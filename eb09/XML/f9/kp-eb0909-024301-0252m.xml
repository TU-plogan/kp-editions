                <p>UNDER the heading Sea Fisheries, which form the particular subject of the present
                    article, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> may be included the various operations
                    engaged in for the capture of the different forms of marine life which, in some
                    manner or other, minister to the wants or convenience of man. The most important
                    of these fisheries—those only, in fact, to which the title strictly belongs, and
                    which have more or less widely occupied attention from probably the earliest
                    times—are carried on chiefly by hook and line or net, with the object of
                    obtaining fish for the purposes of food; and this main division of the general
                    subject will be here considered.</p>
                <p>Although little or nothing is known of the methods of fishing on our coasts in
                    very early times, there can be no doubt that in England, as in all maritime
                    countries, fish has always been eagerly sought after as an easily procurable
                    article of food. The abundance of herrings and mackerel, for instance, on the
                    coasts at regular seasons of the year, could not have failed to attract
                    attention; and Swinden, in his <hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities of
                    Great Yarmouth,</hi> expresses his belief that the herring fishery began there
                    soon after the year 495. In Scotland also there is evidence that the herring
                    fishery was systematically carried on from a very early date. Precise records of
                    other fisheries do not go back so far as that of the herring; but there is no
                    reason for believing that cod and kindred fishes were not taken by the hook and
                    line very many centuries ago, and, like the herring, were subjected to some
                    ready mode of curing either with salt or by drying in the open air. In
                    comparatively recent times all the fisheries have been largely developed, and
                    none more so than that known as beamtrawling, a method of fishing which had
                    probably attracted little notice a hundred years ago, but is now the most
                    regularly productive and important on the English coast. Many circumstances have
                    combined to encourage the working of sea fisheries as a national industry. The
                    great extent of coast-line surrounding the British Islands provides ready access
                    to the sea to a numerous population who become familiar from their youth with
                    seafaring pursuits; and to such occupations large numbers betake themselves with
                    instinctive aptitude, either as fishermen or sailors. In many cases early
                    associations lead them to devote themselves to such fisheries as are within
                    reach of their native villages; in others, they may become alternately sailors
                    and fishermen, shipping for a few months every year on a trading voyage, and
                    returning home in time to take part in the herring or some other temporary but
                    profitable fishery; whilst in the case of the deep-sea trawling or cod fishery,
                    they learn to become as good sailors as they are fishermen, for they have often
                    to remain at sea in decked vessels for weeks at a time in all kinds of
                    weather,—they must keep on their fishing ground, and must trust to their
                    knowledge of seamanship to battle with the furious gales to which they may be at
                    any time exposed when thus far away from shelter. Inducements to become
                    fishermen are not wanting to this coast population. Nowhere are the best kinds
                    of sea fish more abundant than in temperate and moderately high latitudes; and
                    in this respect the British Islands are most advantageously situated, the seas
                    surrounding them being frequented throughout the year by a variety of fishes
                    always in request for the market, besides producing countless shoals of other
                    kinds which only come within reach of the fishermen at particular seasons of the
                    year. And great as may sometimes be the supply offish during the continuance of
                    favourable weather, it is rarely that the demand for it is exceeded at the
                    present day; for all the markets of the country are brought within reach by the
                    facilities provided for rapid transport from the fishing ports by the extensive
                    system of coast and inland railways now in operation. Fishermen, therefore,
                    always find a market for their produce; and although it is to be feared that
                    many of them obtain but a small proportion of the price for which their fish is
                    ultimately sold to the consumer, the majority of them are enabled to live more
                    comfortably than formerly, and to save enough to keep their fishing gear in good
                    working order, and in many cases to pay for improved and larger boats.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that the fisheries fluctuate a good deal from year to year; and
                    it is often the case that they may be good on one part of a coast when they are
                    bad on another. The important herring fishery on the coasts of Scotland is a
                    marked example of this, as must be familiar to all persons who have given any
                    attention to the subject. Thus it not unfrequently happens that when the fishery
                    on the east side is particularly successful, a scarcity occurs on the west
                    coast, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Again, in some years the fish are
                    equally abundant or scarce on both coasts. These fluctuations are observed in
                    even small districts of a line ofcoast, and one part of a season may be good and
                    another bad in the same locality. Precisely the same variations occur on all the
                    coasts of the British Islands, and with all kinds of fishes. Undoubtedly,
                    weather is one of the most important elements in the question of success; and a
                    generally stormy season has a marked effect in the diminished quantity of fish
                    landed. It tells both in reducing the number of fishermen at work, and in
                    driving the fish from their usual haunts. It is only quite recently that
                    attention has been directed to the subject of temperature as affecting the
                    movements of certain fishes towards or from the surface of the sea, and this
                    will be further noticed when we speak of the herring fisheries. Apparently
                    trifling circumstances may in some cases materially affect the catch of fish.
                    Thus the sean fishery for pilchards on the coast of Cornwall has fluctuated
                    exceedingly during the last 50 or 60 years for which returns are in existence;
                    but however abundant these fish may be on the coast, the seans cannot catch them
                    unless the shoals come quite close to the land in localities where these nets
                    can be worked. Enormous hauls of pilchards have been made in particular years,
                    whilst in others the fishermen have waited week after week without a chance of
                    wetting their nets, although the drift-net fishermen at some little distance
                    from the land have been meeting with fair success. The large apparent element of
                    chance in the success of our fisheries cannot be better expressed than by the
                    general hope of the fishermen for “good luck.”</p>
                <p>Great changes have taken place in the fishing trade within the last 20 or 30
                    years, more especially in that for fish sent fresh to the market. Excluding
                    herrings and cod, which to a great extent were consigned to the curer as soon as
                    possible after they were caught, a large proportion of the fish formerly taken
                    on our coasts was disposed of within a short distance of the place where it was
                    landed. A good many turbot and soles were forwarded by light carts or coaches to
                    the nearest railways as these gradually extended in different directions from
                    London; but the people near the coast were, a generation or two ago, the
                    principal consumers of fish, and the supply was compara tively scanty, for the
                    fishing boats were small, and there was little inducement to fish on a large
                    scale when the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> For <hi rend="smallcaps">Coral,
                    Pearl, Salmon, Sponge,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Whale Fisheries</hi> the
                    reader is referred to those headings.</p>

                <p>markets within reach were so few. All this has been completely changed, and the
                    main agent in the work has been the great extension of railways throughout the
                    length and breath of the land. Next to railways as a means of facilitating the
                    transit of fish to all the markets, the use of ice for packing the fish has
                    become of great importance, so much so in fact that without its employment it
                    would be impossible to carry on the North Sea trawl fishery during summer at the
                    distance from land at which it is generally worked, and where some of the most
                    productive grounds are situated. Its special importance in this fishery will be
                    further noticed when we speak of the general system of beam-trawling; but we may
                    here mention that without the use of ice a large proportion of the fish now sent
                    long distances by railway would never reach their destination in a condition fit
                    for the table. The idea of using ice in connexion with the fish trade was first
                    put into a practicable shape by Mr Samuel Hewett. At the present time about
                    30,000 tons of ice are imported annually from Norway into Hull, which is only
                    one of the large North Sea trawling stations, for the sole purpose of preserving
                    fish, either on board the fishing smacks or during its transit to market. With
                    the exception of herrings, pilchards, and sprats, a large proportion of the fish
                    now caught on the English coast is put into ice almost as soon as taken out of
                    the water. Much of it is at once so packed on board the trawlers; it is brought
                    on shore sometimes after several days, and sold in the wholesale markets; it is
                    then repacked in ice and forwarded to other markets, where it is purchased by
                    the fishmongers, who have a stock of ice at home ready to receive it; and there
                    it remains, if properly taken care of, till wanted, sufficient only to make an
                    attractive display being laid out at one time for sale.</p>
                <p>The question of how long our present large supply of sea fish is likely to
                    continue is one of much interest, and the answer to it depends on whether or not
                    our fisheries are carried on in such a manner as to cause more destruction of
                    fish life than can be compensated for by the vast reproductive powers of those
                    fishes which escape the nets and hooks of the fishermen. For more than fifty
                    years past the cry has been periodically raised that our fisheries are being
                    ruined. The general complaint has been of the wasteful destruction of spawn and
                    very young fish by beam-trawling and sean nets; and in 1863 the outcry was so
                    loud that a Royal Commission was appointed, not only to examine this question,
                    but also to inquire into the general condition of all our sea fisheries,—the
                    special objects of inquiry being the state of the supply of fish, and the
                    questions whether the methods of fishing in use involved a wasteful destruction
                    of fish or spawn, and whether existing fishery restrictions operated injuriously
                    on the fisheries. Ou these points the commissioners, after taking evidence all
                    round the British Islands, were enabled to give a very decided opinion. They
                    reported that the supply of fish generally had largely increased, that the
                    methods of fishing involved no waste of young fish that could be prevented
                    without interfering with the general fisheries, that spawn was not destroyed by
                    the nets, and that all fishery restrictions should be removed except such as
                    were desirable for protecting and keeping order among the fishermen. The
                    recommendations of the commissioners were embodied in an Act of Parliament known
                    as The Sea Fisheries Act 1868, by which, with one or two small exceptions
                    relating to herring fishing on the west coast of Scotland, previous Fishery Acts
                    were repealed, and fresh regulations made having reference to the registration
                    of fishing boats, keeping order among driftfishermen and beam-trawlers, and
                    providing a close time for oysters in the English Channel. The main object of
                    the Act was to carry out a convention between the British Islands and France,
                    for the better ordering of the fisheries in the seas adjoining the two
                    countries. The Act came into force in England on the 1st of February 1869, but
                    circumstances have hitherto prevented any date being fixed for carrying out the
                    convention on the part of the French. Great advantage has undoubtedly been
                    gained by British fishermen from the substitution of the present simple fishery
                    regulations for the numerous Acts previously existing, many of which had long
                    been obsolete; but the Royal Commission, which was issued virtually to inquire
                    into the alleged destruction of fish spawn on the ground by beamtrawlers, would
                    probably have never come into existence had the facts then been known which have
                    since come to light about the spawning habits of most of our edible fishes.
                    These facts are so important that a short notice of them may be given here.</p>
                <p>Fishermen are in the habit of asserting with perfect confidence that fishes of
                    almost every kind they arc accustomed to catch have certain grounds which they
                    frequent at particular seasons for the purpose of depositing their ova. The
                    herring is known to spawn on the ground,— at all events the spawn is found there
                    in irregularly shaped lumps adhering to the bottom. It has therefore been
                    concluded that all kinds of fishes have the same habits in this respect. Yet no
                    one has been able to speak positively of having ever seen any fish spawn taken
                    from the ground except that of the herring. Various soft and gelatinous
                    substances are brought on shore by the sean nets, and commonly go by the name of
                    spawn among the inshore fishermen: but that they are not fish spawn is perfectly
                    well known to any one who has given attention to the variety of curious animal
                    organisms inhabiting the sea.</p>
                <p>It was stated by Professors Huxley and Allman in 1867, before the select
                    committee of the House of Commons on the Sea Coast Fisheries (Ireland) Bill, as
                    within their personal knowledge, that fish ova had been found floating at the
                    surface of the sea, and that the ova they had met with were in all cases alive,
                    and some of them in an advanced state of development. Reference was at the same
                    time made to the observations then recently recorded by Norwegian naturalists on
                    the spawning habits of the common cod, leading to the belief that spawning at
                    the surface was by no means uncommon with our sea fishes. These investigations
                    have been systematically carried on during the last ten years, under the
                    direction of the Swedish Government, by Professor G. O. Sars of the university
                    of Christiania, and have resulted in some unexpected discoveries. The seas in
                    the neighbourhood of the Loffodcn Islands on the coast of Norway had long been
                    known to be a great place of resort for cod during the spawning season; and in
                    1864 Professor Sars commenced his work there, and by means of a small surface
                    towing net he obtained plenty of the ova of the common cod <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Gadus</hi><hi rend="italic">morrhua)</hi> floating at the surface; examples in
                    various stages of development were procured, the young fish were successfully
                    hatched out, and the species identified beyond a doubt. Subsequent observations
                    fully confirmed the accuracy of the conclusions previously arrived at that the
                    cod spawn was not deposited on the ground but floated freely at or near the
                    surface. In 1865 the same observations were made on the ova of the haddock <hi
                    rend="italic">(foadus</hi><hi rend="italic">aeglefinus),</hi> and it was
                    satisfactorily proved that they went through all their stages of development
                    while floating at the surface, in precisely the same manner as in the case of
                    the cod. Sars was at first inclined to believe this development of the ova while
                    floating was peculiar to the members of the <hi rend="italic">Gadidae</hi> or
                    cod family, in its restricted sense; but in the summer of 1865 he visited the
                    southern coast of Norway during the season for mackerel, and found abundant
                    evidence of the same rule obtaining in that widely distinct fish. In the case of
                    the mackerel, the spawning actually <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n254/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0254-0245"/> takes place at the surface; but with the cod.
                    family we believe the operation has not been so distinctly observed. The ova,
                    however, are undoubtedly met with at the surface and at a short distance below
                    it. Entirely subversive as these discoveries of Professor Sars are of the
                    popular notions about fish-spawning, it is even more unexpected to find that
                    both he and Μ. A. W. Malm of Gothenburg have independently ascertained that the
                    ova of that essentially ground-fish the plaice <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pleuronectes</hi><hi rend="italic">platessa)</hi> follow the same rule of
                    floating at the surface. Other kinds of floating ova were also obtained by Sars,
                    some of which he succeeded in hatching; and he has completely identified the
                    gurnard <hi rend="italic">(Trigla)</hi> and the garfish <hi rend="italic">(Bel
                    lone),</hi> in addition to those before mentioned. It is evident, then, that the
                    floating of fish ova during the development of the embryo must be taken as the
                    general rule in several large and distinct families of sea fish. Sars has
                    pointed out that the development takes place at the bottom in the case of those
                    fishes especially whose ova are cemented together by a glutinous secretion, or
                    fastened in lumps to foreign bodies, such as Algae, Hydroids, &amp;c. He
                    mentions as examples of this, among others, the herring <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Clupea),</hi> the capelan <hi rend="italic">(Osmerus),</hi> the species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cottus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Liparis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>It is particularly worthy of notice that, according to these observations of the
                    Norwegian naturalists, all the important kinds of fish taken by our line
                    fishermen and beam-trawlers, and the mackerel among such as are caught by the
                    drift-nets, may be reasonably included among the species whose spawn floats at
                    or near the surface of the sea, and their ova cannot therefore be liable to the
                    slightest injury by any method of fishing which is carried on upon or near the
                    ground. For if that be the rule with the spawn of the cod and haddock there can
                    hardly be a doubt about its being so likewise with the ova of ling, coal-fish,
                    whiting, pollack, hake, and that northern species, the tusk, all belonging to
                    the same family. Again, turbot, holibut, brill, soles, plaice, dabs, and
                    flounders are all closely allied, and there can scarcely be a doubt that the
                    same rule applies to all which Sars and Malm have established in the case of the
                    plaice, one of the most typical of this group of fishes. The gurnard family must
                    also be included in this category; the spawn of the red mullet, we believe, has
                    been observed floating in aquariums; and the dory, from its close affinity to
                    the mackerel, may be expected to follow the same rule. On the other hand, we
                    know that the spawn of the herring is commonly found at the bottom, although it
                    by no means follows that the parent fish is there when the ova are excluded; for
                    the full herring is frequently taken in drift nets which are very near the
                    surface, and these nets are often covered with small lumps of spawn. At the same
                    time the specific gravity of herring spawn is greater than water, and it sinks
                    to the bottom sooner or later if nothing intercepts it. There is no evidence of
                    its ever floating at or near the surface as is the case with that of the cod. In
                    fact, the aggregation of the ova into masses of various sizes, and the glutinous
                    substance in which the ova are embedded, by which they are enabled to adhere
                    firmly to anything with which they may come in contact, point to their remaining
                    in a fixed position during the process of development. It might have been
                    anticipated that the other members of the herring family—the pilchard and sprat,
                    for instance—would also have spawned on the ground, but, so far as we are
                    aw*are, their ova have never been found there. Indeed, nothing is known of the
                    spawning habits of the sprat, although this little fish has the roe well
                    developed in December or January, when it is found in the greatest abundance on
                    our coast, and comes nearest to the shore. The spawning of the pilchard is a
                    matter of some little interest. The late Mr Jonathan Couch, who probably devoted
                    more time to the study of the habits of this fish than any other ichthyologist,
                    states<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >History of British Fishes,</hi> vol. iv. ρ. 81 (1865).</p></note> his belief
                    that the pilchard spawned at the surface, and the ova became mixed with a large
                    quantity of tenacious mucus which spread out like a sheet on the water and kept
                    them floating. If this should be confirmed, it will prove that even in the case
                    of agglutinated masses of ova, development may naturally take place in them far
                    away from the bottom. There appears to be little doubt that the pilchard spawns
                    far out at sea, as they are on chance occasions taken in spawning condition in
                    the mackerel drift-nets early in the year; and when, some months later, the
                    shoals of pilchards approach the land the roe shows no signs of development.
                    These circumstances favour the idea that pilchards are surface spawners, as
                    believed by Mr Couch.</p>
                <p>There are several other kinds of edible fish of whose spawning habits we have no
                    definite knowledge, but enough has been discovered of the habits of most of the
                    fish which are valuable for the purposes of food, to show that there need be no
                    anxiety about their spawn being destroyed by any of the methods of fishing in
                    ordinary use. The only apparent exception to this statement is in the case of
                    the herring, whose spawn it has been alleged has been destroyed by the
                    beam-trawlers. But if the beam-trawlers wish to avoid tearing their nets in
                    pieces, they must work where the ground is smooth; and in the few precise
                    localities where it has been positively ascertained that the herring does spawn,
                    the general character of the bottom is rough. That is the ground specially
                    worked over by the line fishermen for haddock, cod, turbot, and other fishes,
                    which come there in numbers for the sake of feeding on the herring spawn. There
                    is a popular idea that all fish spawn is of a most delicate nature, and quickly
                    loses its vitality if taken out of the water for a short time, or at all knocked
                    about. This is probably true in those cases in which the ova are separated from
                    each other after exclusion, and float freely in the water; but it is not so with
                    the spawn of the herring, or probably of other fish whose ova are embedded in a
                    tenacious mucus. The experiments of Professor Allman and of Dr M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Bain have shown that herring spawn does not readily
                    lose its vitality under rough treatment, and may even be hatched out after
                    having been exposed to most unnatural conditions. Professor Allman states in his
                    Report to the Board of Fisheries at Edinburgh that some stones covered with
                    spawn were taken from the sea by divers on the 1st of March 1862, not far from
                    the Island of May. Some of this spawn was forwarded to him and came into his
                    possession after being kept in only a small quantity of water for two entire
                    days. He says :—</p>
                <p>“With the view of determining whether development would proceed in confinement, I
                    placed some of this spawn in a glass jar with sea-water, exposing it in a window
                    looking to the east. The several stages of development were regularly passed
                    through, and on the 15th of March the embryo was fully formed, energetic
                    movements were performed by it in the ovum, and it seemed ready to escape into
                    the surrounding water. On the 16th some of the embryos had actually escaped, and
                    were now about four-tenths of an inch in length. They were of crystalline
                    transparency, and swam about with great activity, and with the remains of the
                    yolk, reduced now to a very small volume, still adhering to them. The specific
                    characters had, of course, not yet become established, and the little fish
                    afforded no further evidence, beyond what we already possessed, to enable us to
                    identify it with the young of the herring."</p>
                <p>The young fish lived nearly a month in confinement, but the specific characters
                    were not even then sufficiently perfected to identify the fish with certainty.
                    There could be no reasonable doubt, however, that the spawn was that of the
                    herring. After some account of other discoveries of spawn, he thus concludes his
                    report :—</p>
                <p>“It was shown by these experiments that the vitality of the spawn was in no way
                    injured by detaching it from the spawning <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n255/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0255-0246"/> bed, so that if it be returned to the sea before
                    it suffers any prolonged exposure to the air, development will proceed
                    apparently unchecked. Those specimens, indeed, which underwent development in my
                    possession, had not only been removed from the ground, but had been kept for
                    many hours in a scanty supply of water before I received them; and even after
                    they came under my care, they were necessarily placed in conditions very
                    different from those to which they would, have been exposed if they had been
                    allowed to remain in their natural habitat,—and yet, with all these
                    disadvantages, development proceeded uninterruptedly.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Registration of Fishing Vessels.—</hi> Under the Sea Fisheries
                    Act 1868, all vessels and boats engaged in fishing for the purpose of sale must
                    be registered at the custom-house, and must be marked on the bow with letters
                    denoting the port to which they belong, and their registered number. Thus,
                    Grimsby is represented by the letters G Y, Peterhead by P D, and Galway by G.
                    The fishing boats are divided into three classes,—the first class including
                    everything of 15 tons and upwards, the second class all boats under 15 tons
                    navigated otherwise than by oars only, that is, sometimes by sails and sometimes
                    by oars, ana the third class those with which oars only are used. The last class
                    is supposed to include only small boats used for harbour fishing;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By a recent order in council
                    all open fishing boats which do not fish beyond three miles from land are
                    exempted from registration. This practically abolishes the third class which has
                    hitherto appeared in the returns.</p></note> but as there are very few boats in
                    which a sail of some kind is not sometimes hoisted, the customs have a
                    discretionary power to put very small boats into the third class,
                    notwithstanding their occasional use of a sail. The registers for each port are
                    sent to the registrar-general of shipping, and appear in the annual returns
                    published by the Board of Trade. There is great difficulty, however, in
                    obtaining precise accuracy in the returns for many parts of the coast; new boats
                    sometimes escape registration, and boats which have been lost or broken up
                    sometimes remain for a year or so on the list. But, imperfect as these returns
                    undoubtedly are, they are of some value in giving an approximate idea of the
                    number of the fishing craft, and of the average size of those in the first
                    class. It must be remembered, however, that this class includes boats ranging
                    from 15 tons to 70 or 80 tons. The tendency now is to fish farther from the land
                    than formerly, and to use decked instead of open boats; the result is that there
                    is a steady increase in the first class boats, and a diminution in the number of
                    the smaller ones. The following table gives the total number of fishing boats in
                    England, Scotland, Ireland, and the Isle of Man on the register for 1876 and
                    1877, arranged according to their classes :—</p>

                <p>We will now proceed to give an account of the several valuable fisheries carried
                    on around the coasts of the British Islands, with some details of the appliances
                    in use, and the manner in which they are worked.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">English Fisheries.</hi> —On the coast of England the methods
                    of fishing in general use are more numerous than in the case of either Scotland
                    or Ireland, the fishing grounds are more extensive, and the total supply of fish
                    obtained is larger and more varied in kind. The principal modes of fishing are
                    by the beam-trawl, the drift-net, the sean, the stow-net, and lines. Their
                    relative importance varies to some extent, but trawling and drift-net fishing
                    occupy by far the most conspicuous positions, and lines come next in order.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trawling.—</hi> The most characteristic mode of fishing is that
                    known in England as “trawling,” or in Scotland as “beam-trawling,” and consists
                    in towing, trailing, or trawling a flattened bag-net, often 100 feet long, over
                    the bottom in such a manner as to catch those fish especially which naturally
                    keep close to or upon the ground. It is very desirable that the name “trawl”
                    should be restricted to this net, presently to be described, as much confusion
                    has been caused by the practice, general in Scotland (which has misled even such
                    writers as Mr Couch, see <hi rend="italic">Fishes of the British Islands,</hi>
                    iv. 105), of applying the name to that very different kind of net which has for
                    centuries past been almost universally known as the “sean,” “seine,” or “seyne,”
                    and may be traced back through the Saxon <hi rend="italic">segne</hi> to the
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">sagena,</hi> a sweep-net. In the United States and
                    Canada, the word “trawl” is still more misapplied, being given to what is in
                    England commonly called the long line or bulter.</p>
                <p>The beam-trawl may be simply described as a triangular, flat, purse-shaped net
                    with the mouth extended by a horizontal wooden beam, which is raised a short
                    distance from the ground by means of two iron frames or heads, one at each end,
                    the upper part of the mouth being fastened to the beam, and the under portion
                    dragging on the ground as the net is towed over the bottom. The beam of course
                    varies in length according to the size of the net, and depends to some extent
                    also on the length and power of the vessel which has to work it. In the large
                    “smacks,” as the trawl-boats have long been called, the beam ranges from 36 to
                    50 feet in length; and there is rarely anything less than this now used by the
                    deep-sea trawlers. Elm is generally preferred for it, selected if possible from
                    timber grown just of the proper thickness, that the natural strength of the wood
                    may not be lessened by more trimming or chipping than is absolutely necessary.
                    If the required length and thickness cannot be obtained in one piece, two or
                    even three pieces are scarfed together, and the joints secured by iron bands.
                    When the trawl is being hoisted in, the first part of the apparatus taken on
                    board is the large heavy beam, and this is very commonly done when the vessel is
                    rolling and pitching about in a seaway. It is therefore necessary for the sake
                    of safety that the beam should be secured as soon as possible, and in such a
                    position as to be out of the way and at the same time conveniently placed for
                    lowering again when required. All this may be easily effected by having the beam
                    of such a length in proportion to the size of the vessel that when hoisted up,
                    one end of it may come over the taffrail, with the iron head just clear outside,
                    and the fore end in front of one of the shrouds. It then lies on the gunwale of
                    the vessel, and the ends are secured by ropes, the forerigging preventing that
                    end of the beam coming on board, but the iron head passing in between the
                    shrouds. The object or use of the beam is to extend the mouth of the net; but,
                    in order to allow room for the fish to enter, the beam, and with it the back of
                    the net which is laced to it, must be raised a certain distance from the ground.
                    For this purpose the beam is fastened at each end to the top of an iron frame,
                    shaped somewhat like an irregularly formed stirrup, which is fitted to it at
                    right angles by a square socket at the top. By these “heads or irons” the beam
                    is supported at a height of nearly 3 feet from the ground, and, contrary to the
                    popular idea on the subject, never touches the bottom. It could only do so if
                    the trawl were to reach the ground with its back undermost, and then the mouth
                    of the net would close and no fish could enter. The lower part of the trawl-head
                    or iron is straight and flat, just like the corresponding part of a stirrup. It
                    is called the “shoe,” and is the part which slides over the ground as the
                    trawl-beam and following net are towed along. There is a slight variation in the
                    form of the trawl-irons, and one, known as the Barking pattern, from having been
                    adopted at that old trawling station on the Thames, is shaped exactly like a
                    stirrup; but generally the irons are preferred with the aft side straight. We
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n256/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0256-0247"/> now have the long beam supported at each end by a
                    more or less stirrup-shaped iron fitted at right angles. The next thing to be
                    considered is the net. This was previously spoken of as flattened and
                    purse-shaped. When the net is spread out in the manner it would be when working,
                    the upper part or back has its straight front edge fastened to the beam, but the
                    corresponding lower part or belly is cut away in such a manner that the front
                    margin forms a deep curve extending from the shoe of one trawl-head to the
                    other, the centre of the curve or “bosom,” as it is called, being at a
                    considerable distance behind the beam. The usual rule in English trawls is for
                    the distance between the beam and the bosom to be about the same as the length
                    of the beam. In French trawls this distance is generally much less; but in all
                    cases the beam and back of the net must pass over a considerable space of ground
                    when the trawl is at work before the fish are disturbed by much of the lower
                    margin of the net. This lower edge of the mouth of the trawl is fastened to and
                    protected by the “groundrope,” which is made of an old hawser “rounded” or
                    covered with small rope to keep it from chafing, and to make it heavier. The
                    ends of the ground-rope are fastened at each side by a few turns round the back
                    of tho trawlheads, just above the shoe, and the rope itself rests on the ground
                    throughout its entire curve. The fish which may be disturbed by it have
                    therefore no chance of escape at either the sides or back of the net, and as the
                    outlet under the beam is a long way past them, and is steadily moving on, their
                    fate is sooner or later decided by their passing over the ground-rope and
                    finding their way into the funnel-shaped end of the nef, from which a small
                    valve of netting prevents their return. The ground-rope is the part which
                    directly bears on the ground, and to prevent the possibility of the fish passing
                    under it, the rope should have some weight in it so as to “bite” well, or press
                    the ground closely. It is, however, always made of old material, so that it may
                    break in case of getting foul of rocks or such other chance obstruction as may
                    be met with on the generally smooth ground where the trawl can only be worked
                    with advantage. If in such a contingency the rope were so strong and good as not
                    to break, there would be serious danger of the tow-rope snapping, and then the
                    whole apparatus might be lost; but the ground-rope giving way enables the net to
                    be cleared and hauled up with probably no more damage to it than the broken rope
                    and perhaps some torn netting. The remaining part of the trawl, extending from
                    the bosom to the extreme end, forms a complete bag gradually diminishing in
                    breadth to within about the last 10 feet, which part is called the “cod or
                    purse,” and is closed by a draw-rope or “cod-line” at the extremity when the net
                    is being used. This is the general receptacle for the various fishes which enter
                    the net; and when the trawl is hauled up and got on board the vessel, the
                    draw-rope is cast off and the fish all fall out on the deck.</p>
                <p>We must now say a few words about the ingenious contrivances for preventing the
                    escape of the fish which have entered the purse and reached the farthest
                    extremity of the net. It has been mentioned that the body of the net tapers away
                    to the entrance to the purse. It is at this point the opening of the pockets are
                    placed; and they are so arranged that the fish having passed into the purse, and
                    then seeking to escape by returning along its sides, are pretty sure to go into
                    the pockets, which extend for a length of about 15 or 16 feet along the inner
                    side of the body of the net, and there, the more they try to press forward, the
                    more tightly they become packed, as the pockets gradually narrow away to nothing
                    at their upper extremity. These pockets are not separate parts of the trawl, but
                    are made by merely lacing together the back and belly of the net, beginning
                    close to the margin or side nearly on a level with the bosom, and then carried
                    on with slowly increasing breadth downwards as far as the entrance to the purse.
                    At this point the breadth of the net is divided into three nearly equal spaces,
                    the central one being the opening from the main body of the net into the purse,
                    or general receptacle for the fish, which must all pass through it, and those on
                    each side being the mouths of the pockets facing the opposite direction. The
                    central passage has a valve or veil of netting called the “flapper,” which only
                    opens when the fish press against it on their way into the purse. To understand
                    clearly the facilities offered to the fish to enter the pockets, it is necessary
                    to remember that the trawl, when at work, is towed along, with just sufficient
                    force to expand the net by the resistance of the water. But this resistance
                    directly acts only on the interior of the body of the net between the pockets
                    and then on the purse; it does not at first expand the pockets, but tends rather
                    to flatten them, because they are virtually outside the general cavity of the
                    trawl, and their openings face the further end of it. The water, however, which
                    has expanded the body of the net, then passes through the flapper or valve, and
                    enters the purse, which, being made with a much smaller mesh than the rest of
                    the net, offers so much resistance that it cannot readily escape in that
                    direction; return currents are consequently formed along the sides, and those
                    currents open the mouths of the pockets, which, as before mentioned, are facing
                    them; and the fish, in their endeavours to escape, and finding these openings,
                    follow the course of the pockets until they can go no farther. The whole of the
                    net is therefore well expanded, but it is so by the pressure of the water in one
                    direction through the middle, and in the opposite direction at the sides or
                    pockets.</p>
                <p>The meshes of an ordinary deep-sea trawl vary in size in different parts of the
                    net, diminishing from 4 inches square near the mouth to 1∣ inches in the cod or
                    purse. The under part of the net, being exposed to more wear and chafing than
                    the upper, is usually made with rather stouter twine; and the purse, being
                    especially liable to injury from being dragged over the ground with a weight of
                    fish and perhaps stones in it, has some protection provided by layers of old
                    netting called “rubbing pieces” laced to its under surface. The French fishermen
                    frequently fasten a stout hide to this part of their trawls with the same
                    object.</p>
                <p>A deep-sea trawl, such as has now been described, is therefore an immense
                    bag-net, the largest size being about 50 feet wide at the mouth and about 100
                    feet long. Many of these nets are much smaller, some of them not having the beam
                    more than 36 feet or even less, and the net reduced in proportion; but there has
                    been a great increase in the size of the trawl-vessels in recent years, and at
                    the same time there has been an enlargement of the nets, although not quite in
                    the same ratio. The trawl is towed over the ground by the trawl-warp, generally
                    a 6-inch rope 150 fathoms long, and made up of two lengths of 75 fathoms each
                    spliced together; one end of this warp is shackled to two other pieces each 15
                    fathoms long, and called the “spans or bridles,” which lead one to each end of
                    the beam, and are shackled to swivel-bolts in front of the iron heads so as to
                    give a fair pull on the whole apparatus.</p>
                <p>The great development of the trawl fishery in recent years has led to a vast
                    improvement in the kind of fishing vessels employed in it. Fifty years ago the
                    only deep-sea trawlers were in the west of England, and from Barking on the
                    Thames. They were not nearly the tonnage of many of the vessels now used in the
                    North Sea, but were stout, heavy, seagoing craft of their size, and capable of
                    standing almost any description of weather; and, although comfortable, they were
                    certainly not very fast. At that <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0257-0248"/> date, however, the fish went into consumption at
                    once, instead of being sent one or two hundred miles before it reached the
                    consumer. The increased demand for fish of late years has led to the building of
                    trawlers of the best description, as remarkable for their fast sailing as for
                    other improved qualities. There is racing home now from the fishing grounds to
                    catch the first of the market, and everything is done as quickly as possible to
                    ensure quick distribution and delivery all over the country. The cost of the
                    vessels has of course largely increased, not only from their greater size, but
                    also because of the much higher price now paid for everything used in their
                    construction. In 1862 a new trawl vessel, and what was at that time considered
                    one of the larger class, could be built and fitted out ready for sea for £700 or
                    £800; but it costs from £1200 to £1300 to turn out one of the vessels now
                    commonly used in the North Sea fishery. This includes a supply of everything
                    necessary for fishing, costing about £70 or £80. A proper fit-out consists of a
                    double set of almost every part of the gear, so as to provide against accidents,
                    and generally to save the time which would be lost if the trawler were obliged
                    to return to port before he had done a fair quantity of work. A trawl-net will
                    perhaps last from two to four months, according to the nature of the ground
                    worked upon; but during that time parts of it will have to be renewed. The back
                    of the net, being exposed to the least wear, lasts the longest; the under part
                    will generally require renewing twice, and the cod or purse five or six times,
                    before the net is finally condemned. The additional size now given to the
                    trawlvessels has led to an alteration in the manner in which they are rigged.
                    The term “smack” has been for a long time applied to those trading and fishing
                    craft which were cutter rigged, and until quite recent years all the trawlers
                    were known as trawl-smacks. It was a convenient rig; the single mast was stepped
                    well forward so as to allow of a large and powerful mainsail, at the same time
                    giving plenty of free space on deck for getting in the net, and stowing it and
                    the long trawl-beam on the top of the bulwark when not at work. But when the
                    size of the vessels was increased to 70 or 80 tons, it was found that the
                    mainsail, enlarged in proportion, wanted a good deal more looking after in bad
                    weather than was convenient, and the heavier main-boom caused a great deal of
                    straining. More hands became necessary on this account than were required for
                    ordinary fishing purposes, and the increased expenses interfered with profitable
                    working. The new trawl-boats were therefore built of greater length, so as to
                    provide room for a small second mast or mizen on which a gaff-sail could be
                    carried, and thus something could be taken off the large mainsail. The result
                    has been very satisfactory; just as much sail is carried as before, but it is
                    not so lofty, and being divided into smaller pieces, it can be handled with
                    greater ease and safety. As a gaff-sail is carried on the mizen, the rig is that
                    of a ketch; had a lug-sail been used instead of a gaff-sail, the vessel would
                    have been what is called “dandy-rigged.” The increased length of the vessel in
                    proportion to her size gives many advantages. Space is provided for packing away
                    a considerable quantity of ice, which is a very necessary article in the present
                    mode of working the North Sea trawl fishery; the produce of many fishing days
                    can be properly stowed away and preserved in good condition, and the crew have
                    more roomy and comfortable accommodation,—a point of importance, since at
                    certain seasons they remain at sea for several weeks at a time.</p>
                <p>“Barking” the sails is a regular practice with the trawlers, as it is with most
                    other fishermen in England and Scotland. The process consists in mopping them
                    over with a composition of a solution of oak-bark, tar, grease, and ochre, which
                    acts as a good preservative of the canvas. This is done once in six or eight
                    weeks, and a suitable place is kept for the purpose at all the important fishing
                    stations.</p>
                <p>Working the beam-trawl requires some little skill which can only be acquired by
                    experience at sea. A knowledge of the ground and of the direction and times of
                    the tide is essential; for the trawl is towed with the stream, a little faster
                    than it is running, so that there may be just sufficient resistance from the
                    water to expand the net. If it were towed too fast, the pressure of the water
                    against the long transverse beam would tend to lift it from the ground, and then
                    the fish would not enter the net. This important point is regulated by a nice
                    adjustment of the length of tow-rope to the force of the wind and state of the
                    sea; and experience enables the fisherman to tell, by pressing the hand firmly
                    on the warp between the vessel and the water, whether or not the trawl is
                    working steadily over the ground. Lowering the trawl to the bottom is also a
                    matter requiring great care, so that it may reach the ground with the beam above
                    the iron heads and the ground-rope in its proper position below. This can only
                    be managed by first getting the whole apparatus in a proper position at the
                    surface, and then keeping the vessel slowly moving through the water whilst the
                    lowering takes place. If, as sometimes happens in spite of all precautions, the
                    net and beam should twist round while being lowered, and the apparatus should
                    reach the bottom with its back downwards, then the beam would be on the ground
                    and the iron supports above, the mouth of the net would close, and no good could
                    be done with it. The only thing for the fishermen to do under such circumstances
                    is to haul up the trawl and shoot it again. The popular idea that the beam is
                    always dragging on the ground is therefore a mistaken one. The trawl is shot at
                    the beginning of the tide, so that it may be towed for five or six hours, and
                    during that time it will probably pass over from fifteen to twenty miles of
                    ground. As trawlers when engaged in fishing are practically anchored by their
                    trawls, they cannot readily get out of the way of vessels meeting them, and the
                    law admits this view of the case by obliging them at night to carry a single
                    mast-head light as an anchor light, instead of <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> the
                    regulation red and green side-lights for vessels under sail.</p>
                <p>When the tide has finished, or the smack has reached the end of its fishing
                    ground, the trawl is hauled up by a winclι or capstan. This seldom takes less
                    than three-quarters of an hour in fine weather, and two or three hours if it be
                    rough. The beam is got alongside, and hoisted up and secured; then the net is
                    gathered in, the cod or end of the bag being hoisted in by a tackle, and the
                    cod-rope closing the end being cast off. the whole catch of fish falls out on
                    deck. The fish are immediately sorted and packed away, and the fishermen prepare
                    for another haul, according to the state of the wind and tide.<note

                <p>Trawl-fish are separated for market purposes into two great classes, known
                    respectively as “prime” and “offal.” Prime includes turbot, brill, soles,
                    dories, and red mullet, the last being caught in large numbers in summer,
                    especially by the Brixham trawlers. Offal is the name given to plaice, haddocks,
                    whiting, and other kinds of inferior fishes which are caught in great abundance,
                    and usually sell at a low price. The term “offal” was applied to these fish at a
                    time when railways had not come into existence, and purchasers frequently could
                    not be found for the quantity of fish the trawlers would bring to market in one
                    day. This was especially the case with plaice and haddocks when the newly
                    discovered fishing grounds in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n258/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0258-0249"/> the North Sea were first worked. Λ good deal of
                    fish was then wasted, and thousands of haddocks were thrown overboard again as
                    soon as caught, for the fishermen were under orders not to bring ashore more
                    than were likely to be sold whilst fresh. Even in comparatively recent years
                    trawled haddocks were of little value, until the practice of smoking them, as
                    had long been done in Scotland, was adopted at Hull, Grimsby, and other places;
                    and now not a haddock is thrown away if it is in good condition when landed. It
                    may be mentioned that round-fish, such as haddock and whiting, always suffer
                    more or less in appearance when caught by the trawl, as they are liable to be
                    knocked about by the crowd of fish in the small end of the net, especially when
                    the trawl is being hauled up. They do not therefore fetch a good price in the
                    wholesale market, whilst haddock and whiting caught by the hook are always in
                    demand, and it need hardly be mentioned that the Scotch haddock, so long famous
                    for their excellence, both fresh and cured, are all caught with hook and
                    line.</p>
                <p>The trawling stations in the west of England are Plymouth, and Brixham in Torbay,
                    and this method of fishing has been carried on from botlι places for probably
                    upwards of 100 years, although the date of its commencement has been by no means
                    accurately ascertained.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Fronde, i ’ ι his <hi rend="italic">History of England,</hi> vol. xii. p.
                    397 (cabinet edition, 1870), speaks incidentally of trawlers at Brixham so long
                    ago as the time of the Spanish Armada. In his description of the English attack
                    on the Spanish fleet, he says :—“Drake, returning from the chase, came up with
                    her [the ‘ Capitana, ’ the admiral’s disabled ship] in the morning. She struck
                    her flag, and he took her with him to Torbay, where he left her to the care of
                    the Brixham fishermen. . . . The prize proved of unexpected value. Many casks of
                    reals were found in her, and, infinitely more important, some tons of gunpowder,
                    with which the ‘ Roebuck,’ the swiftest trawler in the harbour, flew in pursuit
                    of the fleet.” The “Roebuck” is spoken of, in another account of the attack, as
                    Sir Walter Raleigh’s ship, and therefore, no doubt, an armed vessel; and we have
                    been unable to find any evidence of there having been trawlers at Brixham at
                    that date (1588).</p></note> It is certain, however, that at the beginning of
                    the present century the trawlers were comparatively few, and not half the size
                    of those now at work. Plymouth does not appear to have progressed so steadily in
                    later years as Brixham, and this may be partly caused by the more frequent
                    interruptions from bad weather at the western port. The south-westerly gales so
                    common in winter are felt in all their violence on the fishing ground of
                    Plymouth, and the heavy sea accompanying them sometimes puts a stop to fishing
                    for two or three days at a time. The custom also at Plymouth of only fishing
                    during the day and returning to harbour every evening must materially diminish
                    the chances of the fishing being very profitable, ìnd for some few years past
                    the number of trawl vessels has not averaged more than about 60. At Brixham,
                    where trawling is believed to have originated, and fishing has always been the
                    chief industry, much more enterprise is shown. The trawlers there go to sea on
                    Monday morning and remain at work till the next morning, when they return
                    an&lt;l land their fish. After an hour or so they again go off, and fish day and
                    night till the next morning, and so on every day till Saturday conies, when,
                    having landed their fish, they come to anchor, get their sails down, and spend
                    the rest of the day in mending their nets and putting everything in order for
                    the next week’s work. Sunday is a day of rest for all hands.</p>
                <p>The history of the Brixham fishery has a very important bearing on the charges
                    that have been brought against the trawlers of destroying spawn and very young
                    fish, and of gradually exhausting the fishing grounds on which they worked. The
                    Brixham men, as a rule, keep to a particular stretch of fishing ground,
                    extending from the Start Point, past Torbay, towards the neighbourhood of
                    Portland,—practically about twenty miles long and of variable breadth, but
                    mostly from three to eight miles off the land. There is no record of how many
                    trawlers there were at Brixham at the beginning of this century, but it is known
                    that they were few and less than half their present size. In 1852, however,
                    there were 70 of them, 85 in 1863, and in 1872 their number was about 100,
                    besides 20 others which worked on this home ground during the winter; and new
                    vessels are being built every year, not only to make up for losses, but to add
                    to the fleet. This small strip of fishing ground has certainly been worked for
                    more than a hundred years, the fishing smacks have been steadily increasing in
                    number and have more than doubled in size, and yet there is no sign of the
                    ground becoming exhausted. The greater demand for fish has no doubt encouraged
                    the fishermen in their work, for they have obtained better prices for their
                    fish; but if the effects of trawling were the exhaustion of the fishing ground,
                    the Brixham fishery should have come to an end many years ago. It has, however,
                    never been so prosperous as during the last few years. Every one at Brixham is
                    more or less interested in the success of the fishing; the actual condition of
                    the fishery is generally understood, and the savings of the fishermen and many
                    of the trades-people of the place are invested in it year after year. The
                    trawlers do not work for weekly wages, but on the share principle, and the
                    master is generally owner or part-owner of the vessel. It is consequently the
                    interest of every one on board to do his best to make a successful fishing, and
                    the fact of the owner being in command insures due attention to economy in
                    working, so that, whilst no necessary expense is spared in keeping the sails and
                    gear in proper older, everything is made to last as long as possible.</p>
                <p>Brixham has been long considered the “mother-port” of the trawlers, the place
                    where the system of beam-trawling originated; but although Barking, once famous
                    as a fishing station, disputes the honour with her, there is no doubt that
                    Brixham men have led the way in developing this particular method of fishing to
                    its present large proportions. More than forty years ago some of the Brixham
                    vessels went to Ramsgate and fished the grounds at that end of the Channel.
                    Others joined them and permanently settled there, and now there are upwards of
                    160 sea going trawlers belonging to the port. Ten years later Hull was colonized
                    from Brixham and Ramsgate, and Grimsby from Hull at a subsequent period; whilst
                    as early as 1818, Brixham smacks and fishermen passed over to Dublin to commence
                    deep-sea trawling in Irish waters. The important rise of Hull as a trawling
                    station dates from 1845, soon after the discovery of the famous Silver Pit, at
                    the south end of the Dogger Bank. Before that time the number of North Sea
                    trawlers was very small; they were only of about half the size of most of the
                    smacks at present; and not enough was known of the fishing grounds to tempt the
                    fishermen so far from land in vessels of such little power. For a long time,
                    however, the line fishery for cod and haddock had been carried on in the
                    neighbourhood of the Dogger, but in vessels specially constructed for the
                    purpose. The Great Silver Pit, so called to distinguish it from a smaller Silver
                    Pit much nearer the land, was first woiked over during a very severe winter,—we
                    believe, in 1843. Two fishing grounds called the Well Bank and Botany Gut had
                    been explored, and dis covered to be very productive; and between them and the
                    Dogger, and bearing tine east from Flamborough Head, the Admiralty chart showed
                    a bed of deeper soundings, ranging in some parts from 30 to 40 fathoms, and the
                    whole extending for about sixty miles east and west, and from six to ten miles
                    in breadth. The patch was marked “Outer Silver Pit,” and on trying it with the
                    trawl, in the deeper parts at the western end and near the middle, soles were
                    found during that very cold season in almost incredible numbers; the nets were
                    hauled up bristling with fish trying to escape through the meshes, and such
                    enormous catches were made as the most experienced fishermen had never before
                    thought possible. Of course it was not long before this remarkable discovery
                    became known, and a migration of trawlers from Brixham and Ramsgate soon took
                    place to Hull as a convenient station from which to work on this promising
                    ground. With the breaking up of the cold weather, however, this extraordinary
                    congregation of soles became dispersed; but more attention was from that time
                    directed to the North Sea fishing generally, and in after years the Silver Pit
                    has again been found very productive whenever the winter has been very severe,
                    or, as the trawlers call it, in “pit seasons.” The fact of temperature affecting
                    the distribution of many kinds of fish, shown in such a marked manner in this
                    particular case, is now receiving systematic attention from the Meteorological
                    Society of Scotland in connexion with the herring fisheries, and very important
                    results have apparently been obtained from an inquiry into the same subject on
                    the coasts of Nova Scotia.</p>
                <p>The value of the North Sea fishery soon became established, and nothing in the
                    history of our sea fisheries is more remarkable than the rapid but steady
                    development of the system of trawling which has taken place from the Humber
                    ports. The Hull trawlers were 40 in 1845, and most of these were arrivals from
                    the Channel ports, as previously mentioned; but in 1863 they had increased to
                    270, and in 1877 there were 440 first-class fishing craft, with an aggregate of
                    26,310 tons, on the Hull register,—these, excepting a few shrimping boats just
                    over 15 tons each, being all trawl-smacks. Another port on the Humber, Great
                    Grimsby, situated nearer ( the entrance of the river, has made still greater
                    progress. It had for some years been known in connexion with the North Sea cod
                    fishery; and the practice of bringing home the cod alive in welled vessels, and
                    keeping them so till they were wanted for the market, led to the selection of
                    Grimsby, rather than the more important town of Hull, as better suited, on
                    account of the greater purity of the salt water, for preserving the cod in good
                    condition in the floating store chests; and the extension of the Manchester,
                    Sheffield, and Lincolnshire railway to the port provided the facilities for
                    sending away the fish to the various inland markets. In 1858, when the railway
                    was nearly completed, five of the Hull trawlers made Grimsby their headquarters,
                    and in the following year the line was <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0259-0250"/> opened to the town. The advantages of the port at
                    once became evident, and the trawlers rapidly increased from 5 in 1858 to 70 in
                    1863; in 1872, only nine years later, the number was 248, and there were 82 cod
                    smacks besides. In the return by the Board of Trade of the first-class fishing
                    craft registered at Grimsby for 1877, the number of vessels, including trawlers,
                    cod-smacks, and a few smaller craft engaged in procuring whelks for cod-bait, is
                    officially stated as 505, with an aggregate of 29,924 tons, new measurement,
                    which is more than one-third less than that known as builder’s measurement.
                    Tlιis gives an average of over 59 tons; but many of these vessels are 70 tons,
                    and even more.</p>
                <p>By the courtesy of Mr Reed, the dock-master at Grimsby, we are enabled to give
                    the following return of the quantity of fish sent away by rail from that town in
                    each of the years from 1856 to 1877 :—</p>

                <p>The only break in this increasing series is in 1875, and is readily explained by
                    the fact the herring fishery in that year was a very bad one, and that instead
                    of about 4000 tons of herrings being then landed from Lowestoft and other boats
                    at Grimsby as had been the case for some few years previously, the quantity was
                    very much smaller. Great, however, as has been the increase of fish sent away by
                    rail from Grimsby, especially during the last two years, the returns above given
                    do not represent all the fish landed at the fishwharf; for a new trade to the
                    Continent has lately sprung up, and fresh fish is exported direct to the

                <p>It must be remembered that this great increase of the Grimsby trawl fishery has
                    not been at the expense of Hull and other trawling stations, for, except at
                    Plymouth, where, owing to local causes, the number of trawlers has remained
                    about the same for several years, the others have also more or less largely
                    added to their fleets. Grimsby is indeed comparatively new as a fishing station,
                    but it is fast outgrowing in this particular trade the conveniences which, at
                    the time they were provided, were thought ample for anything that would be
                    required. A special dock of 12 acres in extent was constructed for the use of
                    the fishing vessels; another of 11 acres has lately been finished, as well as a
                    graving dock capable of holding ten smacks at a time. The fish are all landed on
                    a covered pontoon 828 feet long and 48 feet wide; but so crowded has this
                    landing wharf become, that an addition to it is likely to be made. Ice companies
                    have also been established, with steamers of their own constantly bringing ice
                    from Norway for the use of the fisheries. This is largely employed in packing
                    the fish for transit by rail inland; but ice now also forms part of the regular
                    fit-out of the trawlers, more particularly from September to May, when, there
                    generally being plenty of wind, each vessel brings back its own catch of fish.
                    An air-tight compartment is fitted, in the hold of the vessel, called the
                    “ice-box,” in which from two to four tons of Norwegian ice are placed when she
                    starts on her trip, or “voyage,” as it is usually called. As the fish are caught
                    they are stowed away below in bulk, with broken ice between the layers, and this
                    is continued till a good quantity of fish has been collected. Then the vessel
                    returns to port, after an absence of perhaps ten or fourteen days. The fish are
                    taken out loose and put up to auction, the buyers finding the packages; in these
                    the fish are packed with a sprinkling of crushed ice again between the layers,
                    and an extra quantity at the top, which is covered with straw and tied down.
                    From May to September, however, when light winds prevail, a different system is
                    adopted, and the vessels fish in fleets of from twenty to fifty together. Their
                    fish are collected every day by carriers, either steamers or fast-sailing
                    cutters, which receive what each vessel has to send in, and with it a
                    consignment note, or “pot-list," to the wholesale dealer who has to sell it as
                    soon as it reaches the market. All the fish are packed in ice as before, and are
                    repacked in ice when sent away to the fishmonger, who keeps them under the same
                    cooling influence till almost the moment of sale to the consumer; so that from
                    first to last the value of ice in the trawl fishery is almost incalculable.
                    Without this material the supply of trawl fish iu a wholesome condition for food
                    would not be a tenth of what it is now, the price would be infinitely greater,
                    and the various trades benefiting by the trawling system would not be in such a
                    thriving condition as is now the case. The public of course do not get their
                    fish so fresh from the sea as formerly, and there is sometimes a want of flavour
                    about it which is undoubtedly due to long icing; but if the fish be cooked as
                    soon as taken from the ice, it is still wholesome and generally palatable
                    food.</p>
                <p>Besides the trawling stations we have more particularly mentioned, Great Yarmouth
                    is of some importance, as, in addition to a considerable fleet of trawlers
                    belonging to the place, many of the Barking smacks also fish from that port; but
                    after what has been already said, there is nothing special to add regarding the
                    trawling from Yarmouth, Lowestoft, Barking, Ramsgate, and some smaller
                    stations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Steam, trawling.—</hi> An endeavour is now being made on a
                    tolerably large scale to utilize steam in deep-sea trawling. The experiment is
                    not altogether new, it having been tried on the Devonshire coast a few years
                    ago, but without success; for, although steam answered perfectly well in towing
                    the trawl, and saved an immense deal of labour in hauling up the net, and time
                    in going to and returning from the fishing ground, it was found that the
                    expenses were too heavy. About five years ago a steam cutter fish-carrying
                    company was started at Yarmouth, with the intention of using the vessels for
                    either trawling or taking the fish to market; but it appears to have been soon
                    found that it did not pay to use the steam for trawling, and that the vessels
                    would be more profitably employed in the carrying trade. The steam-trawling now
                    being worked is from Shields; and the fact is worthy of note, for it was along
                    this particular part of the east coast—from Sunderland northwards—that the
                    complaints against trawling were so loud in 1863, that the royal commission of
                    that year was appointed to inquire into the working of the trawl system, and
                    they commenced their inquiry at Cullercoats, only three miles north of the
                    present headquarters of steam-trawling. In 1877 it appears that trawling was
                    tried with one or two steam-tugs, which, owing to the badness of the shipping
                    trade, had very little to do; and it was found to be so successful that others
                    fitted out for the same work, until about forty were engaged steadily in this
                    fishery whenever there was nothing to keep them at home. The latest information
                    is that other more suitable vesselá are about to begin, and that by way of
                    further experiment fast steamers are to be employed to collect the fish from the
                    trawlers, which will take it to London, it is calculated, in about twenty hours.
                    The best ground fished by these steam-trawlers is said to be north of Newbiggen,
                    and at some little distance from the land. Very fine soles are reported to be
                    taken there, and no doubt the character that part of the coast formerly had for
                    turbot has not been entirely lost. The chief .grievance of the Newbiggen
                    fishermen in connexion with this trawling is that their long lines are
                    interfered with; but as they are in the habit of setting their lines, and then
                    leaving them all night to take care of themselves, they can have no just or
                    legal cause of complaint against fishermen who are working another method of
                    fishing in the same neighbourhood, and who have no means of finding out where
                    the lines are after it has become dark. It is well-established law that no one
                    can be held responsible for the loss of fishing gear in the open sea if the
                    owners leave it unguarded.</p>
                <p>With regard to trawling grounds, those hitherto worked in the North Sea are
                    principally on the Norfolk and Lincolnshire coasts for the home fishing, whilst
                    the off grounds are about the southern part of the Dogger, and towards the Dutch
                    coast. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Some localities are famous for haddocks,
                    others for plaice, while soles are abundant on particular grounds But there are
                    seasons for each locality when the fish frequenting them become more numerous
                    there. There is good trawling also to be had off Hastings, on the Diamond
                    grounds, as well as on the Varne and the Ridge in mid-channel, and from the
                    North Foreland far into the North Sea. On the western side of England, the
                    Liverpool and Fleetwood trawlers work according to the season between the Isle
                    of Man and the English coast, sometimes going into Carnarvon and Cardigan bays;
                    and the Tenby ground is fished by smacks belonging to Tenby, and by several from
                    Brixham during the summer months.</p>
                <p>The number of sea-going trawlers now working on the English coasts cannot be less
                    than between 1700 and 1800, and of these upwards of 1300 regularly fish in the
                    North Sea. Taking a low average of five hands to each vessel, we have nearly
                    9000 men and boys engaged in this fishery, and trained to a regular sailor’s
                    life.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Drift Fisheries.—</hi> The next in importance to trawling among
                    the English fisheries is that carried on with drift-nets for mackerel, herrings,
                    and pilchards. It is undoubtedly the most common method of net-fishing on the
                    coasts of the British Islands, but nowhere is it so general as in Scotland.
                    There are, however, some consider-</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The great increase of large trawlers within the
                    last few years has naturally led to a more extended field of work, and many of
                    them now go much further to sea than formerly.</p>

                <p>able drift fisheries on the eastern and southern coasts of England, and the
                    important mackerel fishery is mainly at the western end of the Channel. The
                    value of that mode of fishing, technically known as “drifting or driving,” will
                    be understood when it is remembered that it is the only method by which such
                    fishes as herrings, mackerel, and pilchards, which generally swim at or near the
                    surface, can be readily caught in the open sea, at any distance from the land,
                    and in any depth of water, so long as there is sufficient for the floating of
                    the nets in the proper position. The term “drift-net” is derived from the manner
                    in which the nets are worked, They are neither fixed nor towed within any
                    precise limits of water, but are cast out or “shot” at any distance from the
                    land where there are signs of fish, and are allowed to drift in whichever
                    direction the tide may happen to take them, until it is thought desirable to
                    haul them in. The essential principle of the working of the drift-net is that it
                    forms a long wall or barrier of netting hanging for a few fathoms
                    perpendicularly in the water, but extending for a great length horizontally, and
                    that the fish, meeting these nets and trying to pass them, become meshed; they
                    force their heads and gill-covers through the meshes, but can go no farther; and
                    as the gill-covers catch in the sides of the mesh, the fish are unable to
                    withdraw and escape. Whether it be mackerel, herring, or pilchard, the manner in
                    which the net works is the same; the variations which exist relate only to the
                    difference in habits and size of the fish sought after.</p>
                <p>We will first speak of the Yarmouth herring fishery, one of the most important
                    English drift fisheries, and the one of which wo have the oldest records. The
                    thriving town of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk is said to have been the resort of
                    fishermen during the herring season as early as the Gth century, and there is no
                    reason for believing that the fishery with which its name has been so long
                    associated was ever carried on by any other method than drift-nets, as at the
                    present day. An immense deal of information about the early records of the
                    herring fishing at Yarmouth and other places has been compiled and published by
                    Mitchell in his book on <hi rend="italic">The Herring</hi>,<note anchored="true"

                    and to him we must refer our readers for numerous historical details on the
                    subject; but we may mention that, according to authorities quoted by him,
                    Yarmouth was erected into a burgh by Henry I. in 1108, the annual payment for
                    this privilege being “ten milliers of herrings.” The fishery was then evidently
                    recognized as being well-established, and herrings as the special trade of the
                    town. A quaintly written account also of the origin of Yarmouth, as given by
                    Manship (who wrote in 1619), is quoted in the following note by Swinden<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">History and
                    Antiquities of Great Yarmouth,</hi> p. 5 (1772).</p></note> in his history of
                    the town :—</p>
                <p>“And now by pregnant probabilities, it is my opinion very clear, that from the
                    landing of Cerdick (one of the Saxon adventurers) in anno 495, now 1124 years
                    past, this sand, by the defluxion of tides, did by little and little lift its
                    head above the waters; and so in short time after, sundry fishermen, as well of
                    this kingdom, viz., of the Five Ports (being then the principal fishermen of
                    England), as also of France, Flanders, and the Low Countries, yearly about the
                    feast of St Michael the Archangel, resorted thither, where they continued in
                    tents, made for the purpose, by the space of forty days, about the killing,
                    trimming, salting, and selling of herrings, to all that thither came for that
                    purpose; whereunto aid resort the merchants of London, Norwich, and other places
                    to buy herrings during the season, and then departed; as those fishermen who
                    kill fish at Wardhouse use to do at this present. So in short time after, as
                    that sand became firm land, and that thereby traffic began more and more to be
                    increased, men finding the same to be a commodious place to dwell and inhabit
                    in, did for that purpose gather themselves together, to have a continual
                    residence therein, and began to build houses, of which came streets, and of
                    those streets this flourishing township.”</p>
                <p>Without placing entire faith in Manship’s conclusions, however, there is
                    sufficient evidence of the antiquity of the Yarmouth herring fishery; and as it
                    keeps up its repute at the present day, and has indeed considerably increased in
                    recent years, some details of its working may be acceptable. The nets used in
                    the drift-fishing were formerly all made of hemp or flax, but for some years
                    past cotton has almost entirely superseded these materials. Cotton nets are
                    manufactured at Bridport, Manchester, Musselburgh, and other places, and are
                    about 30 yards long and 9 or 10 yards deep. One of the long edges of the net,
                    called the “back,” is fastened to a rope corked at regular intervals, whose
                    purpose is to keep that part of the net uppermost. The number of such nets used
                    by each vessel depends chiefly on her size, and ranges from 80 to 130, or even
                    more. They are fastened together end to end, and thus united form what is called
                    a “train, fleet, or drift of nets,” often extending to a length of more than a
                    mile and a quarter. The size of the mesh was at one time regulated by law, and
                    the smallest dimensions allowed in herring nets were one inch “from knot to knot
                    along the line,” or, to speak more concisely, one inch square. Under the present
                    fishery regulations, however, it is wisely left to the fishermen to choose a
                    mesh of such a size as will be most effective in catching the fish, and their
                    practical good sense does not often lead them astray in this matter. With
                    herrings of average size the inch mesh is found to do the most profitable work.
                    An exception to this freedom from restriction to any particular sized mesh
                    exists, however, on one part of the west coast of Scotland, and to that we shall
                    direct attention when we speak of the Scotch fisheries. Twine nets are coarser
                    than those made of cotton, and the material not being so flexible, machinery
                    cannot be satisfactorily used in their manufacture; they are therefore netted by
                    hand, and are made in narrower pieces called “deepings,” which are laced
                    together one below the other to make up the required depth. The labour of
                    hauling in these nets is of course more severe than with cotton, on account of
                    their greater weight and faculty of absorbing the water; and the comparative
                    stiffness of the mesh is not so favourable to the capture of the fish when they
                    strike the net. On the other hand, it was objected to the cotton nets that the
                    thread was so fine as to cut into the fish which were meshed, and to tear off
                    their heads as the nets were hauled in. Whatever force there may be in this
                    objection, the advantages in time and labour saved both in making and working
                    cotton nets have practically decided in their favour, and cotton is now almost
                    universally employed in all our drift-fisheries. The object of the cork-rope is,
                    as we have said, to keep that edge of the net uppermost, but in the ordinary net
                    the corks are only sufficient for that purpose, and will not prevent its
                    sinking. This is provided against by the use of buoys, or “bowls,” as they are
                    called, one being attached by a rope to each net, and by lengthening or
                    shortening this rope the net can be kept at any distance below the surface that
                    may be considered best for catching the fish. It is always a matter of
                    uncertainty at what depth the fish may be found, and a good deal of judgment is
                    needed in sinking the nets, if there are no signs of the fish being near the
                    surface. It is found convenient to colour these bowls so as to mark the
                    divisions of the fleet of nets. The first net, or the one nearest the fishing
                    boat, is marked by a small white bowl, called the “puppy,” and at the end of the
                    next four nets is a “dan,” or buoy with a pole carrying a small flag. The rest
                    of the nets are marked in four divisions; at the first quarter from the pole is
                    a bowl painted one quarter red and three quarters white; the next is half red
                    and half white; and at the beginning of the last division the bowl is three
                    quarters red and one quarter white. All the rest of the bowls from the beginning
                    to the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n261/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0261-0252"/> end of tho train of nets are entirely black. The
                    only part of the gear in connexion with the long string of nets is the warp, a
                    stout rope to which each net is fastened by two smaller ropes called “seizings,”
                    and long enough to allow the warp to hang down near the foot of the nets. This
                    warp has a twofold purpose: it prevents the loss of the nets if by any chance a
                    vessel should pass through and cut them when near the surface, an accident not
                    unlikely to happen, as the nets are only used at night and extend a considerable
                    distance, often in the course of trading vessels going up and down the coast;
                    and it is by means of the warp the nets are hauled in, the strain being thus
                    brought evenly, by means of the seizings, on each separate net. The Yarmouth
                    drift boats are the largest used for this kind of fishing on any part of our
                    coasts. They are fine decked vessels of about 36 tons, the largest being upwards
                    of 52 feet on the keel, with about 17 feet beam and 7 feet depth of bold. The
                    universal rig has long been that of a lugger, with two masts only, and they
                    carry a jib, a large dipping fore-lug, and a mizen with a topsail. The
                    mizen-mast is always kept standing, but the fore-mast is made to lower backwards
                    when fishing is going on, so as to enable the vessel to ride easier, as at that
                    time she is head to wind and without any sail that can steady her. The mast is
                    not lowered on to the deck, however, but, as is the practice with all large
                    drift-boats, the head is supported on a wooden crutch 10 or 12 feet high, in the
                    Yarmouth vessels called a “mitch-board.” In this manner the mast lies very snug,
                    and does not interfere with the room on deck. The interior of the vessel is
                    fitted up with separate spaces for the nets, warp, fish, and salt, of which last
                    a quantity is always taken to sprinkle the fish with before they are stowed
                    away. These boats carry as many as ten or twelve men, as the labour of hauling
                    in the nets is considerable; but more than half the crew are landsmen who are
                    mainly employed at the capstan by which the warp and nets are got in. Strength,
                    and not nautical knowledge, is required for this work; and all the important
                    part of the fishing—the deciding where to work and at what depth to place the
                    nets—is the business of the experienced fishermen.</p>
                <p>Drift-net fishing is with rare exceptions only carried on at night. The time for
                    commencing is just before sunset, and the nets are then got into the water by
                    the time it is dark. When the vessel has arrived at what— from certain
                    indications, such as numerous seabirds or possibly fish playing at the surface,
                    or even without any special signs to guide the fishermen—may be thought a likely
                    place for fish, for there is a great deal of speculation in the matter, the
                    vessel is sailed slowly before the wind, and if possible across the tide; then
                    the net is shot or thrown out over the vessel’s quarter, the men being
                    distributed at regular stations, some hauling up the net from below, others
                    throwing it over and taking care that it falls so that the foot is clear of the
                    corked back; others, again, looking after the warp which has to be paid out at
                    the same time, and seeing that the seizings are made fast to it in their proper
                    places. When it is all overboard, and about 15 or 20 fathoms of extra warp,
                    called the “swingrope,” given out, the vessel is brought round head to wind by
                    the warp being carried to the bow; the sails are then taken in, the mast
                    lowered, a small mizen set to keep the vessel with her head to the wind, and the
                    regulation lights are hoisted to show that she is fishing. A few of the hands
                    remain on deck to keep a look out, and the vessel and nets are left to drift
                    wherever the wind and tide may tike them. It is very rarely that there is an
                    absolute calm at sea; and if there is the faintest breath of air stirring, the
                    fishing boat will of course feel it more than the buoys supporting the nets; she
                    will consequently drift faster, and being at the lee end of the train, will have
                    a constant pull upon them, and so keep them extended almost in a straight line,
                    so that every portion of the nets hangs clear and free from folds. If there is a
                    great deal of wind more swingrope is allowed, so that the nets may not be
                    dragged through the water or any undue strain be thrown on the warp, as the more
                    warp there is out the greater spring there is in it, and the less danger of its
                    breaking. The first net in the train is called the “look-on” net, and frequently
                    after an hour or so, that one is hauled in to see if any fish have been taken,
                    and if so, in what part of the net. If it has been allowed to sink too low, that
                    will be shown by the fish being only in the upper part of the net, cr <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Such an examination of one of the nets (called in
                    Scotland by the name of “preeing”) also sometimes discloses the fact that
                    dog-fish are unpleasantly abundant, and this makes it desirable to haul in the
                    nets very soon, as these pests of the fisherman do a great deal of mischief to
                    both the fish and the nets if they are allowed to remain long in the water. The
                    operation of hauling in the nets is carried on in the same systematic manner as
                    in the case of shooting them. The laborious part of the work is now performed by
                    the “capstan-men,” whose duty it is to heave in the warp, the regular fishermen
                    looking after the net as it comes on board, and shaking out the fish, which is
                    at once sprinkled with salt and stowed away in the fish room.</p>
                <p>After a day or two, depending on the success or failure of the fishing, the
                    vessel returns to port; and the general practice since the opening of the
                    extensive covered fish market by tne side of the Yarmouth haven is for the
                    luggers to go into the river and deliver their cargoes direct into the market.
                    It is at times, however, a difficult matter to enter the haven, and then the old
                    practice of landing the fish on the beach in front of the town is resorted to.
                    The landing is effected by means of large “ferry-boats,” which go off loaded
                    with baskets of a peculiar shape, called “swills,” each one capable of holding
                    500 herrings, and put them on board the lugger which is anchored at a short
                    distance from the shore. The fislι are then counted rapidly into the baskets,
                    which are placed, when full, in the ferry-boat, and as soon as she is loaded she
                    returns and is laid broadside on to the beach. A set of strong, active fellows,
                    known as “beachmen,” at once go to work, and two men taking each basket between
                    them in their aims, soon carry up the fish to the carts waiting to take them
                    either to the market or direct to the curing houses. The situation of the market
                    by the side of the haven is very convenient; and, if required, more room can be
                    easily provided by adding some of the vacant land immediately adjoining it, and
                    with the same river frontage. The market was completed only in 1867, and
                    although the Yarmouth fishery has been carried on continuously for many
                    centuries, it is only since the opening of the new market that an accurate
                    account has been kept of the quantity of herrings landed there.</p>
                <p>The following statement shows the number of lasts of fish received at the market
                    during each of the ten years 1868-77, and as a “last” of herrings contains
                    13,200 fish, some idea will be gained of the produce of the Yarmouth fishery,
                    without taking into consideration what is landed elsewhere by Yarmouth
                    boats:</p>

                    produce of the Yarmouth fishery during the last ten years; and there is no doubt
                    that they have been almost entirely caused by variations of weather during the
                    herring season.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n262/mode/1up"

                <p>A few words must be said here about the manufacture of bloaters and red herrings,
                    which has made Yarmouth famous all over the world. The same mode of curing
                    herrings is now adopted in many other parts of England and in Scotland, but the
                    time spent on the operation is not in all cases the same.</p>
                <p>As soon as the herrings are brought to the curing houses at Yarmouth, the fish
                    are all washed to get rid of the salt they were sprinkled with on board the
                    fishing boats, and then, without being gutted, or any other preparation, they
                    are again put into salt, which is generally brought from Liverpool. Their
                    subsequent treatment depends on whether they are to be made into red herrings or
                    bloaters. The latter—Yarmouth bloaters, <hi rend="italic">par excellence—</hi>
                    are generally selected fish, full-roed and of the best quality. The finest are
                    made in October and part of November, when the home fishery is going on, and
                    they should be cured as soon as possible after they are taken out of the water.
                    Strictly speaking, a bloater is nothing more than a herring that has been only
                    slightly cured; it is kept in salt from twelve to eighteen hours, and then
                    smoked for about twenty-four hours. But as any herring can be made into what may
                    l&gt;e called a bloater, and there being always a demand for them, their
                    manufacture is carried on throughout the season with the best fish that can be
                    obtained; and we need hardly say that bloaters are to be had all over the
                    country, and cured in various places, which come far short in excellence of the
                    selected Yarmouth fish. A properly cured bloater is ready for the market at
                    once, and the sooner it appears on the breakfast table the better it is likely
                    to taste. In the last few years some bloaters have been prepared at Yarmouth
                    with even less curing than that we have spoken of, but they will not bear
                    keeping very long. It is the practice at Yarmouth to keep the fish in salt for
                    fourteen days if they are to be made into “red, well-cured, or high-dried
                    herrings”; they are then washed and hung in wood-smoke for another fortnight.
                    The curing is mainly done by women, and after the fish have been taken out of
                    the salt and washed, they are “rived” or strung in “spits,” or thin sticks,
                    about 4⅛ feet long, which are thrust under one gill-cover and out at the mouth.
                    Twenty-five fish arc put on each stick. The spits are then taken to the
                    smoke-room,— a lofty chamber, perhaps about 16 feet square, having a series of
                    wooden frames reaching from floor to roof, with small transverse beams, called
                    “loves,” beginning at a distance of six or seven feet from the ground, and
                    running, one above the other, from one side of the room to the other. The frames
                    are four feet apart, and the spits are placed in rows between them, the ends of
                    the spits resting on opposite loves. The roof is made of tiles, uncemented, so
                    as to allow a good draught through the room, which when filled contains three
                    lasts of fish. About sixteen fires are made on the stone floor of this room, the
                    fuel generally being oak billets, which give a high colour to the fish. Ash
                    timber, producing a different colour, is used in some cases, to suit the fancies
                    of particular foreign markets. When the room has been thus filled with spits of
                    fish, the fires are lighted and kept burning for two days; they are then let
                    out, and the fish allowed to drip for a day; the fires are again kept alight for
                    two days, and the process of alternately drying and dripping is continued for a
                    fortnight, when the herrings are considered thoroughly cured, or high-dried, and
                    are fit for packing. For the export trade they are packed in barrels, each of
                    which should hold 650 good-sized fish, or a larger number of smaller ones. The
                    manufacturer’s name and the number of fish are marked on each barrel. The
                    ex]κ&gt;rt trade is to Italy, the Greek islands, and the Levant. The time
                    employed in curing these herrings is longer than is given in Scotland, but in
                    some cases only half the usual time is allowed, and such fish are sent by
                    steamer to the Mediterranean, where they are soon disposed off; but it is not
                    considered safe generally to consign any but “well-cured” herrings to the
                    foreign markets, especially in warm climates. For the home market both bloaters
                    and “reds” are packed as a rule in flat boxes.</p>
                <p>The drift fishery for herrings is carried on more or less along the whole east
                    coast of England, throughout the English Channel, and to a small extent on the
                    Welsh and western side of England. The seasons for this fishery differ, however,
                    on different parts of the coast. It commences on the Northumberland coast in the
                    latter part of July, becoming later as we go southward; at Yarmouth and
                    Lowestoft the home fishery is in October and November; but a spring fishing has
                    been made for some years past at Lowestoft, beginning at some distance from the
                    land, and gradually coming nearer as the season advances. It is a fishery that
                    has given rise to much complaint on account of the generally small size of the
                    fish then caught. In the Channel herring fishing goes on during November and
                    December, and at the extreme west in the early part of the year. It is not a
                    very important fishery there, however, and the attention of the fishermen is
                    soon entirely given to the more lucrative fishing for mackerel, which may be
                    said to have its headquarters at the mouth of the Channel, although the fish
                    gradually advance eastward as the summer goes on.</p>
                <p>The mackerel drift fishery is worked practically in the same manner as that for
                    herrings, but a larger mesh is of course required, and about an inch and a half
                    square has been found most suitable. That, however, is not the only difference
                    between mackerel and herring nets. It is the special habit of mackerel to keep
                    near the top of the water, and the nets are consequently so well corked as to
                    float at the surface. It is also unnecessary to have the same depth of netting
                    as when herring fishing, and what is saved in this direction is added to the
                    length. A full train of mackerel nets as used by the large Yarmouth drift-boats
                    is as much as 2⅛ miles long, or double that of a herring fleet. Twine was long
                    used in their manufacture, but cotton has taken its place generally whenever new
                    nets were required. Mackerel first appear in deep water south and south-west of
                    the British Islands, and are sometimes caught as early as January many miles
                    west of Scilly, but the general Cornish fishery does not usually begin till
                    towards the end of February, and it extends into June. May, June, and July are
                    the months in which the mackerel drift fishery is carried on farther up the
                    Channel, and at the later part of that season in the southern portion of the
                    North Sea. The important fishery for mackerel is, however, on the Cornish coast,
                    and thither resort fishing boats from Yarmouth, Lowestoft, and the various
                    Channel ports, and, in company with the famous Mounts Bay luggers, devote
                    themselves to the ingathering of this great harvest of the sea. Many thousands
                    of tons of mackerel are landed at the western ports during the season,
                    particularly at Plymouth and Penzance, and are sent away by rail to the London
                    and other markets.</p>
                <p>The pilchard drift fishery is worked in the same manner as that for herrings, but
                    rather a smaller mesh is used, and herring nets which have shrunk too much for
                    their original purpose are often usefully employed for the capture of pilchards.
                    This fishery begins in July and continues till September. It is mostly worked on
                    the coast of Cornwall, but during the last few years a great many of these fish
                    have been taken along almost every part of the south coast of Devon. Pilchards
                    may be regarded in England as essentially Cornish fish; there is very little
                    sale for them out of their proper county, but there they are looked upon almost
                    as one of the necessaries of life, and every household likes to have a store of
                    salted pilchards for winter use. These are all the produce of the drift nets,
                    the fish taken by the seans being cured for export to the Mediterranean. A new
                    industry in connexion with the pilchard fishery has been recently established at
                    Newlyn in Mounts Bay, and at Mevagissey, further to the eastward. This is the
                    manufacture of “sardines” in precisely the same manner as has long been carried
                    out on the French coast. The so-called “sardines,” caught so largely in the Bay
                    of Biscay, being nothing but young pilchards, there seemed no reason why the
                    Cornish fish if treated in the same way as the French should not turn out as
                    good. Curing establishments were therefore set up at the two places named, and
                    measures having been taken to ensure a thorough knowledge of the French mode of
                    curing, “Cornish sardines,” or “pilchards in oil,” were prepared, and with so
                    much success that orders for them are now received for more than the present
                    limited means of manufacture can supply.</p>

                    occasionally taken by them. The particular fishery with which this net is most
                    commonly associated is that for pilchards at St Ives on the north coast of
                    Cornwall, where seans are kept in readiness for working on a very large scale.
                    For a long course of years St Ives Bay has been more or less visited by shoals
                    of pilchards, generally during the months of October and November. These fish
                    are found in abundance off the south-west of Ireland rather earlier in the year,
                    and it appears as if the shoals were returning towards the Bay of Biscay, when
                    they arrive on the north coast of Cornwall in October. In their course
                    southwards some of them enter St Ives Bay and sweep around it, and if, in doing
                    so, they come within a certain range of part of the shore, the seans are brought
                    into play, and large captures of fish may be made. The seaning ground is on the
                    western side of the bay, and extends southwards for nearly three miles from the
                    bar. It is divided into six stations or “stems,” by marks or boundaries on the
                    land, in positions fixed by a local Act.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>and 5 Vict. c. 57.</p></note> These stems have each a name,
                    and no fishing boats besides those employed in the seau fishery are allowed to
                    fish or anchor within a certain distance of the stems between an hour before
                    sunrise and the same period after sunset from the 25th of July to the 25th of
                    December; and any passing boats must keep near the shore. Under favourable
                    circumstances the fishery is likely to be so valuable and of such general
                    advantage to the town that the Act of Parliament regulating the proceedings is
                    strictly carried out with the approval of all concerned.. For this reason also
                    no seans below a certain size are allowed to be used, so that the danger of
                    disturbing a large body of fish, and perhaps frightening them into deep water
                    without having secured a good haul, may be as much as possible avoided. The
                    smallest sean of legal size at St Ives is 160 fathoms along the cork-rope, with
                    a depth of 8 fathoms at the middle or bunt and 6 fathoms at the ends or wings.
                    Some of the seans are as much as 200 fathoms long, and the mesh in all is
                    three-quarters of an inch square throughout the net. The object is not to mesh
                    the fish as in a drift-net, but to inclose them. What we have described is the
                    sean proper, but there is another of smaller size and different proportions
                    which also takes part in the fishery. This is called a tuck-sean, and is only 70
                    to 80 fathoms long, but it is 8 fathoms at the wings and 10 fathoms in the
                    middle or bunt. Besides these there are other nets called stop-nets, which are
                    practically only additions which can be made to the principal sean, and which
                    are so used when the sean is being worked. As there are about 250 seans at St
                    Ives, and only six stations in which they can be used, some arrangement is
                    necessary to prevent confusion and interference, and this and other details are
                    the subject of special regulations. The seans are all registered, and many of
                    them belong to companies. Several boats are employed when a sean is to be shot.
                    The largest, called the sean-boat, is about 32 feet on keel, with plenty of room
                    for carrying the net; she has six men for rowing and two for shooting the sean.
                    Two tow-boats about 24 feet long, and each carrying a stop-net, with a crew of
                    six men, make up the working party; but besides these there is a small boat
                    called the “volyer” or “lurker,” from which the master seaner directs all the
                    proceedings. The position of the shoals of fish is pointed out by men called
                    “huers,” who are selected from the sharpest and cleverest of the fishermen.
                    There are generally two of them on the hill above each station, and when they
                    see the shoals of fish, looking like the shadow of a cloud on the water, they
                    signal with a large white canvas ball to the boats waiting below in the
                    stations. These men remain on duty for three hours at a time, and receive <hi
                    rend="italic">£3</hi> a month, and one hogshead out of every hundred hogsheads
                    of fish landed. When the shoal has come within a convenient distance of one of
                    the stations, the boats containing the sean and stop-sean, which have been
                    previously joined together, commence shooting the nets at the same time, the
                    larger net being thrown out in a direction parallel with the shore, while the
                    stop-sean is shot in front of the shoal as the boat is rowed towards the land.
                    The two boats ultimately turn towards each other, and gradually bring the ends
                    of the nets together, thus cutting off and surrounding as many fish as they can.
                    The second stop-net is joined to the first if there is a probability of its
                    being wanted. The nets are then fastened together at the point of meeting, and
                    the circle gradually contracted until all the fish are inclosed by the single
                    large sean. The ends being securely joined and the stop-nets taken away, the
                    circle of netting with the inclosed pilchards is slowly hauled towards the
                    shore, into some quiet place as much as possible out of the run of the tide,
                    till the weighted foot of the net touches the bottom, and there it is safely
                    moored. The fish cannot now escape, and if the haul be a large one several days
                    may elapse before they are all taken out. “Tucking” the fish is the next
                    operation, and this is performed with the tuck-sean, which we described as being
                    very deep in the middle. It is shot in the ordinary way with one boat, but
                    inside the other sean, and as it is hauled in, the foot of the bunt is raised so
                    as to bring the fish to the surface, whence they are dipped out in large baskets
                    and put into attendant boats to be carried on shore. This is of course the
                    exciting moment of the day, and all the town is astir, and taking part in the
                    general rejoicing. Landing and carrying the fish to the curing houses is done by
                    men termed “blowsers,” who are paid in proportion to the catch of fish. The
                    seanmen receive certain wages in money and a share of the fish, and every
                    household docs a little curing on its own account. The great bulk of the fish,
                    however, goes into the houses of the large curers, who are generally the
                    proprietors of the seans.</p>
                <p>Women are employed in the curing, which consists in packing the pilchards in
                    alternate layers of coarse salt and fish on the stone floor of the curing house,
                    until the “bulk,” as it is called, has reached a height of five or six feet. The
                    fish remain here a month, and the oil and brine draining from the mass are
                    carried off by gutters in the floor to a cistern. When the fish have been
                    sufficiently salted they are washed and packed with the heads outwards in
                    hogsheads, and a “rose” of fish in the middle to keep the level. Gradual
                    pressure is now applied on top of the fish, until the contents of the cask have
                    been reduced one-third in bulk, and a large quantity of oil squeezed out; this
                    escapes through the sides of the hogshead, the hoops not being at first very
                    tightly driven. The cask is filled up three times before the pressing is
                    finished, and then, after eight or nine days, the hogshead of fish should weigh
                    four hundredweight gross. The average number of fish in each hogshead is 2500,
                    and sometimes as many as 1000 hogsheads have been taken at one haul of the sean
                    The largest single catch recorded at St Ives was 5500 hogsheads actually landed,
                    and on that occasion great numbers of fish were lost besides. The fluctuation in
                    the sean-pilchard fishery, at St Ives is very great from year to year; and it
                    would appear remarkable, if the success of the fishery did not almost entirely
                    depend on whether or not the shoals came into that part of the bay where alone
                    the seans can be used. The St Ives sean-fishery has been unsuccessful for the
                    last four years, less than 10,000 hogsheads having been cured in each of those
                    periods; but in the “Pilchard Circular” issued by'Messrs G. C. Fox &amp; Co. of
                    Falmouth, giving an account of the fishery season of 1877, it is said that
                    “considerable bodies of fish visited the coast, but did not come into the stems
                    where seines might have inclosed them.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is difficult to suggest any satisfactory explanation of
                    the fact that, though large shoals of pilchards are every year observed passing
                    the north coast of Cornwall, it is only in particular years that any great
                    numbers of these fish enter St Ives Bay and come within reach of the seaners. It
                    might seem that the streams, containing drainage from mining works, which fall
                    into the bay, would pollute the water, and tend to turn back the fish, but there
                    is much less mining in the neighbourhood now than formerly. The fishermen’s idea
                    that the state and direction of the tide, when a shoal of fish is near the
                    entrance to the bay, affect the course of the shoals appears more plausible, for
                    it must <pb corresp="kp-eb0909-0264-0255" xml:id="pbn9255"/> be remembered that,
                    though the fishery season lasts several months, it is only at intervals that the
                    nets are put into the water, and the tide may be unfavourable when the fish are
                    heading towards the bay. It is quite clear that, as the sean fisheries of 1871
                    and 1873 were the most successful on record, there has been no gradual
                    diminution of pilchards from over-fishing.</p></note> The pilchards<pb

                <p>The special sean fisheries for mackerel are along the Chesil Beach near Portland,
                    and on the Sussex coast, at and near Brighton; but they do not call for
                    particular notice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stow-net Fishery.—</hi> This fishery appears to be entirely
                    confined to the Solent, inside the Isle of Wight, the estuary of the Thames, and
                    the Wash, between the Norfolk and Lincolnshire coasts. It is specially for the
                    capture of sprats, although many young herrings are sometimes caught, and it is
                    worked most extensively at the entrance of the Thames. The stow-net is a
                    gigantic funnel-shaped bag having a nearly square mouth, 30 feet from the upper
                    to the lower side, and 21 feet wide. It tapers for a length of about 90 feet to
                    a diameter of 5 or 6 feet, and further diminishes to about half that size for
                    another 90 feet to the end of the net. The whole net is therefore about 180 feet
                    or 60 yards long. The upper and lower sides of the square mouth are kept
                    extended by two wooden spars called “balks,” and the lower one is weighted so as
                    to open the mouth of the net in a perpendicular direction when it is at work.
                    The size of the meshes varies from an inch and three-eighths near the mouth to
                    half an inch towards the end, where, however, it is again slightly enlarged to
                    allow for the greater pressure of the water at that part. The mode of working
                    the net is very simple. Oyster smacks are commonly used in this fishery,
                    although shrimping boats are also employed in it in the Thames. The smack takes
                    up a position at the first of the tide where there are signs of fish, or in such
                    parts of the estuary as are frequented by the sprats during that part of the
                    season; she then anchors, and at the same moment the net is put overboard and so
                    handled that it at once takes its proper position, which is under the vessel. It
                    is kept there by a very simple arrangement. Four ropes leading, one from each
                    end of the two balks, and therefore from the four corners of the mouth of the
                    net, are united at some little distance in front, forming a double bridle, and a
                    single mooring rope leads from this point of union to the vessel’s anchor; so
                    that the same anchor holds both the vessel and the net. The net is kept at any
                    desired distance from the bottom by means of two ropes, one from each end of the
                    upper balk to the corresponding side of the smack, where it is made fast. The
                    open mouth of the net is thus kept suspended below the vessel, and the long mass
                    of netting streams away astern with the tide. The strain of this immense bag-net
                    by the force of the tide is often very great, but if the vessel drags her
                    anchor, the net being made fast to the same mooring, both keep their relative
                    positions. Here they remain for several hours till the tide slackens, the
                    vessel’s sails being all taken in, and only one hand being left on deck to keep
                    watch. The way in which the fish are caught hardly requires explanation. The
                    sprats, swimming in immense shoals, are carried by the tide into the open mouth
                    of the net and then on to the small end, where they are collected in enormous
                    numbers; from this there is no escape, as the crowd is constantly increasing,
                    and they cannot stem the strong tide setting into the net. The first thing to be
                    done in taking in the net is to close the mouth, and this is effected by means
                    of a chain leading from the bow of the vessel through an iron loop in the middle
                    of the upper balk down to the centre of the lower one, and by heaving in this
                    chain the two balks are brought together and ultimately hoisted out of the water
                    under the vessel’s bowsprit. The net is then brought alongside and overhauled
                    till the end is reached, and this is hoisted on board. The rope by which it is
                    closed having been cast off, the sprats are then measured into the hold of the
                    vessel by about three bushels at a time, until the net has been emptied. The
                    quantity of sprats taken in this manner by many scores of fishing craft during
                    the season, which lasts from November to February, is in some years simply
                    enormous; the markets at Billingsgate and elsewhere are inundated with them, and
                    at last they can only be disposed of at a nominal price for manure; and in this
                    way many hundreds of tons are annually got rid of. The stow-boats do not
                    generally take their fish on shore, but market boats come off to them and buy
                    the fish out of the vessel’s hold, and carry it away The mode of working is the
                    same in the Solent and the Wash as that we have described in the Thames, and
                    large quantities of sprats are landed by the Southampton boats.</p>
                <p>“Whitebait,” or young herrings, as they should properly be called, are caught in
                    the Thames by a net which is practically nothing else but a very small stow-net,
                    and it is worked in essentially the same manner.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Line Fisheries.—</hi> Hand-lining and long-lining are worked
                    more or less all round the British Islands, and various kinds of fish, such as
                    cod, haddock, whiting, coalfish, pollack, bream, and conger are taken regularly
                    on the English coast, some being more abundant in one part and some in another.
                    The cod fishery in the North Sea, however, is the one specially deserving
                    notice; it has been carried on in a systematic manner, and on rather a large
                    scale for a great number of years. Welled smacks were in use at Harwich as early
                    as 1712, and in them the cod were brought alive into port just as they are at
                    the present day. The idea of keeping the fish alive appears to have been taken
                    from the Dutch fishermen, and in the interval between 1712 and 1715 three
                    vessels fitted for that purpose were built, but very inferior to those
                    afterwards constructed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Our notice of the early history of the cod fishery as carried on from
                    Harwich is taken from a statement prepared by Mr Groom of Harwich, and given to
                    the Royal Sea Fisheries Commissioners in 1864.</p></note> In the year 1720 the
                    number had increased to 12, and in 1735 to 30. Of that number Mr Nathaniel
                    Saunders, the progenitor of several generations of fishfactors and salesmen at
                    Billingsgate, had six, and with four of these, which were very superior to the
                    other two, he visited the coast of Scotland in the course of his fishing
                    expeditions, and was at that time the chief medium for conveying goods to and
                    from the north of Scotland. In 1766 <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0265-0256"/> a Mr Orlibar, a fishing smack owner at Harwich,
                    made the first attempt to fish for cod with long lines on the Dogger Bank; and
                    although he was at first very unsuccessful, he persevered, and was so fortunate
                    that in 1774 the number of smacks had increased to 62, of which 40 went
                    regularly to the Dogger to fish with long lines. In 1788 there were 78 smacks,
                    and in 1798 the number had increased to 96. About this time a few attempts were
                    made at Gravesend, Greenwich, and Barking to construct smacks of a similar
                    description, and the Harwich fishery gradually declined. Afterwards the three
                    places on the Thames increased their connexion with this fishery, and Barking
                    especially became an important station, not only for cod-boats, but also for
                    trawlers. Many cod vessels were likewise owned at Gravesend and Greenwich, and
                    these two towns for many years had stores of live cod in chests floating in the
                    river. Great changes have, however, taken place in recent times; the Thames
                    water became so impure that the cod could not be kept alive in it for many days,
                    and ultimately the storing of the fish there was altogether given up. The
                    Harwich river was still used for that purpose, and is so now, although there are
                    but few cod-boats belonging to the place; but the opening of the railways on the
                    east coast gradually brought Grimsby into notice, and its position in relation
                    to the fishing grounds was found so convenient that it gradually became, and
                    there is every reason to believe it will remain, the headquarters of the North
                    Sea cod fishery.</p>
                <p>The special feature in this fishery which distinguishes it from all other line
                    fishing on the coast of the United Kingdom is the systematic use of welled
                    vessels, in which the cod are kept alive until they are brought into port. These
                    welled smacks are built for the purpose, the well not being a tank fitted into
                    any suitable vessel, but a part of the original construction of the hull. Two
                    strong water-tight bulkheads are built entirely across the vessel from keelson
                    to deck, enclosing a large space just in the centre of the smack. This is the
                    “well”; and a constant supply and circulation of the water from the sea is kept
                    up within it through large auger holes bored in the bottom of the vessel, in
                    that part of it between the bulkheads. The vessel is in fact built in three
                    compartments, and the water has access to the central one through the holes made
                    at the bottom of it. The entrance to the well is on deck through a hatchway, the
                    four sides of which are carried down for about three feet to what is called the
                    well-deck, above the level of the water-line, extending all round the hatchway
                    to the bulkheads and sides of the vessel. The object of this lower deck is to
                    keep the level of the water within certain limits when the vessel is rolling
                    about or pressed down under sail. The cost of these welled smacks is about £300
                    more than that of the ordinary “dry-bottomed” vessels of the same size. The
                    working expenses of a cod smack are also much heavier than in a trawler. Each of
                    these line boats carries from nine to eleven hands, of whom as many as six or
                    seven are apprentices of various ages; and the system of payment by shares, so
                    general with the trawlers, is here only adopted in the case of the captain, who
                    gets 9 per cent, of the proceeds of the voyage, the mate receiving 24s. per
                    week, the men 22s., and the apprentices from £5 to £12 a year, according to
                    their length of service. Provisions are found by the owner, entirely or nearly
                    so. Both hand lines and long lines are used in this fishery, depending on season
                    and locality. A complete set of long lines consists of about fifteen dozen, or
                    180 lines, 40 fathoms in length, each supporting 26 hooks on smaller short lines
                    called “snoods,” which are fastened to the main line a fathom and a half apart.
                    A “string” of lines of this description is 7200 fathoms long, or nearly eight
                    miles, and has 4680 hooks. Whelks or “buckies” are always use! for bait where
                    they can be procured in sufficient quantities, and in the regular long-line
                    season each smack takes about 40 wash<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A wash is a stamped measure capable of holding twenty-one
                    quarts and a pint of water.</p></note> of whelks with her for the voyage, and
                    about half that quantity as the season draws to a close in March. The whelks are
                    preserved alive in net bags, and are kept in the vessel’s well till wanted, when
                    the shells are broken and the tough fleshy animals extracted. Baiting the large
                    number of hooks used gives plenty of employment to the large crew of the smack.
                    The lines are shot at sunrise or earlier if the weather is fine and there is
                    light enough to see what is being done. The smack is put under easy sail, and
                    kept as much as possible with the wind free, so long as a course can be sailed
                    across the tide, which is important, as then, as the line is paid out, the
                    snoods drift clear of it. The lines are neatly coiled, and with the baited hooks
                    are laid in trays all ready for running, each tray containing from 12 to 16
                    pieces of line, and as the vessel sails slowly along, the whole length of line
                    is gradually put overboard. A small anchor at every 40 fathoms keeps the line
                    steady on the ground, and its position at the two ends and at every intermediate
                    mile is marked by a conical buoy or “dan,” with a staff passed through it and
                    carrying a small flag. When after a few hours the tide has nearly come to an
                    end, the smack, which meanwhile has been hove to in the neighbourhood of the
                    last buoy, gets the end of the line on board and works in short tacks along its
                    course, the line being hauled in, and the fish taken off the hooks as she
                    proceeds. When the wind is very light a boat is used for hauling in the line,
                    and the fish are kept alive in the stern of the boat, which is partitioned off
                    so as to form a watertight division. In any case the strong and lively fish are
                    transferred as soon as possible to the ship’s well, and dead fish, or those
                    which do not appear likely to live in the well, are stowed away in ice. The
                    season for long-lining is during winter, and the fishery is carried on both on
                    the Dogger Bank and on well-known ground off the coast of Norfolk. In April this
                    fishery conies to an end, and a few of the smacks go away hand-lining to Iceland
                    and the Faroe Islands, salting the fish they catch there, and usually lauding it
                    at Shetland. In July hand-line fishing for cod begins in the home waters, and is
                    continued till October, the commencement of the long-line fishery of which we
                    have just spoken. The July fishery is at a distance of from 10 to 30 miles from
                    the coast, as the approach of the herrings to the land at that time causes a
                    great gathering of cod in their neighbourhood. The smack is hove to when
                    hand-lining, and each man works with a single line furnished with from two to
                    six hooks. On the return of the vessel to Grimsby after a few days, the fish are
                    taken out of the well by means of long handled landing nets, and are put into
                    wooden chests which are kept floating in the fish-dock. These chests are 7 feet
                    long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep, and are constructed so that there is a free
                    circulation of the water through them. The water in the dock at Grimsby being
                    quiet, the chests are made with the ends square; but at Harwich, another storing
                    place for live cod, the chests are moored in the tideway, and have the ends
                    boat-shaped, so as to offer less resistance to the stream. There are about 400
                    of these chests in use at Grimsby during the height of the cod season, and as
                    many as from 15,000 to 20,000 live cod in them at a time. There is a great
                    advantage in thus storing these fish, as they can always be sent quite fresh to
                    market, and only as many forwarded as there is a demand for. Killing the cod for
                    market is a strange scene, and it goes on daily during the season. Each chest
                    will hold from 40 to 100 cod according to their size, and when the fish are
                    wanted, a chest is hauled alongside a hulk kept in the dock for the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n266/mode/1up"

                    the top is then opened, and a man steps into the chest aud lifts the fish out,
                    seizing them.by the head and tail, and throwing them on the deck of the hulk. It
                    is often difficult work to get hold of the struggling and slippery cod, but one
                    after another tlιey are taken out and handed over to the executioner on the deck
                    of the hulk; he grasps the fish tightly behind the head with his left hand,
                    holding it down on the deck, and giving a few heavy blows with a short bludgeon
                    on the nose, kills it at once. The dead fish rapidly accumulate in a heap,
                    whence they are taken on shore to be picked in bulk in the railway trucks
                    waiting by the side of the market to receive them. The fish thus killed and
                    packed reach Billingsgate early the next morning, aud are known in the trade as
                    “live cod”; they fetch the highest prices; and there is something in the manner
                    in which they are killed which enables them to be properly crimped many hours
                    after their death.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scotch Fisheries.</hi> —The important fisheries on the coast
                    of Scotland are drift-fishing for herrings, and line-fishing for cod, haddock,
                    ling, and some other kinds. Besides these there is in particular localities sean
                    or “trawl’’fishing for herrings, and for sprats or “garvíes.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Herring Fishery.—</hi> We will first speak of this special
                    fishery, which from its profitable character, extensive range, and the
                    employment it gives to vast numbers of the coast population, both afloat and on
                    shore, ranks as one of the most important fisheries of the United Kingdom, as it
                    is also one of the great harvests of Scotland.</p>
                <p>The herring season on the Scotch coast does not commence everywhere at exactly
                    the same time, although the principal fishing is always during the summer
                    months, the winter fishings being local and rather uncertain. The earliest
                    herrings are taken on the west coast, and are generally first met with outside a
                    line between the Butt of Lewis and Cape Wrath during April. In May the herrings
                    come into the Minch and work their way southwards; but they sometimes enter the
                    Minch at the south end of the islands, and in 1870 in particular, there was a
                    large fishery near South Uist and Barra, but mostly on the Atlantic side, some
                    miles south-west of Barra Head. It is rarely, however, that herrings are taken
                    on the western side of the outer Hebrides, and the great fishery may be said to
                    lie between those islands and the mainland. The fish remain in these waters in
                    greater or less abundance till nearly the end of September, but May and June are
                    the most productive months of the season, and during that period a great number
                    of boats from the east coast go to tl⅜e western side to take part in this early
                    fishery. As July approaches the order of proceeding is reversed: the time is
                    near for commencing the great fishery on the east coast, and one by one the
                    boats which had come from that side return to their own waters, and many others
                    from the western districts accompany them. The eastern fishery begins about the
                    middle of July, and continues until about the end of September, commencing at
                    the north and extending gradually southwards as the season advances. Many
                    changes in the importance of particular districts as centres of this fishery
                    have taken place in the course of years. For a long time Wick was the leading
                    fishing and curing station on the east coast, sending out 1000 boats daily
                    during the best of the season; but recently the fisheries from Peterhead and
                    Fraserburgh have been unusually successful, and they have taken the principal
                    position on the cast coast for the extent of their curing operations.</p>
                <p>Drift-fishing is the method by which most of the Scotch herrings are taken, the
                    use of seans or “trawls” being practically confined to a few localities on the
                    west coast so far as regards the herrings, although they are employed on the
                    eastern side fbr the capture of garvies. Cotton nets are now universally used,
                    and the manner of working them is precisely the same as we have already
                    described in our account of the Yarmouth fishery; but there has been a
                    considerable increase in both the size and number of the nets worked by each
                    boat. This has been due to several causes. The lightness of cotton nets compared
                    with those of hemp formerly in use enables a larger quantity of netting to be
                    easily handled by the same number of men, and thus more catching power is
                    provided. Then it is desirable to make up a certain weight of nets in proportion
                    to the size of the boats, that they may not drift too fast and drag the nets
                    through the water; for all the strain that is needed on a fleet of nets is as
                    much as will keep them extended in as near a straight line as may be. The
                    fisheries have in late years been carried on far out at sea, and a remarkable
                    change from open to decked fishing boats has taken place, a change that had for
                    a long time been earnestly recommended to the fishermen for their own sakes, and
                    to prevent the great loss of life which had so frequently occurred when the open
                    boats were overtaken by bad weather. This change led to larger boats being
                    built, capable of using an increased quantity of fishing gear. There are thus
                    many reasons for the additional netting now generally employed, without
                    resorting to the idea that it has become necessary owing to herrings having
                    gradually diminished in the seas. We may here mention that the official returns
                    of Scotch fishing boats have of late years shown a steady diminution in their
                    number, but it will be found on examination that the falling off has been only
                    in the second and third class boats, and that those of the first class have been
                    increasing. In the last report issued by the Board of Fisheries, that for 1876,
                    a decrease of 109 boats is recorded; but at the same time it is stated that
                    there were 181 fishermen and boys more than in the previous year, and the
                    estimated value of the boats, nets, and lines, had increased by as much as
                    £35,719. The size of the fishing boats is limited unfortunately by the general
                    absence of natural deep-water harbours where they would be most useful, so that
                    no very great increase in their tonnage can be conveniently made; and although
                    first-class boats are taking the place of those which were in the second, the
                    change does not involve an addition of more than four or five tons in one of the
                    larger craft. Fourteen tons was a common size for a large second-class boat, and
                    as anything over 15 tons ranks in the first class, the new ones of 17 or 18 tons
                    are all included under that head. There is little difference at first sight in
                    the appearance above water of most Scotch fishing boats, but there are many
                    distinctions below the water-line in accordance with local ideas. As a rule,
                    excepting on parts of the west coast, the boats are sharp at both ends and have
                    a great deal of beam, but they differ much in depth and in the extent of rise to
                    the floor. The Buckie boats have long been remarkable for their peculiar build
                    and rig, having a low and broad midship section with a flat or rather hollow
                    floor; they are very fine at both ends, and have considerable rake of both stem
                    and stern post. They are commonly known as “scaffy” boat- <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 1</hi>. Another peculiarity in these boats was that they carried a mizen
                    lugsail in addition to the large fore and main lugs which were the usual working
                    sails of the general run of Scotch fishing craft. Fishermen as a class are most
                    unwilling to make any change in their style of boats or methods of fishing; but
                    when decked boats were fairly tried on the Scotch coast, their advantages could
                    not fail to be acknowledged; and as it was found that profitable fishing<note

                    decked fishing boats gradually gained favour, and is now very general. This
                    alteration, however, involved an important change in the rig of the boats in the
                    doing away with the main-lug, a sail which for many years had given a
                    distinctive character to the Scotch fishing boats. In our notice of the Yarmouth
                    luggers we mentioned that when the vessel was fishing, the foremast was lowered
                    on to a crutch on deck, so that the vessel might ride easier and not roll about,
                    as the weight of the standing mast would be likely to make her do. This is the
                    practice with all drift-fishing boats; but in decked boats there is a difficulty
                    in doing this with a second mast, and if it were done there would be so much
                    more hamper upon or near the deck and in the way of the fishermen as to cause
                    much inconvenience. The mainmast has therefore been done away with, and the
                    necessary after-sail is provided by means of a mizen, which, being outside the
                    stern, has plenty of power when wanted, and is out of the way of the fishermen.
                    The fore-lug is made larger than it used to be, so that there is still plenty of
                    canvas, and the general rig of the boats is now just what has been for a very
                    long time adopted by the English fishermen as the most convenient for
                    drift-fishing. Steam-tugs have been advantageously used in towing the fishing
                    boats towards and from their fishing ground; but such a system could hardly be
                    generally applied to the vast fleet of boats which collect in certain years at
                    some of the stations.</p>
                <p>The fluctuations in the herring fishing are very remarkable, but they are not
                    more so on the coast of Scotland than on that of Norway and elsewhere. Indeed,
                    Norway and Sweden afford instances unparalleled in Britain of the disappearance
                    of herrings from particular districts, and their return in the most unexpected
                    manner after a long course of years (see p. 267). On the coast of Scotland, the
                    changes which take place in the fishery consist in an increase or decrease at
                    particular districts rather than a total disappearance from any one of them. The
                    most marked failure in recent years is in the Firth of Forth, where the summer
                    fishing has now been given up, only a small winter fishing being carried on. At
                    Wick, also, for a great number of years the most important station on the east
                    coast, the herring fishing has been more or less diminishing, whilst at the same
                    time Fraserburgh, only about 70 miles distant from it, has gradually assumed an
                    unexampled importance. It is true that in 1876 there was an immense falling off
                    in the quantity of fish landed at the latter port, but it was a bad year at
                    almost every station on the east and west coasts, and the almost general
                    decrease arose not from any apparent scarcity of fish, but from the boats being
                    frequently kept in harbour by a continuance of very bad weather during the
                    fishing season, or being unable from the same cause to work their nets when they
                    reached their regular grounds. There is some reason for believing the alleged
                    scarcity of herrings near the land is not so great as has been supposed.
                    Successful fishing many miles out at sea has attracted large numbers of boats
                    from the home waters, and the catches inshore have been consequently much
                    diminished; still the general opinion appears to be well founded that the fish
                    have not entered the firths and lochs in the last few years to the same extent
                    as they used to do. That the fisheries, taken as a whole, have been gradually
                    increasing is shown by the carefully prepared statistics of the Board of</p>
                <p>Fisheries; and it is desirable to point out that the great increase in the
                    quantity of netting now used is to some considerable extent counterbalanced by
                    the shorter time the nets are in the water; for the boats go long distances to
                    sea, and they have to leave off fishing earlier in order to bring in their fish
                    in good time to the curers. It may appear strange that after the lapse of
                    centuries during which the herring fishery has been regularly carried on, so
                    little knowledge should have been gained of the habits of this valuable fish;
                    but it must be confessed that at the present moment we can say nothing
                    positively about what brings the herring towards the land, why at one time they
                    will “strike” the nets, and at another they will apparently not go near them—in
                    short, what are the particular influences which regulate their movements. Of
                    course, the old idea that these fish come into shoal water in order to deposit
                    their spawn is the one still generally received, and we will not venture to say
                    it is incorrect; but if it be true that the spawning fish come in for that
                    purpose, that cannot be the inducement in the case of the “maties” or fish which
                    show no development of the milt or roe. Yet both these herrings do precisely the
                    same. Mackerel differ from herrings in spawning at the surface, and it has been
                    abundantly proved that their ova float during the whole period of development;
                    still we find that mackerel in full spawning condition, and half-grown fish
                    also, are mixed up in the same shoals at the time when they approach the land.
                    Thus we find the habits of surface-spawners and ground-spawners are alike in
                    this respect, yet the common explanation of the visits of the spawning herring
                    will not apply in the case of the mackerel, or even in that of the “matie.” With
                    respect to the causes which induce the herrings to keep near the surface, or to
                    remain at some little depth, a step seems to have been taken in the right
                    direction in the observations now being made of the possible relation of the
                    temperature of the sea to the higher or lower movements of the fish, Good
                    service was done by the late Marquis of Tweeddale.when he provided a number of
                    deep-sea thermometers for the use of the fishery officers and fishermen, whose
                    observations are reported weekly to the Meteorological Society of Scotland, and
                    come under the careful scrutiny of the secretary, Mr Alexander Buchan. It is
                    early yet to expect any definite results from this inquiry, as it has only been
                    carried on for four or five years; but the observations hitherto made peint to a
                    high degree of temperature in the sea being unfavourable to fishing, and show
                    that, when the sea is found to be colder in any one district than in that on
                    either side of.it, the herrings are more abundant and the fishery is more
                    successful in the colder than in the warmer water. It is also stated that the
                    influence of thunderstorms had been, perceptible in each year; and that if a
                    thunderstorm of some magnitude had extended over a large portion of the east of
                    Scotland, good takes of fish might be made on that day, but on the following day
                    few if any fish would be caught over that part of the coast, unless at the
                    extreme verge of a deep part of the sea, as if the fish were retreating thither.
                    Observations on the influence of winds and the temperature of the sea have also
                    been made by the Dutch fishermen; and Herr von Freedon of Hamburg believes, from
                    an analysis of these observations, that a temperature of from 53° to 57° F. is
                    most favourable for the herring fishery, and that the chances of success
                    diminish with higher or lower temperatures. Should these conclusions be
                    confirmed, it is quite possible that the fishermen may be enabled, by a trial of
                    the temperature of the sea at different depths, to determine how far their nets
                    should be sunk to give them a fair hope of a successful fishing, instead of
                    working, as they do now, very much on the chance system, often finding that they
                    have been too high or too low for the principal part of the shoal.</p>

                <p>The important system of curing herrings in the wet state, or, as it is properly
                    called, as “white nerrings,” is more completely worked on the east coast than on
                    the west. The whole process of curing is earned on under the supervision of the
                    Board of British White Herring Fishery, which was established by the Act, 48
                    Geo. III. c. 110 (1808), and, with some slight changes in its organization and
                    additions to its duties, has continued its labours to the present time. Its
                    particular duties are to inspect the curing, and to see that the proper
                    regulations are duly carried out; to place the Government brand on the barrels
                    when desired, according to the quality of the cure; to see that the regulations
                    for registering the fishing boats are duly attended to; to maintain order on the
                    fishing grounds; to lay out to the best advantage a special grant of money for
                    improving or building fishery harbours; and to prepare accurate statistics of
                    the fisheries. Many years ago curing according to this system was done at some
                    of the English ports,—hence the word British in the title of the board; but for
                    some little time past “white herrings” have practically only been prepared in
                    Scotland, and the now ordinary name of “Fishery Board, Scotland,” fairly
                    expresses the geographical limits within which its duties are performed at the
                    present day. The general out-door work of the board is performed by a body of
                    men who are well known by the title of fishery officers; and it is essential
                    that they should have been brought up as coopers, an important part of their
                    duties being to see that barrels<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    training they have had in them, have resulted in the board gradually obtaining a
                    staff of men by whose intelligence and experience a vast store of information
                    about everything connected with the working of the Scotch fisheries has been
                    collected. Each man is placed in charge of a district of the coast, and the
                    detailed reports they make to the secretary form the basis of the valuable and

                <p>“All along the inner harbour, and in almost every street and quay, of the town of
                    Wick, as well as within many large inclosed yards and covered buildings, there
                    are numerous square boxes as big as ordinary-sized rooms, the containing sides,
                    however, being only two or three feet high. Into these huge troughs the herrings
                    are carried from the boats as soon as possible after they arrive. There they are
                    all tumbled in helter-skelter, in a long-continued stream of fish, until the
                    boats are emptied or the troughs are filled. Then come troops of sturdy females
                    of various ages and complexions, each armed with knife in hand, who range
                    themselves around the fishery chambers; the process of gutting immediately
                    commences, and is carried on with such ceaseless and untiring activity that the
                    unaccustomed eye can scarcely follow the quickness of their manipulations. One
                    woman will eviscerate about two dozen of herrings in a minute; and when nearly
                    2000 of them are working at that rate, with but brief intermission from early
                    morning till the close of day, the amount of disembowelment may be more easily
                    imagined than described. This important process is effected in the following
                    manner. The practitioner takes a herring in her left hand, its back lying in her
                    palm, and inserts the point of her knife into the near side, of the neck,
                    bearing well down upon the backbone, and making the weapon protrude a little
                    through the other side. She then gives the knife a turn, and pulling it outwards
                    and upwards, with an opposing pressure of the thumb, she draws forth in the
                    first place the gills, stomach, and intestinal canal, and tosses them into an
                    adjoining barrel. She then inserts the knife a second time, and by a peculiar
                    twitch removes what is called the crown gut or caecal appendages and liver.
                    There are thus two actions performed, each of which seems to occupy about a
                    second of time. This is the ordinary Scotch practice. The Dutch method is
                    somewhat different. They leave in the crown gut, and so with them a single pull
                    suffices to remove whatever is to be taken away. This latter method is partially
                    followed in this country, as being best adapted for the Continental market,
                    where it is believed that the crown gut has a powerful influence in improving
                    the flavour of the fish, and where the appearance of the herring is held to be
                    injured if it is removed. These fair gutters usually work together in little
                    companies of two or three, so that while one is filling a measure with her
                    gutted fish, another carries them off to be <hi rend="italic">roused,</hi> as it
                    is called, that is, cast into vats or barrels, then sprinkled with salt, then
                    more herrings and more salt, and next a brawny arm plunged among them far above
                    the elbow, thus mingling them together, and so on till the space is filled. They
                    may lie a longer or shorter time in this state, according to the supply of
                    labour at command, and the immediate necessities of gutting and rousing; but the
                    next usual step in the routine is for a third hand to remove those herrings from
                    the second vats or vessels, and re-salt and pack them carefully, every
                    successive row crossing at right angles that which precedes it. Herrings
                    intended for the foreign market are usually arranged with their backs downwards,
                    while those for the Irish market are preferred when packed flat, or more upon
                    their sides. Each row gets a fresh sprinkling of salt until the barrel is
                    filled. The head of the cask is then laid loosely on, the contents being allowed
                    to settle down, <hi rend="italic">or pine,</hi> as it is called, for a
                    time,—which they soon do so considerably as to admit of each cask receiving
                    another row or two, with additional salt, before being closed by the cooper. The
                    barrels should then be headed up, tightened in the hoops, laid upon their sides,
                    and placed under cover, so as to be shaded from the sun’s rays, which are
                    injurious to the fish. They should also be rolled half over every second or
                    third day, until they are bung-packed; which process, if the after intention is
                    to receive the official brand of the Board of Fisheries, must not be sooner
                    perforai ed than after the lapse of ten free days from the date of capture.” Sir

                    operations :—“When the pickle has been sufficiently poured off, a handful of
                    salt, if required, should be thrown around the inside of the barrels, and the
                    herrings should be pressed close to the inside of the casks, and additional
                    fish, of the same description and date of cure, should be packed in until the
                    barrel is properly filled; after which it should be flagged, headed, blown, and
                    tightened, and the curing marks scratched upon the sides. The barrel may then
                    have its pickle poured in, and be finally bunged up.”</p>
                <p>The cured herrings are separated into four classes:—“Full,” or fish having large
                    milt or roe—in fact, those which are nearly or quite ready to spawn;
                    “Maties,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Maties” is a
                    corruption of the Dutch <hi rend="italic">maatjes,</hi> the term applied to
                    heιτlngs in which the roe is small or undeveloped. Its signification,.however is

                    which it seemed might possibly refer to the small size of the unde veloped milt
                    or roe, as compared with the bulky proportions the full fish. But our inquiries
                    on the subject from authorities, both in England and the Netherlands, have
                    failed to elicit any definite explanation The Dutch separate their herrings into
                    three classes, as we do, according to the condition of the reproductive organs,
                    viz:—“Voll, full of roe; Maatjes, <hi rend="italic">with</hi> the roe un
                    developed; and “Ylen,” empty or shotten. <hi rend="italic">Maatjes</hi> are
                    generally fat fish., but herrings are in that condition only when the roe is
                    very small.</p><p>season advances, the fat is gradually absorbed and the fish
                    become <hi rend="italic">voll</hi> and when the spawn, then fully matured, is
                    deposited, the herrings are called <hi rend="italic">ylen,</hi> oι
                    empty.</p></note> or fat fish, in which the milt or roe is quite undeveloped;
                    “Spent,” or sh&lt;^∙tten, those which have recently spawned, and consequently
                    are in very poor condition, having neither the fat of the maties nor the roe of
                    the full fish; and “Mixed,” consisting of fish of all kinds, or unassorted. For
                    these four classes the Board of Fisheries gives distinct brands, denoting the
                    quality and description of fish in each barrel; but the crown full brand, given
                    only to “full” fish properly cured, is the one in special request. It denotes
                    the finest production of the system of the British white herring cure. Branding
                    is quite optional on the part of the curer; but in any case this method of
                    curing can only be carried on under inspection, and barrels of a particular size
                    must be used for packing the fish in. It is one of the anomalies of the system,
                    however, that although it is absolutely forbidden to use barrels of other than a
                    certain specified size, there is not the slightest restriction as to the quality
                    or condition of the fish to be packed in them, so long as the Government brand
                    is not desired for them. Any refuse fish may be cured and packed, but the barrel
                    must be of a certain size. The advantages or disadvantages of the branding
                    system have been often discussed, and it has been frequently condemned as
                    opposed to the general policy of making the sale of an article dependent on its
                    merits alone; it has been contended that the Government is not justified in
                    giving a certificate of the quality of cured herrings more than of any other
                    manufactured article, and in no other case would such a guarantee be given. To
                    this it is replied that there is a demand for “white herrings” in numerous and
                    distant European markets; that without the Government brand a barrel of herrings
                    would in some places rarely be sold unless the contents were first examined; and
                    that the disturbance and exposure of the fish would lessen their value when they
                    were ultimately unpacked at the end possibly of a distant journey. They may pass
                    through many hands before they finally reach the consumer, and each person would
                    be anxious to satisfy himself of their quality. There is no doubt that the brand
                    facilitates the sale under such circumstances, but at the same time it cannot be
                    disputed that thousands of barrels are sold on the Continent every year with no
                    other guarantee than that of the curer’s name. Up to the year 1859 no charge was
                    made for branding; but since then a fee of fourpenceper barrel has been paid,
                    and the proceeds practically count against the expense of the board. It was
                    believed in some quarters that the alleged value of the brand was really not so
                    great as to make the curers willing to pay for it, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n269/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0269-0260"/> and consequently nie system might be quietly got
                    rid of by the curers ceasing to make use of it. The result has been precisely
                    the reverse; and the argument against the continuance of branding on the ground
                    of the expenses in connexion with it has been considerably weakened by the fact
                    that the system is now to a large extent self-supporting.</p>

                <p>On the west coast of Scotland the herring fishery is also of great importance,
                    and, as we have previously mentioned, it begins earlier than that on the eastern
                    side. There is a good deal of curing in the Stornoway district, but the brand is
                    in little favour. It is alleged that the western fish, especially those caught
                    early in the season, are more delicate than those taken on the east coast, and
                    will not bear the close packing requisite for ensuring the proper weight in each
                    barrel if it is to receive the brand. The real explanation is doubtless that the
                    curers are anxious to catch the market as soon as possible, and will not allow
                    the number of days for the fish to be in pickle before sending them away that is
                    necessary according to the branding regulations. These early cured fish are
                    maties or fat herrings, and are chiefly sent to the Russian market. A very large
                    quantity of the western fish caught later in the season is, however, sent to
                    market in the fresh state; they are sprinkled with salt and loosely packed in
                    barrels, and quickly taken by special steamers tc Glasgow and to Liverpool.
                    These fish are given under the head of “bulk” in the published returns by the
                    Fi⅛ery Board, and, being slightly salted, are included among the “cured fish,’’
                    although not with those which have been gutted and have gone through the regular
                    preparation for export. On arrival at the home markets they may be readily sold
                    as fresh herrings, after the sprinkling of salt has been washed off.</p>
                <p>It is on the western coast that the question of a close time for herrings has
                    been so much discussed, and unfortunately in 1860 an Act (23 and24Vict. c. 92)
                    was passed by whichaclose time was established there. The bill was brought in at
                    the instance of some of the curers at Glasgow and other places, principally on
                    the west coast. By this Act herring fishing was entirely prohibited from the 1st
                    of January to the 31st of May on any part of the coast between Ardnaraurchan
                    Point and the Mull of Galloway on the south, and from the 1st of January to the
                    20th of May between Ardnamurchan and Cape Wrath on the North. Not a herring was
                    allowed to be taken during the close season for the purpose of sale, or to be
                    used as bait, or to keep the fishermen from starvation; and it appears that this
                    cruel prohibition was to be enforced that the markets might not be supplied with
                    fish which were not of the best quality, but yet were sufficiently good to
                    command an easy sale, and therefore to lower the prices the curers would
                    otherwise have obtained from the regular summer fishery. It was professed that
                    the early fishing broke up the shoals before they entered the Minch, and
                    therefore diminished the supply iu June and July; and it was said that many of
                    the fish caught between January and May were unwholesome and unfit for food. But
                    an inquiry into all the circumstances of the case clearly showed that the
                    promoters of the Act for establishing close time were the curers alone, who held
                    meetings of their own body, and, without consulting the fishermen, pressed
                    forward a measure which sacrificed every one s interest to their own. It was one
                    of the most unhappy episodes in the history of the Scotch fisheries; but
                    fortunately the effects of the close time were soon made known, and after a
                    short experience it was found impossible to enforce a law which brought misery
                    and starvation to the homes of a coast population, many of whom previously could
                    only manage to obtain a bare subsistence by hard and unremitting toil. The law
                    remained practically in abeyance for a time, and no prosecutions for infringing
                    it were carried on pending the result of the report of the royal commission in
                    1862 on herring trawling. In 1864 this question of close time came also before
                    the royal commission for inquiring into the condition of the sea fisheries
                    generally; and such overwhelming evidence of the evil effects of the close time
                    was brought before the commissioners that, in anticipation of their complete
                    report, they did not hesitate to bring the subject before the Government, with
                    the view to some relief being given before the question could be finally
                    disposed off. This resulted in instructions being given not to enforce the law;
                    aud in the following session of parliament a bill was passed by which close time
                    was entirely abolished north of Ardnamurchan Point. This included all the inner
                    and outer Hebrides, where the restriction h- <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi>.d
                    been so severely felt. South of that part of the coast close time was continued
                    as before, with the exception of January, which became free to the fishermen. By
                    subsequent legislation (the Sea Fisheries Act, 1868) this close time has been
                    done away with beyond the three mile limit, so that at the present time heιτing
                    fishing is entirely free everywhere around the British Islands except within
                    three miles of that part of the coast of Scotland which lies between
                    Ardnamurchan Point and the Mull of Galloway; and the difficulties of enforcing
                    the law there are so great that the close time has now only a nominal existence.
                    Another commission which has been recently engaged in inquiring into the state
                    of the herring fisheries of Scotland has also reported against the utility of
                    close time.</p>
                <p>The fisheries of the west coast of Scotland have unfortunately given rise to much
                    bitter feeling among those who are interested in them, either as fishermen or
                    curers, and nothing has caused so much social disturbance as the quarrels
                    between the drift-fishermen and those who have been using the sean-net, or, as
                    it is called in Scotland, the “trawl,” for catching herrings. The localities in
                    which these disputes have specially taken place are Loch Fyne and the Kyles of
                    Bute, but more particularly in the former long famous waters. We have already
                    described the general mode of working the sean, when speaking of the English
                    fisheries, and we will only now repeat that this method of fishing consists in
                    shooting a long sheet of netting in a semicircle, both ends of which are most
                    commonly hauled on shore until the whole net with the inclosed fish is landed;
                    but sometimes a boat is used as the fixed point at which the ends of the net are
                    made to meet, and into which the net is hauled as before. In the former case the
                    net is used as a ground-sean, in the latter as a circle-net. Both are equally
                    objected to by the drift fishermen, who, until about the year 1838, had fished
                    Loch Fyne according to the old established method. The trawl was then
                    introduced, and on several occasions a gunboat has been required to keep order
                    between the fishermen when both modes of fishing were being carried on. Loch
                    Fyne, as we have said, was the special scene of these disputes, and one common
                    complaint by the drift fishermen was that the trawls intercepted the fish at the
                    entrance to the loch, and broke up the shoals, so that the herrings did not find
                    their way to the upper water, where it was alleged there always used to be
                    plenty of fish at the proper season. There were complaints also that fish of all
                    sizes were caught by the trawl, those which were too small to be stopped by the
                    drift nets and those too large to be meshed in them—the “mother fish,” as some
                    of the fishermen called them. Then it was said that the trawlers sometimes made
                    such enormous hauls that only a portion of the catch could be saved, and,
                    besides other sins laid to their charge, it was finally stated as the crowning
                    offence— one that really explained the principal opposition to the trawlers—
                    that they lowered the price of herrings to a considerable extent by the large
                    supplies they could with little expenditure of time and trouble sometimes throw
                    into the market, and so prevented the driftmen from obtaining the better prices
                    they had commonly got from their smaller catches.</p>
                <p>The result of these several complaints was that in 1851 an Act (14 and 15 Vict.
                    c. 26) was passed to put an end to trawling for herrings on the coast of
                    Scotland; but that not proving effective, more stringent measures were brought
                    to bear on the fishermen in 1860 (23 and 24 Vict. c. 92) and 1861 (24 and 25
                    Vict. c. 72), and fishing with the trawl was completely suppressed. So strong a
                    feeling existed, however, among a large body of the fishermen and others that
                    the complaints against trawling were unjust, and. the prohibition injurious to
                    the interests of the public as well as to the fishermen immediately affected by
                    it, that in 1862 a royal commission was appointed especially to inquire into the
                    subject; and in 1864 the question was independently considered by two of the
                    members of the general Sea Fisheries Commission, the third commissioner being
                    purposely absent from the second inquiry, as he had taken part in the
                    proceedings of the previous one. The conclusions arrived at by the two
                    commissions, after hearing a great deal of evidence from both sets of fishermen,
                    were decidedly adverse to the opponents of trawling, and were to the effect that
                    the herring fishery in Loch Fyne had suffered no diminution by that method of
                    working; on the contrary, it had really been progressive, when the periods of
                    comparison were made sufficiently long to correct the annual fluctuations, which
                    were always considerable in this as in all other herring fisheries. They

                    trawling was destroying the fishery, have, when examined, no application to the
                    question, as an equal number of years of quite as bad fishing are found in every
                    decennial period before the system of trawling had been discovered Trawling for
                    her ring has been an important means of cheapening fish to the consumer, by the
                    large and sudden takes, and has thrown into the market an abundant supply of
                    wholesome fresh fish at prices which enable the poor to enjoy them without
                    having to come into competition with the curer. It is this circumstance which,
                    in our opinion, has produced the demand for repressive legislation, for the
                    gains of the drift-net fishermen are much affected by the sudden and <pb

                    less capital and with a more productivo kind of labour, is able to undersell the
                    drift fishermen, and to derange the market for the curcrs.”</p>
                <p>It happened that in 1860, the last year of trawling before its complete
                    suppression, the fishing in Loch Fync was the largest ever known there; in 1861
                    it fell oil <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>, but in 1862 it was again very large,
                    and that was followed by fluctuations as before, although the drift fishermen
                    then had it all their own way. The recommendations of the two commissions were
                    embodied in an Act (30 and 31 Viet, c. 52) passed in 1867, by which any kind of
                    herring net with what was then the legal mesh was permitted, and trawls so
                    constructed again came into use. By the Sea Fisheries Act, 1868, all
                    restrictions as to the size of mesh were done away, but as that Act only applies
                    to fishing beyond the three mile limit, the Act of 1867 still regulates the
                    fislιing In Loch Fyne. It chanced that from 1868 to 1874 the produce of this
                    loch gradually fell oil’ from 46,813 barrels to 6934 barrels; the herrings did
                    not go to the upper waters of the loch in the same numbers as before, and we
                    need hardly say that the drift fishermen accounted for it mainly by the fact
                    that trawling had again been permitted. The drift fishermen had little belief in
                    the two commissions which had reported that trawling had done no harm; but in
                    1874, when matters were at their worst, three Scotch gentlemen of position, who
                    were likely to command the confidence of the fishermen, formed themselves into a
                    private committee to inquire into the causes of the failure in Loch Fyne. The
                    result as regards the effects of trawling in keeping away the herrings may be
                    best given in their own words :—“The fact cannot be explained away that the fish
                    seem to be at present disinclined to enter other narrow waters where trawling is
                    unknown.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Report of
                    these gentlemen is given 'in full and ably discussed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annual Report</hi> for 1875 of the Board of Fisheries.</p></note> The idea,
                    however, that the opinions of these gentlemen would be received with respect has
                    proved to be a mistaken one; and the fact that three inquiries had resulted in
                    the same conclusions seemed only to make these fishermen the more determined to
                    clamour against trawling. In 1877 a fourth commission was appointed; its object
                    was to examine into the condition of the Scotch herring fisheries generally, and
                    the state of the Loch Fyne fisheries was therefore once more investigated. Yet,
                    notwithstanding that the produce of this loch had increased from 6934 barrels in
                    1874 to 15,097 in 1875, and to 34,471 in 1876, with a further increase, in 1877,
                    so far as the returns had been made up at the time, all the old statements were
                    again brought forward by the drift men. But the facts against them appear to
                    have been too strong, and this last commission, like the three previous ones,
                    has declined to recommend that trawling should be suppressed.</p>
                <p>There is abundant evidence in the records for a great number of years that the
                    annual produce of Loch Fyne has been subject to large fluctuations. But if we
                    compare successive periods of ten years each we shall find that not only are the
                    average total catches in recent years far in excess of those in earlier times,
                    but the average for each boat has very largely increased. The following official
                    record for periods of ten years is very instructive :—</p>

                <p>The average for the ten years 1857-1866 was much raised by the enormous catch of
                    79,893 barrels in 1862, whilst the small number of 6934 barrels only being taken
                    in 1874 has materially lowered the average for the last ten years.</p>
                <p>If we now look at the produce of the fishery on the whole west coast of Scotland
                    for the last thirty years, taking the average in periods of ten years as before,

                <p>The quantities here given are in barrels, as usual; and the figures in this and
                    the preceding return are taken from the statistics carefully prepared by Mr
                    George Reiach, assistant inspector under the Board of Fisheries, and furnished
                    by him to the commission in 1877. He had been 27 years in the service of the
                    board, and for the last 14 years the whole of the west coast fisheries had been
                    under his inspection.</p>
                <p>There is nothing that enables us better to understand the actual condition of a
                    fluctuating industry like our sea fisheries than accurate records of its annual
                    produce. In this respect Scotland, owing to the careful labours of h&lt; ’ r
                    Board of Fisheries, is in α far more fortunate position than either England or
                    Ireland; and the following tables taken from the last report of the Fishery
                    Board will readily show, by the comparison of any two selected series of years,
                    the gradually increasing importance of the Scotch herring fishery,
                    notwithstanding the fluctuations arising from unfavourable weather and other
                    natural causes. We may add that considerable quantities of herrings which are
                    sold in the local markets and consumed whilst quite fresh, do not appear iu the
                    board’s returns, but those which arc slightly salted for transit by ship to the
                    great markets are so included. The quantities are in barrels, as before.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Garvie</hi><hi rend="italic">or Sprat Fishing.—</hi> This is
                    carried on to some extent at the upper end of the Firth of Forth, and in the
                    Beauly Firth. In the former locality the garvies are caught by means of trawls
                    (seans), and the principal fishing is on the western side of Inchgarvie. In the
                    Beauly Firth drift-nets are used, and only fish of fair size are taken.
                    Complaints have long been made in both places of the capture of young herrings
                    with the garvies, and the herring fishers have done their best to get the garvie
                    fishery put a etop to; but fortunately they have not succeeded, for this fishery
                    gives profitable employment to a good many fishermen, and there is not a
                    particle of proof that the herring fishing farther out has suffered from the
                    occasional capture of young herrings with the garvies. Sprats are not in much
                    demand in the Scotch markets, and almost all that are taken in the localities
                    mentioned are sent by rail to London. We are sorry to say that the old fallacy
                    of the sprat being nothing but a young herring still prevails among some of the
                    fishermen and curers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Line Fisheries.—</hi> The capture of cod, haddock, ling, and
                    saithe or coalfish is general around the coast of Scotland; and the tusk or
                    torsk, a northern species of the cod family, aud in shape like a short-bodied
                    ling, is taken in some numbers at the Shetlands, and a few at the outer
                    Hebrides. Long lines are in use for haddock, ling, and tusk, and also for cod on
                    many parts of the coast; but at the Shetlands hand lines are employed for cod
                    and saithe, and also at Faroe and Iceland. At Newhaven, Eyemouth, and other
                    places in the neighbourhood in the Firth of Forth, two sizes of long line are
                    regularly worked in the proper season. The smaller or haddock lines have from
                    800 to 1000 hooks each, or even more, on snoods 14 inches long and 2⅜ feet
                    apart, and mussels and lug worms are used as bait. Some little interest is
                    attached to the state of this fishery, as it is an important one in ScQtland,
                    and a few years ago it was said to have fallen off very much. But it appears
                    there are still plenty of haddocks on the coast, and now that larger and decked
                    boats are used, and the fishermen are consequently more independent of weather,
                    very large takes are not uncommon. In one week in January 1876 the Eyemouth
                    boats were at sea six times, and landed 20,000 stones of haddocks, which sold at
                    2s. per stone, producing in that short period no less than £2000. The season
                    lasts here from October to April, and the average gain for the season by each
                    boat usually ranges from £400 to £600. There is a considerable trade in smoked
                    haddocks, particularly from Eyemouth, and the curing consists in soaking the
                    fish in pickle for half an hour, and then hanging them for about four hours in
                    some hardwood smoke. The village of Findon, between Stonehaven and Aberdeen, has
                    long been famous for first preparing the fish known as “Finnan haddies.” Their
                    peculiar flavour, which has made them so popular, arises from their being hung
                    in peat smoke. They are cured in the cottages, and some little variation in the
                    time in pickle and in smoke is made according to the time they are intended to
                    keep. This manufacture is now carried on at many places besides Findon. The cod
                    or “great lines” are of the same description as those used for haddock fishing,
                    but have longer snoods, and the hooks farther apart. It is unnecessary to speak
                    of the manner in which these long-lines are worked, as we have fully described
                    it in our notice of the North Sea cod fishery. A vast quantity of line fish is
                    sent to the fresh market, but the great importance of this Scotch fishery is due
                    to the large extent to which curing operations are carried on, and more
                    especially in the distant districts such as the Shetlands and the outer
                    Hebrides.</p>
                <p>Curing is performed in two ways—dry and in pickle. The latter method consists in
                    packing the fish, after they have been split open, gutted, and part of the
                    backbone and the head removed, with layers of salt in barrels; but when to be
                    cured dried, these fish, perhaps caught as far off as the Faroe Islands or
                    Iceland, and landed at the Shetlands, are unpacked, washed, and spread out
                    either on stages or on the beach, and exposed for some days to the air and sun,
                    due attention being given to them to ensure their being evenly dried. When
                    thoroughly cured, they are kept in a cool dry place, until wanted for shipment.
                    The fish caught near the coast are salted as soon as landed, and afterwards
                    treated as the others. The produce of the Shetland fishery is large in itself;
                    but the return of fish cured in those islands is greatly increased by the
                    supplies of fish in pickle landed there for curing by the Grimsby and Shetland
                    smacks, which go every year to Faroe, Iceland, and other more or less distant
                    fishing grounds.</p>
                <p>A great deal of the cod and some of the ling go to the Spanish markets, and a
                    little to Australia; but the ling and tusk are chiefly sent to Dublin, Glasgow,
                    and Leith, and the saithe to Belfast, Leith, and Dundee.</p>

                    therefore, appear for 1852 in the tables. The collection of Returns for England
                    ceased from the 5th of January 1850, when also the Punching and Branding of Cod
                    and Ling came to an end; and there were no Returns for the Isle of Man after
                    January 1869.</p>

                <p>The difficulty in ascertaining the precise number of boats and fishermen on some
                    of the wilder parts of the coast is so great, however, notwithstanding the
                    important fact that the coastguard is employed in collecting the information,
                    that, as the inspectors tell us, the returns even at the present time cannot be
                    taken as quite trustworthy. There was, however, an apparent increase of 46 craft
                    and 585 fishermen, and this seemed certainly the most encouraging report that
                    had reached us for many years. But an analysis of the return shows that this
                    increase is more apparent than real. The inspectors conveniently divide the
                    boats with their crews into three classes independently of tonnage, and this
                    plan enables us in some measure to understand who are included under the head of
                    fishermen. The divisions come under the following heads, and we give the returns
                    for 1875 and 1876 for the sake of comparison :—</p>

                <p>The total number of boats and men in 1876 was—boats 5965, and fishermen 23,693,
                    being a slight increase in both over the previous year. But there is a falling
                    off in the number of regular fishermen, and the increase is only in those who
                    devote part of their time to fishing. We have it on the authority of the
                    inspectors that the men in the third division, or occasional fishermen, are not
                    employed in that occupation on an average for more than one month in the year,
                    and yet we find the boats in this division form more than two-thirds, and the
                    men nearly the same proportion, of the total numbers in Ireland.</p>
                <p>The history of the Irish fisheries shows that great fluctuations have taken place
                    at various times, but the last great decline undoubtedly dates from the period
                    of the famine in 1846, and those who have been long acquainted with the west
                    coast fishermen in particular believe that their present depressed state is
                    entirely the result of that disastrous time. Local assistance has been given
                    time after time with only a temporary improvement; and now the experiment is
                    being tried of advancing money from the Irish Reproductive Loan Fund to enable
                    the fishermen to provide the necessary gear for fishing. The applications for
                    loans have been, as was expected, far in excess of the amount available for the
                    purpose, and in very many cases no security could be obtained that the money
                    would be expended in the manner proposed. No doubt some good will be done by
                    these loans, but much lasting advantage is not to be expected from the system.
                    Emigration has carried off thousands from the country, and mainly from the west
                    coast, where, however, the majority of the fishermen were little more so than in
                    name, and fishing was never allowed to interfere with sea-weed cutting, farming,
                    and any chance occupation. There is this to be said, however, that on very many
                    parts of the west coast of Ireland the weather is frequently so bad, and the
                    seas so stormy that fishing cannot be carried on with any regularity; and when
                    favourable times arrive, the neglected boats and fishing gear are too often
                    unfit for use. On the east and south coasts things are in a better condition;
                    important fisheries for herrings and mackerel in their seasons there provide
                    profitable employment not only for Irish fishermen, but for large numbers of
                    Cornish, Scotch, and Manx fishing boats, which until the last year or two have
                    far outnumbered the native craft. There is plenty of fish to be caught on the
                    Irish coasts; and the influence of the strangers is telling on many of the Irish
                    fishermen, and leading them to improvement in their boats and all that relates
                    to carrying on their work.</p>
                <p>The principal methods of fishing in Irish waters are trawling, drift-fishing, and
                    line fishing; there is also a little done with seans and trammels.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trawling.—</hi> Dublin is the headquarters of the deep-sea
                    trawlers, and possesses a fleet of about 50 smacks, ranging from 30 to 50 tons,
                    and working chiefly from that station. Deep-sea trawlers were first used from
                    Dublin in 1818, when, as previously mentioned, some Brixham boats and fishermen
                    were brought over. The fishing was found to be profitable, and the fleet of
                    smacks was gradually increased until it reached its present size. The trawlers
                    work throughout the year when they can get sufficient hands, but the light
                    summer weather is not very suitable for them; and the attractions of the herring
                    fishery and profitable employment on board yachts take away a great many men for
                    several weeks from their ordinary occupation. The principal trawling grounds lie
                    within a triangular space between Dublin and Dundrum Bays and the Isle of Man,
                    and consist of a number of patches differing in shape and extent, which are
                    worked over, either on the inner or outer grounds, according to the season. The
                    Isle of Man ground, lying in deep water, and a favourite place for soles, is
                    usually fished from March to July. In January there is a partial migration of
                    the trawlers to the south of Ireland, and a very productive fishing place known
                    as the Saltee ground, and about south-west from the Saltee lightship, near
                    Waterford, is worked by them with advantage. Farther out at sea, at a distance
                    of 30 or 40 miles from the land, and without any very clearly defined limits, is
                    what has long been spoken of as the Nymph Bank.<note anchored="true"

                    Domestic Fisheries,</hi> p. 4 (1818).</p></note> Extraordinary results have been
                    anticipated from fishing this ground, and no doubt there is plenty of fish upon
                    it; but there are difficulties in working it properly, partly on account of many
                    scattered rocks which interfere with trawling on it generally, and partly
                    because of a want of organization for bringing in the fish and sending them to
                    market. For a long time the greatest difficulty encountered was from the local
                    fishermen, who would not work in a deep-sea trawler, or allow one to use her
                    nets anywhere within the headlands, although the weather was too bad to go
                    outside. Companies have been formed for trawling from Waterford harbour, but the
                    determined hostility of many of the native fishermen, and the fears of others in
                    consequence, have done more to discourage trawling there on a large scale than
                    anything else. English crews have been tried, but it is not surprising that they
                    should be unwilling to remain in a locality where the feeling against them was
                    so strong. Matters seem to have improved of late, but a good deal of enterprise
                    is needed to carry on the fishing in the way in which it might be done. Trawling
                    is worked in the shoaler parts of Waterford harbour by the local fishermen; and
                    the complaint made by them that the large trawlers did so much mischief in
                    destroying the young fry, whilst the small boats habitually worked where the
                    young fish were most abundant, was not too absurd to be listened to by the
                    inspecting commissioner of fisheries a few years ago. A bye-law was therefore
                    established (probably with the object of preserving the peace) to keep the large
                    trawlers beyond a certain depth of water, and the small ones then had it all
                    their own way inside. Under <pb break="no"

                    the tendency is happily to remove restrictions to fishing rather than to make
                    them; and the results of a systematic search for spawn in the Irish bays are
                    reported to have been such as to refute completely the charges brought against
                    the trawlers of destroying it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Drift Fishing.—</hi> Two of the most important fisheries in
                    Ireland arc those for herrings and mackerel. That for herrings is carried on
                    more or less on many parts of the coast, but its chief seat is in the Irish
                    Channel, with Howth, the northern point of Dublin Bay, and Ardglass, opposite
                    the Isle of Man, for its headquarters. The fishery begins at the end of May or
                    beginning of June, and lasts well into September, or in some parts into October.
                    By July it is in full work, and the two stations above mentioned are then the
                    scene of unusual life and activity, for a very large proportion of the fish
                    landed there is at once packed and sent off fresh to the English and Scotch
                    markets. A little curing is done at Howth, but it better answers the purpose of
                    the Irish people to send their own fish fresh to market, and to import cured
                    fish from Scotland. The question of introducing the branding system into Ireland
                    has recently been considered by the inspectors of fisheries, and inquiries were
                    held on various parts of the coast in order to find out the general feeling
                    about it. The inspectors say, however, in their report for 1876 — “With regard
                    to branding, we felt it our duty to report that under existing circumstances we
                    were unable to recommend extension of the system to Ireland—there being,
                    firstly, no <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> desire for it existing amongst the
                    Irish fishermen or curers; and, secondly, that the fish caught in. Ireland and
                    sold fresh realized a much higher price to the captors than the price received
                    by the fishermen in Scotland and cured for the foreign markets, and that no
                    material benefit would therefore really be derived from such extension.”</p>
                <p>Ireland is in fact well off in having a market across the channel for any
                    quantity of fresh fish she may send over; and a large proportion of the herrings
                    and trawl fish caught on the east coast, and almost all the mackerel taken in
                    the Kinsale fishery are at once despatched there. The drift fisheries are, as
                    before mentioned, by no means monopolized by the Irish fishermen, but are taken
                    part in by a large number of strangers. The inspectors in their report for 1876
                    tell us that “the highest number of boats of each country at Howth during the
                    season was—Cornish 206, Irish 209, Scotch 224, Manx 133. At Ardglass the highest
                    average number that fished during one day (23d July) was−Scotch 140, Manx 20,
                    Irish 42, Cornish, 19.” These figures show a slight increase in the Irish boats
                    over those in previous years. The east coast fishermen have of late shown many
                    signs of improvement; and the better boats and steady industry of the Manx,
                    Scotch, and Cornish fishermen have not been without their use as examples of how
                    to work the fisheries with profit.</p>
                <p>Kinsale has in recent years come into notice as the great station for the
                    mackerel fishery. This fishing begins early in March and goes on till about the
                    end of June, thus immediately preceding the herring season. In 1876 there were
                    217 English and Manx boats, 13 Scotch, and 133 Irish engaged in this fishery,
                    besides more than 60 large French luggers, the last-mentioned boats salting
                    their fish as soon as caught, and returning home when they have made their
                    cargo. The mackerel fishery is a very important one for Kinsale, as it gives
                    employment, not only to the fishermen, but to numerous other persons of various
                    descriptions. The mackerel are almost all packed in ice and sent to England.
                    During the season of 1876 there were 7 steamers and 11 cutters in this carrying
                    trade,—the former at a monthly expense of £350 to £400 for each vessel, besides
                    paying all dues, coals, and pilotage: and 4400 tons of ice were imported solely
                    for the package of the fish. The mackerel arc packed in boxes containing a
                    “hundred,” or six score of fish in each, and the official returns show a total
                    capture of 139,083 boxes full in the season of 1876. The prices ranged from 12s.
                    to £5 per box in the course of the regular season; but some boats made a large
                    catch afterwards in July, when there was little demand for the fish, and prices
                    then went as low as 3s. per 100.</p>
                <p>The following is a summary of the quantity of herrings, mackerel, and cod
                    exported from Ireland to the undermentioned places in England during 1876 :—</p>

                <p>It will be seen from the above figures that the Irish fisheries are by no means
                    wanting in importance, and it is much to be regretted that the fishermen of the
                    country do not take a larger share in working them. The produce of the deep-sea
                    trawl fishery is also very valuable, but we can give no return of the
                    considerable quantity of trawl-fish sent to England.</p>
                <p>It has been a matter of surprise to many that no systematic attempt has been made
                    to catch the large shoals of pilchards which annually visit the south coast of
                    Ireland. The prejudice of the Irish fishermen against pilchards has been so
                    great as to almost dishearten the inspectors in their repeated endeavours to
                    bring this fishery into notice. Whilst the great Cornish sean fisheries have
                    been languishing because the shoals of pilchards have not come into the bays
                    within reach of the nets, they have been in plenty on parts of the Irish coast.
                    One of the inspectors (Mr Brady) has been untiring in his exertions to procure
                    every kind of information about the catching and curing of pilchards in the
                    Cornish fashion, in the hope of its leading to the establishment of curing
                    stations in Ireland, but little progress has yet been made. The inspectors,
                    however, continue to be hopeful in the matter, and in their report for 1876 they
                    say:—“No efforts have yet been made to cure for the Continental markets, but
                    some have been cured for home consumption on various parts of the coast. By
                    degrees this fish is being regarded with more favour by the country people, and
                    if they continue to frequent our coast as they have now done for some years,
                    there is little doubt but that a considerable trade will result, as they come
                    more into favour.”</p>
                <p>We have now referred to all the important Irish sea fisheries. It may be added
                    that line-fishing is more or less general around the coast, and is perhaps more
                    systematically attempted on the north and west sides than elsewhere.</p>

                    Crab and Lobster Fisheries,</hi> p. ii. (1877).</p></note> The English markets
                    are mainly supplied from Cornwall and the south coast of England, from the
                    Orkneys and Hebrides in Scotland, and from the west coast of Ireland. Besides
                    these about 200,000 come from France, the fishery for them being in the
                    neighbourhood of Cherbourg, and a few from Sweden. The means adopted for
                    catching lobsters and crabs in the British Islands are either circular
                    basketwork “pots” with a mouse-trap entrance at the top, or cages covered with
                    netting and with one or two entrances as in the pots. These cages are commonly
                    called “creels.” Crabs are taken in most abundance in the west and south of
                    England, and more or less generally on the cast coast, and in Scotland aud
                    Ireland, those from parts of Devon and Cornwall being the finest which are sent
                    to market. There is a general disposition on the part of the fishermen to submit
                    to some law limiting the size of both crabs and lobsters to be offered for sale,
                    so as to put a stop to the falling off in these fisheries, which is apparent on
                    some parts of the coast. A close time is objected to, as no month in the year is
                    generally suitable, and “berried” lobsters are so valuable for the market that
                    if they had to be returned to the sea the fishermen would lose a great part of
                    their present profits. A limit to the size allowed to bo sold seems therefore to
                    be the best means of protecting these fisheries; and such a law is now enforced
                    on the coast of Norfolk.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shrimp and Prawn Fisheries.—</hi> The most important of these
                    fisheries are carried on in the estuary of the Thames, Pegwell Bay near
                    Ramsgate, and Morecambe Bay on the Lancashire coast, but they are more or less
                    general wherever suitable ground is met with. Leigh is the headquarters of the
                    Thames shrimpers. They fish with a net mounted very much like a beam-trawl, but
                    having a long, straight piece of wood at the lower part of the mouth to work
                    over the ground instead of the ordinary ground-rope. This is in fact like the
                    common form of hand-shrimping net, but so fitted as to bo towed instead of
                    pushed. Ordinary trawls are used for prawns or “red shrimps,” and in some other
                    places for true shrimps. The supply of shrimps from Leigh sometimes amounts to
                    2000 gallons in a day.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shellfish:—Oysters, Mussels, Whelks, Periwinkles.—</hi> The
                    oyster fisheries of the British Islands have been in a failing condition for
                    some few years past, owing to a deficiency of spat, the cause of which has been
                    the subject of active controversy, not only between rival theorists, but also
                    among practical fishermen. Over-fishing has been regarded by many as the main
                    cause of the decrease, and it may possibly have helped to make matters worse
                    than they would otherwise have been; but it is difficult to explain in this
                    manner the fact that, in England, Scotland, and Ireland, there has been a
                    general failure of spat for some years past, on all kinds of ground and under
                    every condition, in public and private beds, and whether they have been
                    carefully protected, as in the case of old established private companies, or
                    left to the working of the general public, except during a definite close time,
                    more or less enforced. In Ireland, where there are regulations for close time,
                    and restrictions as to the size of oysters allowed to be sold, and where in some
                    cases all fishing has been stopped for two or three years, the decrease of
                    oysters has been as decided as in England or Scotland; and Mr Blake, until
                    recently one of the inspectors of Irish fisheries, and chairman of the oyster
                    commission in 1868, stated in his evidence given before the select committee of
                    the House of Com mons in 1876 that the decline in the oyster fisheries was due
                    to the bad spatting seasons, and to the great increase of dredging; “but if the
                    spatting went on as it formerly did, the amount of dredging would not be of much
                    importance.”</p>
                <p>The bulk of English supplies is obtained from the oyster beds of private
                    companies, of which the Whitstable company is the most ancient, having worked
                    from time immemorial on their present ground on the south shore of the entrance
                    to the Thames. In 1793 they purchased from the lord of the manor the exclusive
                    right of fishing there. The company is a corporation of fishermen governed by
                    elected members of their own body. The men are paid for the daily work done by
                    them, and each member of the company also receives his share of the profits on
                    the sale of the oysters. A great part of their employment, besides dredging aud
                    keeping their own ground clean and free from vermin, consists in dredging for
                    spat in the public portion of the river for the purpose of laying it down on
                    their own beds. A general failure of spat, such as there has been in recent
                    years, is therefore not only felt by them on their own limited ground, Put they
                    suffer from the scarcity in what may be called their reserves. The Whitstable
                    company is, however, only one among many which occupy the shores of the Thames
                    estuary and the small rivers which flow into it. The oysters thus laid-down or
                    bred in these situations become remarkable for the thinness of their shells, and
                    the good flavour and comparatively large size of their contents, and are what
                    are known as “natives.” There are numerous companies or individual proprietors
                    engaged in cultivating oysters on various parts of the coasts, but at the
                    present time they are, we believe, all more or less suffering from deficiency of
                    spat. Channel or deep-sea oysters arc generally large and coarse, and do not
                    fetch more than one tenth of the price given for the more delicate “natives.”
                    Attempts at the artificial cultivation of oysters have not met with much
                    success.</p>

                    request for food among the lower classes, are in especial demand for the
                    purposes of fish-bait, and tho value of mussels in this respect has recently led
                    to a more careful protection of the older banks, and some attempts at the
                    cultivation of new ones. Whelks are particularly valuable in the North Sea cod
                    fishery, and a number of vessels from Grimsby are regularly engaged in fishing
                    for them. Their mode of catching them is by means of shallow hoop-nets baited
                    with refuse fish, and sunk to the bottom on suitable ground; in these the whelks
                    collect in large numbers, and are caught without any difficulty. A considerable
                    supply is also obtained from the oyster dredgers; and at the mouth of the Thames
                    they are caught largely by using “trots” or buffers—long-lines of small
                    dimensions; but instead of having baited hooks, they have common small
                    shore-crabs threaded on the snoods, about twenty on each; these are seized by
                    the whelks and so firmly held whilst being devoured that the line may easily be
                    hauled in without disturbing the numbers found on every snood. <hi rend="italic"

                    including the long-famous cod fishery of Newfoundland. The fisheries of the
                    Dominion of Canada are chiefly carried on with open boats, and consequently are
                    to a great extent, though subject to some variation, what may be called shore
                    fisheries. The proportion, as given by Professor Hind, of the shore fisheries to
                    the deep-sea fisheries, in which decked vessels are employed, is 4 <hi

                    fishing industry of the Dominion is pursued in coastal waters, and much of it
                    rarely extends beyond the limit of three marine miles from the coast line.” The

                <p>In the Newfoundland fisheries boats and vessels are also used, but the deep-sea
                    fishery is scarcely distinct from that pursued in coastal waters, or within the
                    three-mile limit from the shore. The total number of boats employed at
                    Newfoundland in 1874 -was 18,611, and the number of persons engaged in catching
                    and curing fish 45,854, while the number of vessels was 1197, with an aggregate
                    of 61.551 tons, and manned by 8394 fishermen sailors. These vessels, however,
                    include the large number used for sealing. The number of “fishing rooms” or
                    portions of the shore set apart for the curing and storing of fish was 8902 in
                    the same year. The numbers of fishing craft, men, and fishing rooms in 1874
                    showed a considerable increase over those for 1869. Professor Hind, in speaking
                    of the large proportion of inshore fishing, says :—“The changeable character of
                    the weather on the British American coast, the sudden and unexpected occurrence
                    of fogs, the variations of currents produced by tides, the long experience of
                    the dangers attending fishing in open boats some distance from the land, the
                    pecuniary resources of the fishermen, conjointly with the abundant fish
                    resources of the coastal waters, have combined to limit the industry of the
                    British American fishermen in a great measure to the immediate vicinity of the
                    shore line, and within easy reach of harbours. This is particularly the case
                    with Newfoundland.” This inshore fishery, however, depends for its success on
                    the supply of bait fishes, especially the capelan and herring; and, as in every
                    kind of fishery, there are years when migratory fish, those which more or less
                    change their quarters at particular seasons, vary in abundance in certain
                    localities, and sometimes forsake one part of a coast and go to another, so the
                    important fisheries dependent on these movements are subject to fluctuations.
                    The cod, in fact, there follow the bait-fishes precisely as, on the English
                    coast, the cod and coalfish become most numerous near the land when the shoals
                    of herrings come closest in. On the coasts of British North America the fishing
                    interest is almost entirely concerned with species whose natural habitat is in
                    cold waters; and as an immense area of fishing water is there influenced by the
                    Labrador current, it is not surprising that cod, holibut, herring, mackerel, and
                    others should be found in abundance on these coasts. The mackerel has also an
                    extensive range south along the coast of the United States; but the Labrador
                    current is little felt south of Cape Cod, its influence being there almost
                    destroyed by the Gulf Stream. The really cold-water species are therefore mainly
                    found in the Dominion seas; and the fact that American fishermen so
                    systematically work there for them is the ground on which the Dominion claim for
                    compensation from the United States Government was based. The sum recently
                    awarded to the colony by the arbitrators is much less, however, than the amount
                    of the claim.</p>
                <p>The methods of fishing in use in the Dominion and Newfoundland waters are of the
                    same kind as in the British Islands, with the exception of beam-trawling, which
                    seems to be practically unknown on the American coasts. Herrings are taken by
                    drift-nets, anchored nets, and seans; mackerel by seans and hook and line;
                    capelan by seans; and cod and its allies by long lines or bulters—there, strange
                    to say, known as “trawls.”</p>
                <p>Professor Hind states (at p. 58 of pt. 1 of his report) that the aggregate number
                    of barrels of herrings caught in Dominion and Newfoundland waters in 1874 may be
                    put down at—</p>

                <p>This number does not include the quantities used for manure or bait; and he adds
                    :—“A million barrels of herring each year, and gradually increasing, will fairly
                    represent the quantity of this fish taken from British American seas.” In the
                    same year 164,879 barrels of mackerel were taken in Dominion waters, of which 80
                    per cent, were caught on the coast of Nova Scotia. The mackerel fishery at
                    Newfoundland appears to have been very small for some years; and the fishermen
                    do not now seem to be well provided with the means of catching them; but there
                    is reason to believe that this fishery might be largely increased in the
                    Dominion waters if more attention were given to it. There is a very great demand
                    for mackerel in the American market. The Newfoundland and Dominion cod fisheries
                    are, as we have mentioned, almost entirely inshore fisheries, and the abundance
                    or scarcity of capelan or other fishes there used as bait materially affects the
                    success of the fishery, for if the bait fishes do not come inshore, there is no
                    attraction for the cod. In the deep-sea fishery on the banks, the case is
                    different; but they are almost neglected by the Dominion and Newfoundland
                    fishermen, for reasons previously stated. The produce of the inshore cod
                    fisheries, although fluctuating, shows no signs of being exhausted. The
                    following table, it is believed, represents with tolerable accuracy the catch of
                    cod and allied fishes on the Dominion coasts in the years stated :—</p>

                <p>Of the numbers of fishing craft here given about 70 per cent, are boats. The
                    produce of the French Newfoundland fishery in 1872 was said to be 10 million
                    francs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">United States Fisheries.</hi> —These may be divided into
                    warm-water and cold-water fisheries, the latter being for the most part carried
                    on in British American waters. The cod fishery, formerly prosecuted off the
                    coast of New England, in the cold water north of Cape Cod, is said to have
                    seriously decreased, and it is believed by Professor Baird, the commissioner of
                    fish and fisheries, that the failure is largely due to the diminution of
                    alewives and other baitfishes, caused by the numerous dams and obstructions in
                    the rivers in which these fishes were accustomed to spawn. The young fish
                    formerly produced in such myriads are now said to be comparatively few, and the
                    cod and allied fishes consequently have less food to attract them to the old
                    haunts. As there is no reason to suppose that cod, as a species, are diminishing
                    in numbers, the conclusion obviously is that they are seeking other feeding
                    grounds. The warmwater fisheries include the pursuit of a variety of fishes, but
                    the “scup,” a kind of bream, and the “blue-fish,” both migratory species, are
                    those whose capture is thought of most value. Although almost all the shore
                    fisheries are said to be decreasing,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Professor Baird says at page 19 of Part i. of his Report—“It
                    is by no means to be inferred from our remarks as to the scarcity of fish that
                    fewer are actually caught now than formerly at any time, the contrary, perhaps,
                    being the case, since by means of the improved methods of capture, in the way of
                    pounds and nets, an immense supply is taken out at certain seasons of the year,
                    so as frequently to glut the markets. The scarcity is better shown by the great
                    difficulty experienced by line fishermen in securing a proper supply throughout
                    the year, on grounds where they were formerly able to catch all they needed for
                    their own u⅞e and for sale.”</p></note> Professor Baird, in his elaborate
                    reports to the United States Government, does not seem to be quite clear as to
                    an effectual remedy. The pounds and weirs are said to be very destructive to
                    spawning fish, but they supply a large quantity of fish to the markets. The
                    scourge of the American coast appears to be the blue-fish, “destroying ten times
                    as many fish as they really need for food, and leaving in their track the
                    surface of the water covered with the blood and fragments of the mangled
                    fish.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Baird. <hi
                    rend="italic">Report</hi> for 1871 and 1872, part i. p. 23.</p></note> Professor
                    Baird estimates that in 1871 there w ere 100 millions of these fish on part of
                    the American coast, and that each one destroyed twenty fish per day; and as the
                    blue-fish season lasts from 120 to 150 days, some idea may bo formed of the
                    extent of the mischief caused by them, Fortunately the blue-fish is in great
                    request as an article of food, and about a million and a quarter were captured
                    in 1871, or, as estimated, one in a hundred of those on the coast. To the
                    blue-fish Professor Baird assigns the very first position among the injurious
                    influences that have affected the supply of fishes on the coast. The agency of
                    man he places next,—the pounds and weirs along-shore catching spawning fishes,
                    and the dams and other obstructions in the rivers preventing certain species
                    from ascending to their proper spawning grounds. He proposed to limit the
                    working of the pounds and weirs to a certain number of days in each week, and to
                    do away as much as possible with the river obstructions. The blue-fish is beyond
                    control.</p>

                <p>The oyster fisheries of the United States are on a very large scale, and the
                    coast line generally appears to abound with suitable localities for the
                    production of these favourite mollusks. The oysters are all of a more or less
                    elongated form, and of large size, sometimes growing to a length of 12 or 15
                    inches. They are obviously more suitable for cooking than for consumption in a
                    natural state; and it is therefore not surprising that they are unable to
                    compete with the favourite “native” in the English market. The trade in oysters
                    in the principal cities of the United States in 1859 was estimated as

                    coast in this country. The first appearance of the herring took place at
                    Christmas (1877), when whales were seen following the shoals of herrings towards
                    the coast.” This is by no means the first time that herrings have returned to a

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">French and Dutch Fisheries.</hi> —The French fisheries on
                    the coast of the Channel are of much the same kind as those on the English
                    side—trawling, drifting, and linefishing. Trawling is carried on to a
                    considerable extent from Boulogne, Treport, Calais, and some other places where
                    there is convenient access to railways; and recently two companies have been
                    established for trawling with steamers along the sandy coast between Arcachon
                    and the mouth of the Gironde. On the coast of Brittany the long-standing fishery
                    for sardines, or, as they really are, young pilchards, is regularly worked. It
                    is remarkable that this fishery is almost entirely dependent for its success on
                    a good supply of cod-roes, in which a large trade with Norway and other places
                    is carried on solely for this purpose, the separated ova of the cod being freely
                    scattered among the sardine nets in order to attract the fish. French and Dutch
                    vessels work regularly in the North Sea for herrings and cod, and the French
                    fish in large numbers along the east coast of England in company with English
                    boats during the herring season. They also take part in the Kinsale mackerel
                    fishery. The Fretìch fisheries at Newfoundland have been already noticed;
                    considerable attention is also given by the French to the cod fishery at Iceland
                    About 200 French vessels visited Iceland in 1877, and during the five years
                    1872-6 the average annual produce of about 120 vessels from Dunkirk alone was
                    <hi rend="italic">5</hi> million kilos, of fish, and of oil about 500,000

                <p>The French oyster fisheries have for many yens received considerable attention,
                    and at Arcachon especially great success appears to have attended the
                    cultivation of the beds. Eighty-five per cent, of the oysters obtained from
                    these fisheries are said to be the produce of four or five breeding grounds,
                    Auray and Arcachon being the most prolific. The total produce of all the French
                    oyster fisheries in 1875 reached the enormous number of 97,227,000 oysters.<note

                    tribe, are regularly collected for the market, and are in great request among
                    the poorer classes of the population. They are eaten uncooked, the egg-shaped
                    spiny shell being divided into two parts by a single cut with a knife, and the
                    soft and slippery contents then readily extracted. The echini form part of the
                    various marine productions well known at Naples as <hi rend="italic">frutti di

                    rend="italic">bêche de mer</hi> belongs to the order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Holothuriadae</hi> or sea-cucumbers. Representatives of the group are found in
                    British seas, but by no means so abundantly or of such general large size as in
                    tropical waters. Several species go under the commercial name of “tripang”; they
                    are collected among almost all the islands of the Indian Archipelago down to New
                    Guinea and Australia, and also on the north coast of Ceylon. In shape the
                    tripang resembles a cucumber, but with a circle of short branched tentacles at
                    one end, and surrounding the mouth. The colour is generally black, more or less
                    variegated with red or orange, and although sluggish in its movements, the
                    animal has ^reat power of contracting and altering its form. Coral recis are
                    favourite haunts of the tripang, and it is found in both deep and shallow water.
                    The only preparation it receives after being gutted consists in drying ia the
                    sun and smoking over a wood fire. Macassar is the centre of the tripang trade,
                    but the whole produce of the fisheries goes to China, and the trade is entirely
                    in the hands of native merchants, <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.</hi><hi

                    relating to Fisheries.</hi></p>
                <p>Fish in English law fall under the general principles of the law as to animals
                    <hi rend="italic">fcrce</hi><hi rend="italic">raturai.</hi> All mankind, says
                    Blackstone, had by the grant of the Creator an original right to pursue them;
                    and this natural right still continues unless so far as it is restrained by the
                    civil law. Accordingly everybody has a right to take fish in the seas, in public
                    rivers, or in private rivers belonging to himself. In private (i.c.,
                    non-navigable) rivers the right of fishery belongs <hi rend="italic"
                    >prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> to the owners of the land on either
                    side, in public or navigable rivers to the public at large. In both, however, an
                    exclusive right of fishery may exist, by which the presumptive right is
                    excluded; and this, in the case of public rivers, can only take place by grant
                    of the crown. Since Magna Charta the crown can no longer make such grants—at
                    least such seems to be the better interpretation of the words in the
                    statute.</p>
                <p>These various rights are more or less roughly distinguished in English law as
                    follows. A <hi rend="italic">common</hi> fishery is the right of fishing in the
                    sea and public rivers open to all the public. A <hi rend="italic">several</hi>
                    fishery is the exclusive right of an individual, derived through or on account
                    of ownership of the soil. A <hi rend="italic">free</hi> fishery is an exclusive
                    right of fishing iu public water, derived from royal grant. A <hi rend="italic"
                    >common</hi> of fishery is the right of fishing “in another man’s water,” like
                    common of pasture, &amp;c. These rights include fish of all descriptions, with
                    this exception that the crown has an old prerogative right to the whale and
                    sturgeon, which, “when thrown ashore or caught near the coast, are the property
                    of the sovereign on account (as it is said in the books) of their superior
                    excellence.” A curious distinction is made between the whale and the sturgeon :—
                    <hi rend="italic">De sturgione</hi><hi rend="italic">observetur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quod rex</hi><hi rend="italic">illum habebit</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >si</hi><hi rend="italic">rex habeat caput et regina caudam.</hi></p>
                <p>As to the mode in which fish may be caught there does not seem to be any
                    restriction at common law. It is a question, however, whether a wear, “by which
                    is meant a fixed structure on the bed of the river, the object of which is,
                    either by means of an apparatus which then catches them or by impeding their
                    progress, to prevent all or nearly all the fish from passing upwards,”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Fishery
                    Laws of the United Kingdom,</hi> by James Paterson, London, 1863.</p></note> is
                    not illegal at common law. In the case of a public river a structure of this
                    sort would be objectionable on the ground of its impeding the navigation, and in
                    a case relating to the River Severn the judges held that the crown could not
                    derogate from the public right of navigation by any grant to erect wears in a
                    public river. The legal writer from whom we have quoted above, while stating
                    that no case had arisen directly on the point in England, Scotland, or Ireland,
                    is of opinion that “both wearsand fixed nets, and all other apparatus which
                    prevent fish passing to or fro are illegal at common law and form a good ground
                    of action,” even although they may not obstruct navigation. ‘Though one riparian
                    owner may, by fishing by net or rod at all hours and by means of servants and
                    assistants, almost use up the fish as effectually as by keeping fixed nets, this
                    kind of user could not properly be a cause of action, just as one owner who has
                    a large number of cattle could not be liable to an action at the suit of another
                    who has no cattle, and so makes no use of the water. But it is otherwise where a
                    total obstruction occurs. Hence, even independently of any statute, any fixed
                    apparatus in a river or stream which prevents the fish going up to the other
                    riparian owners is a good cause of action at common law, as it deprives him of
                    one of the natural riparian rights.”</p>
                <p>A considerable number of statutes have been passed on the subject of fisheries,
                    the most important of which are those relating to salmon. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Salmon.</hi></p>
                <p>A short Act was passed in 1876 enabling boards of conservators to fix a close
                    term for trout, commencing not earlier than 2d September, nor later than 2d
                    November, and extending over 123 days. A bill for the protection of freshwater
                    fish has passed through parliament during the present session (1878). Sections 8
                    and 9 of the Salmon Fishery Act 1861 (which relate to fishing with light spears
                    and other prohibited instruments, and to using roe as a bait) shall, as amended
                    by the subsequent Salmon Fishery Acts, apply to <hi rend="italic">trout</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">char</hi> in all waters within the limits of the Act, which
                    are the same as the limits of the Salmon Act. For all other freshwater fish, not
                    migrating to or from the open sea, a close season is established from 1st March
                    to 31st May, both <pb break="no"

                    fish during this close season is subjected to a penalty not exceeding 40s. for
                    the first or £5 for the second offence, recoverable on summary conviction before
                    two justices. The Fisheries (Dynamite) Act is extended to private waters.</p>
                <p>The Act 40 and 41 Vict. c. 62 is an Act to amend the law relating to the
                    fisheries of oysters, crabs, and lobsters, and other sea fisheries. The sale of
                    <hi rend="italic">oysters</hi> is prohibited, in the case of “deep sea oysters,”
                    between 15th June and 4th August; in other eases between 14th May and 14th
                    August. Oysters taken in foreign waters, or preserved in tins, or intended for
                    the purpose of oyster cultivation are not within this section. The Board of
                    Trade has power to temporarily prohibit or restrict dredging for oysters on
                    certain banks. <hi rend="italic">Crabs</hi> measuring less than 4⅜ inches across
                    the back, or carrying spawn attached to the tail, &amp;c., or having recently
                    cast the shell may not be sold, except for bait. <hi rend="italic">Lobsters</hi>
                    measuring less than 8 inches “from the tip of the back to the end of the tail,
                    when spread as far as possible flat,” may not be sold. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oysters</hi> arc also specially dealt with by the “Sea Fisheries Act, 1868,”
                    which is an Act to carry into effect a convention between England and France
                    concerning the fisheries in the seas adjoining the British Islands and France,
                    and to amend the laws relating to British sea fisheries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">lìdcmational Law.—</hi> As between different nations, fishing
                    in the high seas is common to all, while fishing in the territorial waters of
                    any particular state (t.e., within three miles of the coast) is limited to the
                    subjects of that state. Between France and England the rights of fishing in the
                    seas adjacent to both countries are regulated by the convention and Act of
                    Parliament cited above. Between</p>
                <p>England and the United States questions of great importance have arisen as to
                    their respective rights of fishing in North American waters. Mutual concessions
                    were made by treaties in 1818,1804, and 1871. The last was the Treaty of
                    Washington, by which “the inhabitants of the United States are to have in
                    addition to their rights under the treaty of 1818, in common with British
                    subjects, for ten years from the date of the treaty and until the end of two
                    years after notice has been given by either party, the right to take fish of
                    every kind except shell-fish on the sea coasts and shores, and in the bays,
                    harbours, and creeks of the provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick,
                    and the colony of Prince Edward’s Island, and of the several islands thereto
                    adjacent, without being restricted to any distance from the shore, with
                    permission to land upon the said coasts and shoresand islands, and also upon the
                    Magdalen Islands for the purpose of drying their nets and curing their fish.”
                    Salmon and shad fisheries and all other fisheries in the rivers and mouths of
                    rivers are reserved for British subjects. Exactly similar rights are granted to
                    British subjects on the eastern sea coasts and shores of the United States north
                    of the 39th parallel of north latitude. But inasmuch as the English Government
                    insisted that the privileges granted to the United States were of greater value
                    than those conceded to England, it was agreed that commissioners should be
                    appointed to determine the amount of any compensation which ought to be paid to
                    the English Government in consideration of such excess. The commissioners have
                    recently made an award finding the sum of £1,000,000 to be due from the United
                    States to England. Certain places designated in the abrogated treaty of 1854 are
                    to be excepted from the operation of the treaty as “places reserved from the
                    common right of fishing.” (E. R.)</p>
