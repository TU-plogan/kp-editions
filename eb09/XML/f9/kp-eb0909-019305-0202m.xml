                <p><label type="entry">FINE</label>, in law, is a pecuniary penalty inflicted for
                    the less serious offences. Fines are necessarily discretionary as to amount; but
                    a maximum is generally fixed when the penalty is imposed by statute. And it is
                    an old constitutional maxim that fines must not be unreasonable. In Magna
                    Charta, c. Ill, it is ordained “<hi rend="italic">Liber homo non amercietur
                    pro</hi><hi rend="italic">parvo</hi><hi rend="italic">delicto nisi

                <p>The term is also applied to payments made to the lord of a manor on the
                    alienation of land held according to the custom of the manor, to payments made
                    on the renewal of leases granted by ecclesiastical and other corporations, and
                    to other similar payments.</p>
                <p>Fine also denotes a fictitious suit at law, which played the part of a conveyance
                    of landed property. “A fine,” says Blackstone, “may be described to be an
                    amicable composition or agreement of a suit, either actual or fictitious, by
                    leave of the king or his justices, whereby the lands in question become or are
                    acknowledged to be the right of one of the parties. In its original it was
                    founded on an actual suit commenced at law for the recovery of the possession of
                    land or other hereditaments; and the possession thus gained by such composition
                    was found to be so sure and effectual that fictitious actions were and continue
                    to bo every day commenced for the sake of obtaining the same security.” Freehold
                    estates could thus be transferred from one person to another without the formal
                    delivery of possession which was generally necessary to a feoffment. This is one
                    of the oldest devices of the law. A statute of 18 Edward I. describes it as the
                    most solemn and satisfactory of securities, and gives a reason for its name—“Qui
                    quidem finis sic vocatur, eo quod finis et consummatio omnium placitorum esse
                    debet, et hac de causa providebatur.” The action was supposed to be founded on a
                    breach of covenant: the defendant, owning himself in the wrong,<note

                    concordandi;</hi> then followed the concord, or the compromise itself. These,
                    then, were the essential parts of the performance, which became efficient as
                    soon as they were complete; the formal parts were the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nots,</hi> or abstract of the proceedings, and the <hi rend="italic">foot</hi>
                    of the fine, which recited the final agreement. Fines were said to be of four
                    kinds, according to the purpose they had in view, as for instance, to convey
                    lands in pursuance of a covenant, to grant reversionary interest only, &amp;c.
                    In addition to the formal record of the proceedings, various statutes required
                    other solemnities to be observed, the great object of which was to give
                    publicity to the transaction. Thus by statutes of Richard III. and Henry VII.
                    the fine had to be openly read and proclaimed in court no less than sixteen
                    times. A statute of Elizabeth required a list of fines to be exposed in the
                    Court of Common Pleas and at assizes. The reason ſor these formalities was the
                    high and important nature of the conveyance, which, according to the Act of
                    Edward I. above mentioned, “precludes not only those which are parties and
                    privies to the fine and their heirs, but all other persons in the world who are
                    of full age, out of prison, of sound memory, and within the four seas, the day
                    of the fine levied, unless they put in their claim on the foot of the fine
                    within a year and a day.” This barring by <hi rend="italic">non-claim</hi> was
                    abolished in the reign of Edward III., but restored with an extension of the
                    time to five years in the reign of Henry VII. The effect of this statute,
                    intentional according to Blackstone, unintended and brought about by judicial
                    construction according to others, was that a tenantin-tail could bar his issue
                    by a fine. A statute of Henry VIII. expressly declares this to be the law.
                    Fines, along with the kindred fiction of recoveries, were abolished by statute 3
                    and 4 Will. IV. c. 74, which substituted a deed enrolled in the Court of
                    Chancery.</p>
                <p>Fines are so generally associated in legal phraseology with recoveries that it
                    may not be inconvenient to describe the latter in the present place. A recovery
                    was employed as a means for evading the strict law of entail. The purchaser or
                    alienee brought an action against the tenant in-tail, alleging that he had no
                    legal title to the land. The tenant-in-tail brought a third person into court,
                    declaring that be had warranted his title, and praying that he might be ordered
                    to defend the action. This person was called the <hi rend="italic">vouchee,</hi>
                    and he, after having appeared to defend the action, takes himself out of the
                    way. Judgment for the lands is given in favour of the plaintiff; and judgment to
                    recover lands of equal value from the vouchee was given to the defendant, the
                    tenant-in-tail. In a real action, such lands when recovered would have fallen
                    under the settlement of entail; but in the fictitious recovery the vouchee was a
                    man of straw, and nothing was really recovered from him, while the lands of the
                    tenant-in-tail were effectually conveyed to the successful plaintiff. A recovery
                    differed from a fine, as to <hi rend="italic">form,</hi> in being an action
                    carried through to the end, while a fine was settled by compromise, and as to
                    effect, by barring all reversions and remainders in estates tail, while a fine
                    barred the issue only of the tenant. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. e.)</hi></p>
