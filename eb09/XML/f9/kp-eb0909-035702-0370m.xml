                <p><label type="entry">FOLK-LORE</label>, This word, formed in imitation of such
                    German compounds as “Volksepos,” “Volksfest,” “Volkslied,” has recently become
                    current in the English language <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> as a convenient
                    though somewhat vague general heading under which to arrange all that has been
                    observed or recorded of the traditions current among the “common people” of
                    different countries, civilized or uncivilized, whether in ancient, mediaeval, or
                    modern times. Each nation and each locality has, of course, a “folk-lore” as it
                    has a language; and it is obvious that to set forth any given folk-lore, with
                    all its stratifications, in a comprehensive and orderly way, would virtually be
                    equivalent to exhibiting fully the past and present intellectual, moral,
                    religious, and social condition of the people to whom it belonged. An exhaustive
                    account of the folk-lores of the world would be equivalent to a complete history
                    of the thoughts of mankind.</p>
                <p>The eccentricities of traditionary story and traditionary practice have always
                    been found a more or less interesting and amusing study by the contemplative
                    observer of human nature; and almost all travellers and historians, from
                    Herodotus downwards, have occasionally condescended to add something to the
                    general collection of curiosities in that department. But to make a thorough
                    investigation of the “vulgar antiquities” of any country, and especially of
                    one’s own, was, until very recently, regarded as childish and useless. An
                    exception, indeed, was made in favour of the folklores of ancient Greece and
                    Rome, as being intrinsically beautiful and exceptionally instructive. But the
                    very fact that these had been beautified by artistic treatment impaired their
                    usefulness from the purely antiquarian point of view; and in any case the
                    floating traditions of Attica and Latium were too few, too fragmentary, and
                    gathered from too narrow an area to furnish adequate data for the anthropologist
                    and the sociologist. Here, as in so many other instances, it was necessary that
                    men should greatly extend the area of their investigations before they could
                    rightly understand that which alone they were curious to know.</p>
                <p>It was in Germany that the study of folk-lore first entered upon its scientific
                    stage. One of the earliest symptoms of the awakening of a wider and more
                    sympathetic interest in the various products of a nation’s mind, its legends and
                    its tales, its manners and its customs, its laws, government, religion, and
                    daily life, was the appearance in 1778-9 of Herder’s celebrated collection of
                    popular songs. But the new day was fairly ushered in by the successive
                    publications of the brothers Grimm, more particularly of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kinder-</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Ilaus-Mährchenin</hi>
                    1812, and of the <hi rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mythologie</hi> in 1835. The latter work, which was closely dependent on the
                    former, showed for the first time what results may be hoped for by an
                    intelligent investigator, if only, laying aside all prejudice, he will put
                    himself to the trouble of collecting largely and widely, and of interpreting
                    faithfully and rationally, a nation’s oral traditions and unwritten customs. It
                    was seen that, although many relics of the past had been irrecoverably lost,
                    enough had been preserved to furnish conclusive proof of the oneness in faith as
                    well as in speech of the Teutonic race, and also to give indications, in many
                    instances, of the precise points at which the divergences had occurred. This new
                    knowledge, derived to a large extent from the skilful use of folk-lore
                    “collected from the mouths of old women in the spinning-rooms of German
                    villages,” acquired an altogether peculiar interest and importance from the
                    other discovery by which the philological labours of Bopp and others had been
                    crowned,—the discovery, namely, of the original unity of all the Aryan races,
                    and the demonstration of the fact that the Teutons themselves were but one
                    branch of a greater family, including Hindus and Celts, which had at one time
                    inhabited the central plain of Asia, and before dispersing eastward and
                    westward, had developed an ineffaceably characteristic speech, civilization, and
                    religion. The identification verbally of Dyaus, Zeus, Jo(vi)s, Tiw, Zio, and Tyr
                    was followed, as investigation proceeded, by the identification really of many
                    of the strange forms in which religious sentiment had found expression; and
                    comparative mythology became an inseparable companion of comparative philology.
                    (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mythology</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Philology.)</hi> It was thenceforward obvious that every mythology, in the
                    Aryan family at least, however puerile or absurd it might at first sight appear,
                    was a fit subject for scientific investigation, and capable of yielding
                    scientific results. The problem in each case was to trace the nursery tale to
                    the legend, and the legend to the myth, and the myth to its earliest germ, and
                    as far as possible to indicate the foreign interpolations when they occurred,
                    and account <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> It was first suggested by Mr Thoms in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> of 1846 (p. 862). Its equivalent does not
                    actually occur in German.</p>

                <p>for the local accretions. In this way the history of a story, like the history of
                    a word, was frequently found to be more interesting and more instructive than
                    the history of a campaign. Once this had been realized, the new field of
                    folk-lore found many skilled labourers; and the quantity of material available
                    for examination and classification rapidly increased. Each fresh comparison made
                    it increasingly plain that in groundwork and plot the stories current among the
                    Indo-European peoples were substantially identical The reader of the fables of
                    La Fontaine found nothing essentially and absolutely strange in the Pankatantra
                    or Hitopadesa; the Indian ayah was discovered to have unmistakably the same
                    stock of stories as the German, Norwegian, or Celtic nurse. In a few cases,
                    indeed, it could be shown that the wide diffusion of some particular fable was
                    attributable to migrations which had taken place within the historic
                    period;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Max Müller’s
                    paper “On the Migration of Fables,” in the <hi rend="italic">Contemporary

                    hardly be doubted that certain very remarkable coincidences were still mere
                    coincidences and nothing more;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    The Zulus also have tales resembling that of Jack the Giant-Killer. See Max
                    Müller, <hi rend="italic">Chips,</hi> ii. 212; iv. 156. So with the large family
                    of stories which turn on the idea of gods wandering on earth in the likeness of
                    men.</p></note> but in a great majority of instances, it was plain that the
                    notion of borrowing or copying having occurred was inadmissible, and that
                    nothing could account for their constant similarity except the theory of a
                    common origin. They were “primitive or organic legends, representing one common
                    ancient stratum of language and thought reaching from India to Europe;” the
                    others were secondary or inorganic, consisting of “boulders of various strata
                    carried along by natural and artificial means from one country to
                    another.’’<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Max Müller,

                <p>The aboriginal Aryan legends may be arranged under one or other of two
                    categories, the myth or the fable. That primitive fables actually exist, stories
                    expressly invented for a moral or didactic purpose, seems a well-established
                    fact. The fable of the King and the Bee, for example, crops up alike in India,
                    in Greece, and in Norway, in forms that cannot be accounted for by direct oral
                    or literary transmission;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    never have found its way into the nurseries of German peasants if written by
                    Grimm himself in imitation of some other Aryan tale <hi rend="italic">(Mythology

                    Highlands of Scotland, must probably also be regarded as embodying at least a

                    organic myths,—those stories, that is to say, which, whether based on mistaken
                    metaphor or distorted history, are at least the product of the unconscious play
                    of fancy. The same characters and the same incidents constantly recur under
                    innumerable names and shapes. “The story of the heroes of Teutonic and Hindu
                    folk-lore, the stories of Boots and Cinderella, of Logedas Rajah and Surya Bai,
                    are the story also of Achilleus and Oidipous, of Perseus and Theseus, of Helen
                    and Odysseus, of Baldur, and Rustem, and Sigurd. Everywhere there is the search
                    for the bright maiden who has been stolen away, everywhere the long struggle to
                    recover her. The war of ∏ion has been fought out in every Aryan land” (Cox).
                    What we are accustomed to associate with the name of William Tell is told of
                    many archers under other names, in England</p>
                <p>(William of Cloudsle), Germany, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Lapland;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>But also, it ought to be
                    added, among Turks, Mongolians, and Samoyedes,—in other words, beyond the Aryan
                    territory.</p></note> the same story of the young hero dying in the fulness of
                    youth is told of Baldur and Isfendiyar, Sifrit, and Achilles. The stories vary
                    widely under the influence of climate, religion, and civilization, and yet
                    remain substantially the same. The sun-myth, when transferred from southern to
                    northern latitudes, cannot but undergo some change of shape; the <hi
                    rend="italic">dramatis personae</hi> are as various in each fable as the fauna
                    and flora of the regions in which it is told. Odin, when no longer recognized as
                    a deity, becomes simply the wild huntsman or Hellequin; when civilization makes
                    even such a being no longer credible, he still survives possibly as Harlequin or
                    Robin Hood.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the systematic study of comparative folk-lore has been almost
                    exclusively confined within Aryan limits. But the successful application of
                    scientific method in that field has encouraged many labourers in other regions,
                    and an amount of material is being accumulated which may be expected ultimately
                    to yield very important results in ethnology and anthropology. So far as the
                    savage tribes of the world are concerned, it would seem that the greater
                    proportion of trustworthy data is to be derived from that department of their
                    “folk-lore” which manifests itself in traditionary practices; but in no case,
                    indeed, can the comparative mythologist afford to overlook the qualifying or
                    corroborative evidence supplied by what may be called comparative “ethology.”
                    Every custom has an instructive history if we can but succeed in interpreting
                    its lore. In ascertaining when, where, and how any given tribe came first to
                    worship plants, or animals, or ghosts, we get definitely nearer the solution of
                    the fundamental problem of anthropology. Even the modem usages of social and
                    domestic life, the observances that accompany such incidents as marriage, birth,
                    and death, when skilfully read, are capable of telling us something at least of
                    the condition of primitive man. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthropology, Animism,
