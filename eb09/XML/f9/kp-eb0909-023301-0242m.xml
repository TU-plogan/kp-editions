                <p>Such great fires as the above are due, first, to the combustible contents of
                    buildings and of the materials they are built of, and to radical defects în the
                    method of construction, and, secondly, to the want of proper means and
                    appliances for promptly extinguishing fires and perventing the spread of them.
                    Wooden buildings crowded together in narrow crooked streets, insufficient supply
                    or absolute want of water, no fire-engines or only the feeblest machines for
                    pumping water, and no organized or trained and disciplined body of firemen, were
                    the conditions in earlier times, and in some countries they are the conditions
                    still.</p>

                <p>It is of importance, however, to bear in mind that the loss of property by great
                    fires or conflagrations is really small in proportion to the loss by fires of
                    moderate proportions. Thus a very competent authority, Mr Cornelius Walford,
                    gives it as his opinion that great fires, properly so called, “involving the
                    loss of £50,000 and upwards, probably do not account for more than one-fifth of
                    the losses of any average year.” With the gradual improvement of the
                    organization for coping with fires, the disproportion of conflagrations year by
                    year becomes greater, so that really small but oft-occurring fires are now, in
                    all well-governed communities, the subject which demands the careful attention
                    of authorities. No means at present exist for accurately estimating the average
                    annual loss of property by fire throughout the world, as in scarcely any country
                    is an official record of fires and their results kept; and the imperfect returns
                    of insurance companies are of comparatively little significance. It is estimated
                    that the value of the insured property destroyed by fire all over the world
                    amounts to from thirty to forty millions of pounds sterling annually. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Insurance.)</hi></p>
                <p>In modern times great improvements have been made in the means employed for the
                    prevention and extinction of fires. Broad thoroughfares have taken the place of
                    narrow crooked streets; incombustible materials, such as brick, stone (natural
                    and artificial), and iron are used, not only for the exterior, but for the
                    interior of important buildings as far as practicable; the introduction into
                    cities of an abundant supply of water is common; the electric fire-alarm
                    telegraph, powerful steam fire-engines, extension ladders, and fire-escapes are
                    among the mechanical appliances now in daily use. The two essential elements of
                    the problem, however, are the fire-resisting character of buildings, and the
                    organizations of trained men who can make the modern appliances effective. The
                    methods of organization and procedure differ in different countries.</p>
                <p>Fires are dealt with, first and chiefly, by way of prevention; secondly, by
                    prompt measures for extinction when they have begun; and thirdly, by
                    circumscription or limitation when the fire has obtained such a hold of any
                    building or range that the salvation of the burning property is beyond hope. In
                    concerting preventive measures, a knowledge of the principal causes of fires is
                    of the utmost consequence; and as bearing on the ordinary causes the following
                    abstract of the results deduced from about 30,000 fires, which occurred in
                    London during the thirty-three years 1833-65, possesses significance. The
                    percentages of different causes were :—Candles 11O7, children playing 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 59, curtains 9'71, flues 7 ’ 80, gas 7'65, lucifers l
                    ’ 4l, smoking tobacco l ’ 40, sparks of fire 4 ’ 47, spontaneous ignition 0'95,
                    stoves 1 ’ 67, other known causes 19'40, unknown causes 32 ’ 88. There is too
                    much reason to suspect that a considerable proportion of fires attributed to no
                    known cause are due to incendiarism; and were an official investigation into the
                    origin of fires instituted, it most probably would result in a great saving of
                    property. Among preventive measures the fire-proof building of large erections
                    occupies an important place. Much can be done structurally to prevent and to
                    limit fires, although it is now conceded that the thorough fire-proofing of any
                    building is almost impracticable. The erection itself may be fire proof, but no
                    sooner is it stored with inflammable goods or property than it ceases to be
                    invulnerable. It is of the utmost importance to reduce the danger of fire to a
                    minimum in many public structures, as for example, public record offices, banks,
                    and great libraries and museums, and in such establishments generally the most
                    complete precautions are observed. Open fire-places are discouraged, arched
                    floors are provided, the use of exposed wood is, as far as possible, avoided,
                    gas and other lights are most carefully arranged, and fire buckets, hose, and
                    other appliances are in readiness for any emergency, while the premises are
                    constantly patrolled by watchmen. For the prompt extinction of a fire in its
                    incipient stages the water-buckets, handpumps, and extincteurs alluded to below
                    are of the utmost value. When such means fail or are wanting, the services of
                    fire brigades and salvage corps, if brought into requisition without loss of
                    time, generally result in a great saving of property; but when a fire has
                    obtained complete mastery of a building, it is a recognized fact that the most
                    powerful engines, even aided with unlimited supplies of water, are ineffectual,
                    and the efforts of the firemen are directed to confining the conflagration
                    within the limits over which it has secured a hold. To cut off neighbouring
                    properties, the use of gunpowder and other means of breaking connexion are
                    frequently required.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fire Extinction.</hi></p>
                <p>In coping with fires, water is the great agent employed; and in towns where the
                    supply of water is abundant, and where especially there is a constant and high
                    pressure in the mains, the task of the firemen is much simplified. In such cases
                    it is frequently only necessary to attach the firehose to the plugs, and the
                    pressure in the main pipe is sufficient, without the aid of any engine, to throw
                    the jet over the whole burning mass. But it ⅛ only rarely that towns are so
                    favourably situated, and for the equipment of an ordinary fire brigade and fire
                    establishment the following among other appliances are required.</p>

                    into a bucket of water is the most effective means of distributing a small

                    its earlier stages.</p>

                    cylindrical tank, holding 7 gallons or upwards of water, and is carried on the
                    back. Carbonic acid is generated at the moment of using within the vessel
                    itself, and from its compressibility affords the power which projects the
                    liquid. The working pressure varies from 70 to 120 ft&gt; per square inch,
                    according to the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere; and the projectile
                    range of the jet is from 40 to 50 feet, <hi rend="italic">Hand-worked

                    hauled by men or horses. Those most used in Paris are worked by eight men, and
                    throw a f-inch jet to a height of 100 feet. Each pump is 5 inches in diameter,
                    with 9∣-inch stroke. A smaller engine that may be carried into buildings by four
                    men is also used. Those of the London fire brigade are worked most effectively
                    by 26 to 30 men; pumps 6 or 7 inches diameter and 8 inches stroke. Each stroke
                    (with 6-inch pumps) delivers If gallons of water. Still larger engines have been
                    used, requiring 40 to 50 men. In the United States these as well as smaller
                    hand-worked engines have given place to steam fire-engines, with pumps of the

                    bicarbonate of soda and</p>

                    has two pumps, with vertical motion, connected with the suction pipes, to fill
                    the compartments with water where the chemicals are dissolved, and two pumps to
                    project the chemical liquid from each compartment into the air-chamber, where
                    they combine and generate carbonic acid gas. The gas is held in solution by the
                    water, and is conveyed direct to the fire, upon which it exercises its
                    fire-extinguishing power. The engine can be worked by four or five men, and is
                    capable of throwing 30 gallons of water per minute, containing 250 gallons of
                    carbonic acid gas, a distance of 75 to 90 feet.</p></note><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ladder Carriages</hi> carry from 20 to 25 ladders of various lengths (see fig.
                    4). Two ladders spliced reach 70 feet. The carriage fully equipped and carrying
                    12 men weighs from 7000 to 8000 K), and is drawn by two horses. The “aerial
                    ladder” (so-called) reaches when fully extended a height of 100 feet, and is
                    self-supporting: it is readily moved, when raised. It is made in 8 sections,
                    each being a ladder about 12 feet long, and is put together and raised in six
                    minutes. It is available as a fire-escape. The total load with its carriage is
                    about 6000 ft).</p>

                    department in the shortest possible time. Throughout the town or city “alarm
                    boxes” are placed, connected by telegraph wire <pb break="no"

                    the department. They are small iron boxes about a foot square, numbered in order
                    and placed conspicuously on telegraph poles, or on the side of a building at
                    corners of streets. Inside of each is a simple clock-work, which is set in
                    motion by the pulling of a handle, and which records at the central office the
                    number of the box. To guard against false alarms the outer door of the box is
                    locked, but keys are kept at hand and are in the possession of all policemen and
                    firemen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Automatic Signal Telegraph</hi> gives instantaneous notice
                    at the headquarters of the fire department, or at the nearest engine-house, of
                    the existence of a fire, by the action of the fire itself, and records there the
                    number of the building and the room in which it occurs. The apparatus is very
                    simple, and may be fully relied on. It consists of a small tube, called a
                    thermostat, about 3 inches long, containing a spiral strip of metal, so arranged
                    that the expansion due to a rise of thirty degrees above the ordinary
                    temperature of the room in which it is placed, will close the connexion between
                    the two poles of a battery, and produce an electric current, which, passing
                    through a small iron box containing a clockwork and circuit breaker, called a
                    “transmitter,” at once strikes a bell and starts a register at the nearest
                    station of the fire department, which records the number of the building and the
                    room in which the fire has broken out. The thermostat is placed upon the ceiling
                    of each room at intervals of 25 feet throughout the building, the transmitter in
                    every room that requires a separate signal. The signal is transmitted even when
                    the wires are broken. This telegraph has been adopted in New York and
                    Boston.</p>
                <p>The electric arrangements connected with the fire brigade in the city of Glasgow,
                    which have been devised by Mr R. S. Symington, telegraph engineer, have been
                    carried out on a scale of much efficiency and perfection. The city is divided
                    into six fire districts, all connected by telegraph with the central principal
                    station. There are also placed throughout the city 80 “electric fire alarm
                    boxes,” at the corners of the principal streets, and the occurrence of fire can
                    through these be instantly telegraphed to the nearest “fire station,” and at the
                    same time to the “central station.” On the arrival of the first detachment, the
                    “box’’from which the signal was given is by an ingenious arrangement immediately
                    converted into a “telegraph station” (for the time being), connecting all the
                    stations, and enabling the firemαster to command the whole “staff.” The
                    fire-master, as also the principal men, reside on the premises at the central
                    station; and men and horses are summoned by an electric bell system leading into
                    each man’s bedroom. Besides the above arrangements there are placed in many
                    warehouses and extensive establishments throughout the city about 2000 electric
                    thermostats, by which the rising of a mercurial column causes a loud gong to
                    sound, at once drawing attention to unoccupied or shut-up premises.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Organization.</hi> —The organizations of Paris and Berlin
                    ace similar, and are based upon the idea of small detachments of men, lighter
                    machines, and a large number of stations, and on the presumption that no fire
                    will have got beyond the control of the small detachment before it is discovered
                    and made known. The results have been generally satisfactory under the
                    conditions existing in those cities. In London larger detachments and fewer
                    stations have given good results. In the principal cities of the United States
                    different conditions have necessitated a proportionately larger force of men and
                    more effective appliances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">London.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The metropolitan fire
                    brigade is a force of about 400 men under the control of the Board of Works, but
                    under the immediate command of the “chief officer.” The city is divided into a
                    number of districts, each under a “superintendent.” Within each district are
                    fire-engine stations properly equipped, each under an “engineer.” The force at
                    these stations is the unit of organization. Each engineer has independent
                    telegraphic communication with his superintendent, and he in turn with the chief
                    officer. 26 steam fire-engines and 86 hand-wórked engines are in use. Floating
                    steam fire-engines protect the river front. The chief officer has absolute
                    command at fires.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Paris.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The firemen are a corps,
                    “sapeurs-pompiers,” attached to the War Department, but at fires the corps acts
                    under orders from the prefect of police. It is under the immediate command of a
                    colonel, and is divided into 12 companies, the company being the unit of
                    organization. Fire stations, manned by three men and provided with handpumps and
                    fire-escapes, are distributed throughout the city. If the three men of a
                    station, with bystanders impressed into the service by the police, are unable to
                    extinguish the fire, men from other stations of the same company are summoned.
                    Additional companies are called out by orders from headquarters of the corps.
                    Hand-engines are the main reliance, but in 1876 five steam fire-engines were in
                    use.</p>

                    to military discipline, and is under the command of a “fire-director” with
                    subordinate officers. The city is divided into four inspection districts, with
                    an officer in charge of eacli. Each district has numerous fire depots, according
                    to its needs, and each depot is in charge of a fireman and four men, and is
                    furnished with a small hand-engine, a hook and ladder, and a fire-escape. The
                    principal stations are connected by telegraph.</p>

                    New York may be taken as the type of the best system now employed in the United
                    States. It is on a military basis, under the control of a board of commissioners
                    appointed by the mayor. The active force is under the immediate command of the
                    “chief of department,” and consists of 10 battalions, each of 6 companies, in
                    all about 750 men. Each company, whether engine or ladder company, has its own

                    engine, and are loosened by a <pb break="no"

                    with the striking of the alarm, opens the front of the stall; the horses,
                    trained to move at the sound of the gong, advance rapidly each to his own place
                    at the pole. They are instantly hitched in, the men spring to their seats, and
                    the carriage is driven at high speed to the “alarm box” from which the alarm was
                    given. To make sure that there will be a working pressure of steam on reaching
                    the fire, the water in the engines, as they stand in the houses, is kept always
                    at boiling point by the circulation of hot water from small stationary boilers,
                    and fire is lighted in the engine the instant it leaves the house. Every effort
                    is made to save even a few seconds of time, so that the interval between
                    sounding the alarm and pumping water on the fire will average three minutes, and
                    rarely exceeds five minutes. The city is divided into 10 battalion districts.
                    The smallest of these represent each an area of about 5000 by 2000 feet, and
                    comprise the most exposed parts of the city; but most of the districts are from
                    two to three times as large. The signal boxes of the electric fire-alarm
                    telegraph are placed conspicuously in the streets about 400 feet apart in the
                    more crowded portion of the city, and from 1000 to 1200 feet in other portions.
                    There are 540 in all. Alarms given from these boxes are instantly telegraphed
                    from the headquarters of the department to each company house in the city. The
                    first alarm calls out two or more companies previously designated; a second and
                    third call out additional force. There are in use 57 steam fire-engines (5 of
                    which are self-propellers), 1 steam fireboat, 10 chemical engines, and 18 ladder
                    carriages, including 5 “aerial ladders.” The men are well-disciplined and
                    skilful firemen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
