                    Walter Scott. His mother was sister of Professor John Wilson. In his early youth
                    he lived in the family of the Rev. Dr Duncan, in the manse of Ruthwell,
                    Dumfriesshire, and under Dr Duncan’s tuition he acquired a strong liking for the
                    Latin poets, which remained with him ^all his days. After attending Edinburgh
                    High School he studied under Dr Burney at Greenwich, and was a student of
                    Edinburgh University in sessions 1825-26 and 1826-27. He took the B.A. degree at
                    Oxford in 1831. In 1832 he passed as an advocate at Edinburgh. Probably it was
                    his metaphysical tastes which led him to Heidelberg in 1834. These tastes were
                    fostered by his intercourse with Sir William Hamilton, which was always most
                    cordial, notwithstanding their wide differences of opinion. Ferrier himself has
                    recorded the warm friendship which subsisted between himself and Hamilton. “For
                    years together,” he wrote, “scarcely a day passed in which I was not in his
                    company for hours, and never on this earth may I expect to live such happy hours
                    again.” His admiration for his uncle, John Wilson, whose daughter he married,
                    was unbounded, and he had many opportunities of meeting political and literary
                    celebrities in Wilson’s house. In 1842 he was appointed professor of civil
                    history in Edinburgh University. In session 1844-45 he acted as Sir William
                    Hamilton’s substitute in the chair of logic and metaphysics, and in 1845 he was
                    elected professor of moral philosophy and political economy at St Andrews. He
                    was twice an unsuccessful candidate for chairs in Edinburgh, for that of moral
                    philosophy on the resignation of Professor Wilson in 1852, and for that of logic
                    and metaphysics in 1856, after Hamil ton’s death. As a professor Ferrier had
                    immense influence over his students, and was warmly beloved by them. He <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0119-0110"/> had an attack of <hi rend="italic">angina
                    pectoris</hi> in November 1861, from the effects of which he never recovered. He
                    died on 11th June 1864.</p>
                <p>Ferrier made his début as a metaphysician in a series of articles in <hi
                    rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> in the years 1838-39, bearing the title “An
                    Introduction to the Philosophy of Consciousness.” In these articles he condemns
                    previous philosophers for ignoring in their psychological investigations the
                    fact of consciousness, which is the distinctive feature of man, and coufining
                    their observation to the so-called “states of the mind.” By doing so, he says,
                    they allowed freedom, will, morality, and all man’s peculiar attributes to
                    crumble away. It is wrong to apply the method of physical research to the
                    problems of psychology, for the psychologist must <hi rend="italic">act</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">create</hi> the great phenomenon which he has to observe.
                    Consciousness only comes into manifestation when the man has used the word “I”
                    with full knowledge of what it means. This notion he must originate within
                    himself. Consciousness cannot spring from the states which are its object, for
                    it is in antagonism to them. It originates in the will, which in the act of
                    consciousness puts the “I” in the place of our sensations. Morality, conscience,
                    and responsibility are necessary results of consciousness.</p>
                <p>A number of articles on philosophical subjects intervened between the above and
                    the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Institutes.</hi> The “Crisis of Modern
                    Speculation,” contributed in 1841, is a decided advance upon his earlier
                    articles, and evinces a more correct appreciation of the particular element in
                    thought. He there states the problem of philosophy to be the nature of the
                    connexion between the mind of man and the external universe, and he solves the
                    question, not by giving it a positive answer, but by changing its aspect. The
                    question as formerly put becomes under his hands meaningless, for mind and
                    universe, subject and object, are shown to be not two, but merely moments in one
                    reality. Think the object, and it becomes subject-object. Think the subject, and
                    it becomes subject-object. So that the question really asked is, “What is the
                    connexion between the subjective subjectobject and the objective
                    subjective-object ί” “What is the connexion between <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    thing which thought cannot construe as really two ?” As results of this mode of
                    stating the question, to which the mere thinking it necessarily leads,
                    perception is removed from the sphere of cause and effect, and the grounds of
                    dogmatic realism and dogmatic idealism are subverted. “Berkeley and Idealism”
                    (1842) is a further exposition of absolute idealism, and contains some
                    foreshadowings of the later teaching of the <hi rend="italic">Institutes</hi> on
                    the subject of “Agnoiology.”</p>
                <p>In an article on the publication of Hamilton’s edition of Reid (1847), which
                    contains a vigorous attack on the philosophy of common sense, the perception of
                    matter is pronounced to be the <hi rend="italic">ηe plus ultra</hi> of thought,
                    and Reid, for presuming to analyse it, is declared to be a representationist in
                    fact, although he professed to be an intuitionist. A distinction is made between
                    the “perception of matter” and “our apprehension of the perception of matter.”
                    Psychology vainly tries to analyse the former. Metaphysic shows the latter alone
                    to be analysable, and separates the subjective element, “our apprehension,” from
                    the objective element, “the perception of matter,”—not matter <hi rend="italic"
                    >per se,</hi> but the perception of matter is the existence independent of the
                    individual’s thought. It cannot, however, be independent of thought. It must
                    belong to some mind, and is therefore the property of the Divine Mind. There, he
                    thinks, is au indestructible foundation for the <hi rend="italic">α priori</hi>
                    argument for the existence of God.</p>
                <p>Ferrier’s matured philosophical doctrines find expression in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutes of Metaphysics.</hi> Therein he claims to have met the
                    twofold obligation resting on every system of philosophy, that it should be
                    reasoned and true. His method is that of Spinoza, strict demonstration, or at
                    least an attempt at it. All the errors of natural thinking and psychology must
                    fall under one or other of three topics :— Knowing and the Known, Ignorance, and
                    Being. These are all-comprehensive, and are therefore the departments into which
                    philosophy is divided; for the sole end of philosophy is to correct the
                    inadvertencies of ordinary thinking. Hence it must be polemical.</p>
                <p>The problems of knowing and the known are treated in the “Epistemology or Theory
                    of Knowing,” under a series of twenty-two propositions and counter-propositions.
                    Each proposition contains a philosophic truth, and the corresponding
                    counter-proposition expresses the error of ordinary thinking regarding it. The
                    truth that <hi rend="italic">alvng with whatever any intelligence knows it must,
                    as the ground or condition of its knowledge, have some cognizance of itself</hi>
                    is the basis of the whole philosophical system; and, variously stated through a
                    series of propositions, it leads to the conclusion that the only independent
                    universe which any mind can think of is the universe in synthesis with some <hi
                    rend="italic">other</hi> mind or <hi rend="italic">ego.</hi></p>
                <p>The leading contradiction which is corrected in the “Agnoiology or Theory of
                    Ignorance” is this, that there can be an ignorance of that of which there can be
                    no knowledge. <hi rend="italic">Ignorance is a defect.</hi> But there is no
                    defect in not knowing what cannot be known by any intelligence, and therefore
                    there can be an ignorance only of that of which there can be a knowledge, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of some-object^o⅛s-some-subject, Ferrier lays special
                    claim to originality for this division of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutes.</hi></p>
                <p>The “Ontology or Theory of Being” forms the third and final division of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutes.</hi> It contains a discussion of the origin of
                    knowledge, in which Ferrier traces all the perplexities and errors of
                    philosophers to the assumption of the absolute existence of matter. The
                    conclusion arrived at is that the only true real and independent existences are
                    minds-together-with-that-which-they-apprehend, and that the one strictly
                    necessary absolute existence is a supreme and infinite and everlasting mind in
                    synthesis with all things.</p>
                <p>Ferrier’s works are perhaps the best propaedeutic to the study of metaphysics in
                    the English language. He has Berkeley’s charm of style, while he surveys
                    philosophical questions from a more advanced standpoint. His philosophic insight
                    was true from the first. Notwithstanding his disavowal of any indebtedness to
                    the German philosophers, his writings are imbued with the spirit of German
                    metaphysics; and he has the merit of being the first to question the right of Dr
                    Reid and his school to dominate the thought of Scotland. Others have arisen more
                    potent than he to read the riddle of the great German he admired so much; yet
                    those who seek a knowledge of the philosophy of the absolute will do wisely not
                    to neglect the works of Ferrier.</p>
                <p>A collected edition of Ferrier’s philosophical works, edited by his son-in-law
                    Sir Alexander Grant, and Professor E. L. Lushington, was published in 1866. This
                    edition contains Ferrier’s earlier contributions to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Blackwood,</hi> a few miscellaneous lectures, the biographies of Schelling and
                    Hegel contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Imperial Dictionary of Universal
                    Biography,</hi> some papers supplementary to the <hi rend="italic">Institutes of
                    Metaphysics,</hi> and the lectures in Greek philosophy which he delivered to his
                    class. In 1875 there was brought out a three-volume edition of Ferrier’s
                    philosophical works, including, along with the above, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutes of Metaphysics,</hi> of which two editions had been published in the
                    author’s lifetime one in 1854, and a second in 1856. (D. B.)</p>
