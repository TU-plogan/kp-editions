                    194-242). He was born at Place on 3d May 1648, and received the rudiments of his
                    education at the grammar-schools of Liskeard and Bodmin. In 1665 he was placed
                    at Westminster under Dr Busby, and after staying there for three years was
                    admitted a student at Christ Church, Oxford, taking his degrees in the following
                    order, B.A. in 1672, M.A. 1675, B.D. 1682, and D.D. 1686. It was the rule of
                    that house that its best scholars should, after they had taken their first
                    degree, be employed in editing some classical writer, and Prideaux was
                    accordingly deputed to superintend a new edition of Lucius Florus and to prepare
                    for the press, from a Greek MS. in the Bodleian, a work by Johannes Malalas. The
                    first of these works is now exceedingly scarce, if indeed a copy be in
                    existence, and the second was, on his advice, left in manuscript. The famous
                    Arundel marbles had just been given to the university, and Prideaux was
                    instructed to undertake the task of describing the gift, his transcript of the
                    inscriptions, with a commentary and additions from the Selden marbles, appearing
                    in 1676. In 1679 he was appointed to the rectory of St Clement’s, Oxford, and in
                    the same year became Hebrew lecturer at Christ Church, whereupon he published
                    two Hebrew tracts of Maimonides with a Latin translation and annotations.
                    Prideaux continued tutor at Christ Church until February 1686, holding for the
                    last three years the rectory of Bladon with Woodstock; but in 1686 he exchanged
                    for the benefice of Saham in Norfolk, and took up his residence in that county,
                    with which he had for some time been connected through his appointment in August
                    1681 to a prebendal stall in Norwich cathedral. The sympathies of Prideaux
                    inclined to Low Churchism in religion and to Whiggism in politics, and during
                    the years which immediately preceded and succeeded the Revolution of 1688 he
                    took an active part in the controversies of the day, publishing in quick
                    succession the following pamphlets— <hi rend="italic">The Validity of the Orders
                    of the Church of England</hi> (1688), <hi rend="italic">Letter to a Friend on
                    the Present Convocation</hi> (1690), <hi rend="italic">The Case of Clandestine
                    Marriages stated</hi> (1691). Prideaux was promoted to the archdeaconry of
                    Suffolk at the close of 1688 and to the deanery of Norwich in June 1702, and it
                    was the wish of some of the members of the episcopal bench that he should have
                    been appointed to the bishopric of Norwich, but their desires were not
                    gratified. In 1694 he was obliged, through ill-health, to resign the rectory of
                    Saham, and after having held the vicarage of Trowse for fourteen years <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n747/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0747-0724"/> (1696-1710) he found himself incapacitated, by
                    repeated attacks of stone, from further parochial duty. He died at Norwich on
                    1st November 1724, and was buried in the cathedral on 4th November. His wife,
                    Bridget, only daughter and sole heir of Anthony Bokenham of Helmingham, Suffolk,
                    died at Norwich in November 1700; they were married on 16th February 1686.</p>
                <p>Many of the dean’s writings were of great value, and their popularity continued
                    unimpaired down to the present century. His <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    Mahomet,</hi> originally published in 1697, had passed through eight editions by
                    1723, and his <hi rend="italic">Directions to Churchwardens,</hi> first issued
                    in 1701, reached a twelfth edition in 1871. But the favour with which these
                    volumes were received, great as it was, contrasts but badly with the
                    extraordinary success of his account of <hi rend="italic">The Old and New
                    Testament connected in the History of the Jews,</hi> a work of great research
                    and learning. This has been many times reissued since the appearance of the
                    first part in 1716, and has been translated into the French, German, and Italian
                    languages. Le Clerc subjected it to a critical examination. A series of remarks
                    upon it is contained in Walter Moyle’s works, and continuations were compiled by
                    Samuel Shuckford and Michael Russell. Prideaux published several small tracts,
                    and many volumes of manuscript collections are in the possession of his
                    descendant at Place. These, with particulars of the dean’s letters in print and
                    in manuscript and with bibliographical details of his numerous publications, are
                    described in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Comubiensis,</hi> ii. 527-533 and
                    iii. 1319. A volume of his letters to John Ellis, some time under-secretary of
                    state, was edited by Mr E. Μ. Thompson for the Camden Society in 1875, and
                    contained a vivid picture of Oxford life after the Restoration; but it will
                    always be regretted that some passages in his correspondence should betray
                    feelings unworthy of the writer. An anonymous life of Dean Prideaux appeared in
                    1748, but it was mainly compiled from a larger memoir by his son.</p>
