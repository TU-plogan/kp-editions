                    apothecary’s assistant at Itzehoe. Ambition and a strong inclination towards a
                    scientific career led him to throw up his business and remove to Berlin, where
                    he entered the university in 1820. Here his abilities were speedily recognized,
                    and in 1823 he was appointed meteorological observer to the Academy of Sciences
                    with a small salary, which was important to him, inasmuch as the expenses of his
                    university career had nearly exhausted his slender patrimony. Even at this early
                    period he had conceived the idea of founding a physical and chemical scientific
                    journal. The realization of this plan was hastened by the sudden death of
                    Gilbert, the editor of <hi rend="italic">Gilbert's</hi><hi rend="italic">Annalen
                    der Physik,</hi> in 1824. Poggendorff immediately put himself in communication
                    with the publisher, Barth of Leipsic, with the result that he was installed as
                    editor of a scientific journal which was to be a continuation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gilbert's</hi><hi rend="italic">Annalen</hi> on a somewhat
                    extended plan, indicated by its title <hi rend="italic">Annalen der Physik und
                    Chemie.</hi> Poggendorff was admirably qualified for the post which he thus
                    attained. He had an extraordinary memory, well-stored with scientific knowledge,
                    both moderr and historical, which served him in good stead in the critical part
                    of his editorial duty. He had a cool and impartial judgment, with a strong
                    preference for facts as against theory of the speculative kind at least, and was
                    able to throw himself into the spirit of modern experimental science,
                    represented in the early part of his editorial career by such great names as
                    Berzelius, Faraday, Brewster, Fresnel, Régnault. He also possessed in more than
                    German measure the German virtue of orderliness in the arrangement of knowledge
                    and in the conduct of business. To this he added an engaging geniality of manner
                    and much tact in dealing with men; so marked in fact was this part of his
                    character that, notwithstanding his somewhat trying position, he never during
                    his long life was involved in anything that could be fairly called a literary
                    quarrel. These qualities of its editor soon made <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poggendorff's</hi><hi rend="italic">Annalen</hi> the foremost scientific
                    journal in Europe. He collected around him all the eminent seien-tific<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n283/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0283-0274"/> men of his own country, and he managed, either
                    through original contributions or by translations of memoirs of approved value
                    already printed, to secure for many years an adequate representation of the
                    scientific work of other lands. So true is this that, for years after the
                    beginning of Poggendorff’s editorship, the tables of contents of his annual
                    volumes read like an index of the history of physical science.</p>
                <p>In the course of his fifty-two years’ editorship of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annalen</hi> Poggendorfi could not fail to acquire an unusual acquaintance with
                    the labours of modern men of science. This knowledge, joined to what he had
                    gathered by historical reading of equally unusual extent, he carefully digested
                    and gave to the world in his <hi rend="italic">Biographisch-literarisches
                    Handbuch zur Geschichte der Exacten Wissenschaften,</hi> containing notices of
                    the lives and labours of mathematicians, astronomers, physicists, chemists,
                    mineralogists, geologists, &lt;fcc., of all peoples and all ages. The two
                    volumes of this work contain an astounding collection of facts invaluable to the
                    scientific biographer and historian; they form in fact the basis of the yet
                    unwritten history of physical science. We possess a small fragment of such a
                    history in the form of lectures delivered by Poggendorfi himself at Berlin; and
                    probably he had contemplated at one time writing a continuous narrative; but
                    even his long life was too short for the double task of collecting and using the
                    material.</p>
                <p>Poggendorfi was a physicist of high although not of the very highest rank. He wàs
                    wanting in mathematical ability, and never displayed in any remarkable degree
                    the still more important power of scientific generalization, which, whether
                    accompanied by mathematical skill or not, never fails to mark the highest genius
                    in physical science. He was, however, an able and conscientious experimenter. He
                    was very fertile and ingenious in devising physical apparatus, and contributed
                    greatly in the earlier part of his life to enrich the resources of experimental
                    science. Contemporaneously with Schweigger, he succeeded in greatly increasing
                    the sensitiveness of the galvanometer by introducing the multiplying coil, and
                    he made important improvements on that particular type of this instrument which
                    is usually called the sine galvanometer. To him (according to Wiedemann) we owe
                    the use of binding screws in most of their various forms. He invented the
                    “Inversor” for rapidly alternating the direction of a voltaic current, and the
                    “Wippe” for throwing a number of voltaic or electrolytic cells suddenly into
                    “series” or into “multiple arc”; and to him is due the suggestion of the
                    telescope and mirror method for reading galvanometers and other physical
                    instruments, a device which has proved very valuable in all branches of physical
                    science.</p>
                <p>Poggendorff’s contributions to physics were published for the most part in his
                    own journal. They form an important part of the scientific work of the 19th
                    century; but it would be difficult in a few words to characterize them inasmuch
                    as they do not constitute a single coherent group or even a few coherent groups
                    of connected researches. By far the greater and more important part of his work
                    related to electricity and magnetism. As specimens we may mention his
                    investigations into the working of Holtz’s machines, and his variations on their
                    construction; his researches on the resistance and electromotive force of
                    electrolytic cells, along with which ought to be noticed his admirable method of
                    comparing electromotive forces by “compensation”; and finally his researches on
                    magnetism and diamagnetism.</p>
                <p>Poggendorff’s literary and scientific reputation speedily brought him honourable
                    recognition. In 1830 he was made royal professor and in 1834 Hon. Ph.D. and
                    extraordinary professor in the university of Berlin, and in 1839 member of the
                    Berlin Academy of Sciences. He ultimately became a member of many foreign
                    societies, and received more than the usual share of the orders bestowed by
                    Continental nations for scientific merit. During his lifetime many offers of
                    ordinary professorships were made to him, but he declined them all, devoting
                    himself to his duties as editor of the <hi rend="italic">Annalen,</hi> and to
                    the pursuit of his scientific researches. He died at Berlin on January 24,
                    1877.</p>
