                    >(Punica Granatum)</hi> is of exceptional interest by reason of its structure,
                    its history, and its utility. It forms a tree of small stature, or a bush with
                    opposite, shining, lance-shaped leaves, from the axils of some of which proceed
                    the brilliant scarlet flowers. These are raised on a short stalk, and consist of
                    a thick fleshy cylindrical or bell-shaped calyx tube, with five to seven short
                    lobes at the top. From the throat of the calyx proceed five to seven roundish,
                    crumpled, scarlet or crimson petals, and below them very numerous slender
                    stamens. The pistil consists of two rows of carpels placed one above another,
                    both rows embedded in, and partially inseparate from, the inner surface of the
                    calyx tube. The styles are confluent into one filiform thread. The fruit, which
                    usually attains the size of a large orange, consists of a hard leathery rind,
                    which is the enlarged calyx tube, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0461-0442"/> enclosing a quantity of pulp derived from the
                    coats of the numerous seeds. This pulp, filled as it is with refreshing acid
                    juice, constitutes the chief value of the tree. The more highly cultivated forms
                    contain more of it than the wild or half-wild varieties. The great structural
                    peculiarity consists in the presence of the two rows of carpels one above
                    another (a state of things which occurs exceptionally in apples and oranges),
                    and in the fact that, while in the lower series (fig. 1 ) the seeds are attached
                    to the inner border or lower angle of the cavity, they occupy the outer side in
                    the upper series (fig. 2), as if, during growth, the upper whorl had become
                    completely bent over.</p>
                <p>By Bentham and Hooker the genus <hi rend="italic">Punica</hi> is included under
                    <hi rend="italic">Lythraceae</hi>; others consider it more nearly allied to the
                    myrtles; while its peculiarities are so great as, in the opinion of many
                    botanists, to justify its inclusion in a separate order. Not only is the fruit
                    valuable in hot countries for the sake of its pulp, but the rind and the bark
                    and the outer part of the root are valuable as astringentsowing to the large
                    quantity of tannin that they contain. The bark of the root is likewise valued in
                    cases of tape-worm.</p>
                <p>The tree is without doubt wild in Afghanistan, north-western India, and the
                    districts south and south-west of the Caspian, but it has been so long
                    cultivated that it is difficult to say whether it is really native in Palestine
                    and the Mediterranean region. It has been cited as wild in northern Africa, but
                    this appears to be a mistake. Recently, however, Prof. Bayley Balfour met with a
                    wild species, heretofore unknown, in the island of Socotra, the flowers of which
                    have only a single row of carpels, which suggests the inference that it may have
                    been the source of the cultivated varieties. But, on the other hand, in
                    Afghanistan, where Aitchison met with the tree truly wild, a double row of
                    carpels was present as usual. The antiquity of the tree as a cultivated plant is
                    evidenced by the Sanskrit name <hi rend="italic">Dâdimba,</hi> and by the
                    references to the fruit in the Old Testament, and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey,</hi> where it is spoken of as cultivated in the gardens of the kings
                    of Phaeaeia and Phrygia. The fruit is frequently represented on ancient Assyrian
                    and Egyptian sculptures, and had a religious significance in connexion with
                    several Oriental cults, especially the Phrygian cult of Cybele (Arnob., v. 5 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.∙,</hi> see also Baudissin, <hi rend="italic">Studien,</hi> ii.
                    207 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> It was well known to the Greeks and Romans, who
                    were acquainted with its medicinal properties an'd its use as a tanning
                    material. The name given by the Romans, <hi rend="italic">malum punicum,</hi>
                    indicates that they received it from Carthage, as indeed is expressly stated by
                    Pliny; and this circumstance has given rise to the notion that the tree was
                    indigenous in northern Africa. On a review of the whole evidence, botanical,
                    literary, and linguistic, Alphonse de Candolle <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Origine</hi><hi rend="italic">des Plantes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cultivées)</hi> pronounces against its African origin, and decides in favour of
                    its source in Persia and the neighbouring countries. According to Saporta the
                    pomegranate existed in a fossil state in beds of the Pliocene epoch near
                    Meximieux in Burgundy. The pomegranate is sometimes met with in cultivation
                    against a wall in England, but it is too tender to withstand a severe winter.
                    The double-flowered varieties are specially desirable for the beauty and long
                    duration of their flowers.</p>
