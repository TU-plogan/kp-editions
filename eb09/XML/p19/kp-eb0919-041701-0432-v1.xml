                <p><label type="entry">POLYGLOTT</label>. A polyglott is a book which contains side
                    by side versions of the same text in several different languages; and the most
                    important polyglotte are editions of the Bible, or its parts, in which the
                    Hebrew and Greek originals are exhibited along with the great historical
                    versions, which are of value for the history of the text and its interpretation.
                    The first enterprise of this kind is the famous <hi rend="italic">Hexapla</hi>
                    of Origen: but here only Hebrew and</p>
                <p>Greek were employed (though the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion
                    were shown as well as the Septuagint), so that the work was rather diglott than
                    polyglott in the usual sense. After the invention of printing and the revival of
                    philological studies, polyglotte became a favourite means of advancing the
                    knowledge of Eastern languages (for which no good helps were available) as well
                    as the study of Scripture. The series began with the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Complutensian</hi> (Alcala, 1514-17), already spoken of in the article on
                    its promoter Cardinal <hi rend="smallcaps">Jimenes</hi> or Ximenes; next came
                    the <hi rend="italic">Antwerp</hi><hi rend="italic">Polyglott</hi> (1569-72, in
                    8 vols, folio) of which the principal editor was Arias Montanus aided by Guido
                    Fabricius Boderianus, Raphelengius, Masius, Lucas of Bruges, and others. This
                    work was under the patronage of Philip II. of Spain; it added a new language to
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">Complutensian</hi> by including the Syriac New
                    Testament; and, while the earlier polyglott had only the Targum of Onkelos on
                    the Pentateuch, the Antwerp Bible had also the Targum on the Prophets, and on
                    Esther, Job, Psalms, and the Salomonie writings. Next came Le Jay’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Paris</hi><hi rend="italic">Polyglott</hi> (1645), which
                    embraces the first prints of the Syriac Old Testament (edited by Gabriel
                    Sionita, a Maronite, but the book of Ruth by Abraham Ecchelensis, also a
                    Maronite) and of the Samaritan Pentateuch and version (by <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Morinus,</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.').</hi> It has also an Arabic version,
                    or rather a series of various Arabic versions. Le Jay’s work is a splendid piece
                    of typography, but its success was marred by the appearance of the cheaper and
                    more comprehensive <hi rend="italic">London</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Polyglott.</hi> Le Jay was ruined, and a great part of the impression went
                    to the trunkmakers. The last great polyglott is Walton’s (London, 1657), which
                    is much less beautiful than Le Jay’s, but more complete in various ways,
                    including among other things the Syriac of Esther and several apocryphal books
                    for which it is wanting in the Paris Bible, Persian versions of the Pentateuch
                    and Gospels, the Psalms and New Testament in Ethiopie. Walton was aided by able
                    scholars, and used much new manuscript material. His prolegomena, too, and
                    collections of various readings mark an important advance in Biblical criticism.
                    It was in connexion with this polyglott that E. Castle produced his famous <hi
                        rend="italic">Heptaglott Lexicon</hi> (London, 2 vols, folio, 1669), an
                    astounding monument of industry and erudition even when allowance is made for
                    the fact that for the Arabic he had the great MS. lexicon compiled and left to
                    the university of Cambridge by the almost forgotten W. Bedwell. The later
                    polyglotts are of little scientific importance, the best recent texts having
                    been confined to a single language; but every Biblical student still uses Walton
                    and, if he can get it, Le Jay. Of the numerous polyglotts on parts of the Bible
                    it may suffice to mention the Genoa psalter of 1516, edited by Giustiniani,
                    bishop of Nebbio. It is in Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Chaldee, and Arabic, and is
                    interesting from the character of the Chaldee text, from being the first
                    specimen of Western printing in the Arabic character, and from a curious note on
                    Columbus and the discovery of America on the margin of Psalm xix.</p>
