                <p>§ 1. <hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Among the varied and fruitful observations
                    of the early microscopists, Rösel v. Rosenhofs excellent account (1755) of his
                    “Proteus animalcule” (the-familiar <hi rend="italic">Amoeba)</hi> is especially
                    noteworthy as the earliest description of the form and movements of what we now
                    know as a mass of living protoplasm. Such discoveries, as those of rotation in
                    the cell of <hi rend="italic">Chara</hi> (Corti, 1772), and of similar movements
                    in other plant cells <hi rend="italic">(Vallisneria^</hi> Meyen, 1827; <hi
                    rend="italic">Tradescantia,</hi> R. Brown, 1831), are also memorable,—more so
                    indeed in this relation than is the great contemporaneous movement in general
                    histology, since this, though aided by the rapid improvement of the microscope,
                    eagerly carried on by the united labours of zoologists and botanists, headed by
                    Johannes Müller and Robert Brown, and culminating in the hands of Schleiden and
                    Schwann (1838-39) in the fundamental morphological generalization of the cell
                    theory (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Morphology),</hi> included views of the
                    structure, origin, and function of the cell-substance alike erroneous and
                    misleading. Knowledge had in fact to start afresh from the level of the
                    unappreciated discovery of Rosenhof; and it is accordingly from the observations
                    of Dujardin on <hi rend="italic">Foraminifera</hi> (1835) that our modern
                    knowledge of protoplasm dates. His main account is still worth reading in his
                    own words. In proposing the term “sarcode,” he says, “je propose de nommer ainsi
                    ce que d’autres observateurs ont appelé une gelée vivante, cette substance
                    glutineuse, diaphane, insoluble dans l’eau, se contractant en masses
                    globuleuses, s’attachant aux aiguilles de dissection, et se laissant étirer
                    comme du mucus, enfin se trouvant dans tous les animaux inférieurs interposée
                    aux autres éléments de structure.” Though thus dissipating many errors, and
                    placing the study of the lowest forms of life on its true basis, Dujardin
                    unfortunately did not see the full bearing of his discovery. He recognized his
                    sarcode, however, in the polyps, and noted that the ova of the slug exhibited
                    similar movements. The next important step was not taken until 1846, when the
                    botanist Hugo von Mohl, working on quite independent lines, reached a clearly
                    defined conception of the vegetable cell, not only, as usual hitherto,
                    distinguishing the cell wall and the nucleus from the cell contents <hi
                    rend="italic">(Zellsaft∖</hi> but also the “tough, slimy, granular, semifluid”
                    constituent from the watery cell-sap hitherto generally confused with it under
                    the common name. For this substance (which Schleiden had already vaguely
                    mentioned as “Schleim”) he proposed the term “protoplasma” (πρώτος, first,
                    7rλ&lt;ισ∕zα, formed substance). The discovery of the amoeboid movements of
                    colourless blood corpuscles dates from the same year, and the basis was thus
                    prepared for Ecker’s acute comparison (1849) of the “formed contractile
                    substance” of muscle with the “unformed contractile substance” of the lowest
                    types of animal life. This <pb break="no"

                <p>speculation, so profoundly anticipatory of our present standpoint (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Physiology),</hi> was greatly strengthened when Bonders shortly
                    afterwards succeeded in referring contractility from the cell-membrane to the
                    cell-substance. Cohn’s researches among microscopic plants and animals, and
                    particularly his study of the transition, which at that time seemed so
                    marvellous and so perplexing, from plantlike quiescence to animal-like activity,
                    exhibited by the protoplasm of such an alga as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protococcus</hi> on escaping from its cell-wall, led him to suggest that
                    vegetable protoplasm and animal sarcode, “if not identical, must be at any rate
                    in the highest degree analogous substances.” This speculation again ran too far
                    in advance of current conceptions, dominated as these were by the errors which
                    accompanied the cell-theory, and another decade of research was needed for its
                    establishment. This was effected on several simultaneous and convergent lines.
                    The botanical evidence culminated in De Bary’s classical monograph of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Myxomycètes</hi> (1859); the study of the segmentation of the
                    ovum, and the rapid advance of animal histology, both largely due to Kölliker,
                    were of marked importance; while the clear identification of the vegetable
                    “protoplasm” with the animal “sarcode,” requiring, as it did, a mastery of all
                    these lines and results of inquiry, was finally effected by Μ. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Schultze</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(ç.v.),</hi> whose researches
                    on <hi rend="italic">Foraminifera</hi> (1854), and subsequent admirable studies
                    in animal histology, prepared him to accomplish the definite reform of the
                    cell-theory. This he did by fully and finally replacing (1861-63) the early
                    conception of the cell as an all-important membrane enclosing a nucleus
                    surrounded by fluid by that of a unit-mass of living matter or protoplasm (the
                    nucleus alone being viewed as essential, the wall or membrane no longer so). Our
                    present usage of the term protoplasm for the living substance of the animal as
                    well as of the plant dates from Schultze’s paper (“Ueber Muskelkörperchen und
                    das was man eine Zelle zu nennen habe,” <hi rend="italic">Arch,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">f. Anat. u.</hi><hi rend="italic">Physiol.,</hi> 1861); and the
                    term sarcode, notwithstanding Dujardin’s priority, has since lapsed into disuse,
                    save to some extent among French authors.</p>
                <p>This rejuvenescence of the cell theory, in a form pointing to a far deeper unity
                    of the forms and processes of organic nature than its founders had ventured to
                    dream, marks the commencement of a new epoch of detailed investigation of all
                    the forms, aspects, conditions, and products of protoplasmic life; but in this
                    movement the workers are too numerous for mention save in so far as may be
                    incidental in the following scanty reference to some of their main results
                    (1).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These numbers refer

                <p>§ 2. <hi rend="italic">Appearance and Properties of Protoplasm.—</hi> To obtain a
                    notion of the appearance and physical properties of protoplasm, it is expedient
                    as it were to repeat the process of discovery, and acquire concrete ideas by
                    actual observation as far as possible, or at least from good figures. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Amoeba</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Protozoa)</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Foraminifera</hi> (g ’.v.) thus afford convenient and classical
                    examples of the protoplasm of the lowest animal forms; the colourless corpuscles
                    of blood should also be examined, and the structure of the higher tissues (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Histology)</hi>
                    inquired into, and the segmentation of an ovum (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Reproduction)</hi> observed,—most conveniently perhaps in frog spawn. Vegetable
                    examples are readily obtained from the cells of a growing shoot (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Botany,</hi> vol. iv. pp. 83 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> figs.
                    1 and 6); while the living cells of <hi rend="italic">Chara</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Botany,</hi> fig. 7) and other examples of protoplasmic
                    movement should be observed. Thus, with the aid of the descriptive passages to
                    be found in the articles referred to at the outset, a tolerably clear idea of a
                    mass of protoplasm, with its contained granules of various kinds and its
                    sap-vacuoles, will be obtained; and its frequent differentiation into an outer
                    layer or ectoplasm, clearer and denser, passing into an inner layer or
                    endoplasm, usually more fluid and granular, will be noted. A finely reticulated
                    structure of the protoplasm may also be made out in many cases; the nucleus
                    (inconspicuous since equally refracting with the protoplasm during life, but
                    brought out clearly after death by the process of internal digestion of the
                    surrounding protoplasm, or by the application of dyes and other reagents), and
                    its contained nucleolus, as well as the cell-wall when present, will be
                    observed. Wide variations of consistency will thus be noted from the
                    comparatively solid, almost brittle, state of the quiescent protoplasm of some
                    seeds to its thin, syrupy, and largely vacuolated state in a growing vegetable
                    tissue <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Botany,</hi> fig. 6).
                    Such structural inquiries are now in active progress, especially in connection
                    with the process of cell division (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Histology,
                    Reproduction),</hi> and many questions of detail are more or less under active
                    dispute, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the relation of the nucleus to the
                    protoplasm the existence or constancy of an internal network (the “stroma”) in
                    both, the conditions of occurrence of that continuity of protoplasm lately shown
                    to exist through the cell walls of many vegetable tissues, and so on (2).</p>
                <p>§ 3. <hi rend="italic">Manifestations of Life (Functions).—</hi> The vital
                    properties or “functions” exhibited by undifferentiated living protoplasm <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g., Amoeba)</hi> are usually enumerated as contractility,
                    irritability and automatism, reception and assimilation of food, metabolism with
                    secretion and excretion, respiration, and reproduction. Thus we have represented
                    all those functions which in higher animals seem to be confined to special
                    tissues—which we accordingly recognize as muscular or nervous, secretory or
                    excretory, respiratory, reproductive, or the like. Yet in these organs, however
                    apparently specialized to one function only, a residue of all or nearly all the
                    other fundamental properties of protoplasm remains and may be redeveloped; and
                    thus those functional changes (necessarily accompanying morphological evolution
                    or change of environment) which we call “adaptation” and those pathological
                    disturbances which we term “disease” are alike provided for. See <hi

                    —The behaviour of protoplasm under various modifications of physical conditions
                    has been investigated by Schultze, Kühne, Strasburger, Engelmann, and others,
                    while not a few researches are also extant as to the behaviour of living cells
                    under various chemical stimuli, among which those of Darwin (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Insectivorous Plants)</hi> and Frommann may be mentioned as
                    especially suggestive. See also <hi rend="smallcaps">Schizo-</hi> MYCETES, <hi

                <p>§ 6. <hi rend="italic">Chemical Composition and Processes.—</hi> This aspect of
                    protoplasm is of constantly increasing importance, since for the chemist all
                    functions alike can only be viewed in terms of those specific anabolic or
                    katabolic changes which to the physiologist, on the other hand, seem mere
                    accompaniments of them (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Physiology, Nutrition,
                    Reproduction).</hi> The determination of the chemical nature cf protoplasm is
                    thus the supreme problem of physiological chemistry; and, while, thanks to the
                    labours of Reinke, E. Schultze, and others, there has been a rapidly increasing
                    knowledge of its anastates, but more especially of its katastates, and of many
                    cases of the unity of metabolic processes throughout nature, several daring
                    general hypotheses are already in the field. Of these that of Schützen - berger,
                    who views proteid bodies as complex ureides, and that of Loew and Bokorny, who
                    regard them as a complex mixture of aldehyde groups, are examples. See (5).</p>
