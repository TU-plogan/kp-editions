                    Asia, a national appellation, but a purely territorial one, derived from its
                    proximity to the Euxine, often called simply Pontus by the Greeks. Originally it

                    from the borders of Cilicia to the Euxine; but afterwards it came to be divided
                    into two satrapies or governments, of which the northernmost came to be
                    distinguished as “Cappadocia on the Pontus,” and thence simply as “Pontus.” The
                    term is not, however, found either in Herodotus or Xenophon, though the latter
                    traversed a considerable part of the region, and it is probable that it did not
                    come into general use until after the time of Alexander the Great. Under the
                    Persian empire the province continued to be governed by a satrap, nominally
                    subject to the great king, but apparently enjoying virtual independence, as no

                    authorities in this part of Asia. The first of these local satraps who assumed
                    the title of king was Ariobarzanes, about the beginning of the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> who was reckoned the founder of the dynasty; but its
                    history as an independent monarchy really begins with Mithradates II., who
                    commenced his reign in 337 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> From this time Pontus
                    continued to be ruled by a succession of kings of the same dynasty, mostly
                    bearing the name of Mithradates, whose independence was respected by the
                    Macedonian sovereigns of Asia, and who were able gradually to extend their power
                    along the shores of the Euxine. The capture of the important city of Sinope by
                    Pharnaces I. (about 183 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) led to the extension of
                    their frontier to that of Bithynia; while under Mithradates VI., commonly known
                    as the Great, their dominion for a time comprised a large part of Asia Minor.
                    The history of the reign of that monarch and his wars with the Romans will be
                    found under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">Mithradates.</hi> After his final
                    defeat by Pompey in 65 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Pontus was again confined
                    within its original limits, but was united with Bithynia as a Roman province,
                    and this union generally continued to subsist, though not without interruption,
                    under the Roman empire. A portion of the original dominion of the kings of
                    Pontus was, however, separated from the rest by Antony in 36 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and placed under the government of a Greek
                    rhetorician named Polemon, whose descendants continued to rule it till the reign
                    of Nero, when it was finally annexed to the Roman empire (63 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> Hence this part of the country came to be known as
                    Pontus Polemoniacus, by which epithet it was still distinguished as a Roman
                    province. The interior district in the south-west, adjoining Galatia, hence came
                    to be known as Pontus Galaticus.</p>
                <p>Pontus, in the proper sense of the term, as defined by Strabo, who was himself a
                    native of the country, was bounded by the river Halys on the west, and by
                    Colchis and the Lesser Armenia on the east. Its exact frontier in this direction
                    is not specified, but it may be taken as extending as far as the mouth of the
                    river Acampsis. The region thus limited may be considered as divided into two
                    portions, differing much in their physical characters. The western half presents
                    considerable plains and upland tracts in the interior, stretching away till they
                    join the still more extensive uplands of Cappadocia and Galatia. Besides the
                    great river Halys that forms its boundary on the west, this region is traversed
                    by the river Iris, and its tributary the Lycus, both of which have their rise in
                    the highlands on the frontiers of Armenia, and are very considerable streams,
                    flowing through fertile valleys. The Thermodon, which enters the Euxine a little
                    to the east of the Iris, is a much less important stream, though celebrated from
                    its connexion with the fable of the Amazons. On the other hand the eastern
                    portion of Pontus, between Armenia and the Euxine, is throughout a very rugged
                    and mountainous country, furrowed by deep valleys descending from the inland
                    range of mountains, known to the ancients as Paryadres, which has a direction
                    nearly parallel to the sea-coast, and is continued to the frontiers of Colchis
                    under the name of Scydises and various other appellations. These mountains have
                    in all ages been almost inaccessible, and even in the time of Strabo were
                    inhabited by wild tribes who had never been really reduced to subjection by any
                    government. But the coast from Trebizond westward is one of the most beautiful
                    parts of Asia Minor, and is justly extolled by Strabo for its wonderful
                    productiveness in fruits of every description.</p>
                <p>The population of the greater part of Pontus was undoubtedly of the same race
                    with that of Cappadocia, of which it originally formed a part, and was therefore
                    clearly of Semitic origin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Such at least was the general opinion of Greek writers. The Semitic or
                    Aramaean origin of the Cappadocians has, whoever, in modern times been
                    questioned by Nöldeke and other authorities on Semitic ethnology.</p></note>
                    Both nations were frequently comprised by the Greeks under the term Leucosyri or
                    White Syrians. But the rugged mountain districts in the north-east, towards the
                    frontiers of Colchis and Armenia, were occupied by a number of semi-barbarous
                    tribes, of whose ethnical relations we are wholly ignorant. Such were the
                    Chaldaeans or Chalybes (identified by the Greeks with the people of that name
                    mentioned by Homer), the Tibareni, the Mosynoeci, and the Macrones. Some light
                    is thrown on the manners and condition of these people by Xenophon, who
                    traversed their country on his march from Trapezus to Cotyora <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anab.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> v.) but we have otherwise hardly
                    any information concerning them.</p>
                <p>The sea-coast of Pontus, like the rest of the south shore of the Euxine, was from
                    an early period studded with Greek colonies, most of them of Milesian origin,
                    though in many cases deriving their settlement directly from Sinope, itself a
                    colony of Miletus. Next to that city, between the mouth of the Halys and that of
                    the Iris, stood Amisus, originally a colony direct from Miletus, but which
                    subsequently received a body of Athenian settlers. It was one of the most
                    flourishing of the Greek colonies on this coast, and is still a considerable
                    town under the name of Samsun. Proceeding eastward from thence, we find Side,
                    called in later times Polemonium; Cotyora, a colony of Sinope, where Xenophon
                    embarked with the ten thousand Greeks; Cerasus, afterwards named Pharnacia; and
                    Trapezus, also a colony of Sinope, which was a flourishing and important town in
                    the days of Xenophon, but did not attain till a later period to the paramount
                    position which it occupied under the Roman and Byzantine empire, and which it
                    still retains under the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Trebizond</hi> (g <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>.v.).</p>
                <p>But, besides these Greek settlements, there were in the interior of Pontus
                    several cities of considerable importance, which were of native origin, though
                    they had gradually received a certain amount of Greek culture. The principal of
                    these were Amasia, on the river Iris, the birth-place of Strabo, which was made
                    the capital of his kingdom by Mithradates the Great, but had previously been the
                    burial-place of the earlier kings, whose tombs are still extant, and have been
                    described by Hamilton and other travellers; Comana, higher up the valley of the
                    same river, which, like the place of the same name in Cappadocia, was
                    consecrated to a native goddess named Ma, identified by Strabo with the Greek
                    Enyo, and derived great celebrity from its sacred character, having a large
                    fixed population under the direct government of the priests, besides being the
                    resort of thousands of pilgrims; Zela, nearer the frontier of Galatia, which was
                    in like manner consecrated to a goddess named Anaitis; and Cabira, in the valley
                    of the Lycus, afterwards called Neocaesarea, a name still retained in the
                    abbreviated form of the modern Niksar. Several smaller towns are mentioned by
                    Strabo as giving name to the surrounding districts, of which he has left us the
                    names of not less than fifteen; but these obscure appellations of local
                    divisions are in themselves of little interest, and for the most part not
                    mentioned by any other writer. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. h. b.)</hi></p>
