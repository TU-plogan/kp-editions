                <p><label type="entry">POOLE</label>, a market town, municipal borough, county in
                    itself, and seaport of Dorsetshire, on the south coast of England, is
                    picturesquely situated on a peninsula between Holes Bay and Poole Harbour, 30
                    miles east from Dorchester and 120 south-west of London. The churches are
                    modern, and possess no features of special interest. Among the principal public
                    buildings are the town-house, 1721; the guild-hall, formerly the market-house,
                    1761; the old town-hall, built in 1572; the custom-house; and the mechanics’
                    institute. On Brownsea Island in the middle of Poole Harbour is a small castle
                    erected as a fortress by Elizabeth and strengthened by Charles I. At low water
                    Poole Harbour is entirely emptied except a narrow channel, but at full tide the
                    water covers an area about 7 miles long by about 4⅜ broad. The quays lined with
                    warehouses are about one mile in length, and can be approached by vessels of
                    very large tonnage. There is a large general trade with the British colonies and
                    the United States, and an important coasting trade, especially in corn to
                    London, and Purbeck clay to the Staffordshire potteries. In 1883 the number of
                    vessels that entered the harbour was 933 of 81,003 tons, the number that cleared
                    874 of 77,948 tons. Some shipbuilding is carried on, and there are manufactures
                    of cordage, netting, and sailcloth. The town also possesses large potteries,
                    decorative tile works, iron-foundries, engineering works, agricultural implement
                    works, and flour-mills. The area of the borough is 5111 acres, with a population
                    in 1871 of 10,129, and in 1881 of 12,310 (5820 males and 6490 females).</p>
                <p>Poole derives its name from being nearly surrounded by a sheet of water. There
                    was a Roman road between it and Wimbourne. It is not mentioned in Domesday,
                    being included in Canford, but it enjoyed certain immunities before 1248, when
                    it received a charter from William Longsword. In the reign of Edward III. it
                    supplied four ships and 94 men for the siege of Calais. Mιιch of its succeeding
                    prosperity was due to the presence of Spanish merchants, and after the outbreak
                    of war with Spain in the reign of Elizabeth its trade for a time declined. Its
                    charter was extended by Elizabeth, who reincorporated it, and erected it into a
                    county in itself. It has a sheriff elected annually, and a separate court of
                    quarter sessions. It is divided into two wards, and is governed by a mayor, six
                    aidermen, and eighteen councillors. It returned two members to parliament as
                    early as the reign of Edward III., but one only from 1868 to 1885.</p>
