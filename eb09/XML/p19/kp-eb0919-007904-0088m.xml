                    life, <hi rend="italic">La Cecchina, ossia la Buona Figliuola,</hi> an <hi
                    rend="italic">opera buff a</hi> which attained a European success, little less
                    remarkable than that of Pergolesi’s <hi rend="italic">Serva</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Padrona.</hi> In a very short time this charming piece found its
                    way not only to every theatre in Italy, but to Paris, to London, and to every
                    great city on the Continent. It was even represented by marionettes; and every
                    new fashion was named <hi rend="italic">alia Cecchina.</hi> Six years after this
                    Piccini was invited to Paris. He knew nothing of French, but his librettist,
                    Marmontel, assisted him to such good purpose that, after the production of his
                    first French opera, <hi rend="italic">Roland,</hi> he was carried home from the
                    theatre in triumph. All his next works were successful; but, unhappily, the
                    directors of the Grand Opéra conceived the mad idea of deliberately opposing him
                    to Gluck, by persuading the two composers to treat the same subject— <hi
                    rend="italic">Iphigénie</hi><hi rend="italic">en Tauride</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> simultaneously. The Parisian public now divided itself into two rival
                    parties, which, under the names of Gluckists and Piccinists, carried on an
                    unworthy and disgraceful war, equally ruinous to both artists, who would gladly
                    have withdrawn from its violent excesses. That the final victory should be
                    obtained by the Gluckists was inevitable; for Piccini, though a brilliant
                    ornament of the Italian school, was no match for his illustrious antagonist.
                    Gluck’s masterly <hi rend="italic">Iphigénie</hi> was first produced on May 18,
                    1779. Piccini’s <hi rend="italic">Iphigénie</hi> followed on January 23, 1781,
                    and, though performed seventeen times, was afterwards consigned to oblivion. The
                    fury of the rival parties continued unabated, even after Gluck’s departure from
                    Paris in 1780; and an attempt was afterwards made to inaugurate a new rivalry
                    with Sacchini. Still, Piccini held a good position, and on the death of Gluck,
                    in 1787, proposed that a public monument should be erected to his memory,—a
                    suggestion which the Gluckists themselves declined to support. On the breaking
                    out of the Revolution in 1789, Piccini returned to Naples, where he was at first
                    well received by King Ferdinand IV.; but the marriage of his daughter to a
                    French democrat brought him into irretrievable disgrace. For nine years after
                    this he maintained a precarious existence in Venice, Naples, and Rome; but,
                    deriving new hope from the declaration of peace, he returned in 1798 to Paris,
                    where the fickle public received him with enthusiasm, but left him to starve. He
                    died at Passy, May 7, 1800.</p>
                <p>Fétis gives a complete list of Piccitii’s works, including eighty operas, and
                    much choral music. It is certain that the list of operas is very far from
                    complete.</p>
