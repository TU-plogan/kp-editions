                    Ferrara, afterwards absorbed in the duchy of Modena. The family was illustrious
                    and wealthy, and claimed descent from Constantine. From his childhood Pico was
                    remarkable for his quick and tenacious memory, and gave promise of his future
                    distinction as a scholar. In his fourteenth year he went to Bologna, where he
                    studied for two years, and was much occupied with the Decretals. The traditional
                    studies of the place, however, disgusted him; he was eager to know all the
                    secrets of nature, and devoting himself wholly to speculative learning he spent
                    seven years wandering through all the schools of Italy and France and collecting
                    a precious library. Like most men with brilliant faculties of acquisition and
                    assimilation, Pico was constitutionally an eclectic; and he owes his place in
                    the history of learning and thought to the indefatigable spirit of inquiry which
                    left him dissatisfied with current teaching and drove him to studies then new
                    and strange. Besides Greek and Latin he knew Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic; and
                    his Hebrew teachers (Eliah del Medigo, Leo Abarbanel, and Jochanan Aleman—see L.
                    Geiger, <hi rend="italic">Johann Reuchlin</hi> [1871], p. 167) introduced him to
                    the Kabbalah, which had great fascinations for one who loved all mystic and
                    theosophic speculation. His learned wanderings ended at Rome, where he set forth
                    for public disputation a list of nine hundred questions and conclusions in all
                    branches of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n90/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0090-0081"/> philosophy and theology. He remained a year in
                    Rome, but the disputation he proposed was never held. He was an object of envy
                    to many for the range of attainments, which earned him the title of the Phoenix
                    of his age, and detractors found it easy to fix on his conclusions a suspicion
                    of heresy. The pope prohibited the little book in which they were contained, and
                    Pico had to defend the impugned theses in an elaborate <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apologia.</hi> His personal orthodoxy was, however, finally vindicated by a
                    brief of Alexander VI., dated 18th June 1493. The suspected theses included such
                    points as the following :—that Christ descended <hi rend="italic">ad
                    inferos</hi> not in his real presence but <hi rend="italic">quoad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">effectum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that no image or cross
                    should receive <hi rend="italic">latreia</hi> even in the sense allowed by
                    Thomas; that it is more reasonable to regard Origen as saved than as damned;
                    that it is not in a man’s free will to believe or disbelieve an article of faith
                    as he pleases. But perhaps the most startling thesis was that no science gives
                    surer conviction of the divinity of Christ than “magia” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> the knowledge of the secrets of the heavenly bodies) and Kabbalah.
                    Pico was the first to seek in the Kabbalah a proof of the Christian mysteries,
                    and it was by him that Reuchlin was led into the same delusive path.</p>
                <p>Pico had been up to this time a gay Italian nobleman; he was tall, handsome,
                    fair-complexioned, with keen grey eyes and yellow hair, and a great favourite
                    with women. But his troubles led him to more serious thoughts; he burned his
                    amorous verses and gave himself wholly to sacred letters, publishing as the
                    first fruits of his studies, in his twenty-eighth year, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heptaplus,</hi> a mystical exposition of the creation. Next he planned a great
                    sevenfold work against the enemies of the church, of which only the section
                    directed against astrology was completed. After leaving Rome he again lived a
                    wandering life, often visiting Florence, to which he was drawn by his friends
                    Politian and Marsilius Ficinus, and where also he came under the influence of
                    Savonarola. It was at Florence that he died in 1494. Three years before his
                    death he parted with his share of the ancestral principality, and gave much of
                    his wealth to the poor. He was now increasingly absorbed in ascetic exercises
                    and religious meditation, and designed, when certain literary plans were
                    completed, to give away all he had and wander barefoot through the world
                    preaching Christ, or perhaps to join the preaching friars. But these plans were
                    cut short by a fever which carried him off just at the time when Charles VIII.
                    was at Florence. Pico’s attainments and the beauty of his character and piety
                    produced a profound impression on his contemporaries, but his works, published
                    by his nephew Giov. Fran. Pico, with a biography, at Bologna in 1496, and more
                    than once reprinted, cannot now be read with much interest. The man himself,
                    however, is still interesting, partly from his influence on Reuchlin and partly
                    from the spectacle of a truly devout mind in the brilliant circle of half-pagan
                    scholars of the Florentine renaissance.</p>
