                    to that of Blumenbach, could not be retained, as it had been used at a still
                    earlier time (1793) by Herbst for a genus of <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera.
                    Ornithorhynchus</hi> is therefore now universally adopted as the scientific
                    designation, although Duck-billed Platypus may be conveniently retained as a
                    vernacular appellation. By the colonists it is called “Water-Mole,” but its
                    affinities with the true moles are of the slightest and most superficial
                    description.</p>
                <p>The anatomical differences by which the platypus, and its only ally the echidna,
                    are separated from all other mammals, so as to form a distinct subclass with
                    relationship to the inferior vertebrated classes, have been described in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> (vol. xv. pp. 371 and 377), where <pb

                    characters of the two existing representatives of the group. It is there stated
                    that the early stages of the development of the young are not yet fully known;
                    in fact this was till very recently one of the most interesting problems in
                    zoology to be solved. It has been repeatedly affirmed, in some cases by persons
                    who have had actual opportunities of observation, that the platypus lays eggs;
                    but these statements have been generally received with scepticism and even
                    denial. This much-vexed question has, however, been settled by the researches of
                    Mr W. H. Caldwell (1884), who has found that these animals, although undoubtedly
                    mammals throughout the greater part of their structure, are oviparous, laying
                    eggs, which in the manner of their development bear a close resemblance to the
                    development of those of the <hi rend="italic">Reptilia.</hi> Two eggs are
                    produced at a time, each measuring about three-fourths of an inch in its long
                    and half an inch in its short axis, and enclosed in a strong, flexible, white
                    shell.</p>
                <p>The platypus is pretty generally distributed in situations suitable to its
                    aquatic habits throughout the island of Tasmania and the southern and eastern
                    portions of Australia. Slight variations in the colouring and size of different
                    individuals have given rise to the idea that more than onè species may exist;
                    but all naturalists who have had the opportunity of investigating this question
                    by the aid of a good series of specimens have come to the conclusion that there
                    is but one; and no traces of any extinct allied forms have yet been
                    discovered.</p>
                <p>The length of the animal when full grown is from 18 to 20 inches from the
                    extremity of the beak to the end of the tail, the male being slightly larger
                    than the female. The fur is short, dense, and rather soft to the touch, and
                    composed of an extremely fine and close under-fur, and of longer hairs which
                    project beyond this, each of which is very slender at the base, and expanded,
                    flattened, and glossy towards the free end. The general colour is deep brown,
                    but paler on the under parts. The tail is short, broad, and depressed, and
                    covered with coarse hairs, which in old animals generally become worn off from
                    the under surface. The eyes are small and brown. There is no projecting pinna or
                    ear-conch. The mouth, as is well known, bears a striking resemblance to the bill
                    of a duck. It is covered with a naked skin, a strong fold of which projects
                    outwards around its base. The nostrils are situated near the extremity of the
                    upper surface. There are no true teeth, but their purposes are served by horny
                    prominences, two on each side of each jaw,—those in the front narrow,
                    longitudinal, sharp-edged ridges, and those behind broad, flattened, and
                    molariform. The upper surface of the lateral edges of the mandible has also a
                    number of parallel fine transverse ridges, like those on the bill of a duck. In
                    the cheeks are tolerably capacious pouches, which appear to be used as
                    receptacles for food.</p>
                <p>The limbs are strong and very short, each with five well-developed toes provided
                    with strong claws. In the fore feet the web not only fills the interspaces
                    between the toes, but extends considerably beyond the ends of the long, broad,
                    and somewhat flattened nails, giving great expanse to the foot when used for
                    swimming, though capable of being folded back on the palm when the animal is
                    burrowing or walking on the land. On the hind foot the nails are long, curved,
                    and pointed, and the web extends only to their base. On the heel of the male is
                    a strong, curved, sharply pointed, movable horny spur, directed upwards and
                    backwards, attached by its expanded base to the accessory bone of the tarsus.
                    This spur, which attains the length of nearly an inch, is traversed by a minute
                    canal, terminating in a fine longitudinal slit near the point, and connected at
                    its base with the duct of a large gland situated at the back part of the thigh.
                    The whole apparatus is so exactly analogous in structure to the poison gland and
                    tooth of a venomous snake as to suggest a similar function, but evidence that
                    the platypus ever employs its spur as an offensive weapon has, at all events
                    until lately, been wanting. A case is, however, related by Mr Spicer in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> of the Royal Society of Tasmania for 1876 (p.
                    162) of a captured platypus inflicting a severe wound by a powerful lateral and
                    inward movement of the hind legs, which wound was followed by symptoms of active
                    local poisoning. It is not improbable that both the inclination to use the
                    weapon and the activity of the secretion of the gland may be limited to the
                    breeding season, and that their purpose may be, like that of the antlers of deer
                    and many similar organs, for combat among the males. In the young of both sexes
                    the spur is present in a rudimentary condition, but it disappears in the adult
                    females.</p>
                <p>The platypus is aquatic in its habits, passing most of its time in the water or
                    close to the margin of lakes and streams, swimming and diving with the greatest
                    ease, and forming for the purpose of sleeping and breeding deep burrows in the
                    banks, which generally have two orifices, one just above the water level,
                    concealed among long grasses and leaves, and the other below the surface. The
                    passage at first runs obliquely upwards in the bank, sometimes to a distance of
                    as much as 50 feet, and expands at its termination into a cavity, the floor of
                    which is lined with dried grass and leaves, and in which the eggs are laid and
                    the young brought up. Their food consists of aquatic insects, small crustaceans,
                    and worms, which are caught under water, the sand and small stones at the bottom
                    being turned over with their bills to find them. They appear at first to deposit
                    what they have thus collected in their cheek pouches, and when these are filled
                    they rise to the surface and quietly triturate their meal with the horny teeth
                    before swallowing it. Swimming is effected chiefly by the action of the broad
                    forepaws, the hind feet and tail taking little share in locomotion in the water.
                    When asleep they roll themselves into a ball, as shown in the figure. In their
                    native haunts they are extremely timid and wary, and very difficult to approach,
                    being rarely seen out of their burrows in the daytime. Mr A. B. Crowther, who
                    has supplemented the often quoted observations of Dr George Bennett upon the
                    habits of these animals in confinement, says, “They soon become very tame in
                    captivity; in a few days the young <pb break="no"

                    rapidly to the hand, paddling the water; and it is curious to see their attempts
                    to procure a worm enclosed in the hand, which they greedily take when offered to
                    them. I have noticed that they appear to be able to smell whether or not a worm
                    is contained in the closed hand to which they swim, for they desisted from their
                    efforts if an empty fist was offered.” When irritated they utter a soft low
                    growl, resembling that of a puppy. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">h. f.)</hi></p>
