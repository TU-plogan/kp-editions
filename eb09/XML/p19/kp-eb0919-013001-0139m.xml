                    to Solon, was born about 605 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In his youth there
                    was a keen rivalry between Athens and Megara, and Pisistratus as general of
                    Athens contrived by stratagem to defeat the Megarians and capture their port
                    Nisaea (perhaps 570 or a little later).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >{Solon,</hi> 8) falls into this mistake, and adds to it the blunder of
                    representing Pisistratus as having taken part in the expedition, which happened
                    about 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The two events (Solon’s conquest of

                    Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Solon,</hi> 8, 9) we may infer that the confusion
                    arose in popular tradition. The account of the stratagem itself in the Greek
                    writers Plutarch and Polyaenus differs somewhat from that in the Latin writers
                    Justin and Frontinus. Aelian follows (with some variations) the latter
                    account.</p></note> But Pisistratus was ambitious of more than military
                    triumphs, and in the internal condition of Attica he discerned the road to
                    power. The constitution which Solon had given to Athens a few years before (594
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) was too moderate to satisfy either of the
                    extreme parties. The wealthy nobles chafed at the political rights granted to
                    the lower classes, while the poor were dissatisfied with what they regarded as
                    merely a half measure of relief. The nobles themselves were divided into the
                    parties known as the Plain <hi rend="italic">(Pedieis)</hi> and the Coast <hi
                    rend="italic">(Paraloi),</hi> the former inhabiting the western lowlands of

                    disagreement between two political parties. It is true that Plutarch <hi
                    rend="italic">(Solon,</hi> 13) represents the Paraloi as a moderate political
                    party, intermediate between the Pedieis (oligarchs) and the Diacrioi
                    (democrats), but this has the appearance of being a mere conjecture of his own.
                    His view is, however, accepted by Curtius and Dunckcr.</p></note> The former
                    were led by the noble Lycurgus, the latter by Megacles, of the proud house of
                    the Alcmaeonidae. Pisistratus took advantage of their dissensions to form a
                    third political party out of the men of the Mountain <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Diacreis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Diacrioι),</hi> the poor cottars and
                    shepherds of the eastern and northern hills, among whom his own estates lay. He
                    easily won the affection of these simple highlanders. His manners were
                    captivating, his good humour imperturbable; his purse was ever at the service of
                    the needy; his fields and gardens stood open for their enjoyment. Equality and
                    fraternity, together with the maintenance of the constitution, were the
                    watchwords of this eloquent and handsome aristocrat, the people’s friend. But
                    his easy and affable deportment hid a boundless ambition. Solon detected his
                    schemes, and warned the people against him, but in vain. One day, not long after
                    a violent dispute with Megacles in the public assembly, Pisistratus drove into
                    the market-place, himself and his mules bleeding from wounds which he had
                    inflicted with his own hand, but which he pretended to have received from his
                    political enemies. The indignant people decreed a guard for the protection of
                    their champion. Of this guard the champion soon availed himself in order to
                    seize the Acropolis and make himself master of Athens (560). Megacles and the
                    Alcmaeonidae fled, but Solon remained and continued to lift his voice against
                    the usurper, who, however, treated the old man with the utmost deference, as a
                    valued friend and counsellor. Solon did not long survive his country’s freedom;
                    he died in the next year (559). The government of Pisistratus was marked by
                    great moderation; he maintained the existing laws, to which he exacted obedience
                    from all, and set the example of it himself. Being once accused of <pb

                    citizen to answer the charge, which, however, the accuser did not venture to
                    press. But before he had time to establish himself firmly on the throne, he was
                    expelled by a coalition of the Plain and Coast parties (perhaps in 555).<note

                    which elapsed between Pisistratus’s first usurpation and his death in 527 B.c.,

                    p. 1315 b) that he reigned during seventeen. He was twice deposed and banished,
                    and his second exile lasted between ten and eleven years (Herod., i. 62); hence
                    his first must have lasted between five and six. But we cannot fix with
                    certainty the dates of these two exiles. Duncker (with whom Clinton, <hi

                    auction. But after five or six years Megacles, unable to make head against the
                    party of the Plain, proposed to Pisistratus to secure his recall on condition
                    that Pisistratus should marry his daughter Coesyra, Pisistratus agreed, and his
                    return was effected by a stratagem. A tall and beautiful woman, Phya by name,
                    was dressed as the goddess Athene, and drove into Athens on a chariot with
                    Pisistratus at her side, while heralds proclaimed that Athene herself was
                    bringing back Pisistratus. Thus restored, Pisistratus fulfilled his part of the
                    bargain by marrying Coesyra; but by his former marriage he had already sons
                    approaching manhood (Hippias and Hipparchus), and he treated his young wife so
                    slightingly that Megacles, feeling himself affronted, made peace with his
                    adversaries, and the united parties once more compelled Pisistratus to quit
                    Athens (perhaps in 549). But he did not renounce his designs on the tyranny. The
                    contributions which he received from various cities, especially Thebes, enabled
                    him to hire a body of Argive mercenaries, with which he landed at Marathon in
                    the eleventh year after his expulsion (perhaps in 538). His partisans flocked to
                    him, and he defeated the Athenians at Pallene, and repossessed himself of the
                    tyranny, which he thenceforward held till his death. He now placed his power on
                    a securer basis by keeping a body of mercenaries in his pay, and levying a tax
                    of a tenth or a twentieth on the produce of the soil. A further revenue accrued
                    to him from the Thracian mines, and probably from the silver mines of Laurium,
                    and the harbour and market dues. He now developed his plans for the extension of
                    the naval empire of Athens in the Aegean. The island of Naxos was conquered by
                    him, and handed over to Lygdamis, a native of the island, who had zealously
                    supported the restoration of Pisistratus with men and money. In Naxos
                    Pisistratus deposited the hostages he exacted from those of his enemies who
                    chose to remain at Athens. In Sigeum on the Hellespont, which he conquered from
                    the Mytilenians, he established as tyrant Hegesistratus, his son by an Argive
                    wife, whom he had married in his second exile. The European side of the
                    Hellespont was already in Athenian hands, Miltiades having established an
                    Athenian colony on the Thracian Chersonese during the first tyranny, and with
                    the consent of Pisistratus. Athens thus commanded the straits through which
                    passed the corn trade of the Black Sea. Pisistratus further raised the
                    reputation of Athens by purifying the sacred island of Delos; all the graves
                    within sight of the temple of Apollo were opened and the dead removed to another
                    part of the island. His rule was as wise and beneficent at home as it was
                    glorious abroad. He encouraged agriculture by lending the poorer peasants cattle
                    and seed, and he paid special attention to the cultivation of the olive. He
                    enacted or enforced a law against idleness, and he required that the state
                    should maintain its disabled soldiers. Under his rule and that of his sons
                    Attica was intersected by high roads, which, converging to the capital, helped
                    to unite the country and thus to abolish local feuds and factions. To the
                    tyrants Athens further owed those subterranean channels in the rock which still
                    supply it with drinking water from the hills Pisistratus also adorned Athens
                    with splendid public buildings. The temple of the Pythian Apollo was his work;
                    and he began, but did not finish, the great temple of Zeus, the remaining
                    columns of which still ' astonish the beholder. Modern authorities<note

                    authority of Philochorus. He caused the Panathenaic festival to be celebrated
                    every fourth year with unusual magnificence.</p>
                <p>The well-known story that Pisistratus was the first to collect and publish the
                    poems of Homer in their present form rests on the authority of late writers
                    (Cicero being the earliest), and seems to be sufficiently disproved by the
                    silence of all earlier authorities (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Homer).</hi> The
                    statement of Aulus Gellius that Pisistratus was the, first to establish a public
                    library at Athens is perhaps equally void of foundation. The tyrant seems to
                    have been merciful and amiable to the last. It is not recorded of him that he
                    ever put an enemy to death, and the easy good humour with which he submitted to
                    affronts offered to himself and his family reminds us of Caesar. Solon’s
                    description of him appears to have been justified—that apart from his ambition
                    there was not a better-disposed man at Athens than Pisistratus. He died at an
                    advanced age in 527, and was succeeded by his sons Hippias and Hipparchus (the
                    Pisistratidae), who continued to rule Athens in the same moderate and beneficent
                    spirit. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">g. fr.)</hi></p>
