                <p><label type="entry">PLAYFAIR, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1748-1819),
                    mathematician and physicist, was born at Benvie, Forfarshire, where his father
                    was parish minister, on March 10, 1748. He was educated at home until the age of
                    fourteen, when he entered the university of St Andrews. Ability for scientific
                    studies must have appeared very early with him, for while yet a student he was
                    selected to teach natural philosophy during the occasional absence of the
                    professor. In 1766, when only eighteen, he was candidate for the chair of
                    mathematics in Marischal College, Aberdeen, and, although he was unsuccessful,
                    his claims were admitted to be high. Six years later he made application for the
                    chair of natural philosophy in his own university, but again without success,
                    and in 1773 he was offered and accepted the living of the united parishes of
                    Liff and Benvie, vacant by the death of his father. He continued, however, to
                    carry on his mathematical and physical studies, and in 1782 he resigned his
                    charge in order to become the tutor of Ferguson of Raith. By this arrangement he
                    was able to be frequently in Edinburgh, and to cultivate the literary and
                    scientific society for which it was at that time specially distinguished; and
                    through Maskelyne, whose acquaintance he had first made in the course of the
                    celebrated Schiehallion experiments in 1774, he also gained access to the
                    scientific circles of London. In 1785 when Dugald Stewart succeeded Ferguson in
                    the Edinburgh chair of moral philosophy, Playfair succeeded the former in that
                    of mathematics. In 1802 he published a volume entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth,</hi> and in 1805 he
                    exchanged the chair of mathematics for that of natural philosophy in succession
                    to Robison, whom also he succeeded as general secretary to the Royal Society of
                    Edinburgh. He took a prominent part, on the liberal side, in the ecclesiastical
                    controversy which arose in connexion with Leslie’s appointment to the post he
                    had vacated, and published a satirical <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> (1806)
                    which was greatly admired by his friends. His election as a fellow of the Royal
                    Society took place in 1807. In 1815, after the establishment of a European
                    peace, he made a journey through France and Switzerland to Italy, and remained
                    abroad for nearly eighteen months, interesting himself chiefly in the geology
                    and mineralogy of the districts he visited. After a few years of gradually
                    failing health he died on July 19, 1819.</p>
                <p>A collected edition of Playfair’s works, with a memoir by James G. Playfair,
                    appeared at Edinburgh in 4 vols. 8vo. His waitings include a number of essays
                    contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> from 1804 onwards,
                    various papers in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans,</hi> (including his
                    earliest publication “On the Arithmetic of Impossible Quantities,” 1779, and an
                    “Account of the Lithological Survey of Schehallion” 1811) and in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (“On the
                    Causes which affect the Accuracy of Barometrical Measurement,” &amp;c.), also
                    the articles “Aepinus” and “Physical Astronomy,” and a “Dissertation on the
                    Progress of’Mathematical and Physical Science since the Revival of Learning in
                    Europe,” in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi> (Supplement to
                    fourth, fifth, and sixth editions). His <hi rend="italic">Elements of
                        Geometry</hi> first appeared in 1795 and have passed through many editions;
                    his <hi rend="italic">Outlines of Natural Philosophy</hi> (2 vols., 1812-16)
                    consist of the propositions and formulae which were the basis of his class
                    lectures. Playfair’s contributions to pure mathematics were not considerable,
                    his paper “On the Arithmetic of Impossible Quantities,” that “On the Causes
                    which affect the Accuracy of Barometrical Measurements,” and his <hi
                        rend="italic">Elements of Geometry,</hi> all already referred to, being the
                    most important. As a mathematician simply he was far inferior to the first two
                    Gregorys, to Colin Maclaurin, and even to Matthew Stewart. He was, however, a
                    man of great general ability and was conspicuous for a calm intellect. His
                    scientific style was a model of clearness, and his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth</hi> attained great
                    popularity through its literary merits. His lives of Matthew Stewart, Hutton,
                    Robison, many of his reviews, and above all his. “Dissertation” are of the
                    utmost value. The English mathematicians of his day professed unlimited
                    admiration of Newton, but few of them were found able to wield his weapons, and
                    the majority had come simply to rest under the shadow of that great man; to
                    Playfair belongs the credit of having been one of the first to diffuse among his
                    countrymen a knowledge of the substantial progress which the infinitesimal
                    calculus had been making in the hands of the Continental analysts.</p>
