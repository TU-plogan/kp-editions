                    roadway of floating bridges. They may be either open or closed, heavy and only
                    movable when floated, or light enough to be taken out of the water and
                    transported overland, as when required to form part of the equipment of an army
                    in the field.</p>
                <p>From time immemorial floating bridges of vessels bearing a roadway of beams and
                    planks have been employed to facilitate the passage of rivers and arms of the
                    sea. Xerxes crossed the Hellespont on a double bridge, one line supported on
                    three hundred and sixty, the other on three hundred and fourteen vessels,
                    anchored head and stern with their keels in the direction of the current. Darius
                    threw similar bridges across the Bosphorus and the Danube in his war against the
                    Scythians, and the Greeks employed a bridge of boats to cross the river Tigris
                    in their retreat from Persia. Floating bridges have been repeatedly constructed
                    over rivers in Europe and Asia, not merely temporarily for the passage of an
                    army, but permanently for the requirements of the country; and to this day many
                    of the great ft vers in India are crossed, on the lines of the principal roads,
                    by floating bridges, which are for the most part supported on boats such as are
                    employed for ordinary traffic on the river.</p>
                <p>But light vessels which can be taken out of the water and lifted on to carriages
                    are required for transport with an army in the field. Alexander the Great
                    occasionally carried with his army vessels divided into portions, which were put
                    together on reaching the banks of a river, as in crossing the Hydaspes; he is
                    even said to have carried his army over the Oxus by means of rafts made of the
                    hide tents of the soldiers stuffed with straw, when he found that all the river
                    boats had been burnt. Cyrus crossed the Euphrates on stuffed skins. In the 4th
                    century the emperor Julian crossed the Tigris, Euphrates, and other rivers by
                    bridges of boats made of skins stretched over osier frames. In the 17 th century
                    the Germans employed timber frames covered with leather as pontoons, and the
                    Dutch similar frames covered with tin; and the practice of carrying about skins
                    to be inflated and employed for the passage of troops across a river, which was
                    adopted by both Greeks and Romans, still exists in the East, and. has been
                    introduced into America in a modified form, india-rubber being substituted for
                    skins.</p>
                <p>Pontoons have been made of a variety of forms and of almost every conceivable
                    description of material available for the purpose of combining the two essential
                    qualities of transportability over land and power of support in water. As these
                    qualities are not only distinct but conflicting, one of them has been frequently
                    sacrificed to the other. Thus history records many instances of bridges having
                    failed because incapable of supporting all the weight they were called on to
                    bear, or of resisting the force of the current opposed to them; it also records
                    instances of important strategical operations being frustrated because the
                    bridge equipment could not be brought up in time to the spot where it was
                    wanted. Numerous expedients for lightening the equipment have been suggested, in
                    America more particularly; but the proposers have not always remembered that if
                    a military bridge is intended to be carried <hi rend="italic">with</hi> an army
                    it is also intended to <hi rend="italic">carry</hi> the army, with its columns
                    of infantry and cavalry, its numerous waggons, and its ponderous artillery, and
                    it ought to do so with certainty and safety, even though a demoralized rabble
                    should rush upon it in throngs.</p>
                <p>Pontoons have been made of two forms, open as an undecked boat, or closed as a
                    decked canoe or cylinder. The advantage claimed for the closed pontoon is that
                    it cannot be submerged by the river, but only by having to bear a greater load
                    than its buoyancy admits of; the disadvantages are that it is difficult to make
                    and keep water-tight, it requires special saddles for the support of the baulks
                    which carry the roadway, and it cannot be conveniently used as a row-boat.
                    During the Peninsular War the English employed open bateaus, as did and still do
                    all the other European nations; but the experience gained in that war induced
                    the English to abandon the open bateau; for if large it was very difficult to
                    transport across country, and if small it was only suited for tranquil streams,
                    being liable to fill and sink should the river rise suddenly or become disturbed
                    by the wind. Thus closed pontoons came to be introduced into the British army.
                    General Colleton devised the first substitute for the open bateau, a buoy
                    pontoon, cylindrical with conical ends and made of wooden staves like a cask.
                    Then General Pasley introduced demi-pontoons, like decked canoes with pointed
                    bows and square sterns, a pair, attached sternwise, forming a single “pier” of
                    support for the roadway; they were constructed of light timber frames covered
                    with sheet copper and were decked with wood: each demi-pontooa <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n476/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0476-0457"/> was divided internally into separate compartments
                    by partitions which were made as water-tight as possible, and also supplied with
                    the means of pumping out water; when transported overland with an army, a pair
                    of demi-pontoons and the superstructure of one bay formed the load for a single
                    carriage weighing 3110 lb when loaded. The Pasley was superseded by the
                    Blanshard pontoon, a tin coated cylinder with hemispherical ends, for which
                    great mobility was claimed, two pontoons and two bays’ superstructure being
                    carried on one waggon, giving a weight of about 5000 B&gt;, which was intended
                    to be drawn by four horses. The Blanshard pontoon was long adopted for the
                    British army, but it is now being discarded; experiments made with it in peace
                    time showed that it would probably break down under the strain of actual
                    warfare, and efforts were constantly made to improve on it; when immersed to a
                    greater depth than the semi-diameter it became very unstable and lively under a
                    passing load, a defect which Serjeant-Major Forbes proposed to remedy by giving
                    it a triangular instead of a circular section, thus increasing the stability by
                    presenting a continually increasing area of bearing surface up to the level of
                    total immersion; but the angles of these pontoons were found so liable to injury
                    as to counterbalance any advantages over the cylinders.</p>
                <p>After many years’ experience of the closed pontoon the English engineers came to
                    the conclusion that it was desirable to return to the form of the open bateau to
                    which the engineers of all the Continental armies had meanwhile constantly
                    adhered. Captain Fowke, R.E., invented a folding open bateau, made of
                    water-proof canvas attached to sliding ribs, so that for transport it can be
                    collapsed like the bellows of an accordion and for use it can be extended by a
                    pair of stretchers; it is very mobile, but it is also deficient in power of
                    support, for whereas the buoyancy due to the outline form out of the water is
                    13,600 ft&gt; the actual buoyancy in the water is only 8640 lb, because of the
                    cavities in the canvas between the ribs which are formed by the pressure of the
                    water outside; moreover, the surface irregularities cause the pressure exerted
                    by a current upon a bridge formed of these collapsible pontoons to be about
                    three times as much as upon one of equal power formed with Blanshard’s or
                    Pasley’s pontoons; there is thus great risk of the bridge being carried away by
                    a strong current.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the powers of various pontoons at present or recently
                    in use by different nations. The “working power of support” has been calculated
                    in most instances by deducting from the “available buoyancy” one-fourth for open
                    and one-tenth for closed vessels :—</p>

                <p>In the English and French equipment the pontoons were originally made of two
                    sizes, the smaller and lighter for the ‘‘advanced guard,” the larger and heavier
                    for the “reserve”; in both equipments the same size pontoon is now adopted for
                    general requirements, the superstructure being strengthened when necessary for
                    very heavy weights. The Austrian and Italian pontoons are made in three pieces,
                    two with bows and a middle piece without; not less than two pieces are
                    ordinarily employed, and the third is introduced when great supporting power is
                    required, but in all cases a constant interval is maintained between the
                    pontoons. On the other hand in the Prussian, Russian, Dutch, and American and in
                    the English Blanshard equipments greater supporting power is obtained not by
                    increasing the number of supports but by diminishing the central interval
                    between the pontoons. Within certain limits it does not matter whether the
                    buoyancy is made up of a large number of small or a small number of large
                    vessels, so long as the water-way is not unduly contracted and the obstruction
                    offered to a swift current dangerously increased; but it is to be remembered
                    that pontoon bridges have failed as frequently from being washed away as from
                    insufficient buoyancy.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n477/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0477-0458"/>
                <p>On comparing the “available buoyancy” with the “greatest possible load at 100
                    ft&gt; per foot superficial of roadway” for each of the bridge equipments in the
                    preceding table, it will be seen that very few of the bridges are really capable
                    of carrying the maximum load they may be called on to bear. Strictly speaking
                    the roadway superficies should in all instances be proportioned to the buoyancy
                    of the pontoon, or, as the central interval between the pontoons cannot be
                    reduced below certain limits, the width of the roadway should be proportioned to
                    the buoyancy; in other words the “chesses” or planks which form the roadway
                    should be made of a shorter length for a bridge which is designed for light
                    traffic than for one which is designed for heavy traffic. The employment of
                    chesses of different lengths for the pontoon equipment of an army would,
                    however, be very inconvenient and troublesome, and this has led to the adoption
                    of a constant breadth of roadway, on the understanding that the traffic will
                    always be controlled by the officer in charge of the bridge.</p>
                <p>The latest form of pontoon for the English army is one with which the name of
                    Colonel Blood, R. E., is mainly associated. Its powers are given in the lowest
                    line of the preceding table. It is an open bateau with decked ends and sides
                    partly decked where the rowlock blocks are fixed. It consists of six sets of
                    framed ribs connected by a deep kelson, two side streaks, and three bottom
                    streaks. The sides and bottom are of thin yellow pine with canvas secured to
                    both surfaces by india-rubber solution, and coated outside with marine glue. The
                    central interval between the pontoons in forming a bridge is invariably
                    maintained at 15 feet; for the support of the roadway five baulks are ordinarily
                    employed, but nine for the passage of siege artillery and the heaviest loads;
                    they fit on to saddles resting on central saddle beams. The pontoons are not
                    immersed to within 1 foot of the tops of their “coamings” when carrying ordinary
                    loads, as of infantry in marching order “in fours” crowded at a check, or the
                    16-pounder gun, which weighs 4800 lb; nor are they immersed to within 6 inches
                    when carrying extraordinary loads, such as disorganized infantry, or the
                    64-pounder gun weighing 11,100 lb. In designing this pontoon the chief points
                    attended to were—(1) improvement in power of support, (2) simplification in
                    bridge construction, (3) reduction of weight in transport, and (4) adaptation
                    for use singly as boats for ferrying purposes. One pontoon with the
                    superstructure for a single bay constitutes a load for one waggon, with a total
                    weight behind horses of about 4500 lb.</p>
                <p>For the British army in India the standard pontoon for many years.was the Pasley;
                    it was seldom used, however, for boats could almost always be procured on the
                    spot in sufficient numbers wherever a floating bridge had to be constructed. Of
                    late years an equipment has been prepared for the Indian army of demi-pontoons,
                    similar to the Blood pontoon cut in half, and therefore more mobile; each has a
                    bow and a square stern, and they are joined at the sterns when required to form
                    a * ‘ pier”; they are fitted with movable covers and can therefore be used in
                    much rougher water than pontoons of the home pattern, and their power of support
                    and breadth of roadway are the same.</p>
                <p>For the British army there is a light form of the Blanshard pontoon suitable for
                    infantry uncrowded, guns unlimbered, and cavalry in single file. The Berthon
                    collapsible boat, for infantry in single file, is also employed; when open it is
                    9 feet long and 4 feet wide; it weighs 109 lb with a pair of oars and a
                    removable thwart or seat (to enable it to be used as a boat), and can be slung
                    on to a bamboo and carried by two men; the superstructure for one bay weighs 97
                    lb, and is also carried by two men; the width of roadway is 18 inches; twelve
                    boats are required to bridge a stream 100 feet in width.</p>
                <p>The india-rubber pontoon does not appear to have been generally employed even in
                    America, where it was invented. The engineer officers with the army of the
                    Potomac, after full experience of the india-rubber pontoon and countless other
                    inventions of American genius, adopted the French equipment, which they found
                    “most excellent, useful, and reliable for all military purposes.” The Russians
                    in crossing the Danube in their war with Turkey in 1878 employed the Austrian
                    equipment.</p>
