                <p><label type="entry">POLYNESIA</label>. In the last edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi> Polynesia was used to denote all the
                    intertropical islands of the Pacific Ocean eastward of the Philippine Islands to
                    the north and the New Hebrides to the south of the equator. The New Hebrides and
                    other islands west of that group were included under the term Australasia. Of
                    late years these islands (sometimes also including Fiji) have been known as
                    Melanesia, while the western islands of the North Pacific have been known as
                    Micronesia. Thus Polynesia has been restricted to the central and eastern
                    islands inhabited by the brown or Sawaiori race, becoming an ethnographic rather
                    than a geographical term. Articles dealing with the western islands north and
                    south of the equator will be found under <hi rend="smallcaps">Micronesia</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Melanesia.</hi> The present article is intended to give
                    a comprehensive view of all the islands of the Pacific, their physical
                    characteristics, natural productions, and the races of men found upon them. The
                    name Polynesia is therefore here employed in a wide signification and solely as
                    a geographical term. The western boundary of this region runs from the great
                    barrier reef of Australia eastward of New Guinea and the Philippine Islands. All
                    the intertropical islands of the Pacific eastward of this imaginary line are
                    included, and also a few others which extend outside the tropic of Capricorn to
                    nearly 30° S. lat. Any other divisions for geographical purposes, except those
                    of groups of islands, appear to be unnatural and uncalled for. For
                    ethnographical purposes special terms are used for the three different classes
                    of people found in this wide area.</p>
                <p>If we exclude <hi rend="smallcaps">New Caledonia (⅞.v.),</hi> which is of older
                    formation than the rest, all the islands of Polynesia are either of volcanic or
                    of coral formation. Some are purely coral, either in the shape of low atolls or
                    of elevated plateaus. In a few atolls there are remnants of earlier volcanic
                    rocks; and most of the volcanic islands are more or less fringed with coral
                    reefs. But, notwithstanding this mixture, the islands must be divided broadly
                    into those which are volcanic and those which are of coral formation. The coral
                    islands must again be subdivided into (1) atolls, or low islands which usually
                    have a lagoon within them, and (2) elevated table-lands.</p>
                <p>The volcanic islands, with the exception of the Hawaiian archipelago, are all
                    south of the equator. In Plate III. the great volcanic ridge is indicated by two
                    lines which, commencing in 150° E., run in a south-easterly direction to about
                    140° W. long. With the exception of two curves, one in the lower line south of
                    the New Hebrides, and one in the upper line at its eastern extremity, these are
                    parallel, and are 10° apart. Within these two lines lie all the volcanic islands
                    of Polynesia, except two isolated groups, viz., the Marquesas and Hawaiian
                    Islands. On this ridge there are no atolls. The upper boundary line sharply
                    divides the volcanic ridge from the atoll valley. This valley is indicated by a
                    third line running for more than 50° of longitude parallel with the other two,
                    at 20° distance from that bounding the northern extremity of the volcanic ridge.
                    Eastward of 155° W. long, this line bends towards the south to exclude the
                    isolated volcanic centre of the Marquesas Islands; then, curving around the
                    Tuamotu archipelago, it joins the central line. Within the area thus enclosed
                    lie all the atolls or low coral lagoon islands of Polynesia, and there are no
                    volcanic islands within this region except in three or four instances, where are
                    found the remnants of former islands which have sunk, but have not been quite
                    submerged. This is the region of subsidence —stretching across fully 100° of
                    longitude, and covering generally about 20° of latitude.</p>
                <p>Within the volcanic region there are a few coral islands, but these are all more
                    or less elevated. Since their formation they have participated in the upward
                    movement of the ridge on which they are situated. They are indicated on the map
                    by dotted lines. Two of the groups are within the lines marking the volcanic
                    ridge; and one, the Loyalty group, lies close to the lower line.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Volcanic Islands.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> Most of the volcanic islands of Polynesia are high in
                    proportion to their size. The tapering peaks, or truncated cones, which form
                    their backbone present a picturesque appearance to the voyager as he approaches
                    them. In some there are precipitous spurs jutting into the sea, while in others
                    the land slopes gently from the central peak to the shore. Where there are these
                    gentle slopes, and wherever there is any low land near the shore, there also
                    will be found a coral reef fringing the coast at a smaller or greater distance,
                    according to the steepness of the land under the water. Where the trend
                    downwards is very gradual, the edge of the reef will sometimes be one, two, or
                    even three miles to seaward. It has been thought that the absence of extensive
                    reefs in some islands of the New Hebrides is due to “subterranean heat.” But the
                    steepness of the slope of the islands under water is doubtless the reason why
                    the reefs are small. As the reef-building coral polypes do not live and work
                    below a certain depth—about 20 fathoms, or 120 feet—we easily see that the
                    distance of the outer edge of the reef must be according to the slope of the
                    island beneath the water. Opposite to the larger valleys, where there is a
                    stream flowing out to sea, there is usually found a break in the reef. This is
                    doubtless caused either by the fresh water, or by the sediment which it
                    contains, injuring the coral polypes and preventing them from effectively
                    carrying on their work in these spots. The conviction of the present writer is
                    that it is the sediment contained in the water—especially during heavy rains and
                    consequent freshets—which prevents the growth of the coral, rather than the mere
                    action of fresh water upon the polypes. Where there are streams of considerable
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n438/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0438-0419"/> βize, and especially where they are subject to
                    floods, there are generally wide openings into the reef, and stretches of deep
                    water forming natural harbours sufficient for the accommodation of even large
                    vessels. There are a few land-locked harbours, but most are thus formed by
                    breaks in the reef.</p>
                <p>In a few spots active volcanoes are still found. These are in the neighbourhood
                    of New Britain and New Ireland, in the Solomon, New Hebrides, and Tonga
                    archipelagoes. In most of the islands there have been no recent eruptions; but
                    now and again the inhabitants of islands where volcanic action has apparently
                    long ceased have been startled by a new outbreak. Over the whole region
                    earthquakes are of frequent occurrence. Most of the craters in the islands of
                    Samoa have immense trees growing in them, and there is only one crater in the
                    entire group which shows signs of even a comparatively recent eruption, or
                    concerning which there is a tradition among the people of one. Yet in 1867,
                    after an almost continuous succession of earthquakes during a whole night, there
                    was a submarine eruption between two of the islands. This lasted only a few
                    days. A few months afterwards the writer was on board H.M.S. “Falcon” when
                    soundings were taken on the spot. A cone was found the summit of which was 90
                    fathoms deep, while all around the sea was 120 fathoms deep. Thus the
                    outpourings of this submarine volcano during only a few days raised a mound in
                    the bed of the ocean 180 feet in height.</p>
                <p>The soil in the volcanic islands is generally very fertile. The climate is hot
                    and moist in most of them; consequently the vegetation is wonderfully rich. The
                    islands are densely clothed with the most luxuriant verdure from the sea-beach
                    to the summits of the mountains. While in a few islands, especially the
                    comparatively barren ones (barren is only a comparative term as applied to any
                    of the volcanic islands), there is sometimes grand and bold scenery, in most of
                    them the jagged and precipitous rocks are so covered up and rounded off with the
                    rich vegetation that they lose much of their grandeur. The atmosphere is so
                    laden with moisture that ferns, club-mosses, and even small shrubs grow upon the
                    faces of the steepest rocks. Mainly on this account the scenery can rarely be
                    said to be grand; but nearly all these islands are truly beautiful. There is a
                    freshness about the vegetation all the year round which is rarely seen in other
                    portions of the world. The cocoa-nut palm groves, which are usually abundant on
                    the low lands near the sea, always give a charm to the islands as they are
                    approached. In addition to several species of palms, beautiful ferns, dracaenas,
                    crotons, and other elegant foliage plants abound. Pines are found on some of the
                    western islands. For flowers none of them will compare with the hedgerows and
                    meadows of England. There are, it is true, many most beautiful and sweet-scented
                    flowers, but they are not usually found in great profusion.</p>
                <p>Fruits are abundant. Some of the indigenous kinds are good, and many of the best
                    productions of other tropical countries have been introduced and flourish.
                    Oranges are very plentiful in many islands; also pine-apples, guavas, custard
                    apples, and bananas. The mango has been introduced into some islands, and
                    flourishes well. Most of these fruits have been introduced by missionaries. One
                    of the fruits most abundantly used, both in a ripe state and cooked when unripe
                    as a vegetable, is the Chinese banana, <hi rend="italic">Musa Cavendishii.</hi>
                    The first plant of this carried to the islands was in a case of plants given by
                    the duke of Devonshire to the missionary John Williams when he returned from
                    England to the Pacific shortly before he was killed on Erromanga. During the
                    long voyage all the plants in the case died except this banana.</p>
                <p>When it reached Samoa it was carefully cultivated by one of the missionaries and
                    a stock of it was propagated. From the single plant all the Chinese bananas in
                    Polynesia have sprung, and, that particular kind being greatly prized both by
                    natives and foreign settlers, it is now grown largely wherever missionaries or
                    traders have gone, and must produce annually hundreds of tons of nutritious
                    food.</p>
                <p>The natives live chiefly upon vegetable food. In most of the volcanic islands the
                    taro <hi rend="italic">(Colocasia esculenta)</hi> is the most important
                    food-producer. Next to this comes the yam <hi rend="italic">(Dioscorea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sativa).</hi> Probably next in importance to this are the
                    plantains and bananas, then the bread-fruit <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Artocarpus</hi><hi rend="italic">incisa)</hi> and arrowroot <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Tacca pinnatijida).</hi> The bread-fruit is more or less plentiful in most of
                    the volcanic islands, and during one season of the year the natives very largely
                    subsist upon it. It is not, however, by any means so nutritious as the taro or
                    the yam. This vegetable is often spoken of in Britain as if it were a rich
                    fruit, but one would as soon eat a raw potato as a raw bread-fruit. It has been
                    over-estimated by many writers who have visited the Pacific. The present writer
                    has noticed that the Samoans suffered in condition, that sickness among children
                    was very common and the rate of mortality high during the bread-fruit season.
                    Although the raw cocoa-nut is not eaten to any considerable extent by the
                    natives of volcanic islands, this must not be omitted in an enumeration of the
                    principal articles of their food supply, for it enters into the composition of
                    most of their made dishes in the form of expressed juice or oil; the soft
                    half-grown kernel is used as a kind of dessert, and the liquid from it, when the
                    kernel is only half developed, is one of their principal beverages. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Ava, or Kava,</hi> a narcotic drink largely used, is made from the
                    root of a pepper <hi rend="italic">(Piper methysticum).</hi></p>
                <p>In some islands the cocoa-nut is t'he chief article of commerce. The fully-grown
                    kernel is cut into slices, dried in the sun, and sold as “cobra,” from which
                    much of the palm oil of commerce is expressed. On many islands cotton is largely
                    grown, and on a few, especially in the Hawaiian archipelago, sugar cultivation
                    has made considerable progress. Many other vegetable products might be utilized
                    if there were a demand for them. The candle-nut <hi rend="italic">(Aleurites
                    triloba)</hi> is abundant everywhere near the coast. Coffee has not been grown
                    to any considerable extent. Wild ginger and wild nutmegs are abundant on some of
                    the islands. In some places indigo has been introduced, and has spread so much
                    as to become a nuisance. All the islands have numerous valuable fibre-producing
                    plants belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Urticeae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Malvaceae.</hi> But the probability is that, on these hot, moist, and fertile
                    islands, cocoa-nuts, cotton, or sugar will always be the most profitable crops
                    to cultivate for exportation.</p>
                <p>The indigenous fauna of Polynesia is poor in mammals but rich in birds. Mammals
                    are represented by rats and bats, the latter including the flying foxes <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pteropus).</hi> Some say pigs are indigenous, but they were
                    doubtless introduced by early navigators. Horses and cattle have been
                    introduced. They degenerate very rapidly, unless they are continually improved
                    by newly-imported stock. Sheep and goats are introduced into some islands, but
                    sheep do not usually thrive. Dogs are plentiful, being kept by most of the
                    natives, who are naturally fond of domestic animals; but they degenerate
                    greatly. Pigeons and doves, especially the fruit-eating pigeons <hi
                    rend="italic">{Carpophaga)</hi> and doves of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ptilonopus,</hi> are abundant. The <hi rend="italic">Carpophaga</hi> furnish a
                    very important article of food in some of the islands. Some of the species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ptilonopus</hi> are exceedingly beautiful. Megapodes are found
                    in a few of the western islands; the kagu <hi rend="italic">(Rhinochetus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">jubatus)</hi> has <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n439/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0439-0420"/> its home on New Caledonia; and in Samoa the <hi
                    rend="italic">Didunculus strigirostris</hi> has its habitat. This bird is
                    remarkable as being the nearest relative of the extinct dodo. Some time ago it
                    was rarely found, and was becoming extinct. It fed and nested on the ground, and
                    was destroyed by cats and rats after they were introduced. Of late it has
                    changed its habits: it now feeds, nests, and roosts upon trees, and is, in
                    consequence, increasing in numbers. Certain non-venomous snakes are found in
                    many of the islands. Insect life is abundant, and some of the butterflies are
                    very beautiful.</p>
                <p>The lagoons formed by the coral reefs around the islands invariably abound in
                    fish, many of them most gorgeous in their colouring,—vying in this respect with
                    the parrots of Australia. Fish form a very important part of the food
                    supply.</p>
                <p>One of the most wonderful creatures in the marine fauna of Polynesia is the
                    palolo <hi rend="italic">(Palola</hi><hi rend="italic">viridis),</hi> an annelid
                    which appears upon the surface of the ocean, near the edge of the coral reef, at
                    certain seasons of the year. The palolo are from 9 to 18 inches long, and about
                    ⅛th of an inch thick. They are eaten by the natives, and are esteemed a great
                    delicacy. They live in the interstices of the coral reef, and are confined to a
                    few localities. About 3 o’clock on the morning following the third quartering of
                    the October moon they invariably appear upon the surface of the water; generally
                    they are in such quantities that they may be taken up by the handful. Soon after
                    the sun rises they begin to break, and by 9 o’clock <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi>
                    Μ. they have broken to pieces and disappeared. The morning following the third
                    quarter of the November moon they again appear in the same manner, but usually
                    in smaller quantities. After that they are not again seen until October of the
                    next year. They appear thus to deposit their ova, which is done by the breaking
                    to pieces of the female worms; the males also break in the same manner, the ova
                    being fertilized while floating in the water. Thus the parents are destroyed in
                    propagating their species. The eggs gradually sink down to the reef where they
                    are hatched. The young papolo then live about the reef until the next year, when
                    they repeat the process. Year by year these creatures appear according to lunar
                    time. Yet, in the long run, they keep solar time. This they do by keeping two
                    cycles, one of three years and one of twenty-nine years. In the short cycle
                    there are two intervals of twelve lunations each, and one of thirteen lunations.
                    These thirty-seven lunations bring lunar time somewhat near to solar time. But
                    in the course of twenty-nine years there will be sufficient difference to
                    require the addition of another lunation; the twenty-ninth year is therefore one
                    of thirteen instead of twelve lunations. In this way they do not change their
                    season during an entire century. So certain has been their appearance that in
                    Samoa they have given their name to the spring season, which is vae-p ιlolo, or
                    the time of palolo.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For

                    Atolls.—</hi> The atolls differ in almost every respect from the islands of
                    volcanic origin. Little that is said of one class would be true of the other.
                    These coral islands are all low, generally not more than 10 or 12 feet above
                    high-water mark. They are simply sandbanks formed by the accumulation of debris
                    washed on to the reefs during strong winds. Hence they are usually in the shape
                    of a narrow band, varying from a few yards to one-third of a mile across, near
                    the outer edge of the reef, with a lagoon in the centre. In some of the smaller
                    atolls the circle of land is almost or entirely complete, but in most of those
                    of larger dimensions there are breaks to leeward, and the sea washes freely over
                    the reef into the lagoon. Where the circle of land is complete the sea-water
                    gains access to the central lagoon through the reef underneath the islands. In
                    some it bubbles up at the rise of the tide in the midst of the lagoons, forming
                    immense natural fountains. This has been observed producing a specially fine
                    effect at Nui in the Ellice group. Some of these atolls are not more than 3 or
                    <hi rend="italic">4</hi> miles in their greatest length. Others are many miles
                    long. They are not all circular, but are of all conceivable shapes.<note

                <p>Two of the atolls known to the present writer are remarkable. The lagoons in them
                    are of fresh water. One of these is Lakena in the Ellice group, the other
                    Olosenga, or Quiros Island, in ll <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> 2' S. lat. and
                    17Γ W. long. Both are small circular islands, and in both the lagoon is shut off
                    from the sea. Olosenga is less than 4 miles in diameter, the lagoon occupying
                    over 3 miles, leaving a ring of land around it less than half a mile across. In
                    some places the lagoon is at least 6 fathoms deep. This bulk of fresh water
                    cannot, therefore, be the result of drainage. There is much to favour the
                    opinion that both this island and Lakena are situated over the craters of former
                    volcanoes, and that there is submarine connexion between them and some of the
                    larger islands situated on the volcanic ridge from which the body of fresh water
                    must come. Olosenga is about 200 miles distant from Samoa. In that group
                    mountain streams sometimes fall into chasms and totally disappear underground.
                    In this way subterranean lakes may be formed in some of the cavities which we
                    may suppose volcanic eruptions to leave. It is not difficult to suppose that
                    there would be subterranean connexion between these lakes and an isolated crater
                    200 miles distant. If so, as the crater participated in the subsidence of the
                    region on the edge of which it is situated, the water would rise in it until, if
                    the supply were sufficient, it there found an outlet. This appears to be what
                    occurs at Olosenga. The lake has never been properly examined and sounded. It
                    is, however,- of considerable depth in the centre, where the water is said
                    sometimes to bubble up as if from a great spring, and at low tide it is seen to
                    percolate through the sand on the outer or sea side of the land.</p>
                <p>The vegetation of the atolls is extremely poor, not more than about fifty species
                    of plants being found in the Tokelau, Ellice, and Gilbert groups, in all of
                    which groups collections have been made. All the species consist of littoral
                    plants found in the volcanic islands. Most of them have their seeds enveloped in
                    thick husks, which specially fit them for being carried by currents. Doubtless
                    it is in this way that the atolls have received their flora. The cocoa-nut is
                    abundant on most of these islands. This most useful palm will grow on any
                    sandbank in the tropics, and it is benefited by having its roots in soil
                    saturated with sea water. Unlike the natives of volcanic islands, those dwelling
                    on the atolls eat the raw kernel of the nut in large quantities. Indeed that,
                    with fish and the fruit of a screw-pine <hi rend="italic">(Pandanus),</hi>
                    constitutes the main food supply on some atolls. The people make the pulp of the
                    pandanus into a kind of cake, in appearance much like a quantity of old dates.
                    In some atolls a somewhat elaborate system of cultivation has been adopted, by
                    means of which a coarse kind of taro, banana, the bread-fruit, &amp;c., are
                    grown. These low islands suffer much from drought, and the natural soil is
                    nothing but sand. The people, therefore, form wide trenches by removing the sand
                    until they get within about 2 to 3 feet of the sea-level. ' Into the trenches
                    they put all the vegetable refuse and manure they can obtain, and, as there is
                    more moisture at this level, those excavated gardens are comparatively fertile.
                    Under the influence of a Christian civilization, which is growing, and by the
                    introduction of new food-producing plants, the condition of the natives is
                    improving; but they still suffer much at times from long-continued seasons of
                    drought.</p>
                <p>The fauna of. the atolls consists mainly of a few birds, some lizards, and
                    insects. Fish abound about the reefs, and most of the natives are deep-sea
                    fishermen. In the Ellice Islands the people domesticate frigate-birds. Large
                    numbers of these pets may be seen about the villages.</p>

                <p>Λs the birds are accustomed to visit different islands when the wind is
                    favourable, the people send by them small presents (fish-hooks, &amp;c.) to
                    their friends. Christian missionaries also occasionally use them as
                    letter-carriers for communicating with one another.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Elevated Coral Islands.—</hi> There are comparatively few of
                    the elevated coral islands in Polynesia, but they are so distinct from both the
                    atolls and the volcanic islands that they need a separate description. They all
                    lie within or near the lines marking off the volcanic ridge upon the map. South
                    of the volcanic ridge there are many coral reefs forming shoals. The elevated
                    coral islands doubtless were once such reefs. Lying within the area of volcanic
                    action, they have participated in the upward movement, and have been raised from
                    shoals to become islands. Some have evidently been lifted by successive stages
                    and apparently by sudden movements. This is clearly seen in the Loyalty Islands.
                    On approaching them one sees high coral cliffs, in appearance much like the
                    chalk cliffs of England, except that they are often some distance inland and not
                    close on the shore. The island of Marè may be taken as a good type of the class.
                    Here, between the shore and the coral cliffs, there is a tract of level land
                    varying from a few yards to perhaps one-fourth of a mile or more across. On this
                    level tract the people mainly dwell. At the back of this there rises a
                    perpendicular wall of coral, in some places as much as a hundred feet high. The
                    cliff is water-worn, and has in it large caverns, showing that for a long period
                    it was the coast-line. Still farther inland there are two similar though smaller
                    cliffs, indicating that there were three distinct upheavals. These must have
                    been at very long intervals. At present the island is fringed with a coral reef,
                    and if it were now to be lifted from fifty to one hundred feet the present
                    coast-line would form another cliff, while the present coral reef would form
                    another low plot similar to that upon which the people now dwell.</p>
                <p>These islands are old enough to have a considerable depth of vegetable soil upon
                    them. The low land between the coast and the first cliff is well stocked with
                    cocoa-nut and other trees. None of the islands can be compared with the volcanic
                    islands for fertility, all having a less rich soil and being much drier; still
                    they are fairly fertile. They suffer sometimes from drought, but are much less
                    seriously affected in this way than the atolls.</p>
                <p>The flora of the elevated coral islands is less rich than that of the volcanic
                    islands, but much richer than that of the atolls. The island of Niuè may be
                    taken as a fair specimen of this class. Its flora probably contains between 400
                    and 500 species, nearly all being such as are found on adjacent volcanic
                    islands. The fauna is also much richer than that of the atolls, but poorer than
                    that of the volcanic islands. Birds are numerous. While most of the species are
                    identical with those found in neighbouring volcanic islands, there are some
                    interesting local variations well illustrating the modifications which take
                    place from isolation under changed surroundings. In some instances the
                    differences are so great that local forms have been classed not only as
                    varieties but as distinct species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate of the islands varies considerably,
                    as may be naturally expected when the wide area covered is remembered, and the
                    vast difference there is between the islands themselves. Some, especially the
                    elevated coral islands, are very healthy for tropical regions. Speaking
                    generally, the average reading of the thermometer over a large extent of
                    Polynesia is about 80° Fahr. It very seldom sinks lower than 60°, and, owing to
                    the small size of most of the islands, and the prevalence of trade-winds during
                    the greater portion of the year, the heat is always moderated, and rarely
                    becomes intense. Yet, owing to the constant heat and to the humidity of the
                    atmosphere, the climate in the mountainous islands is trying to the European
                    constitution. But in this respect there is a great difference even between
                    groups which, looked at superficially, appear to be similar, and which lie
                    within almost the same parallels of latitude. All the islands eastward from and
                    including Fiji are much more healthy than are those to the west. In the eastern
                    section fever and ague are of rare occurrence; in the western section European
                    missionaries do not find it expedient to remain for long periods on the islands
                    owing to the weakening effects of frequent attacks of these diseases. The most
                    remarkable thing is that natives of the eastern section suffer even more than
                    Europeans when they go to live in the western islands, the mortality among them
                    being very great. Numerous attempts have been made to evangelize the New
                    Hebrides through the agency of natives of the Samoan, Cook, and Society groups;
                    but, owing to the great mortality among the agents, their efforts have failed.
                    Yet these people have lived there under conditions very similar to those they
                    were accustomed to at home, the heat being about the same, and the food similar,
                    as well as the general mode of life. The causes of the difference are as yet
                    unknown. Possibly the explanation •will be found in differences of natural
                    drainage. It has often occurred to the present writer, though only as an
                    unverified theory, that the bases of these western islands are, like that of New
                    Caledonia, of older formation, and that the islands are only superficially
                    volcanic. If so, this may account for their unhealthiness as compared with the
                    purely volcanic islands within the same parallels of latitude. In comparison
                    with most tropical countries there is little dysentery in Polynesia; but this
                    also is more common in the west than in the east.</p>
                <p>The elevated coral islands are always much more healthy than are those of
                    volcanic formation in their immediate neighbourhood. They are drier, being
                    always well drained, have much less dense vegetation, and receive the benefit of
                    the trade-winds which blow right across them. They, however, sometimes suffer
                    from drought such as is unknown on the volcanic islands. The atolls may be
                    called—if the term can be applied to tiny islets scattered over the expanse of
                    ocean—the deserts of the Pacific. The soil being almost entirely sand, and the
                    vegetation affording little shade, the heat and glare, especially of those lying
                    close to the equator, are exceedingly trying to European visitors. Being so
                    low—only a few feet above the ocean—there is nothing to attract the clouds, and
                    the rainfall is small. The islands are therefore subject to frequent droughts,
                    which are sometimes of month’s duration; and at such times even the fronds of
                    the cocoa-nut palm get a shrivelled appearance, and the trees cease to bear
                    fruit. Sometimes the people suffer greatly during these long-continued droughts,
                    many being starved to death. At best their food supply is confined to
                    cocoa-nuts, pandanus, fruit, and fish, but in times of drought they are forced
                    to chew the roots of shrubs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hurricanes.—</hi> A great portion of southern Polynesia is
                    subject to destructive cyclones. The tract over which they pass may be said to
                    be, generally, that of the volcanic chain indicated by the lines on the map,
                    although the northern edge of this region is not so subject to cyclones as the
                    southern portion. A line drawn parallel to the lines of the map, through the
                    middle of the New Hebrides group, and extending south of Fiji, will well
                    represent the centre of the cyclone tract. The hurricane season is from December
                    to April. Some islands are visited by a more or less destructive cyclone nearly
                    every year; Samoa lies on the upper edge of the tract, and gets one, on an
                    average, about every seven or eight years. Although these cyclones <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n441/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0441-0422"/> are not usually so severe as those which visit
                    the seas of eastern Asia, they are often exceedingly destructive, sweeping
                    almost everything down in their course. They last only a few hours. Heavy seas
                    are raised in the line of progress, and vessels are generally exposed to greater
                    danger when lying at anchor at the ports than when in the open sea. The cyclones
                    are always accompanied by considerable electric disturbances, especially when
                    they are passing away.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diseases.</hi> —Apart from the fever, ague, and dysentery
                    already alluded to, there is comparatively little disease in any portion of
                    Polynesia. The principal purely native diseases are such as affect the skin. A
                    form of elephantiasis prevails more or less on all the damp mountainous islands.
                    Many Europeans are subject to it, especially those who are much exposed to the
                    sun by day and the dews by night. In some of the atolls where the people have
                    little good vegetable food and eat a great quantity of fish, much of it often in
                    a state unfit for food, skin diseases are even more common than in the
                    mountainous islands. There are reputed cases of leprosy in the Gilbert Islands,
                    and that disease is well known to be one of the scourges of the Hawaiian
                    archipelago. Several European diseases have been introduced into the
                    islands,—those which are epidemic usually, at the first visitation, working
                    great havoc among the natives. Many in Europe and America appear to attribute
                    the great mortality which occurs among native races, when an epidemic is
                    introduced among them, to weakness and want of stamina in their constitution;
                    but a more probable explanation is found in the fact that, on the introduction
                    of measles or smallpox, all the inhabitants of an island are suitable subjects,
                    that the population of entire villages are prostrated at once, that there are no
                    doctors or nurses, none even to feed the sick or to give them drink, and not
                    even the most ordinary care is taken by the sufferers themselves to lessen the
                    danger.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In these warm
                    islands the people are generally accustomed to bathe often. When measles
                    prevailed in Fiji many of those who were in a high fever crawled to the bathing
                    places to cool themselves, and many died there. The present writer once visited
                    several islands of the Ellice group about a fortnight after a trading vessel
                    from Sydney, which had influenza on board. This vessel had taken some of the
                    natives from one island to another as passengers, and at three of the islands
                    the entire population was suffering from the epidemic. Had this been a more
                    severe disease the people would have been utterly helpless.</p></note> In some
                    islands, especially the Hawaiian group syphilis, first imported by Captain
                    Cook’s expedition, has wrought great havoc. It spread very rapidly, because, at
                    that time, there was almost promiscuous intercourse between the sexes; and this
                    has been one of the chief causes of the physical deterioration and of the rapid
                    decrease of the natives of Hawaii. The disease has been introduced into other
                    islands in later times through the visits of European and American sailors; but,
                    owing to the influence of Christian teaching, which has in many cases gone first
                    and has produced a change for the better in the relations of the sexes, it has
                    not generally spread.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Races.—</hi> There are three different kinds of people

                    broad and very distinct divisions,— the dark and the brown races. The dark
                    people occupy Australia, the Andaman Islands, portions of the Indian
                    archipelago, and western Polynesia, and have more or less remote affinity with
                    the natives of South Africa. The brown people are found in Madagascar, the
                    Indian Archipelago, Formosa, north-western and eastern Polynesia, together with
                    New Zealand, and are clearly of Asiatic origin.</p>
                <p>There are in Polynesia people who belong to both the dark and the light sections
                    of the Indo-Pacific races. At present the dark are found only in the western
                    islands as far as Fiji. In some islands they are considerably mixed with the
                    lighter race, and in many places within the region occupied by them are colonies
                    of the light people who keep themselves distinct. For this dark race the name
                    Papuan is here used. They have generally been known of late years as
                    Melanesians, but Papuan is an older name which has always been used for part of
                    the race, and which clearly ought to be extended to the whole. The region which
                    they inhabit is coloured yellow on the map, and the pink bands across it
                    indicate the presence of some of the light race there.</p>
                <p>The whole of eastern Polynesia is inhabited by a light brown people to whom the
                    name Sawaiori is here given.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>There has hitherto been no one well understood name used for
                    this people. They are generally called “Polynesians” simply, sometimes
                    “Malayo-Polynesians,” and recently the name “Mahori” (a vile corruption of
                    “Maori ”) has been proposed for them. For evident reasons we need some more
                    distinct name than Polynesian. Malayo-Polynesian cannot be confined to them, but
                    must rather be extended to the whole family of which they are but a branch. <hi

                    peoples.</p></note> They extend out of Polynesia to New Zealand. They have also
                    formed colonies among the Papuans in various places, and in some instances they
                    have become mixed in blood with the blacks among whom they have settled. The

                    the Indian Archipelago for the black, frizzly-haired people found in the Aru
                    Islands and New Guinea. That the inhabitants of the western portion of Polynesia
                    ought to be classed with these Papuans there can be no doubt. The older name is
                    therefore adopted here to include the whole, rather than the newer and less
                    distinctive name Melanesian which has been applied to only a part of the race. A
                    general description of the people is all that can be given here; for·further
                    details the reader is referred to the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Melanesia,

                    peoples much caution is required; but there is some reason for thinking they may
                    be remotely classified, together with all the other black people of the southern
                    hemisphere, with the tribes of South Africa.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Rev. R. H. Codrington believes the Papuan (Melanesian)
                    languages belong to the same stock as the rest of the Polynesian languages. But,
                    as is pointed out by Prof. Keane, he entirely overlooks the physical aspects of
                    the question. See <hi rend="italic">Journ. Anthrop. Soc. Lond.,</hi>

                <p>The Papuans are mostly black, but are not of a jet black. In some islands they
                    are lighter than in others. It was long popularly supposed that their hair grew
                    in small tufts. This was, however, a mistake which probably arose from the
                    manner in which many of them are accustomed to dress it On some islands the men
                    collect their hair into small bunches, and carefully bind each bunch round with
                    fine vegetable fibre from the roots up to within about two inches of the ends.

                    the resemblance between the head of a Papuan, with his hair thus dressed, and
                    the conventional representation of the hair in Egyptian and Assyrian sculptures,
                    and to what Dr Livingstone says about the Banyai of South Africa, who dress
                    their hair in a similar manner. When allowed to grow naturally, the hair of a
                    Papuan is always frizzly. Some of the people have a considerable beard.</p>
                <p>In the features of the Papuans there is considerable difference; but in a typical
                    specimen the lips are thick, the nose is broad, often arched and high, and the
                    jaws project; as a rule, the race is prognathous. They are generally small in
                    stature, but in some islands are large. Where, however, they are of large size,
                    we invariably find other evidence of their mixture with another race. Speaking,
                    therefore, of typical Papuans, we may say they are small, with thin limbs, and
                    are physically weak. In their natural condition they are a savage people and are
                    cannibals. They are broken up into hostile tribes, holding no intercourse with
                    one another except by warfare. The languages or dialects<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>No great care is here taken to distinguish
                    between the terms languages and dialects. While all the languages of Polynesia
                    may be included under three classes, we cannot speak of them as three languages,
                    each with numerous dialects, anymore than we could speak of those languages
                    which have grown out of the Latin as several dialects of one
                    language.</p></note> spoken by them are very numerous, owing, no doubt, to their
                    hostility towards one another, which has produced complete isolation. In
                    grammatical structure there is considerable resemblance between their languages,
                    but owing to long isolation the verbal differences have become very great.
                    Several different dialects are often found on one island.</p>
                <p>Among them women hold a very low position. Nearly all the hard work falls to
                    their share, the men devoting themselves chiefly to warfare. The women cultivate
                    the plantations, carry the burdens, and wait on the men. They take their food
                    from the leavings of the men. Among most of them family life is not greatly
                    elevated above the relationships existing among the lower animals, the relations
                    between the sexes being of the most degraded character. There is, however,
                    considerable affection often manifested towards their children. The Papuans are
                    impulsive and demonstrative in speech and action. They are generally a wild,
                    noisy, boisterous people, easily pleased and as easily offended. They differ so
                    much in different islands, however, that it is extremely difficult to generalize
                    concerning some of their characteristics. Many of them are decidedly low
                    intellectually. On some islands they appear to be physically and intellectually
                    a weak and worn-out race. Yet this must not be understood as applying to all. On
                    some islands youths and men may be seen who are among the brightest and most
                    intelligent-looking people in the Pacific. A vast difference exists between the
                    natives of parts of the New Hebrides and those of the Loyalty Islands, the
                    latter being much the finer. Mixture of blood may partly account for the
                    difference. Difference of physical surroundings, doubtless, also has something
                    to do with it. The dry, comparatively barren, and cooler islands of the Loyalty
                    group ought to have a finer people upon them than the malarious, hot, and moist
                    islands of the New Hebrides. In Fiji some of the finest men in Polynesia are
                    found, but many of the Fijians are considerably mixed with Sawaiori blood.</p>
                <p>As a rule, the Papuans lack elaborate historical traditions, poems, and songs,
                    such as are invariably found among the Sawaiori race. They do not naturally
                    possess much religious feeling or reverence, and their religious systems are
                    little more than fetichism. In this respect, too, they present a marked contrast
                    to the lighter race. In arts and manufactures they are comparatively low,
                    although there are marked exceptions. Usually their houses are very poor
                    structures. On many islands their canoes are of inferior construction. As a race
                    they are indifferent navigators. Their arms are, however, somewhat elaborately
                    made; and most of them make a coarse kind of pottery. In some parts of the
                    Solomon Islands the people build much better houses than are usually found among
                    the Papuans, carving some of the woodwork rather elaborately. They also build
                    good canoes or boats. In Fiji the natives build good houses and good boats, but
                    there the people have learned some of their arts from the Sawaioris. It may be
                    so also in the Solomon group. Indeed, throughout the whole of the Papuan region,
                    there is evidence of more or less mixture of the two races. In some places there
                    are pure colonies of Sawaioris, who keep themselves distinct from their
                    darker-coloured neighbours; but in many other places the lighter immigrants have
                    intermarried with the black race.</p>
                <p>The following are some broad characteristics of the Papuan languages. Consonants
                    are freely used, some of the consonantal sounds being difficult to represent by
                    Roman characters. Many of the syllables are closed. There does not appear to be
                    any difference between the definite and the indefinite article, except in Fiji.
                    Nouns are divided into two classes, one of which takes a pronominal suffix,
                    while the other never takes such a suffix. The principle of this division
                    appears to be a near or remote connexion between the possessor and the thing
                    possessed. Those things which belong to a person, as the parts of his body,
                    &amp;c., take the pronominal suffix; a thing possessed merely for use would not
                    take it. Thus, in Fijian the word <hi rend="italic">luve</hi> means either a son
                    or a daughter—one’s own child, and it takes the possessive pronoun suffixed, as
                    <hi rend="italic">luvena</hi>; but the word <hi rend="italic">ngone,</hi> a
                    child, but not necessarily one’s own child, takes the possessive pronoun before
                    it, as <hi rend="italic">nona ngone,</hi> his child, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.c.,</hi> his to look after or bring up.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hazlewood's <hi rend="italic">Fijian Grammar,</hi> pp. 8 and
                    9.</p></note> Gender is only sexual. Many words are used indiscriminately, as
                    nouns, adjectives, or verbs, without change; but sometimes a noun is indicated
                    by its termination. In most of the languages there are no changes in nouns to
                    form the plural, but an added numeral indicates number. Case is shown by
                    particles, which precede the nouns. Adjectives follow their substantives.
                    Pronouns are numerous, and the personal pronoun includes four numbers—singular,
                    dual, trinal, and general plural, also inclusive and exclusive. Almost any word
                    may be made into a verb by using with it a verbal particle. The difference in
                    the verbal particles in the different languages are very great. In the verbs
                    there are causative, intensive or frequentative, and reciprocal forms.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">The Sawaiori Race.—</hi> The brown people who occupy the
                    islands of eastern Polynesia are generally regarded as having affinities with
                    the Malays of the Indian Arclιipelago, and are sometimes spoken of as a branch
                    of the Malay race, or family. They cannot, however, with any accuracy be so
                    described. The Malays, as they now exist, are a comparatively modem people, who
                    have become what they are by the mixture of several elements not found in the
                    more primitive race. The Sawaioris and the Taraρons of Polynesia, the Malagasy
                    (Hovas) of Madagascar, and the Malays are allied races, but no one of them can
                    be regarded as the paient of the rest. The parent race has disappeared; but the
                    Sawaiori, as the earliest offshoot from it, and one which, owing to the
                    conditions under which it has lived, has remained almost free from admixture of
                    blood, may be taken as most nearly representing what the parent was. The

                    III.</p>
                <p>The absence of Sanskrit (or Prakrit) roots in tire languages appears to indicate
                    that the Sawaiori migration was in ρre-Sanskritic times.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>&lt; It is possible to make too much of the
                    absence of Sanskrit (or Prakrit) roots, since, as remarked by Dr Rost, “there
                    may have been no occasion for the introduction of ready-made terms into the
                    language.” Still the migration may be tentatively put in pre-Sanskritic
                    times.</p></note> Whether we can fix anything like a definite date for this may
                    well be questioned. Mr Fornander<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    168.</p></note> has, however, with great probability, traced back the history of
                    tire Hawaiians to the 5th century. He has studied the folk-lore of those islands
                    exhaustively, and from this source comes to the conclusion that the Sawaiori
                    migration from the Indian Archipelago may be approximately assigned to the close
                    of the first or to the second century. Most likely Samoa was the first group
                    permanently occupied by them. Owing to the admixture of the Sawaioris with the
                    Papuans in Fiji some authorities have thought the first settlement was in those
                    islands, and that the settlers were eventually driven thence by the Papuan
                    occupiers. We can, however, account for the presence of Sawaiori blood in Fiji
                    in another way, viz., by the intercourse that has been kept up between the
                    people of Tonga and Fiji. If the first resting-place of the Sawaioris was in
                    that group, there is good reason to believe that Samoa was the first permanent
                    home of the race, and that from Samoa they have spread to the other islands
                    which they now occupy.</p>
                <p>It used to be doubted whether <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> these people could
                    have gone from the Indian Archipelago so far eastward, because the prevailing
                    winds and currents are from the east. But it is now well known that at times
                    there are westerly winds in the region over which they would have to travel, and
                    that there would be no insuperable difficulties in the way of such a voyage. The
                    Sawaioris are invariably navigators. There is ample evidence that in early times
                    they were much better seamen than they are at present. Indeed their skill in
                    navigation has greatly declined since they have become known to Europeans. They
                    used to construct decked vessels capable of carrying one or two hundred persons,
                    with water and stores sufficient for a voyage of some weeks’ duration. These
                    vessels were made of planks well fitted and sewn together, the joints being
                    calked and pitched.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Cocoa-nut fibre and the gum which exudes from the bread-fruit tree arc
                    generally used for “calking” and “pitching” canoes.</p></note> It is only in
                    recent times that the construction of such vessels has ceased. The people had a
                    knowledge of the stars, of the rising and setting of the constellations at
                    different seasons of the year. By this means they determined the favourable
                    season for making a voyage and directed their course.</p>
                <p>The ancestors of the Sawaioris were by no means a savage people when they entered
                    the Pacific. Indeed their elaborate historical legends show that they possessed
                    a considerable amount of civilization. Those who are familiar with these
                    legends, and who have studied Sawaiori manners and customs, see many
                    unmistakable proofs that they carried with them, at the time of their migration,
                    knowledge and culture which raised them much above the status of savages, and
                    that during their residence in these islands the <pb break="no"

                    of their former condition will appear in the following account of the
                    people.</p>
                <p>The Sawaioris are, physically, a very fine race. On some islands they average 5
                    feet 10 inches in height. De Quatrefages, in a table giving the stature of

                    pp. 57-60.</p></note> puts the natives of Samoa and Tonga as the largest people
                    in the world. He gives the average height of this race as being 5 feet 9 '92
                    inches. They are well developed in proportion to their height. Their colour is a
                    brown, lighter or darker generally according to the amount of their exposure to
                    the sun,—being darker on some of the atolls where the people spend much time in
                    fishing, and among fishermen on the volcanic islands, and lighter among women,
                    chiefs, and others less exposed than the bulk of the people. Their hair is black
                    and straight; but in individual examples it is sometimes wavy, or shows a
                    tendency to curl. They have very little beard. Their features are generally
                    fairly regular; eyes invariably black, and in some persons oblique; jaws not
                    projecting, except in a few instances; lips of medium thickness; noses generally
                    short, but rather wide at the bases. Their foreheads are fairly high, but rather
                    narrow. When they are young many of the people of both sexes are good-looking.
                    The men often have more regular features than the women. In former times more
                    attention was paid to personal appearance and adornment among men than among the
                    women.</p>
                <p>As a race the Sawaioris are somewhat apathetic, They differ, however, in
                    different islands, according to their surroundings. Most of them live in an
                    enervating climate where nature is very lavish of her gifts. Hence they lead
                    easy lives. On the more barren islands, and on those more distant from the
                    equator, the natives have much more energy. Under certain circumstances they
                    become excitable, and manifest a kind of care-for-nothing spirit. This is only
                    occasionally seen, and chiefly in time of war, in a family dispute, or on some
                    other occasion when they are deeply moved. In the time of their heathenism they
                    were strict in their religious observances, and religion came into almost every
                    action of life. They were, in most instances, with comparative ease led to
                    accept Christianity, and this characteristic has remained under the new
                    condition of things. They are a shrewd people, with quick intelligence, and they
                    possess naturally a large amount of common sense. Where they have from early
                    years enjoyed the advantages of a good education, Sawaiori youths have proved
                    themselves to possess intellectual powers of no mean order. They are almost
                    invariably fluent speakers; with many of them oratory seems to be a natural
                    gift; it is also carefully cultivated. A Sawaiori orator will hold the interest
                    of his hearers for hours together at a political gathering, and in his speech he
                    will bring in historical allusions and precedents, and will make apt quotations
                    from ancient legends in a manner which would do credit to the best parliamentary
                    orators. Many of them are very brave, and think little of self-sacrifice for
                    others where duty or family honour is concerned.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of various acts by Sawaioris which indicate
                    the possession of bravery and self-possession under trying circumstances the
                    following may serve as a sample. Some lads belonging to two villages in Samoa
                    fell out, and began stone-throwing. One of them, who was the son of a chief, was
                    struck and, it was feared, was killed. As soon as this was known to the young
                    men of the village they armed themselves in order to go to the other village to
                    seek reparation, according to a custom of former times, by killing some one
                    belonging to the family of the boy who had thrown the stone. A report preceded
                    them that they were going, and a young man, a cousin of the boy, in order to
                    prevent a fight, quietly walked out of the village to meet the avengers of
                    blood. When he met them he calmly said, “You are coming to avenge your brother.
                    I am brother to the boy who killed him. Do not go further; kill me and be
                    avenged, so that our villages may remain at peace.” His conduct somewhat
                    disconcerted the party, and by the timely arrival of a Christian teacher matters
                    were settled without bloodshed.</p></note></p>
                <p>The terms for family among this race are used in two senses— (1 ) of a household,
                    and (2) of all blood relations on both the male and the female side, including
                    the wife or the husband, as the case may be, brought in by marriage,—also those
                    who have been adopted by members of the clan. In the following remarks the word
                    <hi rend="italic">family</hi> is used with the first meaning, and <hi
                    rend="italic">clan</hi> with the second. Each clan has a name which is usually
                    borne by one of the oldest members, who is the chief or head for the time being.
                    This clan system no doubt generally prevailed in early times, and was the origin
                    of the principal chieftainships. But changes have been made in most of the
                    islands. In some the head of one clan has become king over several. In many
                    cases large clans have been divided into sections under secondary heads, and
                    have even been subdivided. The different classes of chieftainships may probably
                    be thus accounted for.</p>
                <p>As a rule, near relations do not intermarry. In some islands this rule is rigidly
                    adhered to. There have been exceptions, however, especially in the case of high
                    chiefs; but usually great care is taken to prevent the union of those within the
                    prescribed limits of consanguinity. Children generally dwell with their kin on
                    the father’s side, but they have equal rights on the mother’s side, and
                    sometimes they take up their abode with their mother’s family. The only names
                    used to express particular relationships are father and mother, son and
                    daughter, brother and sister.</p>
                <p>There is usually no distinction between brothers (or sisters) and cousins, all
                    the children of brothers and sisters speak of each other as brothers and
                    sisters, and they call uncles and aunts fathers and mothers. Above the
                    rcl·ationship of parents all are simply ancestors, no term being used for
                    grandfather which would not equally apply to any more remote male ancestor. In
                    the same way there is no distinctive term for grandchild. A man speaks of his
                    grandchild as his son or daughter, or simply as his child.<note anchored="true"

                    >Ancient Society,</hi> pp. 419-423, makes the Sawaioris to· have distinctive
                    terms for grandfather, grandmother, grandson, and granddaughter. In this he is
                    entirely mistaken. It is evident from his own lists that the Hawaiian <hi
                    rend="italic">kupuna</hi> means simply an ancestor. In like manner <hi
                    rend="italic">moopuna</hi> simply means a descendent of any generation after the
                    first.</p></note> Polygamy was often practised, especially by chiefs, and also
                    concubinage. In some places a widow was taken by the brother of her deceased
                    husband, or, failing the brother, by some other relative of the deceased, as an
                    additional wife. Divorce was an easy matter, and of frequent occurrence; but, as
                    a rule, a divorced wife would not marry again without the consent of her former
                    husband. An adulterer was always liable to be killed by the aggrieved husband,
                    or by some member of his clan. If the culprit himself could not be reached, any
                    member of the clan was liable to suffer in his stead. In some islands female
                    virtue was highly regarded. Perhaps of all the groups Samoa stood highest in
                    this respect. There was a special ordeal through which a bride passed to prove
                    her virginity, and a proof of her immorality brought disgrace upon all her
                    relatives. But in other islands there was much freedom in the relations of the
                    sexes. Owing to the almost promiscuous intercourse which prevailed among a
                    portion of the race, in some groups titles descended through tlιe mother and not
                    through the father. In Hawaii there was a peculiar system of marriage
                    relationship, “brothers with their wives, and sisters with their husbands,
                    possessing each other in common.” There also, especially in the case of chiefs
                    and chieftainesses, brothers and sisters sometimes intermarried. But these
                    customs did not prevail in other groups. It is almost certain that they did not
                    prevail in Hawaii in early times, but, that they were the result of that
                    deterioration in the race which their traditions and many of their customs
                    indicate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Morgan has
                    founded one of his forms of family—the consanguine—on the supposed existence in
                    former times among the Malays and Polynesians of the custom of “intermarriage of
                    brothers and sisters, own and collateral, in a group.” All the evidence he finds
                    in support of this is (1) the existence of the custom above mentioned in Hawaii,
                    and (2) the absence of special terms for the relati&lt; n-ship of uncle, aunt,
                    and cousin, this indicating, he thinks, that these were regarded as fathers,
                    mothers, brothers, and sisters. He admits that “the usages with respect to
                    marriage which prevailed when the system was formed may not prevail at the
                    present time." But he adds, “To sustain the deduction it is not necessary that
                    they should” <hi rend="italic">(Ancient Society,</hi> p. 408). Morgan has given
                    special terms for grandfather and grandmother, because it would prove too much
                    to show that the people had no grandfathers, Ac. But these terms are used for
                    ancestors of any generation. The terms used for grandchildren, in like manner,
                    are used for any generation of descendants. He says (p. 406) the terms of
                    husband and wife are used in common by a group of sisters or brothers, but the
                    fact is that the words used for husband and wife in Hawaii simply mean male-and
                    female. In some islands there are terms used for wife in the most strict sense.
                    The word wife is not used more exclusively among us than among some· Sawaiori
                    people.</p></note></p>
                <p>Women have always occupied a relatively high position among the Sawaioris. In
                    most groups they have great influence and are treated with much respect. In some
                    cases they take hereditary titles and hold high offices. As among their
                    congeners in Madagascar, so also in parts of Polynesia, there may be a queen or
                    a chieftainess in her own right; and a woman in high position will command as
                    much respect, and will exercise as great authority, as a man would in the same
                    position. Everywhere infanticide prevailed; in some of the smaller islands it
                    was regulated by law in order to prevent over-population. It was also a very
                    common practice to destroy the foetus, yet, even before the reception of
                    Christianity, parents were affectionate towards the children who were spared.
                    The practice of adopting children was, and still is, common. Often there is an
                    exchange made between members of the same clan; but sometimes there is adoption
                    from without. Tattooing generally prevailed among the men, different patterns
                    being followed in different groups of islands. In some a larger portion of the
                    body is tattooed than in others. A youth was considered to be in his minority
                    until he was tattooed, and in former times he would have no chance of marrying
                    until he had, by submitting to this process, proved himself to be a man. Puberty
                    in the other sex was generally marked by feasting, or some other demonstration,
                    among the female friends. Old age is generally honoured. Often an inferior chief
                    will give up his title to a younger man, yet he himself will lose but little by
                    so doing. The neglect of aged persons is extremely rare.</p>
                <p>Property belonging to a clan is held in common. Each clan usually possesses land,
                    and over this no one member has an exclusive right, but all have an equal right
                    to use it. The chief or recognized head of the clan or section alone can
                    properly dispose of it or assign its use for a time to an outsider; and even he
                    is expected to obtain the consent of the heads of families before he alienates
                    the property. Thus land is handed down through successive generations <pb

                    of the clan or section for the time being· Changes have been made in many
                    islands in this respect; but there can be little reason to doubt that the joint
                    ownership of property in clans was common among the entire race in former
                    times.</p>
                <p>In early times the head of each clan was supreme among his own people, but in all
                    matters he had associated with him the principal men or heads of families in the
                    clan. Their united authority extended over all the members and the possessions
                    of the clan, and they were independent of every other clan. There are in some
                    places vestiges of this primitive state of society still remaining; the
                    transition to a limited or to a despotic monarchy may be traced by means of the
                    ancient legends in some islands, and in others it is a matter of recent history.
                    One clan being more numerous and stronger than another, and its chief being
                    ambitious, it is easy to see how by conquering a neighbouring clan he increased,
                    the importance of his clan and extended his own power. In some of the islands
                    this transition process has hardly yet developed into an absolute monarchy. We
                    may even see two or three stages of the progress. In one instance a certain clan
                    has the right to nominate the principal chief over an entire district; though it
                    is known as the ruling clan, its rule is mainly confined to this nomination, and
                    to decision for or against war. In all other respects the district enjoys the
                    privilege of self-government. In another case the nominal king over a district,
                    or over an entire island, can be elected only from among the members of a
                    certain clan, the monarchy being elective within that alone; but this king has
                    little authority. In other cases a more despotic monarchy has grown up—the
                    prowess of one man leading to the subjugation of other clans. Even in this case
                    the chiefs or heads of clans sometimes still hold their property and rule over
                    their own people, only rendering a kind of feudal service and paying tribute to
                    the king.</p>
                <p>The Sawaioris are exceedingly fond of rank and of titles. Much deference is paid
                    to chiefs and. to persons of rank; and special terms are generally employed in
                    addressing these. Every part of a chief s body and all his belongings have names
                    different from those employed for common people. The grade of rank which a
                    person occupies will often be indicated by the language in which he is
                    addressed. Thus, in Samoa there are four different terms for <hi rend="italic"
                    >to come :—sail</hi> is for a common man; <hi rend="italic">matin mai</hi> is a
                    respectful term for a person without a title; <hi rend="italic">susu</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mai</hi> for a titled chief; and <hi rend="italic">afio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mai</hi> for a member of the royal family. In addressing chiefs,
                    or others to whom one wishes to be respectful, the singular number of the
                    personal pronoun is rarely, used; the dual is employed instead,—the dual of
                    dignity or of respect.</p>
                <p>Offices and titles are seldom hereditary in our sense of the term, as descending
                    from father to son. They are rather elective within the limits of the clan, or
                    the division of a clan. A common practice is for the holder of a high title to
                    nominate a successor; and his nomination is generally confirmed by the chiefs,
                    or heads of households, with whom the right of election rests. In ancient times
                    the authority of a high chief or king did not usually extend to any details of
                    government. But in Hawaii there are traditions of a wise king who interested
                    himself in promoting the social wellbeing of the people, and made good laws for
                    their guidance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See a
                    remarkable example in Fornander's <hi rend="italic">Polynesian Race,</hi> vol.
                    ii. p. 89.</p></note> Usually all matters affecting a district or an island were
                    settled by the chiefs of the district, while those of a single village were
                    settled by a council consisting of the chiefs and heads of households in the
                    village. In some islands each clan, or each village, would feel itself at
                    liberty to make war on another clan or village, without consulting the views of
                    any higher authority. Indeed the rule was for each clan or district to settle
                    its own affairs. In the case of offences against individuals, either the person
                    injured, or another member of his clan, would avenge the injury done. For most
                    offences there was some generally recognized punishment— such as death for
                    murder or adultery; but often vengeance would fall upon another person instead
                    of the wrongdoer. In avenging wrong, a member of the village or of the clan to
                    which the offender belonged would serve equally well to satisfy their ideas of
                    justice if the culprit himself could n·ot be easily reached. Sometimes all the
                    members of the family, or of a village, to which a culprit belonged would flee
                    from their homes and take refuge in another village, or seek the protection of a
                    powerful chief. In some places, in cases of crime, the members of the family or
                    village would convey the culprit bound—sometimes even carrying him like a pig
                    that is to be killed—and place him with apologies before those against whom he
                    had transgressed. The ignominy of such a proceeding was generally considered
                    sufficient atonement for the gravest offences. There were slaves in many
                    islands, either persons conquered in war, or those who had been condemned to
                    lose their personal liberty on account of evil conduct.</p>
                <p>Pottery was not manufactured by the Sawaioris. When any of them possessed it they
                    obtained it from the Papuans. In most of their manufactures they were, however,
                    in advance of the Papuans. They made use of the vegetable fibres abounding in
                    the islands, the women manufacturing cloth, chiefly from the bark of the paper
                    mulberry <hi rend="italic">(Morus papyrifera),</hi> but also in some islands
                    from the bark of the bread-fruit tree, and the hibiscus. This in former times
                    furnished them with most of their clothing. They also made various kinds of
                    mats, baskets, and fans from the leaves of the pandanus, the bark of the
                    hibiscus, from species of böhmeria or other Urticaceous plants. Some of their
                    mats are very beautifully made, and in some islands they are the most valuable
                    property the people possess. The people also use the various fibre-producing
                    plants for the manufacture of ropes, coarse string, and fine cord, and for
                    making fishing nets. The nets are often very large, and are netted with a needle
                    and mesh as in hand-netting among ourselves. The Sawaioris are rather clever
                    workers in wood. Canoe and house-building are trades usually confined to certain
                    families. The large canoes in which they formerly made long voyages are no.
                    longer built, but various kinds of smaller canoes are made, from the commonest,
                    which is simply a hollowed-out tree cut into form, to the finely-shaped one
                    built upon a keel, the joints of the various pieces being nicely fitted, and the
                    whole stitched together with cord made from the husk of cocoa-nuts. Some of the
                    larger canoes are ornamented with rude carving; and in some islands they are
                    somewhat elaborately decorated with inlaid mother of pearl. The houses are
                    generally well and elaborately made, but nearly all the ornamentation is put on
                    the inside of the roof. The Sawaioris manufacture several wooden utensils for
                    household use, such as dishes or deep bowls, “pillows” or head-rests, and
                    stools. They also make wooden gongs, or drums, which they beat as they travel in
                    their boats, in their dances, &amp;c. They used to make wooden fishhooks, clubs,
                    spears, and bows. They still make wooden fishspears; also carved and inlaid
                    combs. They employ the bamboo for making drums and flutes. Formerly the knives
                    the people used were made of bamboo, which is still sometimes used for that
                    purpose. In the manufacture of these things they employed adzes made of stone,
                    shell, or hard wood, and a wooden drill pointed with stone, shell, or bone. They
                    made mother-of-pearl fishhooks, and they still use a part of those old hooks—or
                    artificial bait—in combination with steel hooks, the native-made portion being
                    generally shaped like a small fish. For water vessels, &amp;c., they employ
                    gourds and large cocoa-nut shells, in preparing which they put water into them
                    and allow the pulp or the kernel to decay, so that it may be removed without
                    breaking the rind or shell. Their drinking cups are made of half a cocoa-nut
                    shell. Sharks’ teeth, shells, and bamboo were formerly generally used as cutting
                    instruments; shaving was done with them, as well as surgical operations. They
                    employ vegetable dyes for painting their bark cloth, calabashes, &amp;c. In some
                    islands they also use a red earth for this purpose. Their cloth is generally
                    ornamented with geometrical patterns. Any drawings of animals, &amp;c., which
                    they make are exceedingly inartistic, and no attempt is made at perspective.
                    Their musical instruments are few and rude—consisting of the drums and flutes
                    already mentioned, and shell trumpets.</p>
                <p>The Sawaioris were all polytheists. Without doubt many of their gods are deified
                    men; but it is clear that some are the forces of nature personified, while
                    others appear to represent human passions which have become identified with
                    particular persons who have an existence in their historical myths.<note

                    regarded as “the first and principal god, uncreated, and existing from the
                    beginning, or from the time he emerged from <hi rend="italic">po,</hi> or the

                <p>The worship of certain of the great gods was common to all the people in a group
                    of islands. Others were gods of villages or of families, while others were gods
                    of individuals. The gods of clans were probably the spirits of the ancestors in
                    their own line. In some islands, when the birth of a child was expected, the aid
                    of the gods of the family was invoked, beginning with the god of the father. The
                    god prayed to at the instant of birth became the god of the child. In other
                    places the name of the child’s god was declared when the umbilical cord was
                    severed, <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> lhe gods were supposed to dwell in
                    various animals, in trees, or even in inanimate objects, as a stone, a shell,
                    &amp;c. In some islands idols bearing more or less resemblance to the human
                    shape were made. But in all cases the material objects were regarded simply as
                    the abodes of the immaterial spirits of the gods.</p>
                <p>Their temples were either national, for a single village, or for the god of a
                    family. They were sometimes large stone enclosures <hi rend="italic"
                    >{marae),</hi> sometimes a grove, or a house. The principal priests wer e a
                    particular order, the priesthood being hereditary. In some cases, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n445/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0445-0426"/> however, the father of a family was priest in his
                    own household and presented offerings and prayers to the family god.</p>
                <p>There was, in the Society Islands, a privileged class known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Areoi.</hi> They were the special devotees of two celibate gods.
                    They were not permitted to have children; any children they possessed when they
                    entered the society, and all children subsequently born to them, were destroyed.
                    The name Areoi became the synonym for all kinds of licence; the party wandered
                    about from place to place conducting obscene entertainments, and was feasted
                    with the best of all the people possessed. There were seven regular grades among
                    the Areoi society, besides an irregular class of attendants.</p>
                <p>In some islands human sacrifices were of frequent occurrence; in others they were
                    offered only on very rare and exceptional occasions, when the demand was made by
                    the priests for something specially valuable. The usual offerings to the gods
                    were food. The system of <hi rend="italic">tapu</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tabu</hi> so common among the Sawaioris was connected with their religious
                    rites. There were two ways by which things might become <hi rend="italic"
                    >tapu,-{l)</hi> by contact with anything belonging to the god, as his visible
                    representation or his priest. Probably it was thought that a portion of the
                    sacred essence of the god, or of a sacred person, was directly communicable to
                    objects which they touched. (2) Things were made <hi rend="italic">tapu</hi> by
                    being dedicated to the god; and it is this form of <hi rend="italic">tapu</hi>
                    which is still kept up. If, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> any one wishes to
                    preserve his cocoa-nuts from being taken, he will put something upon the trees
                    to indicate that they are sacred or dedicated. They cannot then be used until
                    the <hi rend="italic">tapu</hi> is removed from them. Disease and death were
                    often connected with the violation of <hi rend="italic">tapu,</hi> the offended
                    gods thus punishing the offenders. Disease was generally attributed to the anger
                    of the gods. Hence offerings, &amp;c., were made to appease their anger. The
                    first-fruits of a crop were usually dedicated to the gods to prevent them from
                    being angry; and new canoes, fishing-nets, &amp;c., were dedicated by prayers
                    and offerings, in order that the gods might be propitious to their owners in
                    their use.</p>
                <p>The Sawaiori people invariably believe in the existence of the spirit of man
                    after the death of the body. Their traditions on the condition of the dead vary
                    considerably in different groups; yet there is a general agreement upon main
                    points. Death is caused by the departure of the spirit from the body. The region
                    of the dead is subterranean. When the spirit leaves the body it is conveyed by
                    waiting spirits to the abode of spirits. In most islands the place of descent is
                    known. It is generally towards the west. In some traditions there is a
                    distinction between chiefs and common people in the spirit world. In others all
                    are much alike in condition. Some traditions indicate a marked distinction
                    between the spirits of warriors and those of others: the former go to a place
                    where they are happy and are immortal, while the latter are devoured by the gods
                    and are annihilated. In some, however, the spirits are said to live again after
                    being eaten. Some speak of the abode of spirits as being in darkness; but
                    usually the condition of things is similar to that which exists upon earth.
                    Amongst all the people it is believed that the spirits of the dead are able to
                    revisit the scenes of their earthly life. The visits are generally made in the
                    night, and are often greatly dreaded, especially when there may be any supposed
                    reason for spite on the part of the dead towards living relatives. Some writers
                    have connected cannibalism, where it existed among the Sawaioris, with religious
                    customs. In the Cook and Society Islands, when a human being was offered as a
                    sacrifice, the priest presented an eye of the victim to the king, who either ate
                    it or pretended to do so. Probably the earliest human sacrifices were the bodies
                    of enemies slain in battle. As it was supposed by some that the spirits of the
                    dead were eaten by the gods, the bodies of those slain in battle may have been
                    eaten by their victors in triumph. Mr Shortland appears to think that
                    cannibalism among the Maories of New Zealand may have thus originated.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Maori
                    Religion and Mythology</hi>, p. 26.</p></note> Among the Sawaioris generally it
                    appears to have been the practice at times to eat a portion of a slain enemy to
                    make his degradation the greater. In several groups there is evidence that this
                    was done. But where cannibalism was practised as a means of subsistence, it
                    probably originated in times of actual want, such as may have occurred during
                    the long voyages of the people, when it was resorted to as a means of
                    self-preservation. Being once accustomed to the practice, we can easily imagine
                    how they might resort to it again and again in times of scarcity. The testimony
                    of cannibals is that human ilesh is the best of food, and among such a people
                    there would not be strong moral reasons to restrain them from the
                    indulgence.</p>
                <p>The amusements of these people are very numerous. They are a light-hearted race,
                    usually living under easy conditions of life, and they have a large amount of
                    enjoyment Some of their amusements are boisterous and even savage, such as
                    wrestling and boxing. In some islands they have a kind of “hockey” and football.
                    They have running races, walking matches, and canoeracing. One of their most
                    exciting amusements is swimming in the surf. When there is a moderate sea on,
                    great numbers often join in this exercise and find immense pleasure in it.
                    Throwing the javelin, throwing at a mark with slings, and archery are also
                    practised. Some resort to cock-fighting. There are fishing matches; and at a
                    particular season large companies used to resort to pigeon-catching. In their
                    houses they have a number of games. Betting is very often carried on in
                    connexion with these. Much time is spent, especially after the evening meal, in
                    asking riddles, in rhyming, &amp;c. The recital of songs and myths is also a
                    source of great amusement; and on special occasions there is dancing. The night
                    dances were generally accompanied by much indecency and immorality, and for that
                    reason were discountenanced on the introduction of Christianity.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">The Tarapon Race.—</hi> These people have many points of
                    resemblance to the Sawaioris, but, as a rule, they are of smaller stature and
                    are less robust. They have straight black hair, which is more lank than that of
                    the Sawaioris. The Tarapons, however, differ considerably from one another, and
                    are evidently a mixed race. The natives of the Caroline Islands are larger than
                    the Gilbert Islanders. They are also much lighter in colour; they are more
                    yellow, whereas the Gilbert Islanders are darker, than the Sawaioris. In many
                    respects the Tarapons bear a much closer resemblance to the people cf some
                    portions of the Indian Archipelago than do the Sawaioris. It is the belief of
                    the present writer that the bulk of the Tarapons are the descendants of people
                    who, in comparatively recent times, migrated from the Indian Archipelago, and
                    that since they have been in Polynesia they have become mixed with people of
                    other races. There appears to be a little Papuan admixture. Those in the
                    Caroline Islands, especially, appear to have become mixed with Chinese and
                    Japanese blood— probably more Japanese than Chinese. There are several
                    well-authenticated instances of Japanese junks, with living people in them,
                    having been found in various parts of the North Pacific. In 1814 the British
                    brig “Forester” met with one off the coast of California (about 30° N. lat. ),
                    with three living men and fourteen dead bodies on board. In December 1832 a
                    Japanese junk arrived at the Hawaiian Islands with four of the crew living. If
                    these junks could cross the Pacific in the latitude of Hawaii it is not at all
                    unlikely that others running in a south-easterly direction would reach some of
                    the many atolls which stretch over about 35° of longitude, forming the Caroline
                    and Marshall archipelagoes.</p>
                <p>The traditions of the Gilbert Islanders tell us that their islands were peopled
                    from the west and also from the east. Those who came from the east are expressly
                    said to be from Samoa. Those from the west were more numerous than those from
                    the east. There are also traditions of the arrival of other strangers at some of
                    these islands. When the present writer was at the island of Peru, in the Gilbert
                    group, in 1869 there was still there the remnants of a large proah which, from
                    the description given, appears to have been like those used in the Indian
                    Archipelago. So far as we have materials for examination, craniometry confirms
                    other evidence, and indicates that the Tarapon people are more mixed than either
                    of the other Polynesian races.</p>
                <p>All the Tarapon people are navigators, but, owing to the fact that upon their
                    atolls they have little good timber, most of their canoes are inferior to those
                    of the Sawaioris. Their houses are also inferior. Their arms are fairly well
                    made. In the Gilbert Islands they manufacture elaborate armour, to cover the
                    entire body, from the fibre of the cocoa-nut husk. In the Caroline Islands very
                    fine mats are made; and a hand-loom is used, with which a coarse cloth is
                    made.</p>
                <p>Among the Tarapons women occupy a lower position than among the Sawaioris. The
                    difference is not, however, in the amount of work, or kind of drudgery, that is
                    expected from them, but rather in the social and domestic influence they exert.
                    The gods are chiefly the spirits of the great men of past ages. The
                    chieftainship and priesthood are often combined in the same persons. They are
                    strict in the observance of their religious rites. The shrines of their gods are
                    very numerous. In every house he visited in the Gilbert Islands, the present
                    writer saw either a small circle or a square formed with pieces of coral or
                    shells; this was neatly covered with broken coral and shells from the beach, and
                    in the centre stood a block of coral representing the god. These were the
                    household shrines. In various places about the islands there were similar
                    squares or circles, only larger, for the gods of villages or districts.
                    Offerings of food were presented to them, and often the stones were garlanded
                    with wreatns of cocoa-nut leaves. Some embalm their dead—especially the bodies
                    of beloved children. Women often carry the skulls of deceased children, hung by
                    a cord around the neck, as a token of affection.</p>
                <p>In the Tarapon languages consonants are more freely used than in the Sawaiori.
                    They have consonantal sounds which are not found in the latter, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">ch, dj,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">sä.</hi> Closed syllables
                    often occur; occasionally doubled consonants are used, but among some of the
                    people there is a tendency to introduce a slight vowel sound between them. Most
                    words take the accent on the penult. In some languages there appeal’s to be no
                    true article; but in the Gilbert Island language the Sawaiori <hi rend="italic"
                    >te</hi> is used for both the definite and the indefinite article. Gender is
                    sexual only. Number in the noun is either gathered from the requirement of the
                    sense, or is marked by pronominal words, or numerals. Case is known by the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n446/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0446-0427"/> position of the noun in the sentence, or by
                    prepositions. In the language of Ebon, one of the islands in the Marshall
                    archipelago, nouns have the peculiarity which is characteristic of the Papuan
                    languages: those which indicate close relationship—as of a son to a father, or
                    of the members of a person’s body—take a pronominal suffix which gives them the
                    appearance of inflexions. The present writer is not aware of the existence of
                    this in any other Tarapon language, but would not make too much of this negative
                    evidence. Many words are used indiscriminately as nouns, adjectives, or verbs
                    without any change of form. In some languages the personal pronouns are
                    singular, dual, and plural. In others there are no special dual forms, but the
                    numeral for two is used to indicate the dual. In the Ebon language there are
                    inclusive and exclusive forms of the personal pronouns which, so far as has been
                    ascertained, do not occur in any of the other Tarapon languages. The verbs
                    usually have no inflexions to express relations of voice, mood, tense, number of
                    person,—such distinctions being indicated by particles. In the Ebon language,
                    however, the tenses are sometimes marked; but in that the simple form of the
                    verb is frequently given. All have verbal directive particles. In Ponape, one of
                    the Caroline Islands, many words of ceremony are used in addressing chiefs, as
                    they are used in Samoa. The custom of tabooing words is also found there as it
                    is in the Sawaiori languages. For further particulars respecting the Tarapons,
                    see <hi rend="smallcaps">Micronesia.</hi><hi rend="italic">Missions.—</hi> The
                    first mission was commenced in Tahiti by the agents of the London Missionary
                    Society in 1797. Since then that society has continued and extended its labours
                    until it now occupies the Society, Cook, Austral, Tuamotu, Samoan, Tokelauan,
                    and Ellice groups, and several isolated islands, all peopled by the Sawaiori
                    race, besides other islands in the Papuan and Tarapon areas. With the exception
                    of a portion of the Tuamotu archipelago, all the people in the groups mentioned
                    are now nominal Christians. There are only three groups peopled by the Sawaioris
                    where the London Missionary Society’s agents do not labour; and two of these are
                    efficiently occupied by other societies—Hawaii mainly by the American Board, and
                    Tonga by the Wesleyan Missionary Society. These two groups are also entirely
                    Christian. The Marquesas Islands have not been Christianized, but are partly
                    occupied by missionaries from Hawaii. There are, therefore, only two groups
                    peopled by the Sawaioris where any heathen are found at the present day. An
                    estimate of the number of this people, based upon actual counting in many
                    islands, would be about 179,000, of which number about 161,500 are nominal
                    Christians, leaving about 17,500 still heathen. Of the Papuans a smaller
                    proportion are Christians. In Fiji and Rotuma the great majority of the
                    population have become nominal Christians through the labours of Wesleyan
                    missionaries. The Wesleyans have also successfully laboured in Duke of York
                    Island, near New Britain. In the Loyalty Islands most of the people have
                    embraced Christianity through the labours of the London Missionary Society’s
                    agents,—a part, however, being Roman Catholics. Aneityum in the New Hebrides has
                    become wholly Christian through the agency of Presbyterian missions. In a few
                    other islands in the New Hebrides, also in Banks and Santa Cruz groups, small
                    companies of converts have been gathered by the Presbyterian and the Episcopal
                    (Melanesian) missions. The rest of the people in the Papuan area in Polynesia
                    are still savages, and most of them are cannibals. The population of this area
                    may be estimated at about 600,000. Of this number about 130,000 are nominal
                    Christians. Excluding the inhabitants of the Ladrone and Pelew Islands, the
                    Tarapon people may be estimated at about 84,000. The agents of the Hawaiian
                    Board of Missions (taking the place of the American Board, under whose auspices
                    the missionaries first laboured in this region) are the most numerous here,
                    occupying portions of the Gilbert, Marshall, and Caroline Islands. Six atolls
                    south of the equator in the Gilbert group are occupied by native missionaries
                    from Samoa in connexion with the London Missionary Society. The number of
                    nominal Christians in these groups is about 38,000. The aggregate population of
                    Polynesia may thus be estimated at 863,000, of whom 539,500 are heathen and
                    323,500 are nominal or baptized Christians. From the records of the various
                    missionary societies it appears that out of this number 69,605, or very nearly
                    one-fifth, are communicants.</p>
                <p>In addition to the missionary societies already mentioned, which have done the
                    main work in the evangelization of the Polynesians, there are French Protestant
                    missionaries in Tahiti, and Protestant Episcopal clergymen in Hawaii and in
                    Fiji. There are also in many islands French Roman Catholic missionaries; but
                    these have a comparatively small number of adherents.</p>
                <p>Wherever the missions have been planted schools have also been established, and
                    the people have received more or less education. On the Christian islands nearly
                    all the people can now read, most can write, a,nd a large proportion are
                    acquainted with the elements of arithmetic. General education, thus far, is much
                    more common on those islands than it is at present in the British Isles.
                    Advanced schools have been founded in connexion with some of the missions, and
                    many of the native youths have shown considerable aptitude for some of the
                    higher branches of knowledge. In most of the larger groups colleges for the
                    education of native ministers have long been conducted. In these colleges, in
                    addition to Biblical exegesis and theology, other subjects, such as history and
                    elementary science, are taught. Many of the European and American missionaries
                    have devoted themselves largely to literary work in the vernacular of the
                    islands where they reside. Next to the translation of the Scriptures and the
                    preparation of lesson books for the common schools, they have either translated
                    works on history, science, &amp;c., or they have written such books as they
                    found the natives to need. In nearly every group occupied by the Sawaiori race
                    there is now a considerable vernacular literature, embracing elementary works on
                    most branches of knowledge. Amongst the other races the literature is of much
                    smaller extent. The entire Bible has been translated into five of the principal
                    Sawaiori languages of Polynesia. The entire New Testament, and a considerable
                    portion of the Old, has been translated into a sixth language, besides smaller
                    portions into others. The American Bible Society has supplied the Bibles for the
                    Hawaiian Islands. Many portions of the Scriptures for other islands have been
                    printed either in the islands or in Australia. Of the number of copies thus
                    circulated no record is easily accessible, but the British and Foreign Bible
                    Society has issued 153,462 entire Bibles or New Testaments in the Samoan,
                    Tahitian, Tongan, Rarotongan, and Niuèan languages. As among this race one
                    translation serves for an entire group, and in some cases for two or three
                    groups, nearly all the people possess the Scriptures. In no part of the world is
                    the Bible more read than it is by these islanders; and it has not been necessary
                    to give the Scriptures to them without charge in order to induce them to
                    read.</p>
                <p>In many islands the pastoral work is now mostly done by native ministers,—the
                    foreign missionaries who remain devoting themselves to superintendence, higher
                    education, and literature. The native pastors are always supported by the
                    voluntary gifts of the people to whom they minister. The people also build their
                    own churches and schools, and meet all the expenses connected with public
                    worship and education, upon the voluntary principle. No portion of Christendom
                    is better supplied with religious instruction than the Christianized islands of
                    Polynesia, and nowhere is there more regard paid by the people generally to
                    Sabbath observance, to public worship, and to other outward duties of religion.
                    Family worship is almost invariably observed.</p>
                <p>With all this, too many of the people are religious only in name; and in the
                    neighbourhood of ports, where casual visitors usually see and judge the native
                    character, there are some who have added many of the white man’s vices to their
                    own. But in estimating the influence of Christianity upon these people we should
                    remember that only about one-fifth of the nominal Christians are communicants.
                    If they be judged fairly, taking into consideration their past history and the
                    short time they have been under Christian influence, the present writer is
                    convinced that the verdict will be favourable as compared with any Christian
                    people in the world. Every one will admit that social, moral, and spiritual
                    reformations are not completed in a generation, but require time to bring them
                    to maturity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population—its alleged Decrease.—</hi> There is a general
                    notion abroad that in all the islands of Polynesia the native races are rapidly
                    decreasing; and this supposed fact is sometimes attributed to the missionaries.
                    The alleged diminution, however, is a general conclusion from particular
                    premises, and facts drawn from wider observations do not confirm it. The
                    question of the decrease of population in these islands is a wide one, which
                    cannot be fully discussed within the limits of the present article; but a few
                    general observations, and a few particular facts, may help to throw some light
                    upon it. (1) The estimates of population made by the first European or American
                    visitors to Polynesia were far too high. In nearly all islands the people live
                    almost entirely upon the coast; hence it was an error to reckon the inland
                    portions as having a population proportionate to the number of people seen upon
                    the coast. Then, when the visits of foreign ships were a novelty, the people
                    from other districts would crowd to the place where the ships anchored to see
                    them. Thus the population of particular villages was over-estimated. In the last
                    edition of this <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia</hi> the population of Samoa is
                    said to be variously estimated at from 160,000 to as few as 38,000. It is now
                    known that even the lowest estimate was somewhat over the actual number.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nature,</hi> for 1876, vol. xiv. pp. 190-91, Mr Whitmee gave the latest census
                    of Samoa, taken by actual counting, as being 34,265 in 1874. Yet, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Australasia,</hi> published in 1879, Mr A. R. λVallace says the
                    population of these islands “is variously estimated at 35,000 or
                    60,000.”</p></note> Most of the other groups were also greatly over-estimated.
                    Hence the decrease of population in any of the islands since they have become
                    known is not so great as it is supposed to be. (2) Those who have resided in
                    Polynesia, and who have made observations on the subject, know that previous to
                    the introduction of Christianity there had been a great decrease in the
                    population of most of the islands. There are numerous evidences that they were
                    formerly much more <pb break="no"

                    sacrifices, and cannibalism are doubtless among the causes of depopulation. (3)
                    Where the scourge of syphilis had not spread before Christianity was received,
                    and the love of anient spirits has not corrupted the people, there the
                    population has generally increased. It is found from a record of births and
                    deaths in some parts of Samoa, and from periodical census returns as a result of
                    actual counting from the whole of that group, that, apart from the destruction
                    caused by war, the population there increases at the rate of about 1 per cent,
                    per annum. Although Samoa has suffered more from internecine wars than any other
                    Christian group in Polynesia, there are more natives now living there than when
                    they were first counted in 1843, the number then being 33,901. The increase in
                    Tonga has been 25 per cent, in twenty years.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This fact is stated on the authority of the Rev. Mr Moulton,
                    a missionary residing there, and it is the result of counting.</p></note> On the
                    island of Niue the increase is more than 3 per cent, per annum. On several other
                    groups there has been increase, though figures are not available. The rapid
                    decline of population in Hawaii is entirely exceptional.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> Information on this subject, as far as it is
                    available, is given in the special articles on particular groups. The following
                    is a fair specimen of the kind and extent of the commerce which has grown in
                    Polynesia since Christianity has made the islands safe and profitable places for
                    the residence of traders.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>From figures supplied by the Rev. W. W. Gill, B.A.</p></note> From Cook
                    Islands, containing a population of about 8000, and three atolls which lie north
                    of that group, viz., Tongareva, Rakaanga, and Mauihiki, with a population of
                    about 4000, the exports during 1883 were 150 tons of cotton free from seeds, 50
                    tons of coffee, 1000 tons of copra, 84 tons of pearl shell, and about 100,000
                    gallons of lime juice, besides 5000 crates of oranges, containing about 300 per
                    crate. Mr Gill estimates the market value of this produce at £50,000,—more than
                    £4 per head for the native population. Part is purchased by merchants in Tahiti,
                    and part goes to Auckland, New Zealand. There are not many islands whence fruit
                    is exported, although, if there were markets within a few days’ sail, a large
                    quantity of fine oranges, pine-apples, and bananas might be provided. In 1878
                    the figures collected by the present writer relating to the trade in Samoa,
                    Tonga, and several other islands in that neighbourhood, showed that the exports
                    averaged annually about £4 each for the entire population, and that the imports
                    were only a little less.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prehistoric Remains.—</hi> The most remarkable of these are on
                    Easter Island, which lies at the south-eastern extremity of Polynesia, nearly
                    2500 miles from South America. This island is of volcanic formation, and is
                    about 11 miles long by 4 miles wide. The present inhabitants belong to the
                    Sawaiori race. Here are found, immense platforms built of large cut stones
                    fitted together without cement. They are generally built upon headlands, and on
                    the slope towards the sea. The walls on the sea-side are, in some of the
                    platforms, nearly 30 feet high and from 200 to 300 feet long, by about 30 feet
                    wide. Some of the squared stones are as much as 6 feet long. On the land side of
                    the platforms there is a broad terrace with large stone pedestals upon which
                    once stood colossal stone images carved somewhat into the shape of the human
                    trunk. On some of the platforms there are upwards of a dozen images now thrown
                    from their pedestals and lying in all directions. Their usual height is from 14
                    to 16 feet, but the largest are 37 feet, while some are only about 4 feet. They
                    are formed from a grey trachytic lava found at the east end of the island. The
                    top of the heads of the images is cut flat to receive round crowns made of a
                    reddish vesicular tuff found at a crater about 8 miles distant from the quarry
                    where the images were cut. A number of these crowns still lie at the crater
                    apparently ready for removal, some of the largest being over 10 feet in
                    diameter. In the atlas illustrating the voyage of La Pérouse a plan of the
                    island is given, with the position of several of the nlatforms. Two of the
                    images are also represented in a i late. One statue, 8 feet in height and
                    weighing 4 tons, was brought to England, and is now in the British Museum. In
                    one part of the island are the remains of stone houses nearly 100 feet long by
                    about 20 feet wide. These are built in courses of large fl.∣t stones fitted
                    together without cement, the walls being about 5 feet thick and over 5 feet
                    high. They are lined on the inside with upright slabs, on which are painted
                    geometrical figures and representations of animals. The roofs are formed by
                    placing slabs so that each course overlaps the lower one until the opening
                    becomes about 5 feet wide, when it is covered with flat slabs reaching from one
                    side to the other. The lava rocks near the houses are carved into the
                    resemblance of various animals and human faces, forming, probably, a kind of
                    picture writing. Wooden tablets covered witn various signs and figures have also
                    been found. The only ancient implement discovered on the island is a kind of
                    stone chisel, but it seems impossible that such large and numerous works could
                    have been executed with such a tool. The present inhabitants of Easter Island
                    know nothing of the construction of these remarkable works; and the entire
                    subject of their existence in this small and remote island is a mystery.</p>
                <p>On the island of Tonga-tabu, Tonga group, there is a remarkable monument. Two
                    large rectangular blocks of stone, about 40 feet in height, stand
                    perpendicularly, with a large slab lying across from one to the other. On the
                    centre of the horizontal stone is a large stone bowl. The island upon which this
                    monument is found is oι coral formation slightly elevated. These immense stones
                    must therefore have been conveyed thither by sea. The present inhabitants know
                    nothing of their history, or of the object which they were intended to
                    serve.</p>
                <p>In Ponapé, one of the islands of the Caroline group, there are extensive ruins,
                    the principal being a court about 300 feet in length, the walls of which are
                    formed of basaltic prisms and are about 30 feet in height. Inside, on all four
                    sides, next the wall is a terrace 8 feet high and 12 feet wide. The court is
                    divided into three by low walls, and in the centre of each division there is a
                    covered chamber 14 feet square. The walls above the terrace are 8 feet thick,
                    and some of the stones are 25 feet long by 8 feet in circumference. The basaltic
                    columns of which this structure is built were apparently brought a distance of
                    10 miles from the central ridge of the island. There are other ruins of smaller
                    extent on Ponapé, and also on the island of Kusaie in the same group. Ponapé and
                    Kusaie are remnants of larger islands which have been partially submerged. While
                    the smaller islands around which the coral polypes built up the atolls have
                    disappeared, these two remain as monuments of the past.</p>
                <p>North-west from Ponapé, in the Mariana or Ladrone Islands, there are other
                    remains in the shape of stone columns about 14 feet high, with a semi-globular
                    stone nearly 6 feet in diameter on the top of each, the rounded side being
                    uppermost.</p>
                <p>Thus in four different and widely separated parts of Polynesia there are relics
                    of prehistoric people. These together form one of the greatest puzzles the
                    ethnologist has to deal with. (8. J. W.)</p>
