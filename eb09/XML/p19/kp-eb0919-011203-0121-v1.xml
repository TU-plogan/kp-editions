                        rend="italic">c.</hi> 1492-1546), the head of the Roman school of painting
                    in succession to Raphael. This prolific painter, modeller, architect, and
                    engineer is currently named <hi rend="smallcaps">Giulio</hi> (or <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Julio) Romano,</hi> from the place of his birth—Rome, in
                    the Macello de’ Corbi. His name in full was Giulio di Pietro di Filippo de’
                    Giannuzzi,—Giannuzzi being the true family name, and Pippi (which has
                    practically superseded Giannuzzi) being an abbreviation from the name of his
                    grandfather Filippo.</p>
                <p>The date of Giulio’s birth is a little uncertain. Vasari (who knew him
                    personally) speaks of him as fifty-four years old at the date of his death, 1st
                    November 1546; thus he would have been born in 1492. Other accounts assign 1498
                    as the date of birth. This would make Giulio young indeed in the early and in
                    such case most precocious stages of his artistic career, and would show him as
                    dying, after an infinity of hard work, at the comparatively early age of

                    and at Raphael’s death in 1520 he was at the utmost twentyeight years of age.
                    Raphael had loved him as a son, and had employed him in some leading works,
                    especially in the Loggie of the Vatican; the series there popularly termed
                    “Raphael’s Bible” is done in large measure by Giulio,— as for instance the
                    subjects of the Creation of Adam and Eve, Noah’s Ark, and Moses in the
                    Bulrushes. In the saloon of the “Incendio del Borgo,” also, the figures of
                    Benefactors of the Church (Charlemagne, &amp;c.) are Giulio’s handiwork. It
                    would appear that in subjects of this kind Raphael simply furnished the design,
                    and committed the execution of it to some assistant, such as Giulio,—taking
                    heed, however, to bring it up, by final retouching, to his own standard of style
                    and type. Giulio at a later date followed out exactly the same plan; so that in
                    both instances inferiorities of method, in the general blockingout and even in
                    the details of the work, are not to be precisely charged upon the <hi
                        rend="italic">caposcuola.</hi> Amid the multitude of Raphael’s pupils,
                    Giulio was eminent in pursuing his style, and showed universal aptitude; he did,
                    among other things, a large amount of architectural planning for his chief.
                    Raphael bequeathed to Giulio, and to his fellowpupil Gianfrancesco Penni (“Il
                    Fattore ”), his implements and works of art; and upon them it devolved to bring
                    to completion the vast fresco-work of the “Hall of Constantine” in the
                    Vatican—consisting, along with much minor matter, of the four large subjects,
                    the Battle of Constantine, the Apparition of the Cross, the Baptism of
                    Constantine, and the Donation of Rome to the Pope. The two former compositions
                    were executed by Pippi, the two latter by Penni. The whole of this onerous
                    undertaking was completed within a period of only three years,—which is the more
                    remarkable as, during some part of the interval since Raphael’s decease, the
                    Fleming, Adrian VI., had been pope, and his anti-aesthetic pontificate had left
                    art and artists almost in a state of inanition. Clement VII. had now, however,
                    succeeded to the popedom. By this time Giulio was regarded as the first painter
                    in Rome; but his Roman career was fated to have no farther sequel.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of 1524 his friend the celebrated writer Baldassar Castiglione
                    seconded with success the urgent request of the duke of Mantua, Federigo
                    Gonzaga, that Giulio should migrate to that city, and enter the duke’s service
                    for the purpose of carrying out his projects in architecture and pictorial
                    decoration. These projects were already considerable, and under Giulio’s
                    management they became far more extensive still. The duke treated his painter
                    munificently as to house, table, horses, and whatever was in request; and soon a
                    very cordial attachment sprang up between them. In Pippi’s multifarious work in
                    Mantua three principal undertakings should be noted. (1) In the Castello he
                    painted the History of Troy, along with other subjects. (2) In the suburban
                    ducal residence named the Palazzo del T (this designation being apparently
                    derived from the form of the roads which led towards the edifice) he rapidly
                    carried out a rebuilding on a vastly enlarged scale,—the materials being brick
                    and terra-cotta, as there is no local stone,— and decorated the rooms with his
                    most celebrated works in oil and fresco painting—the story of Pfeyche, Icarus,
                    the Fall of the Titans, and the portraits of the ducal horses and hounds. The
                    foreground figures of Titans are from 12 to 14 feet high; the room, even in its
                    structural details, is made to subserve the general artistic purpose, and many
                    of its architectural features are distorted accordingly. Greatly admired though
                    these preeminent works have always been, and at most times even more than can
                    now be fully ratified, they have suffered severely at the hands of restorers,
                    and modern eyes see them only through a dull and deadening fog of renovation.
                    The whole of the work on the Palazzo del T, which is of the Doric order of
                    architecture, occupied about five years. (3) Pippi recast and almost rebuilt the
                    cathedral of Mantua; erected his own mansion, replete with numerous antiques and
                    other articles of vertu; reconstructed the street architecture to a very large
                    extent, and made the city, sapped as it is by the shallows of the Mincio,
                    comparatively healthy; and at Marmiruolo, some five miles distant from Mantua,
                    he worked out other important buildings and paintings. He was in fact, for
                    nearly a quarter of a century, a sort of Demiurgus of the arts of design in the
                    Mantuan territory.</p>
                <p>Giulio’s activity was interrupted but not terminated by the death of Duke
                    Federigo. The duke’s brother, a cardinal who became regent, retained him in full
                    employment. For a while he went to Bologna, and constructed the façade of the
                    church of S. Petronio in that city. He was afterwards invited to succeed Antonio
                    Sangallo as architect of St Peter’s in Rome,—a splendid appointment, which,
                    notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of his wife and of the cardinal regent,
                    he had almost resolved to accept, when a fever overtook him, and, acting upon a
                    constitution somewhat enfeebled by worry and labour, carried him off on 1st
                    November 1546. He lies buried in the church of S. Barnaba in Mantua. At the time
                    of his death Giulio enjoyed an annual income of more than 1000 ducats, accruing
                    from the liberalities of his patrons. He left a widow, and a son and daughter.
                    The son, named Raffaello, studied painting, but died before he could produce any
                    work of importance; the daughter, Virginia, married Ercole Malatesta.</p>
                <p>Wide and solid knowledge of design, combined with a promptitude of composition
                    that was never at fault, formed the chief motive power and merit of Giulio
                    Romano’s art. Whatever was wanted, he produced it at once, throwing off, as
                    Vasari says, a large design in an hour; and he may in that sense, though not
                    equally so when an imaginative or ideal test is applied, be called a great
                    inventor. It would be difficult to name any other artist who, working as an
                    architect, and as the plastic and pictorial embellisher of his architecture,
                    produced a total of work so fully and homogeneously his own; hence he has been
                    named “the prince of decorators.” He had great knowledge of the human frame, and
                    represented it with force and truth, though sometimes with an excess of
                    movement; he was also learned in other matters, especially in medals, and in the
                    plans of ancient buildings. In design he was more strong and emphatic than
                    graceful, and worked a great deal from his accumulated stores of knowledge,
                    without consulting nature direct. As a general rule, his designs are finer and
                    freer than his paintings, whether in fresco or in oil—his easel pictures being
                    comparatively few, and some of them the reverse of decent; his colouring is
                    marked by an excess of blackish and heavy tints.</p>
                <p>Giulio Romano introduced the style of Raphael into Mantua, and established there
                    a considerable school of art, which surpassed in development that of his
                    predecessor Mantegna, and almost rivalled that of Rome. Very many
                    engravings—more than three hundred are mentioned—were made contemporaneously
                    from his works; and this not only in Italy, but in France and Flanders as well.
                    His plan of entrusting principally to assistants the pictorial execution of his
                    cartoons has already been referred to; Primaticcio was one of the leading
                    coadjutors. Rinaldo Mantovano, a man of great ability who died young, was the
                    chief executant of the Fall of the Giants; he also co-operated with Benedetto
                    Pagni da Pescia in painting the remarkable series of horses and hounds, and the
                    story of Psyche. Another pupil was Fermo Guisoni, who remained settled in
                    Mantua. The oil pictures of Giulio Romano are not generally of high importance;
                    two leading ones are the Martyrdom of Stephen, in the church of that saint in
                    Genoa, and a Holy Family in the Dresden Gallery. Among his architectural works
                    not already mentioned is the Villa Madama in Rome, with a fresco of Polyphemus,
                    and boys and satyrs; the Ionic façade of this building may have been sketched
                    out by Raphael.</p>
                <p>Vasari gives a pleasing impression of the character of Giulio. He was very loving
                    to his friends, genial, affable, well-bred, temperate in the pleasures of the
                    table, but liking fine apparel and a handsome scale of living. He was
                    good-looking, of middle height, with black curly hair and dark eyes, and an
                    ample beard; his portrait, painted by himself, is in the Louvre. (W. Μ. R. ) <pb
