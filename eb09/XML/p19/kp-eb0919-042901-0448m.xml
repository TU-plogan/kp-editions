                    covered with hard, polished, ganoid scales, which are arranged in oblique
                    series. The head, with flattened snout and wide mouth, is protected by bony
                    plates with ganoid external surface, of which a series of “supra-temporal” and
                    “spiracular” ossicles are especially characteristic. Spiracles, or external
                    openings of a canal leading into the pharynx are persistent throughout life,
                    situated on each side of the parietal bone, and closed by an osseous valve. The
                    lips are fleshy, but the space between the rami of the mandible is covered by a
                    large “gular” plate. The vent is placed far backwards, in front of the anal fin,
                    the tail being short, with a diphycercal termination of the vertebral column.
                    The mouth is well provided with rasp-like teeth, forming broad bands in the
                    jaws, on the vomer and palatine bones. The paired fins are supported by an axial
                    skeleton. The structure of the dorsal fin is unique: its anterior portion is
                    composed of isolated finlets, from eight to eighteen in number, each of which
                    consists of a flattened spine with a bifurcate termination; to the posterior
                    aspect of the top of each spine several soft rays are attached, which result
                    from the dichotomous division of a single ray, the basal portion of which is the
                    spine. Posteriorly these finlets pass into the ordinary rays composing the
                    caudal fin, which surrounds the tail. The ventral fins are well-developed, and
                    inserted behind the middle of the length of the trunk. The respiratory apparatus
                    consists of three and a half gills, and is protected by an osseous
                    gill-cover.</p>
                <p>An external gill of considerable size in the form of a tapering band fringed with
                    respiratory laminae exists in young examples, and is attached to the end of the
                    gillcover. The air-bladder is double, and communicates with the ventral wall of
                    the pharynx.</p>
                <p>Such are some of the principal characteristics of one of the most interesting
                    representatives of a type which in <hi rend="italic">Polypterus</hi> has
                    survived from the Devonian and Carboniferous formations to our period; for
                    further details of its internal organization see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ichthyology.</hi> The centre of distribution of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polypterus</hi> is the lake region of tropical Africa, from which the Nile and
                    the great ri∖ers of West Africa take their origin. A very remarkable fact is its
                    total absence in the East-African river systems which belong to tl.e Indian
                    Ocean. Specimens of the bishir have been found in the Nile as low as Cairo, but
                    it is very scarce throughout the middle and lower parts of that river; such
                    individuals have evidently been carried by the current down from southern
                    latitudes, and do not propagate the species in the northern parts. As mentioned
                    above, the number of the rays which are modified into finlets varies
                    considerably, and consequently several species have been distinguished by some
                    naturalists, whilst others hold that the∣e is one species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polypterus</hi> only. The largest specimens observed had a length of 4 feet.
                    Nothing is known of its habits and propagation, and observations thereon are
                    very desirable. Some years ago an extremely interesting dwarf form of <hi
                    rend="italic">Polypterus</hi> was discovered in Old Calabar, and described under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Calav</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">oichthys calabaricus.</hi> It much resembles the bishir but is
                    smaller, and considerably more elongate.</p>
