                    into two basins by a chain of three small islands, and the inner basin is
                    subdivided into the naval and the commercial harbour by the Scoglio Olivi, a
                    larger island connected with the mainland by an aqueduct. The hills enclosing
                    the harbour are defended by forts and batteries. The town proper lies opposite
                    the Scoglio Olivi, round the base of a hill formerly crowned by the Roman
                    capitol and now by a castle of the 17th century. Besides the castle the chief
                    mediaeval and modern buildings are the cathedral (15th century), the Franciscan
                    convent (13th century), the Government and municipal offices, the huge infantry
                    barracks, and the theatre. To the southwest, along the coast, extends the marine
                    arsenal, a vast and well-planned establishment employing about 2000 workmen and
                    possessing all the requisites for the equipment of a large fleet. It contains an
                    interesting naval museum, and is supplemented by the docks and wharfs of the
                    Scoglio Olivi. The artillery laboratory and the powder magazine are on the north
                    bank of the harbour. Behind the arsenal lies the suburb of San Policarpo, almost
                    exclusively occupied by the naval population and containing large naval barracks
                    and hospitals. In the middle of it is a pleasant park, with a handsome monument
                    to the emperor Maximilian of Mexico, who had been a rear-admiral in the Austrian
                    navy. To the north, between San Policarpo and the town proper, rises the Monte
                    Zarro, surmounted by an observatory and a statue of Admiral Tegetthoff. Pola has
                    no manufactures outside of its naval stores, but its shipping trade is now
                    considerable, the exports consisting of fish, timber, and quartz sand used in
                    making Venetian glass, and the imports of manufactured and colonial wares. The
                    population has increased from 600 at the close of last century and 5000 in 1857
                    to 25,175 in 1880, including a garrison of 5000 men. To many people, however,
                    the chief interest of Pola centres in its fine Roman remains. The most extensive
                    of these is the amphitheatre, which is 400 feet long and 320 feet wide, and
                    could accommodate 20,000 spectators. It is remarkable as the only Roman
                    amphitheatre of which the outer walls have been preserved intact; the interior,
                    however, is now completely bare, — though the arrangements for the naumachiae,
                    or naval contests, can still be traced. The oldest Roman relic is the fine
                    triumphal arch of the Sergii, erected soon after the battle of Actium; and of
                    not much later date is the elegant and well-preserved temple of Augustus and
                    Roma. Among the other antiquities are three of the old town-gates and a fragment
                    of a temple of Diana.</p>
                <p>The foundation of Pola is usually carried back to the mythic period, and ascribed
                    to the Colchian pursuers of Jason and the Argonauts. In all probability it was a
                    Thracian colony, but its verifiable history begins with its capture by the
                    Romans in 178 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It was destroyed by Augustus on
                    account of its espousal of the cause of Pompey, but was rebuilt on the
                    intercession of his daughter Julia, and received (according to Pliny) the name
                    of Pietas Julia. It seems to have attained its greatest prosperity about the
                    time of the emperor Septimius Severus (193- 211 A.D.), when it was an important
                    war harbour and contained 35,000 to 50,000 inhabitants. At a later period Pola
                    became the capital of the margraves of Istria, and was more than once captured
                    and plundered by the Venetians, who finally made themselves masters of the
                    peninsula. In 1379 the Genoese, after defeating the Venetians in a great naval
                    battle off the coast, took and destroyed Pola, which disappears from history for
                    the next four hundred and -fifty years. It remained under Venetian supremacy
                    down to 1797, and has been permanently united with Austria since 1815. In 1848 a
                    new era began for Pola in its being selected as the principal naval harbour of
                    Austria, and since then its progress has been constant.</p>
