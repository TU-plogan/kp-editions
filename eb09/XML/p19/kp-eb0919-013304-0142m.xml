                    lawyer and scholar, was born at Troyes on November 1, 1539. His taste for
                    literature was early seen, and his father, an advocate, cultivated it to the
                    utmost. He first studied at Troyes, and afterwards went to Paris, where he
                    completed his classical studies under Adrien Turnèbe and Pierre Galand. He next
                    attended the lectures in law of Cujas at Bourges and Valence, and was called to
                    the Paris bar in 1560. Here he achieved but little success as a pleader, but
                    soon acquired a considerable practice as a consulting lawyer. On the outbreak of
                    the second war of religion in 1567, Pithou, who was a Calvinist, withdrew to
                    Sedan and afterwards to Basel, whence he returned to France on the publication
                    of the edict of pacification. Soon afterwards he accompanied the <pb break="no"

                    returning shortly before the massacre of St Bartholomew, in which he narrowly
                    escaped with his life. Next year he followed the example of Henry of Navarre, to
                    whose cause he was ardently attached, by abjuring the Protestant faith. Henry,
                    shortly after his own accession to the throne of France, recognized Pithou’s
                    talents and services by bestowing upon him various legal appointments. It was
                    considerably after this date that Pithou achieved what was probably the most
                    important work of his life, whether political or literary, by co-operating in
                    the production of the powerful <hi rend="italic">Satire</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Menippée</hi> (1593), which did so much to damage the cause of the League; the
                    harangue of Daubray is usually attributed to his pen. He died at
                    Nogent-sur-Seine on November 1,1596. His valuable library, specially rich in
                    MSS., was for the most part transferred to what is now the Bibliothèque
                    Nationale in Paris.</p>
                <p>Pithon wrote a great number of legal and historical books, oesides preparing
                    editions of several ancient authors. His earliest publication was <hi
                    rend="italic">Adversariorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Subsecivorum Lib. II.</hi>
                    (1565), which ιvas highly praised by Turnèbe, Lipsius, and others. Perhaps his
                    5diti0n of the <hi rend="italic">Leges</hi><hi rend="italic">Visigotharum</hi>
                    (1579) was his most valuable iontribution to historical science; in the same
                    line he edited the <hi rend="italic">Capitula</hi> of Charlemagne, Louis the
                    Pious, and Charles the Bald in 1588, and he also assisted his brother François
                    in preparing an edition of the <hi rend="italic">Corpus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonici</hi> (1687). His essay <hi rend="italic"
