                    posthumous child. After obtaining some classical education at the school of
                    Dalkeith, Pitcairne entered Edinburgh university in 1668, and took his degree of
                    Μ. A. in 1671. Like some men of great general ability, he seems to have remained
                    long undetermined as to his future profession, and before taking to medicine he
                    had made some progress first in divinity and then in law. But, having been sent
                    to France for the benefit of his health, he was induced at Paris to begin the
                    study of medicine. On his return to Scotland he applied himself for a time and
                    with great success to the study of mathematics. Having at last taken vigorously
                    to medicine, first at Edinburgh and afterwards for the second time at Paris, he
                    obtained in 1680 his degree of M.D. from the faculty at Rheims. On returning to
                    Scotland he at once began practice at Edinburgh, and in a short time acquired a
                    great and wide reputation—so much so that in 1692 he was invited to fill a
                    professor’s chair at Leyden, and is said to have lectured there with great
                    applause. Among his pupils were at least two men who afterwards rose to great
                    eminence in their profession, Mead and Boerhaave, and both of them are
                    understood to have attributed much of their skill to what they had learned from
                    Pitcairne. In the following year <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n142/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0142-0133"/> Pitcairne returned to Scotland to fulfil a
                    matrimonial engagement with a daughter of Sir Archibald Stevenson, an eminent
                    physician in Edinburgh; and, the family of the young lady having objected to
                    their daughter going abroad, Pitcairne did not return to Leyden, but settled
                    once more in Edinburgh, speedily acquired a most extensive practice, rose indeed
                    to be the first physician of his time in Scotland, and was frequently called in
                    as consulting physician not only in England but even in Holland.</p>
                <p>Soon after his return to Edinburgh, feeling the great want of the means of
                    anatomical study, he importuned the town council to permit himself and certain
                    of his medical friends to dissect the bodies of paupers in “Paul’s Work”
                    unclaimed by their relations, and who therefore had hitherto been buried at the
                    town’s expense. They offered to attend them gratis when ill, and after
                    dissection to bury them at their own charges. Strangely enough this proposal was
                    strongly opposed by the chief surgeons of the place, but ultimately the town
                    council had the good sense to comply with Pitcairne’s request, and in this way
                    he may be said to have the credit of laying the foundation of the great
                    Edinburgh school of medicine.</p>
                <p>Though, according to Boerhaave, Pitcairne had not completely emancipated himself
                    from some of the fanciful theories prevalent in his age in the science of
                    medicine, yet the main characteristic of his superiority appears to have been
                    that, like Sydenham and the higher class of physicians in England at that time,
                    he insisted on strict adherence to the Baconian method of attending chiefly to
                    facts of experience and observation. “Nothing,” he remarks, “more hinders physic
                    from being improved than the curiosity of searching into the natural causes of
                    the effects of medicines. The business of men is to know the virtues of
                    medicines, but to inquire whence they have that power is a superfluous
                    amusement, since nature lies concealed. A physician ought therefore to apply
                    himself to discover by experience the effects of medicines and diseases, and
                    reduce his observations into maxims, and not needlessly fatigue himself by
                    inquiring into their causes, which are neither possible nor necessary to be
                    known. If all physicians would act thus we should not see physic divided into so
                    many sects.”</p>
                <p>Pitcairne’s medical opinions are chiefly contained in a volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertations</hi> which he published in 1701 (second and improved
                    edition, 1713). In these he discusses the application of geometry to physic, the
                    circulation of the blood in the smaller vessels, the difference in the quantity
                    of the blood contained in the lungs of animals in the womb and of the same
                    animals after birth, the motions by which food becomes fit to supply the blood,
                    the question as to inventors in medicine (in which he repels the idea of certain
                    medical discoveries of modern times having been known to the ancients,
                    especially vindicating for Harvey the discovery of the circulation of the blood,
                    and refuting the opinion of Dacier and others that it was known to Hippocrates),
                    the cure of fevers by evacuating medicines, and the effects of acids and alkalis
                    in medicine.</p>
                <p>In addition to his great knowledge and <hi rend="subscript"> rf</hi> skill as a
                    physician, Pitcairne is understood to have -been also an accomplished
                    mathematician. He was intimate with the two Gregorys, and is said to have made
                    some improvement on the method of infinite series invented by David Gregory. His
                    strong addiction to mathematics seems to have misled him, along with some other
                    eminent men of his time, into the idea of applying its methods of reasoning to
                    subjects for which they are quite unfitted: in Pitcairne’s case the attempt is
                    made in one of his papers to adapt them to medicine.</p>
                <p>He was also a very thorough classical scholar, and wrote Latin verses,
                    occasionally with something more than mere imitative cleverness and skill. Some
                    verses of his on the death of Lord Dundee were translated by Dryden, and, as one
                    of the latest editors of Dryden’s poetry with perfect justice remarks, “the
                    translation will not be thought so happy as the original.”</p>
                <p>According to the representations which are left by his contemporaries of his
                    personal bearing and character, he seems to have carried his great faculties
                    very lightly. A strong man all round, with great animal spirits and jovial
                    habits, somewhat contemptuous of the gravities and feeblosities around him, a
                    loudly avowed Jacobite and Episcopalian, rather reckless in his jests and
                    sarcasms, and spending a good deal of his time in clubs, public houses, and
                    drinking jollities, he was evidently regarded with little favour and some
                    suspicion by the sober and decent Presbyterian circles of Edinburgh. “Drunk
                    twice a day,” according to the worthy, credulous, gossiping Wodrow (in one of
                    his note books); “an unbeliever,” “much given to profane jests,” an “atheist,”
                    according to others. These reports may be taken for what they are worth, which
                    perhaps is not very much. What is certain is that he was repeatedly involved in
                    violent quarrels with his medical brethren and others, and once or twice got
                    into scrapes with the Government on account of his indiscreet political
                    utterances. Among his friends, however, he was evidently well liked, and he is
                    known to have acted with great kindhess and generosity to deserving men who
                    needed his help. Ruddiman, the great Scottish scholar, for example, was rescued
                    from a life of obscurity by his encouragement and assistance, and by no one was
                    his memory more gratefully cherished.</p>
                <p>“—Vale, lux Seotigenum, princepsque Medentum, Musarum columen deliciaeque, vale
                    !”</p>
                <p>are the concluding lines of a Latin epitaph by him on his venerated patron and
                    friend, which still remains on Pitcairne’s monument in the Greyfriars
                    churchyard. Mead too, appears never to have forgotten what he owed to his old
                    teacher at Leyden. A son of Pitcairne’s had gone out in the rebellion of 1715,
                    and, having been condemned to death was saved by the earnest interposition of
                    Mead with Sir Robert Walpole. He pleaded, very artfully, that if Walpole’s
                    health had been bettered by his skill, or if members of the royal family were
                    preserved by his care, it was owing to the instruction he had received from Dr
                    Pitcairne. Pitcairne died in October 1713. Among his other scholarly tastes he
                    had been a great collector of books, and his library, which is understood to
                    have been of considerable value, was, through the influence of Ruddiman,
                    disposed of to Peter the Great of Russia.</p>
