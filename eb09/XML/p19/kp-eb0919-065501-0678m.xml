                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> they appear to have had no other title. By the
                    Licinian law of 367 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> which abolished the military
                    tribunes with consular power and enacted that the supreme executive should
                    henceforward be in the hands of the two consuls, a new magistrate was at the
                    same time created who was to be a colleague of the consuls, though with lower
                    rank and lesser powers. This new magistrate was entrusted with the exclusive
                    jurisdiction in civil cases; in other respects his powers resembled those of the
                    consuls. His distinctive title was the <hi rend="superscript"> li</hi> city
                    praetor” <hi rend="italic">(praetor</hi><hi rend="italic">urbanus),</hi> and in
                    after time, when the number of praetors was increased, the city praetor always
                    ranked first. To this new magistrate the title of “praetor” was thenceforward
                    properly restricted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Some writers, following Livy, vi. 42, assert that at first the praetorship
                    was open to patricians only, but Mommsen <hi rend="italic">(Röm.
                    Staatsrecht,</hi> ii. p. 195) shows that this is probably a mistake. The
                    election of a plebeian to the office for the first time in 337 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. was certainly opposed by the consul who presided at
                    the election, but there appears to have been no legal obstacle to it.</p></note>
                    About 242 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the increase of a foreign population in
                    Rome necessitated the creation of a second praetor for the decision of suits
                    between foreigners <hi rend="italic">(peregrini)</hi> or between citizens and
                    foreigners. This praetor was known at a later time as the “foreign praetor” <hi
                    rend="italic">(praetor</hi><hi rend="italic">peregrinus).</hi> About 227 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> two more praetors were added to administer the
                    recently acquired provinces of Sicily and Sardinia. The conquest of Spain
                    occasioned the appointment of two more in 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> of
                    whom one governed Hither and the other Further Spain. The number of praetors,
                    thus augmented to six, remained stationary till Sulla’s time, 82 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But in the interval their duties vastly multiplied.
                    On the one hand, five new provinces were added to the Roman dominions—Macedonia
                    and Achaia in 146 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Africa in the same year, Asia
                    in 134, Gallia Narbonensis in 118, Cilicia probably in 102. On the other hand,
                    new and permanent jury courts <hi rend="italic">(quaes-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tiones</hi><hi rend="italic">perpetuae)</hi> were instituted at Rome, over
                    which the praetors were called on to preside. To meet this increase of business
                    the tenure of office of the praetors and also of the consuls was practically
                    prolonged from one to two years, with the distinction that in their second year
                    of office they bore the titles of “propraetor” and “proconsul” instead of
                    “praetor’’and “consul.” The prolongation of office, together with the
                    participation of the proconsuls in duties which properly fell to the praetors,
                    formed the basis of Sulla’s arrangements. He increased the number of the
                    praetors from six to eight, and ordained that henceforward all the eight should
                    in their first year administer justice at Rome and in their second should as
                    propraetors undertake the government of provinces. The courts over which the
                    praetors presided, in addition to those of the city praetor and the foreign
                    praetor, dealt with the following offences: —oppression of the provincials <hi
                    rend="italic">(repetundarum),</hi> bribery <hi rend="italic">(ambitus),</hi>
                    embezzlement <hi rend="italic">(peculatus),</hi> treason <hi rend="italic"
                    >(majestatis),</hi> murder <hi rend="italic">(de</hi><hi rend="italic">sicariis
                    et veneficis),</hi> and probably forgery <hi rend="italic">(falsi.).</hi> A
                    tenth province (Gallia Cisalpina) was added to the previous nine, and thus the
                    number of judicial and provincial departments corresponded to the annual number
                    of praetors, propraetors, and proconsuls. The proportion, however, was not long
                    maintained: new provinces were added to the empire—Bithynia in 74 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Cyrene about the same time, Crete in 67, Syria in
                    64—and one or more new law courts were instituted. To keep pace with the
                    increase of duties Julius Caesar increased the number of praetors successively
                    to ten, fourteen, and sixteen; after his time the number varied from eight to
                    eighteen.</p>
                <p>The praetors were elected, like the consuls, by the people assembled in the <hi
                    rend="italic">comitia centuriata</hi> and with the same formalities. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Consul.)</hi> They regularly held office for a year; only in
                    the transition period between the republic and the empire was their tenure of
                    office sometimes limited to a few months. The insignia of the praetor were those
                    common to the higher Roman magistrates,—the purple-edged robe <hi rend="italic"
                    >(toga</hi><hi rend="italic">praetexta)</hi> and the ivory chair <hi
                    rend="italic">(sella</hi><hi rend="italic">curulis)</hi>; in Rome he was
                    attended by two lictors, in the provinces by six. The praetors elect cast lots
                    to determine the department which each of them should administer. A praetor was
                    essentially a civil judge, and as such he was accustomed at or before his entry
                    on office to publish an edict setting forth the rules of law and procedure by
                    which he intended to be guided in his decisions. As these rules were often
                    accepted by his successors the praetor thus acquired an almost legislatorial
                    power, and his edicts thus continued, corrected, and amplified from year to year
                    became, under the title of the “perpetual edicts,” one of the most important
                    factors in moulding Roman law. Their tendency was to smooth away the occasional
                    harshness and anomalies of the civil law by substituting rules of equity for the
                    letter of the law, and in this respect the Roman praetor has been compared to
                    the English chancellor. His functions were considerably modified by the
                    introduction of the standing jury courts <hi rend="italic">(quaestiones
                    perpetuae).</hi> Hitherto the praetor had conducted the preliminary inquiry as
                    to whether an action would lie, and had appointed for the actual trial of the
                    case a deputy, whom he instructed in the law applicable to the case and whose
                    decisions he enforced. The proceedings before the praetor were technically known
                    as <hi rend="italic">jus</hi> in distinction from <hi rend="italic"
                    >judicium,</hi> which was the actual trial before the deputy judge. But in the
                    standing jury courts (of which the first—that for <hi rend="italic"
                    >repetundae</hi> —was instituted in 149 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.g.),</hi> or
                    rather in the most important of them, the praetors themselves presided and tried
                    the cases. These new courts, though formally civil, were substantially criminal
                    courts; and thus a criminal jurisdiction was added to the original civil
                    jurisdiction of the praetors. Under the empire various special functions were
                    assigned to certain praetors, such as the two treasury praetors <hi
                    rend="italic">(praetores</hi><hi rend="italic">serarii),</hi> appointed by
                    Augustus in 23 B.c.; the spear praetor <hi rend="italic">(praetor</hi><hi

                    with cases of inheritance; the two trust praetors <hi rend="italic"
                    >(praetores</hi><hi rend="italic">fideicomissαrii),</hi> appointed by Claudius
                    to look after cases of trust estates, but reduced by Titus to one; the ward

                    appointed by Marcus Antoninus to deal with the affairs of minors; and the

                    rend="italic">liberalibus causis),</hi> who tried cases turning on the
                    liberation of slaves. There is no evidence that the praetors continued to
                    preside over the standing courts after the beginning of the 3d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and the foreign praetorship disappears about this
                    time.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Marquardt
                    conjectures with much probability that when Caracalla extended the Roman
                    franchise to the whole empire he at the same time abolished the foreign
                    praetorship.</p></note> Even the jurisdiction of the city praetor seems not to
                    have survived the reforms of Diocletian, though the office itself continued to
                    exist. But of the praetorships with special jurisdiction (especially the ward
                    praetorship and the liberation praetorship) some lasted into the 4th century and
                    were copied in the constitution of Constantinople.</p>
                <p>Besides their judicial functions, the praetors, as colleagues of the consuls,
                    possessed, though in a less degree, all the consular powers, which they
                    regularly exercised in the absence of the consuls; but in the presence of a
                    consul they exercised them only at the special command either of the consul or,
                    more usually, of the senate. Thus the praetor possessed military power <hi
                    rend="italic">(imperium);</hi> even the city praetor, though attached by his
                    office to Rome, could not only levy troops but also in certain circumstances
                    take the command in person. As provincial governors the praetors had frequent
                    occasion to exercise their military powers, and they were often accorded a
                    triumph. The city praetor presided over popular assemblies for the election of
                    certain inferior magistrates, but all the praetors officiating in Rome had the
                    right to summon assemblies for the purpose of legislation. In the absence of the
                    consuls the city praetor, and in default of him the other praetors, were
                    empowered to call meetings of the senate. Public religious duties, such as the
                    fulfilment of state vows, the celebration of sacrifices and games, and the
                    fixing of the dates of movable feasts, probably only fell to the praetors in the
                    absence of the consuls. But since in the early times the consuls as a rule spent
                    only the first months of their year of office in Rome it is probable that a
                    considerable share of religious business devolved on the city praetor; this was
                    certainly the case with the Festival of the Cross-roads <hi rend="italic"
                    >(compitalia),</hi> and he directed the games in honour of Apollo from their
                    institution in 212 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Augustus in 22 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> placed the direction of all the popular festivals in
                    the hands of the praetors, and it is not without significance that the praetors
                    continued thus to minister to the pleasures of the Roman mob for centuries after
                    they had ceased almost entirely to transact the business of the state. For the
                    praetor as provincial governor, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Province. (j. g.
