                <p><label type="entry">PITTSBURGH</label>, the second largest city of Pennsylvania,
                    and the leading iron, steel, and glass manufacturing centre of the United
                    States, lies at the confluence of the Allegheny and the Monongahela, which unite
                    here to form the Ohio, 250 miles west by north of Philadelphia. The business
                    quarter of the city is built on a nearly level triangular plain, between the two
                    rivers, measuring about three quarters of a mile on each side back to the hills
                    which rise to the east.</p>
                <p>The manufacturing establishments stretch for a distance of 7 miles up the
                    Allegheny, 7 up the Monongahela, and 2 down the Ohio, and occupy the strip of
                    low ground usually a few hundred feet broad between the river banks and the
                    hills which generally face them. The slope of the hills to the east of the
                    business quarter is closely built with residences and retail storfes for the
                    distance of a mile and a half, but the summits, 400 or 500 feet high, are
                    partially unoccupied. Beyond the hills extends a rolling country which, for a
                    space of about 5 miles long by 2 wide is occupied by the villas of the citizens.
                    The hills facing the rivers are generally precipitous, and vary in height from
                    300 to 600 feet, but at different points they recede from the river banks and
                    afford sites for the suburbs of Lawrenceville (on the Allegheny), Hazlewood, and
                    Birmingham (on the north and south banks respectively of the Monongahela), which
                    are within the municipality of Pittsburgh, and (on the north bank of the
                    Allegheny and Ohio) for the city of Allegheny, which, with its separate
                    municipal government and population of 78,000 inhabitants, is commercially and
                    socially a part of Pittsburgh. The two cities together cover an irregular space
                    of 9 miles between the extreme eastern and western points, with a breadth
                    varying from 2 to 4 miles.</p>
                <p>From the character of its site Pittsburgh would naturally be very attractive, but
                    the free use of the bituminous coal which has been the principal agent in its
                    development has so spoiled its beauty as to give it the name of the Smoky City.
                    Not only do the manufacturing quarters show long lines of smoke-stained
                    buildings, but the business quarter, which is composed of rather narrow streets
                    laid out early in the century, is mainly constructed of brick and iron, and in
                    spite of the presence of some fine public buildings in granite and brown
                    stone—the municipal hall, the petroleum exchange, the new United States post
                    office and court-house (1884), the new county court-house (1884), &amp;c.—has a
                    generally grimy and unattractive appearance. A better opinion of the wealth and
                    taste of the city is obtained from a view of the suburban quarters of the East
                    End and the parks and residence quarters of Allegheny. And, all disfigurement
                    and dirtiness notwithstanding, it is full of interesting and striking sights.
                    The interiors of its rolling-mills and glass-houses, and the views of the city
                    from the surrounding hills, with the manufacturing quarters marked out by their
                    smoke by day and their fires by night, are of a unique and picturesque
                    character. Along the rivers are fleets of steamers towing barges laden with coal
                    for consumption at this point and for shipment to the cities lower down. Joining
                    the various quarters of the city are ten bridges for ordinary traffic and four
                    railway viaducts, among which the Point Bridge and the Smithfield Street Bridge
                    are fine examples of engineering in iron. Six inclined-plane railways afford
                    access to the summits of the high hills.</p>
                <p>Pittsburgh is of historical interest from the struggle (1755-1758) for its
                    possession between England and France in the Seven Years’ War, and the fact that
                    the public and military career of George Washington was commenced with those
                    campaigns (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Washington).</hi> With the termination of
                    that struggle in the capture of the ruins of Fort Duquesne by the British, the
                    history of the place becomes that of an ordinary frontier town. A new fort was
                    erected and named Fort Pitt in honour of the prime minister whose energy had
                    urged the war forward to its capture, and wrested the Ohio valley and Canada
                    from French control. After one or two Indian wars, in which the post was
                    threatened, and on one occasion nearly taken, Fort Pitt lost its military
                    character and became a trading town. The first streets were laid out near the
                    fort in 1764, and in 1769 the first survey of the unsettled lands in the
                    vicinity was made for the proprietors, the heirs of William Penn, under the name
                    of the manor of Pittsburgh. After the termination of the revolution, the
                    legislature of Pennsylvania incorporated Pittsburgh as a village on April 22,
                    1794, and on March 18, 1816, its charter as a city was granted. During the
                    colonial period a dispute arose between Virginia and Pennsylvania as to the
                    possession of the territory surrounding the town, and in the first few years of
                    its history under the United States it attracted attention from its proximity to
                    the famous “Whisky Insurrection” of Western Pennsylvania. After it had attained
                    a population of 30,000 it was visited on the 10th of April 1845 by a disastrous
                    conflagration in which the buildings in the business centre, covering a space of
                    56 acres, and valued at $5,000,000 dollars, were consumed.</p>
                <p>In the Pittsburgh of to-day there is little besides names of streets, hills, and
                    suburbs to recall the struggle which decided the Anglo-Saxon character of the
                    country. The locality known as the Point, where Fort Duquesne stood, is covered
                    with thickly built factories and dingy tenements. In a squalid and obscure court
                    a portion of the wall of a blockhouse erected in 1763 by Colonel Boquet, one of
                    the British commandants of Fort Pitt, still forms a part of a building, and on
                    the wall of the staircase of Municipal Hall is a stone bearing the inscription
                    with which that officer commemorated its erection. Immediately across the
                    Monongahela a range of precipitous hills some 500 feet high bears the names of
                    Mount Washington and Duquesne Heights. On the first hill rising to the east of
                    the level part of the city, a red granite courthouse, to cost $2,000,000, is in
                    process of construction near to the spot where Major Grant was defeated and
                    slain, and the new building will replace the brown stone structure which for
                    many years fronted on the street bearing that unfortunate officer’s name. Twelve
                    miles away, the suburb long known as Braddock’s Field and now as Braddock’s,
                    attracts attention chiefly by the roar and glare of its great steel
                    manufacturing establishment.</p>
                <p>Deriving its early importance in commerce from its position at the head of the
                    Ohio, which was until 1855 the principal route between the middle States and the
                    west and south-west, Pittsburgh has since obtained its greatest growth from the
                    coal which underlies nearly all Western Pennsylvania. This has made the city and
                    its immediate suburbs the most important manufacturing district in America, in
                    both pig and bar iron, steel, glass, and copper. In 1883 Allegheny county
                    produced 11⅜ per cent, of the pig iron produced in the United States, and 21 per
                    cent, of the rolled iron and steel. The iron industry consists of 16 blast
                    furnaces, producing, in 1883, 592,475 tons; 32 rolling mills, producing 472,351
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n160/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0160-0151"/> tons of finished iron; and 91 other
                    establishments, turning out a large variety of other manufactures of iron, from
                    boilers to safes and steam pumps. The steel industry comprises 20 large mills
                    with an output for 1883 of 405,530 tons. The blast furnaces and rolling-mills of
                    Pittsburgh employ a capital of $23,910,000 and 21,190 workmen, the steel
                    industry $10,170,000 and 7060 workmen. Next in importance is the glass
                    manufacture, in which 75 establishments are engaged, 24 making table ware, 24
                    window glass, 10 green glass bottles, and 9 lamp chimneys. The capital invested
                    in them is $5,985,000. They employ 6442 hands, and the value of their last
                    reported annual production is $6,832,683. The coal and coke industry of the
                    district, which is controlled mainly by Pittsburgh, comprises a capital of
                    $26,406,500, employs 23,621 miners and other labourers, and makes an annual
                    output of 7,720,000 tons of coal and 2,760,000 tons of coke, valued at
                    $16,600,000. The total of all the manufacturing industries of the city is 1380
                    establishments, with $105,401,481 of capital, employing 85,936 workmen of all
                    kinds, and producing to the value of $149,721,619. The wholesale trade of the
                    city is much less important than its manufacturing industries, and with a few
                    exceptions is confined to the immediate vicinity. It includes 90 firms with an
                    aggregate capital of $11,206,000 and total sales of $125,390,472. Within the
                    last year a new and unique industry has been developed. By drilling in the earth
                    to a depth of 1200 to 2000 feet, what is practically the fire-damp of the coal
                    mine is tapped in such quantity that it comes to the surface in great force. It
                    has been found to be useful as a fuel for all the purposes of coal except the
                    smelting of ores in blast furnaces; and, as it is cheaper both for making steam
                    and for the heating of the iron and glass furnaces, its adoption has been
                    general among the manufacturers.</p>
                <p>As the railway system has developed, the important boating interest of Pittsburgh
                    has become confined to the transportation of coal from the Monongahela river
                    mines to the down-river cities. The coal is only taken out when freshets have
                    raised the river, and at that time fleets of steamers, each towing from eight to
                    fifteen barges, covering acres in extent and carrying thousands of tons of coal,
                    start down stream. The total steam tonnage of Pittsburgh is 36,845 tons with 163
                    vessels, but the addition of the barges brings the tonnage up to 1,359,972 and
                    the number of vessels to 3208.</p>
                <p>Pittsburgh is stated to be the origin of more railway freight than any other
                    point in the country. There are a large number of lines, under the control of
                    three great companies. The most important is the Pennsylvania Railroad, whose
                    trunk lines pass through the city, and number amoung their feeders the West
                    Pennsylvania; the Allegheny Valley; the Pittsburgh, Virginia, and Charleston;
                    the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and St Louis; the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and
                    Chicago; and the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroads. The Pittsburgh division of
                    the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad gives a connexion with that trunk line, and by
                    the Pittsburgh and Western, and the Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and Toledo, reaches
                    the Chicago branch of the same system to the west. The Pittsburgh and Lake Erie
                    affords the New York Central and the New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio lines an
                    access to Pittsburgh, while its extension under the name of the Pittsburgh,
                    MacKeesport, and Youghiogheny penetrates the coal and coke district to the
                    southeast.</p>
                <p>In 1796, by the first accurate census on record, the population of Pittsburgh was
                    1395. By 1810 it had increased to 4968; by 1820 to 7248; by 1830 to 12,452; by
                    1840 to 21,115; by 1850 to 36,601; by 1860 to 49,221; by 1870 to 86,076. In 1874
                    the consolidation of outlying boroughs made the population, according to the
                    census of 1870, 121,799; and in 1880 this had increased to 156,389. These
                    figures do not comprise the population of Allegheny, which was 28,702 in 1860,
                    53,180 in 1870, and 78,682 in 1880. Including the manufacturing and residential
                    suburbs, the total population by the census of 1880 was 274,160; and, with the
                    large extension of manufacturing and building that has gone on since then, it
                    was estimated in 1884 at 325,000.</p>
                <p>The municipal governments of Pittsburgh and Allegheny are each composed of a
                    mayor, controller, and treasurer, with city councils in two branches styled
                    respectively select and common. These are elected by the people, and appoint
                    other administrative officials to take charge of the police and fire
                    departments, assessments, and public works. The total assessed valuation of the
                    city of Pittsburgh for purposes of taxation is $101,508,603, on which a revenue
                    is collected for all purposes of $2,777,405. Allegheny has an assessed valuation
                    of $40,707,858, and spends $650,000 annually. The total indebtedness of
                    Pittsburgh is $14,497,800, of which nearly $10,000,000 was expended for
                    water-works and street pavements. The debt of Allegheny is but $1,400,000.</p>
                <p>The school system of each city is governed by a central board of education and
                    ward boards, both elected by popular vote. The Pittsburgh system comprises a
                    fine stone high school overlooking the city, and 52 ward schools, in which are
                    469 teachers and 23,629 scholars, the approximate annual expenditure being
                    $550,000. In the Allegheny system there are the high school and 18 ward schools,
                    with 207 teachers, 9392 scholars, and an annual expenditure of about $200,000.
                    The principal institutions established by public taxation are the Riverside
                    State Penitentiary, completed in 1884 in the lower part of Allegheny; the
                    Morganza Reform School; the workhouse at Claremont, on the Allegheny river; and
                    the Pittsburgh, Allegheny, and County poorhouses.</p>
                <p>The churches and chapels in Pittsburgh and Allegheny number 237: 57 are Roman
                    Catholic, including 13 monastic and conventual establishments; 53 represent the
                    various branches of Presbyterianism; 39 are Methodist Episcopal, and 16
                    Protestant Episcopal. Among the leading examples of church architecture are St
                    Paul’s Cathedral (Roman Catholic), Trinity and St Peter’s (Protestant
                    Episcopal), the First and Third Presbyterian and the German Lutheran churches in
                    Pittsburgh, and the North Presbyterian in Allegheny. Private charity has
                    established the West Penn. Hospital with a large branch for the treatment of the
                    insane at Dixmont, the Homeopathic Hospital, the Mercy Hospital, the Pittsburgh
                    Infirmary, the Free Dispensary, the North Side Hospital, and St Francis
                    Hospital; and 18 asylums for orphans and the aged and infirm are maintained
                    throughout the two cities. The collegiate institutions comprise the Western
                    University, the Western Theological Seminary (Presbyterian), the United
                    Presbyterian Seminary, the Catholic College, the Pennsylvania Female College,
                    and the Pittsburgh Female College. (J. F. H. )</p>
