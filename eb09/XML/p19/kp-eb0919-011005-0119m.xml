                    of tobacco in pipes is a custom which prevailed in America for a period of

                    remains exist have been found in mounds or tumuli called pipe mounds,
                    principally in the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa. These mound
                    pipes, which are carved in porphyry and other hard stones, are very uniform in
                    type. The pipe, cut out of a single piece of stone, consists of a slightly
                    convex platform or base, generally from 3 to 4 inches in length, and about an
                    inch broad, with the bowl on the centre. A fine hole is pierced from one end of
                    the platform to the bottom of the bowl, the opposite end being obviously for
                    holding in the hand while the pipe is being smoked. In the commonest forms the
                    bowl is a simple cylinder or urn (fig. 1), but in many cases remarkable artistic
                    skill has been displayed in carving the bowls into miniature figures of birds,
                    mammals, reptiles, and human heads, often grotesque and fantastic, but always
                    vigorously expressed (fig. 2). These mound or platform pipes with carved human
                    and animal forms are objects of the highest ethnographic interest and
                    importance, being among the most characteristic remains of the ancient
                    inhabitants of the Mis sissippi valley. The wide area over which they, as well
                    as remains of baked clay pipes, are found throughout the American continent
                    testifies to the universal prevalence of smoking in the pre-Columbian era. Many
                    of the ancient clay pipes found in Mexico, &amp;c., are elaborately moulded and
                    ornamented, while others show considerable similarity to the early clay pipes of
                    Europe. Among the Nor th-American Indian tribes the tobacco pipe occupies a
                    position of peculiar symbolic significance in connexion with the superstitious
                    rites and usages of the race. The calumet, peace pipe, or medicine pipe is an
                    object of the most profound veneration, entrusted to the care of a highly
                    honoured official, ~and produced and smoked with much ceremony only on occasions
                    of great importance and solemnity. It is remarkable that, whilst the most
                    ancient American pipes had no separate stem, it is the stem only of the medicine
                    pipe which is the object of veneration among the Indians, the bowl used being a
                    matter of indifference. The favourite material for Indian pipe bowls is the
                    famous red pipe stone (catlinite), a finegrained easily-worked stone of a rich
                    red colour of the Coteau des Prairies, west of the Big Stone Lake in Dakota. The
                    quarries were formerly neutral ground among the warring Indian tribes, many
                    sacred traditions being associated with the locality and its product (see
                    Longfellow’s <hi rend="italic">Hiawatha,</hi> i.). The Babeen Indians of the
                    British-Columbian coast carve from a soft blue clay slate very elaborate and
                    massive pipes with intricate pierced work and fantastic animal forms, the pipe
                    tube being pierced from some protruding part of the sculpture.</p>
                <p>There is considerable dispute as to whether pipes for smoking were at all known
                    in Europe previous to the discovery of America. That tobacco-smoking was unknown
                    is certain; but pipes of iron, bronze, and clay have been so frequently found
                    associated with Roman remains and other antiquities as to lead many authorities
                    to maintain that such pipes must have been anciently used for burning incense or
                    for smoking aromatic herbs or hemp. Throughout Great Britain and Ireland small
                    clay pipes are frequently dug up, in some instances associated with Roman
                    relics. These are known amongst the people as elfin, fairy, or Celtic pipes, and
                    in some districts supernatural agencies have been called in to account for their
                    existence. The elfin pipes have commonly flat broad heels in place of the sharp
                    spur now found on clay pipes, and on that flat space the mark or initials of the
                    maker is occasionally found. There is no reason to believe that these pipes are
                    older than the 17th century. The introduction of the tobacco pipe into Europe is
                    generally ascribed to Ralph Lane, first governor of Virginia, who in 1586
                    brought an Indian pipe to Sir Walter Raleigh, and taught that courtier how to
                    use the implement. The pipe makers of London became an incorporated body in
                    1619, and from England the other nations of Europe learned the art of making
                    clay pipes. Baillard, in his <hi rend="italic">Discours du Tabac</hi> (1668)
                    says of the English—“Ces derniers ont inventé les pipes de terre cuite, qui ont
                    cours aujourd’huy par tout le monde.”</p>
                <p>The habit of smoking with pipes spread with incredible rapidity; and among the
                    various peoples the pipe assumed special characteristics, and its modifications
                    became the medium of conveying social, political, and personal allusions, in
                    many cases with no little artistic skill and humour. The pipe also became the
                    object of much inventive ingenuity, and it varied as greatly in material as in
                    form—wood, horn, bone, ivory, stone, precious and other metals, amber, glass,
                    porcelain, and above all clay being the materials employed in various forms. By
                    degrees pipes of special form and material came to be associated with particular
                    people, so that now we have the elongated painted porcelain bowls and pendulous
                    stem of the German peasantry, the red clay bowl and long cherry wood stem of the
                    Turk, and the very small metallic bowl and cane stem of the Japanese, &lt;fcc.
                    The most luxurious and elaborate form of pipe is the Persian <hi rend="italic"
                    >lcalyun,</hi> hookah, or water tobacco pipe. This consists of three pieces, the
                    head or bowl, the water bottle or base, and the snake or long flexible tube
                    ending in the mouthpiece. The tobacco, which must be previously prepared by
                    steeping in water, is placed in the head and lighted with live charcoal, a
                    wooden stem passes from its bottom down into the water which fills the base, and
                    the tube is fitted to a stem which ends in the bottle above the water. Thus the
                    smoke is cooled and washed before it reaches the smoker by passing through the
                    water in the bottle, and by being drawn through the coil of tube frequently some
                    yards in length. The bottles are in many cases made of carved and otherwise
                    ornamented cocoa-nut shells, whence the apparatus is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ndrgila,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">nàrgîl,</hi> a cocoa-nut. Silver, gold,
                    damascened steel, and precious stones are freely used in the making and
                    decoration of these pipes for wealthy smokers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pipe Manufacture.—</hi> The regular pipe-making industries
                    divide into many branches, of which the more important are the clay pipe,
                    meerschaum (real and artificial), and wooden bowl trades. Clay pipes are made in
                    prodigious numbers by hand labour with an iron mould and a steel wire for
                    forming the tube of the stem. Pipe moulding is a very simple operation in
                    pottery, and the work is performed with astonishing celerity. A number of
                    machines have been devised for automatic pipe-moulding; but the manual
                    operations are so rapid and inexpensive that there is little margin for saving
                    by the substitution of machinery. The pipes are very lightly fired so as to keep
                    them soft and porous; and so cheaply made are they that the commoner kinds can
                    be retailed at a profit for a farthing each. The principal centre of the clay
                    pipe industry is at Broseley in Staffordshire, where the trade has been
                    established since the early part of the 17th century. Meerschaum pipes (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Meerschaum,</hi> vol. xv. p. 825) are the expensive luxury of
                    the European smoker, and large sums of money are occasionally expended on the
                    artistic treatment of the meerschaum bowl or on the adornment of its adjuncts.
                    The common meerschaum is generally provided with a mouth-piece of amber, but
                    modern ingenuity has succeeded in providing a remarkably clever imitation of
                    both substances, so that a large proportion of the so-called meerschaum pipes
                    are factitious. The headquarters of the meerschaum pipe <pb break="no"

                    connexion with an official inquiry iuto the German tobacco trade in 1879 the
                    average production of pipes and pipe adjuncts in that district for several years
                    was ascertained. Of pipe bowls there were made yearly 540,000 genuine
                    meerschaums; 5,400,000 artificial meerschaums; 4,800,000 wooden heads; 9,600,000
                    common porcelain bowls (the favourite of the German peasant); and 2,700,000 fine
                    clay or lava bowls. Further the trade included 15,000,000 pipe stems or tubes of
                    various materials; 19,200,000 adjuncts, such as flexible tubes, chains, tops,
                    &amp;c.; 144,000 pipe cases; 9,600,000 mouth-pieces and cigar-holders of amber,
                    horn, meerschaum, wood, &amp;c.; and finally 15,000,000 complete pipes of
                    various materials. The whole annual value of the industry is estimated at
                    £1,000,000 sterling. The favourite wooden pipe generally known as a briar-wood
                    or briar-root pipe is really made from the roots of the tree heath, <hi
                    rend="italic">Erica</hi><hi rend="italic">arborea</hi> (French, <hi
                    rend="italic">bruyère),</hi> principally obtained on the hills of the Maremma
                    and taken thence to Leghorn. There the roots are shaped into blocks each
                    suitable for a pipe, the cutting of the wood so as to avoid waste requiring
                    considerable skill. These blocks are simmered in a vat for twelve hours, which
                    gives them the much appreciated yellowish-brown hue of a good “briar-root.” So
                    prepared the blocks are exported for boring and finishing to St Claude (Jura) in
                    France and to Nuremberg, the two rival centres of the wooden pipe trade. (J. PA.
