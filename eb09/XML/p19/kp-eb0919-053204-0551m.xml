                    between 17° 50' and 18° 30' N. lat. and 65° 35' and 67° 10' W. long. It forms an
                    irregular parallelogram, 108 miles long and 37 broad, and has an area of 3530
                    square miles, or rather less than that of Jamaica. From east to Avest it is
                    traversed by a range of hills so situated that the streams flowing northward are
                    much longer than those flowing south. The highest district, however, and the
                    highest peak—El Yunque (3600 feet)—are situated in the Sierra de Loquillo near
                    the north-east corner. As the hills intercept the north-east trade-winds Avith
                    their rain-clouds there is sometimes almost a superabundance of moisture in the
                    northern lowlands, while in the south severe droughts occur and the land demands
                    artificial irrigation, as yet carried out with too little co-operation and
                    system. The island is, hoAvever, exceptionally well Avatered, 1300 streams being
                    enumerated, of which forty-seven are considerable rivers; and its general
                    appearance is very beautiful. Forests still cover all the higher parts of the
                    hills, and differ from those of the other West Indian Islands mainly in the
                    comparative absence of epiphytes. Among the noteAvorthy trees Baron Eggers (see
                    <hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi> 6th December 1883) mentions the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coccoloba macrophylla,</hi> or “ortegon” of the natives, Avhich forms extensive
                    woods in some places, chiefly near the coast, and is conspicuous by its immense
                    yard-long purple spikes; a beautiful <hi rend="italic">Talauma,</hi> A∖^ith
                    Avhite odorous flowers, and yielding a timber called “sabino”; an unknown tree
                    with purple flowers like those of <hi rend="italic">Scaevola</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Plumieri</hi>; a large <hi rend="italic">Heliconia·,</hi> and
                    several tree-ferns <hi rend="italic">(Cyathea Serra</hi> and an <hi
                    rend="italic">Alsophila).</hi> Besides the tAvo staples—sugar and coffee—
                    tobacco, cotton, rice, maize, <hi rend="italic">Caladium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >esculentum,</hi> yams, and plantains, as well as oranges, cocoa-nuts, and other
                    tropical fruits, are commonly cultivated. The rice, which is the principal food
                    of the labourers, is a mountain variety grown Avithout flooding. On the lowland
                    pastures, covered mainly with <hi rend="italic">Hymenachne striatum,</hi> large
                    herds of excellent cattle are reared to supply butcher-meat for St Thomas, the
                    French islands, &amp;c. In general Porto Rico may be described as extremely
                    fertile, and its exports more than double in value those of Jamaica. In 1883 the
                    principal items were—sugar and molasses, 78,482 tons, valued at £1,036,595;
                    coffee, 16,801 tons, at £955,948; honey, 30,378 tons, at £148,148; and tobacco,
                    1730 tons, at £114,614. Of the tobacco a large proportion is sent to Havana to
                    be manufactured into cigars. The total value of exports and imports has
                    increased from £2,219,870 in 1850 to £5,118,712 in 1883. The great want of the
                    island is still roads and bridges, though the Government has done good work in
                    this department in recent years; the journey across the hills can only be
                    performed on horseback, and even along the coast-route wheeled traffic is at
                    times interrupted. Gold, iron, copper, coal, and salt are all found in Porto
                    Rico, but the last alone is worked.</p>
                <p>The island, which Avas declared a province of Spain in 1870, is divided into the
                    following seven departments :— <hi rend="italic">Bayamon,</hi> near the
                    north-east end of the island (containing the capital, San Juan Bautista, and
                    Toa-Alta, Toa-Baja, Naranjito, Vega-Alta, &amp;c.), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arecibo</hi> (Arecibo, Hatillo, Camuy, Quebradillas, &amp;c.), <hi
                    rend="italic">Aguadilla</hi> (Aguadilla, Moca, Aguada Lares or San Sebastian),
                    <hi rend="italic">Mayaguez</hi> (Mayaguez, Anaico, San German), <hi
                    rend="italic">Ponce</hi> (Ponce, Guayanilla, Penuelas, Coamo), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Humacao</hi> (Humacao, Naguabo, Luquillo), <hi rend="italic">Guayama</hi>
                    (Hato-Grande, Gurabo, &amp;c.). And the island of Viequez (with the town of
                    Isabel Segunda) is attached as an eighth department, and used as a military
                    penal station. The total population of Porto Rico was not more than 319,000 in
                    1830; by 1860 it reached 583,308; and by 1880 754,313. At this last date 429,473
                    (219,418 males and 210,055 females) were white and 324,840 (162,352 males and
                    162,488 females) coloured. There is still plenty of room for further expansion.
                    Among the people of European origin are Spaniards, Germans, Swedes, Danes,
                    Russians, Frenchmen, Chuetas or descendants of Moorish Jews from Majorca, and
                    natives of the Canary Islands. There are also a number of Chinese. The Gibaros
                    or small landholders and day-labourers of the country districts are a curious
                    old Spanish stock largely modified by Indian blood. Till 1856 it was believed
                    that no trace of the original inhabitants of the island remained; archeological
                    collections, however, have since been made and are now preserved in the
                    Smithsonian Institution, the Ethnological Museum in Berlin, and elsewhere. They
                    comprise stone axes, spear-heads, and knives, stone and clay images, and
                    fragments of earthenware. At Gurabo, on the banks of the Rio Grande de Loiza,
                    there is a curious rude stone monument, on the upper surface of which appear
                    several strange designs (see L. Krug, “Ind. Alterth. in Porto Rico,” in <hi
                    rend="italic">Z.</hi><hi rend="italic">für</hi><hi rend="italic">Ethn.,</hi>
                    Berlin, 1876).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Principal Towns.—</hi> San Juan Bautista or St John’s (24,000
                    inhabitants in town and district), the capital, lies in 18° 29' N. and 66° 7' W.
                    on the north coast, on a small island (Morro) connected with the mainland by
                    bridges. It is a place of some strength and contains a governor’s palace in the
                    old fort of Santa Catalina, a palace erected by Ponce de Leon, a cathedral, a
                    toAvn-house, a theatre, &amp;c. The harbour is one of the best in the West
                    Indies, having a comparatively unobstructed entrance, and along the wharves a
                    depth <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n552/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0552-0533"/> at low water of 10 to 13 feet, and at high water
                    11 ¾ to 14⅜. Ponce (38,000 inhabitants in town and district) lies about 3 miles
                    inland from the south coast. Its public buildings are frequently of brick or
                    stone, but the private houses are of wood. It contains a townhall (situated,
                    like the principal church, in the main square), a public hospital (1875), and an
                    English Episcopal church, and it is lighted with gas by an English company.
                    Mayaguez (27, OOO inhabitants in town and district), on the west coast, is also
                    situated several miles inland, and is separated from its port by a river. An
                    iron bridge, however, was constructed about 1875-76. The town has military
                    barracks, clubs, and gasworks. The harbour, accessible only to vessels drawing
                    less than 16 feet, is silting up, as indeed is the case with almost all the
                    harbours of Porto Rico. Other towns are Guayama on the south coast, with its
                    harbour at Arroya, and San Carlos de Aguadilla on the west coast. The seaports
                    are St John’s, Ponce, Mayaguez, Naguabo, Fajardo, Aguadilla, and Viequez.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Porto Rico, the Borinquen of the aborigines, was
                    discovered by Columbus in November 1493. In 1510 Ponce de Leon founded the town
                    of Caparra, soon after abandoned, and now known as Puerto Viejo, and in 1511,
                    with more success, the city of San Juan Bautista. The native
                    inhabitants—probably not very numerous, though, with their usual exaggeration,
                    old chroniclers rate them at 600,000—were soon subdued and swept away.<note

                    sacked by Drake, and in 1598 by the duke of Cumberland. In 1615 Baldwin
                    Heinrich, a Dutchman, lost his life in an attack on the Castello del Mono. The
                    attempt of the English in 1678 was equally unsuccessful, and Abercromby in 1797
                    had to retire after a three days’ siege. In 1820 a movement was made towards a
                    declaration of independence on the part of the Porto Ricans, but Spanish
                    supremacy was completely re-established by 1823. The last traces of slavery were
                    abolished in 1873 by the abrogation of the system of forced labour.</p>
