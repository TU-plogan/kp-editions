                <p><label type="entry">PROTEST ANTEN VEREIN</label> is the name of a society in
                    Germany the general object of which is to promote the union and the progress of
                    the various established Protestant churches of the country in harmony with the
                    advance of culture and on the basis of Christianity. It was founded at
                    Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1863 by a number of distinguished clergymen and laymen
                    of liberal tendencies, representing the freer parties of the Lutheran and
                    Reformed churches of the various German states, amongst whom were the statesmen
                    Bluntschli and Von Bennigsen and the professors Rothe, Ewald, Schenkel,
                    Hilgenfeld, and Hitzig. The more special objects of the association are the
                    following :—the development of the churches on the basis of a representative
                    parochial and synodal system of government in which the laity shall enjoy their
                    full rights; the promotion of a federation of all the churches in one national
                    church; resistance to all hierarchical tendencies both within and without the
                    Protestant churches; the promotion of Christian toleration and mutual respect
                    amongst the various confessions; the rousing and nurture of the Christian life
                    and of all Christian works necessary for the moral strength and prosperity of
                    the nation. These objects include opposition to the claims of Rome and to
                    autocratic interference with the church on the part of either political or
                    ecclesiastical authorities, efforts to induce the laity to claim and exercise
                    their privileges as members of the church, the assertion of the right of the
                    clergy, laity, and both lay and clerical professors to search for and proclaim
                    freely the truth in independence of the creeds and the letter of Scripture. When
                    the association was first formed the necessity for it was felt to be great. The
                    separation between the Calvinistic and the Lutheran churches on the one hand,
                    and between the churches of the various states on the other, even when the
                    former separation had been bridged over by the Prussian Union; the entire
                    absence of any satisfactory system of church government, the autocratic
                    authority of either the monarch or his ministers, or of the clergy, being
                    supreme; the increasing encroachments of the papal power upon the rights of the
                    individual and the state; the growing estrangement of the educated classes from
                    the church on the one hand, with the manifestation of either ignorance of the
                    fact or a determination to meet it with bitter denunciation on the part of the
                    orthodox clergy on the other, were regarded as urgent calls to action by the
                    liberals. Membership in the association is open to all Germans who are
                    Protestants and declare their willingness to cooperate in promoting its objects.
                    To facilitate its operations, the general association is broken up into a few
                    groups or societies confined to certain geographical areas. Every second year
                    (at first every year) general meetings of the entire association are held at
                    some convenient place. At first the governing committee had its permanent seat
                    at Heidelberg, but in 1874 Berlin, as. the new capital of the empire, was
                    chosen. The means used to promote the objects aimed at are mainly (1) the
                    formation of local branch associations throughout the country, the duty of which
                    is by lectures, meetings, and the distribution of suitable literature to make
                    known and advocate its principles, and (2) the holding of great annual or
                    biennial meetings of the whole association, at which its objects and principles
                    are expounded and applied to the circumstances of the church at the moment. The
                    “theses” accepted by the general meetings of the association as the result of
                    the discussions on the papers read indicate the theological position of its
                    members. The following may serve as illustrations :—</p>
                <p>The creeds of the Protestant church shut the doors on the past only, hut open
                    them for advance in the future; it is immoral and contrary to true Protestantism
                    to require subscription to them. The limits of the freedom of teaching are not
                    prescribed by the letter of Scripture, but a fundamental requirement of
                    Protestantism is free inquiry in and about the Scriptures. The attempt to limit
                    the freedom of theological inquiry and teaching in the universities is a
                    violation of the vital principle of Protestantism. Only such conceptions of the
                    person of Jesus can satisfy the religious necessities of this age as fully
                    recognize the idea of his humanity and place in history. The higher reason only
                    has unconditional authority, and the Bible must justify itself before its
                    tribunal; we find the history of divine revelation and its fulfilment in the
                    Bible alone, and reason bids us regard the Bible as the only authority and canon
                    in matters-of religious belief.</p>
                <p>The formation of the association at once provoked fierce and determined
                    opposition on the part of the orthodox sections of the church, particularly in
                    Berlin. Attempts <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0919-0849-0826"/> more or less successful have been made from
                    the first to exclude clergymen and professors identified with it from the
                    pulpits and chairs of Berlin and elsewhere, though membership in it involves no
                    legal disqualification for either. One of the objects of the association was to
                    some extent obtained by the reorganization of the Prussian Church when Dr Falk
                    was cultus minister, on the basis of parochial and synodal representation, which
                    came into full operation in 1879. But the election for the general synod turned
                    out very unfavourable to the liberal party, and the large orthodox majority
                    endeavoured to use their power against the principles and the members of the
                    association. The members of the association elected to the general synod were
                    nine only, while the party of the decidedly orthodox numbered upwards of
                    seventy. In 1882 the position of the association was rendered still more
                    difficult by the agitation in Berlin of Dr Kalthoff and other members of it in
                    favour of a “people’s church” on purely dissenting and extremely advanced
                    theological principles. The turn of the political tide in the direction of
                    conservatism in Berlin indicated by the retirement of the cultus minister Dr
                    Falk increased the difficulties and the work of the association, far as Dr Falk
                    was from sanctioning its theological principles. Moreover, it had sustained
                    severe losses in its membership by death and other causes.</p>
                <p>At the end of the twelfth year of its existence (1877) the association had 7500
                    members, its annual income was nearly £350, and it had distributed in the same
                    year 10,000 copies of its publications. In 1880 the number of members had risen
                    to 26,000, and of local associations to 80.</p>
