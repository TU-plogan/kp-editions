                    Shortly after the news of the discovery of the New World had reached Spain he
                    was in Seville, and thence found his way across the Atlantic; there he is first
                    heard of in 1510 as having taken part in an expedition from Hispaniola to Urabâ
                    under Alonzo de Ojeda, by whom, in his absence, he was entrusted with the charge
                    of the unfortunate settlement at San Sebastian. Afterwards he accompanied Balboa
                    to Darien; and under Balboa’s successor, Pedrarias, he received a
                    “repartimento,” and became a cattle farmer at Panama, where in 1522 he entered
                    into a partnership with a priest named Hernando de Luque and a soldier named
                    Diego de Almagro for purposes of exploration and conquest towards the south. An
                    expedition along the coast of New Granada (November 1524) was unfortunate, but
                    supplied various confirmations bf rumours previously heard as to the existence
                    of a great and opulent empire farther to the south. On March 10, 1526, Pizarro,
                    Almagro, and Luque renewed their compact, but in a much more solemn and explicit
                    manner, to conquer and divide equally among themselves this empire still
                    undiscovered, and Pizarro and Almagro, with a force of about one hundred and
                    sixty men, again sailed from Panama. The force was too small to effect much at
                    the time, and was at length recalled by the governor, but Pizarro was not to be
                    shaken, and, though he was left for months with but thirteen followers on a
                    small island without ship or stores, persisted in his enterprise till at length
                    he had coasted as far as to about 9° S. lat., and obtained distinct accounts of
                    the Peruvian empire. The governor still showing little disposition to encourage
                    the adventurers, Pizarro resolved to apply to the sovereign in person for help,
                    and with this object sailed from Panama for Spain in the spring of 1528,
                    reaching Seville in early summer. After long and tedious delays, the queen, in
                    Charles’s absence, executed at Toledo on 26th July 1529 the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">capitulation</hi> by which Pizarro was upon certain conditions
                    made governor and captain-general of the province of “New Castile” for the
                    distance of 200 leagues along the newly discovered coast, and invested with all
                    the authority and prerogatives of a viceroy. One of the conditions of the grant
                    was that within six months he should raise a sufficiently equipped force of two
                    hundred and fifty men, of whom one hundred might be drawn from the colonies; but
                    this he had some difficulty in fulfilling. Sailing from San Lucar clandestinely
                    (for his due complement was not yet made up) in January 1530, Pizarro was
                    afterwards joined by his brother Hernando with the remaining vessels, and when
                    the expedition left Panama in January of the following year it numbered three
                    ships, one hundred and eighty men, and twenty-seven horses. A footing was
                    established on the mainland at Tumbez, whence Pizarro set out for the interior
                    in May 1532. San Miguel de Piura was founded a few weeks afterwards, and
                    Caxamarca entered on November 15th. The subsequent movements of Pizarro belong
                    to the history of <hi rend="smallcaps">Peru</hi> (see vol. xviii. p. 677; and,
                    for authorities, comp. p. 679).</p>
