                <p>1. The city praefect <hi rend="italic">(praefectus urbi)</hi> acted at Rome as
                    the deputy of the chief magistrate or magistrates during his or their absence
                    from the city. Thus he represented in the earliest times the king and in later
                    times the consul or consuls when he or they were absent on a campaign or on
                    other public duties, such as the celebration of the annual Latin festival on the
                    Alban Mount. The absence of the chief magistrate for more than a single day
                    rendered the appointment of a praefect obligatory; but the obligation only arose
                    when <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the higher magistrates were absent. Hence so
                    long as the consuls were the only higher magistrates their frequent absence
                    often rendered the appointment of a praefect necessary, but after the
                    institution of the praetorship (367 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) the
                    necessity only arose exceptionally, as it rarely happened that both the consuls
                    and the praetor were absent simultaneously. But a praefect continued to be
                    regularly appointed, even under the empire, during the enforced absence of all
                    the higher magistrates at the Latin festival. The right and duty of appointing a
                    praefect belonged to the magistrate (king, dictator, or consul) whose deputy he
                    was, but it seems to have been withdrawn from the consuls by the Licinian law
                    (367 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> except that they still nominated praefects
                    for the time of the festival. No formalities in the appointment and no legal
                    qualifications on the part of the praefect were required. The praefect had all
                    the powers of the magistrate whose deputy he was, except that he could not
                    nominate a deputy to himself. His office expired on the return of his superior.
                    There could only be one city praefect at a time, though the dictator Caesar
                    broke the rule by appointing six or eight praefects simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Under the empire there was introduced a city prefecture which differed
                    essentially from the above. Augustus occasionally appointed a city praefect to
                    represent him in his absence from Italy, although the praetors or even one of
                    the consuls remained in the capital. In the absence of Tiberius from Rome during
                    the last eleven years of his reign (26-37 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> the
                    city prefecture, hitherto an exceptional and temporary office, became a regular
                    and permanent magistracy; in all subsequent reigns the praefect held office even
                    during the presence of the emperor in Rome. He was always chosen by the emperor
                    and usually from men who had held the consulship; his office was regarded, like
                    the censorship under the republic, as the crowning honour of a long political
                    career. It was not conferred for any definite length of time, but might be held
                    for years or for life. As under the republic, the praefect was not allowed to
                    quit the city for more than a day at a time. His duty was the preservation of
                    peace in the capital; he was, in fact, the chief of the police, being charged
                    with the superintendence<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n676/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0676-0653"/> of the streets, markets, and public buildings. He
                    was further entrusted by Augustus with a summary criminal jurisdiction over
                    slaves and rioters, which was, however, gradually extended till in the time of
                    Severus or even earlier it embraced all offences by whomsoever committed.
                    Further, he had the power of dealing with civil cases where his interference
                    seemed requisite in the interests of the public safety, but such occasions were
                    naturally few. By the beginning of the 3d century, and perhaps earlier, appeals
                    to the emperor in civil cases were handed over by him to be dealt with by the
                    praefect. Except where special restrictions interfered, an appeal lay from the
                    praefect to the emperor. Though not a military officer, the praefect commanded
                    the city cohorts <hi rend="italic">(cohortes urbanae),</hi> which formed part of
                    the garrison of Rome and ranked above the line regiments, though below the
                    guards (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Praetorians).</hi> The military power thus
                    placed in the hands of the chief of the police was one of the most sorely-felt
                    innovations of the empire. The constitutional changes of Diocletian and
                    Constantine extended still farther the power of the praefect, in whom, after the
                    disbanding of the guards and the removal from Rome of the highest officials, the
                    whole military, administrative, and judicial powers were centred.</p>
                <p>2. Under the republic judicial praefects <hi rend="italic">(praefecti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">juri</hi><hi rend="italic">dicundd)</hi> were sent annually from
                    Rome as deputies of the praetors to administer justice in certain towns of the
                    Italian allies. These towns were called “prefectures” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(praefecturae).</hi> After the Social War (90-89 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> when all Italy had received the Roman franchise, such prefectures
                    ceased to exist in fact, though the name was sometimes retained.</p>
                <p>3. Under the empire the praetorians or imperial guards were commanded by one,
                    two, or even three praefects <hi rend="italic">(praefecti</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >praetorio),</hi> who were chosen by the emperor from among the knights and held
                    office at his pleasure. From the time of Alexander Severus the post was open to
                    senators also, and if a knight was appointed he was at the same time raised to
                    the senate. The position was one of great influence and importance; the
                    praetorian praefect stood under the immediate orders of the emperor, of whom he
                    was the natural representative and sometimes the rival. Down to the time of
                    Constantine, who deprived the office of its military character, the prefecture
                    of the guards was regularly held by tried soldiers, often by men who had fought
                    their way up from the ranks. In course of time the command seems to have been
                    enlarged so as to include all the troops in Italy except the corps commanded by
                    the city praefect <hi rend="italic">(cohortes urbanae).</hi> Further, the
                    praetorian praefect acquired, in addition to his military functions, a criminal
                    jurisdiction, which he exercised not as the delegate but as the representative
                    of the emperor, and hence it was decreed by Constantine (331) that from the
                    sentence of the praetorian praefect there should be no appeal. A similar
                    jurisdiction in civil cases was acquired by him not later than the time of
                    Severus. Hence a knowledge of law became a qualification for the post, which
                    under Marcus Antoninus and Commodus, but especially from the time of Severus,
                    was held by the first jurists of the age <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Papinian,
                    Ulpian, and Paullus), while the military qualification fell more and more into
                    the background. Under Constantine the institution of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >magistri militum</hi> deprived the praetorian prefecture altogether of its
                    military character, but left it the highest civil office of the empire.</p>
                <p>The title of “praefect” was borne by various other Roman officials, of whom we
                    may mention the following.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Praefectus Socium (sociorum).</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    Under the republic the contingents furnished to the Roman armies by the Italian
                    allies were commanded by Roman officers called <hi rend="italic">praefecti
                    socium (sociorum),</hi> who were nominated by the consuls and corresponded to
                    the tribunes in the legions.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Praefectus Classium.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Down to
                    near the close of the republic a naval command was never held independently but
                    only in connexion with the command of an army, and, when the general appointed
                    an officer to command the fleet in his room, this lieutenant was styled
                    “praefect of the fleet” <hi rend="italic">(praefectus classium).</hi> When in
                    311 B. c. the people took the appointment of these lieutenants into their own
                    hands the title was changed from “praefects” to <hi rend="italic">duo
                    viri</hi><hi rend="italic">navales,</hi> or “two naval men”; but under the
                    empire the admirals went by their old name of praefects.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Praef</hi><hi rend="italic">'ectus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Fabrum.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The colonel of the engineer and artillery
                    corps <hi rend="italic">(fabri)</hi> in a Roman army was called a praefect; he
                    did not belong to the legion, but was directly subordinate to the general in
                    command.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Praefectus</hi><hi rend="italic">Annonae.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> The important duty of provisioning Rome was committed by
                    Augustus (between 8 and 14 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.i&gt;.)</hi> to a praefect,
                    who was appointed by the emperor from among the knights and held office at the
                    imperial pleasure.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Praefectus</hi><hi rend="italic">Aegypti</hi> (afterwards

                    viceroy with the title of “praefect,” who was selected from the knights, and was
                    surrounded by royal pomp instead of the usual insignia of a Roman magistrate. He
                    stood under the immediate orders of the emperor. The exceptional position thus
                    accorded to Egypt was due to a regard on the part of the emperors to the
                    peculiar character of the population, the strategic strength of the country, and
                    its political importance as the granary of Rome. (J. G. FR.)</p>
