                <p>§ 50. We have seen that, if all points in a figure be projected from a fixed
                    centre to a plane, each point on the projection will be the projection of all
                    points on the projecting ray. A complete representation by a single projection
                    is therefore possible only when there is but one point to be projected on each
                    ray. This is the case by projecting from one plane to another, but it is also
                    the case if we project the <hi rend="italic">visible</hi> parts of objects in
                    nature; for every ray of light meeting the eye starts from that point in which
                    the ray, if we follow its course from the eye, backward meets for the first time
                    any object. Thus, if we project from a fixed centre the <hi rend="italic"
                    >visible</hi> part of objects to a plane or other surface, then the outlines of
                    the projection would give the same impression to the eye as the outlines of the
                    things projected, provided that one eye only be used and that this be at the
                    centre of projection. If at the same time the light emanating from the different
                    points in the picture could be made to be of the same kind—that is, of the same
                    colour and intensity and of the same kind of polarization—as that coming from
                    the objects themselves, then the projection would give sensibly the same
                    impression as the objects themselves. The art of obtaining this result
                    constitutes a chief part of the technique of a painter, who includes the rules
                    which guide him under the name of perspective, distinguishing between <hi
                    rend="italic">linear</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aerial</hi> perspective,—the
                    former relating to the projection, to the <hi rend="italic">drawing</hi> of the
                    outlines, the latter to the colouring and the shading off of the colours in
                    order to give the appearance of distance. We have to deal only with the former,
                    which is in fact a branch of geometry consisting in the applications of the
                    rules of projection.</p>
                <p>§ 51. Our problem is the following:— <hi rend="italic">There is given a figure in
                    space, the plane of a picture, and a point as centre of projection; it is
                    required to project the figure from the point to the plane.</hi></p>
                <p>From what has been stated about projection in general it follows at once that the
                    projection of a point is a point, that of a line a line. Further, the projection
                    of a point at infinity in a line is in general a finite point. Hence parallel
                    lines are projected into a pencil of lines meeting at some finite point. This
                    point is called the <hi rend="italic">vanishing point of the direction</hi> to
                    which it belongs. To find it, we project the point at infinity in one of the
                    parallel lines; that is, we draw through the eye a line in the given direction.
                    This cuts the picture plane in the point required.</p>
                <p>Similarly all points at infinity in a plane are projected to a line (§6) which is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">vanishing line of the plane</hi> and which is <hi
                    rend="italic">common to all parallel planes.</hi><hi rend="italic">All lines
                    parallel to a plane have their vanishing points in a line,</hi> viz., in the
                    vanishing line of the plane.</p>
                <p>All lines parallel to the picture plane have their vanishing points at infinity
                    in the picture plane; hence <hi rend="italic">parallel lines which are parallel
                    to the picture plane appear in the projection as parallel lines in their true
                    direction.</hi><hi rend="italic">The projection of a line is determined by the
                    projection of two points in it,</hi> these being very often its vanishing point
                    and its trace on the picture plane. <hi rend="italic">The projection of a point
                    is determined by the projection of two lines through it.</hi></p>

                <p>These are the general rules which we now apply. We suppose the picture plane to
                    be vertical.</p>
                <p>§ 52. Let (fig. 21) S be the centre of projection, where the eye is situated, and
                    which in perspective is called the <hi rend="italic">point of sight,</hi> ABKL
                    the picture plane, ABMN a horizontal plane on which we suppose the objects to
                    rest of which a perspective drawing is to be made. The lowest plane which
                    contains points that are to appear in the picture is generally selected for this
                    purpose, and is therefore called the ground plane, or sometimes the geometrical
                    plane. It cuts the picture plane in a horizontal line AB called the ground line
                    or base line or fundamental line of the picture. A horizontal line SV, drawn
                    through the eye S perpendicular to the picture, cuts the latter at a point V
                    called the centre of the picture or the centre of vision. The distance SV of the
                    eye from the picture is often called the distance simply, and the height ST of
                    the eye above the ground the height of the eye.</p>
                <p>The vanishing line of the ground plane, and hence of every horizontal plane, is
                    got by drawing the projecting rays from S to the points at infinity in the
                    plane—in other words, by drawing all horizontal rays through S. These lie in a
                    horizontal plane which cuts the picture plane in a horizontal line DD <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> through the centre of vision V. This line is called
                    the horizon in the picture. It contains the vanishing points of all horizontal
                    lines, the centre of vision V being the vanishing point of all lines parallel to
                    SV, that is perpendicular to the picture plane. To find the vanishing point of
                    any other line we draw through S the ray projecting the point at infinity in the
                    line; that is, we draw through S a ray parallel to the line, and deteπnine the
                    point where this ray cuts the picture plane. If the line is given by its plan on
                    the ground plane and its elevation on the picture plane, then its vanishing
                    point can at once be determined; it is the vertical trace of a line parallel to
                    it through the eye (comp. § 35).</p>
                <p>§ 53. To have construction in a single plane, we suppose the picture plane turned
                    down into the ground plane; but before this is done the ground plane is pulled
                    forward till, say, the line MN takes the place of AB, and then the picture plane
                    is turned down. By this we keep the plan of the figure and the picture itself
                    separate. In this new position the plane of the picture will be that of the
                    paper (fig. 22). On it are marked the base line AB, the centre of vision V, and
                    the horizon DD', and also the limits ABKL of the actual picture. These, however,
                    need not necessarily be marked. In the plan the picture plane must be supposed
                    to pass through A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,
                    and to be perpendicular to the ground plane. If we further suppose that the
                    horizontal plane through the eye which cuts the picture plane in the horizon DD'
                    be turned down about the horizon, then the centre of sight will come to the
                    point S, where VS equals the distance of the eye.</p>
                <p>To find the vanishing point of any line in a horizontal plane, we have to draw
                    through S a line in the given direction and see where it cuts the horizon. For
                    instance to find the vanishing points of the two horizontal directions which
                    make angles of 45° with the horizon, we draw through S lines SD and SD' making
                    each an angle of 45° with the line DD'. These points can also be found by making
                    VD and VD' each equal to the distance SV. The two points D, D' are therefore
                    called the distance points.</p>
                <p>§ 54. Let it now be required to find the perspective P of a point Pi (figs. 21
                    and 22) in the ground plane. We draw through P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> two
                    lines of which the projection can easily be found. The most convenient lines are
                    the perpendicular to the base line, and a line making an angle of 45° with the
                    picture plane. These lines in the ground plan are P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    Q <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and PjR <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. The first
                    cuts the picture at Q <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> or at Q, and has the
                    vanishing point V; hence QV is its perspective. The other cuts the picture in R
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, or rather in R, and has the vanishing point D; its
                    perspective is RD. These two lines meet at P, which is the point required. It
                    will be noticed that the line QR=Q <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> R <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> =Q <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> gives the distance of the point P behind the picture plane. Hence if we
                    know the point Q where a perpendicular from a point to the picture plane cuts
                    the latter, and also the distance of the point behind the picture plane, we can
                    find its perspective. We join Q to V, set off QR to the right equal to the
                    distance of the point behind the picture plane, and join R to the distance point
                    to the left; where RD cuts QV is the point P required. Or we set off QR' to the
                    left equal to the distance and join R' to the distance point D' to the
                    right.</p>
                <p>If the distance of the point from the picture should be very great, the point R
                    might fall at too great a distance from Q to be on the drawing. In this case we
                    might set off QW equal to the πth part of the distance and join it to a point E,
                    so that VE equals the nth part of VD. Thus if QW = ⅜QR and VE = ⅛VD, then WE
                    will again pass through P∙ It is thus possible to find for every point in the
                    ground plane, or in fact in any horizontal plane, the perspective; for the
                    construction will not be altered if the ground plane be replaced by any other
                    horizontal plane. We can in fact now <hi rend="italic">find the perspective of
                    every point as soon as we know the foot of the perpendicular drawn from it to
                    the picture plane, that is, if we know its elevation on the picture plane, and
                    its distance behind it.</hi> For this reason it is often convenient to draw in
                    slight outlines the elevation of the figure on the picture plane.</p>
                <p>Instead of drawing the elevation of the figure we may also proceed as follows.
                    Suppose (fig. 23) A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to be the projection of the</p>
                <p>A ’ lg. X&lt;W.</p>
                <p>plan of a point A. Then the point A lies vertically above A <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> because <hi rend="italic">vertical lines appear in the perspective as
                    vertical lines</hi> (§ 51). If then the line VA <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    cuts the picture plane at Q, and we erect at Q a perpendicular in the picture
                    plane to its base and set off on it QA <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> equal to the
                    real height of the point A above the ground plane, then the point A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is the elevation of A and hence the line A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> V will pass through the point A. The latter thus is
                    determined by the intersection of the vertical line through A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and the line A <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> V.</p>
                <p>•This process differs from the one mentioned before in this that the construction
                    for finding the point is not made in the horizontal plane in which it lies, but
                    that its plan is constructed in the ground plane. But this has a great
                    advantage. The perspective of a horizontal plane from the picture to the line at
                    infinity occupies in the picture the space between the line where the plane cuts
                    the picture and the horizon, and this space is the greater the farther the plane
                    is from the eye, that is, the farther its trace on the picture plane lies from
                    the horizon. The horizontal plane through the eye is projected into a line, the
                    horizon; hence no construction can be performed in it. The ground plane on the
                    other hand is the lowest horizontal plane used. Hence it offers most space for
                    constructions, which consequently will allow of greater accuracy.</p>
                <p>§ 55. The process is the same if we know the coordinates of the point, viz., we
                    take in the base line a point 0 as origin, and we take the base line, the line
                    OV, and the perpendicular OZ as axes of coordinates. If we then know the
                    coordinates <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> measured in these directions, we make
                    OQ=ae, set off on QV a distance QA such that its real length QR=y, make QA <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> =z, and find A as before. This process might be
                    simplified by setting off to begin with along OQ and OZ scales in their true
                    dimensions and along OV a scale obtained by projecting the scale on OQ from D to
                    the line OV.</p>
                <p>§ 56. The methods explained give the perspective of any point in space. If lines
                    have to be found, we may determine the perspective of two points in them and
                    join these, and this is in many cases the most convenient process. Often,
                    however, it will be advantageous to determine the projection of a line directly
                    by finding its vanishing point. This is especially to be recommended when a
                    number of parallel lines have to be drawn.</p>
                <p>The perspective of any curveis in general a curve. The projection of a conic is a
                    conic, or in special cases a line. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n829/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0829-0806"/> perspective of a circle may be any conic, not
                    necessarily an ellipse. Similarly the perspective of the shadow of a circle on a
                    plane is some conic.</p>
                <p>§ 57. A few words must be said about the determination of shadows in perspective.
                    The theory of their construction is very simple. We have given, say, a figure
                    and a point I∣ as source of light. We join the point L to any point of which we
                    want to find the shadow and produce this line till it cuts the surface on which
                    the shadow falls. These constructions must in many cases first be performed in
                    plan and elevation, and then the point in the shadow has to be found in
                    perspective. The constructions are different according as we take as the source
                    of light a finite point (say, the flame of a lamp), or the sun, which we may
                    suppose to he at an infinite distance.</p>
                <p>If, for instance, in fig. 23, A is a source of light, EHGF a vertical wall, and C
                    a point whose shadow has to be determined, then the shadow must he on the line
                    joining A to C. To see where this ray meets the floor we draw through the source
                    of light and the point C a vertical plane. This will cut the floor in a line
                    which contains the feet A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, C <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> of the perpendiculars drawn from the points A, C to the floor, or the
                    plans of these points. At O', where the line A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> cuts AC, will be the shadow of C on the floor. If
                    the wall EHGF prevents the shadow from falling on the floor, we determine the
                    intersection K of the line A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 1</hi> with the base EF of the wall and draw a vertical through it, this gives
                    the intersection of the wall with the vertical plane through A and C. Where it
                    cuts AC is the shadow C" of C on the wall.</p>
                <p>If the shadow of a screen CDD <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 1</hi> has to be found we find the shadow D' of D which falls on the floor;
                    then D <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> D' is the shadow of D <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> D and D'C' is the shadow on the floor of the line DC. The shadow of D <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> D, however, is intercepted by the wall at L. Here then
                    the wall takes up the shadow, which must extend to D" as the shadow of a line on
                    a plane is a line. Thus the shadow of the screen is found in the shaded part in
                    the figure.</p>
                <p>§ 58. If the shadows are due to the sun, we have to find first the perspective of
                    the sun, that is, the vanishing point of its rays. This will always be a point
                    in the picture plane; but we have to distinguish between the cases where the sun
                    is in the front of the picture, and so behind the spectator, or behind the
                    picture plane, and so in front of the spectator. In the second case only does
                    the vanishing point of the rays of the sun actually represent the sun itself. It
                    will be a point above the horizon. In the other case the vanishing point of the
                    rays will lie below the horizon. It is the point where a ray of the sun through
                    the centre of sight S cuts the picture plane, or it will be the shadow of the
                    eye on the picture. In either case the ray of the sun through any point is the
                    line joining the perspective of that point to the vanishing point of the sun’s
                    rays. But in the one case the shadow falls away from the vanishing point, in the
                    other it falls towards it. The direction of the sun’s rays may be given by the
                    plan and elevation of one ray.</p>
                <p>For the construction of the shadow of points it is convenient first to draw a
                    perpendicular from the point to the ground and to find its shadow on the ground.
                    But the shadows of verticals from a point at infinity will be parallel; hence
                    they have in perspective a vanishing point L <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> in the
                    horizon. To find this point, we draw that vertical plane through the eye which
                    contains a ray of the sun. This cuts the horizon in the required point L <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and the picture plane in a vertical line which contains
                    the vanishing point of the sun’s rays themselves. Let then (fig. 24) L be the
                    vanishing point of the sun’s rays, L <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be that of
                    their projection in a horizontal plane, and let it be required to find the
                    shadow of the vertical column ÀH. We draw AL <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and
                    EL; they meet at E', which is the shadow of E. Similarly we find the shadows of
                    F, G, H. Then E'FO'H' will be the shadow of the quadrilateral EFGH. For the
                    shadow of the column itself we join E' to A, &amp;c., but only mark the
                    outlines; F'B, the shadow of BF, does not appear as such in the figure.</p>
                <p>If the shadow of E has to be found when falling on any other snrface we use the
                    vertical plane through E, determine its intersection with the surface, and find
                    the point where this intersection is cut by the line EL. This will be the
                    required shadow of E.</p>
                <p>§ 59. If the picture is not to be drawn on a vertical but on another plane—say,
                    the ceiling of a room—the rules given have to bo slightly modified. The general
                    principles will remain true. But if the picture is to be on a curved surface the
                    constructions become somewhat more complicated. In the most general case
                    conceivable it would be necessary to have a representation in plan and elevation
                    of the figure required and of the surface on which the projection has to be
                    made. A number of points might also be found by calculation, using coordinate
                    geometry. But into this we do not enter. As an example we take the case of a
                    panorama, where the surface is a vertical cylinder of revolution, the eye being
                    in the axis. The ray projecting a point A cuts the cylinder in two points on
                    opposite sides of the eye, hence geometrically speaking every point has two
                    projections; of these only the one lying on the half ray from the eye to the
                    point can be used in the picture. But the other has sometimes to be used in
                    constructions, as the projection of a line has to pass through both. Parallel
                    lines have two vanishing points which are found, by drawing a line of the given
                    direction through the eye; it cuts the cylinder in the vanishing points
                    required. This operation may be performed by drawing on the ground the plan of
                    the ray through the foot of the axis, and through the point where it cuts the
                    cylinder a vertical, on which the point required must lie. Its height above is
                    easily found by making a drawing of a vertical section on a reduced scale.</p>
                <p>Parallel planes have in the same manner a vanishing curve. This will be for
                    horizontal planes a horizontal circle of the height of the eye above the ground.
                    For vertical planes it will be a pair of generators of the cylinder. For other
                    planes the vanishing curves will be ellipses having their centre at the eye.</p>
                <p>The projections of vertical lines will be vertical lines on the cylinder. Of all
                    other lines they will be ellipses with the centre at the eye. If the cylinder be
                    developed into a plane, then these ellipses will be changed into curves of
                    sines. Parallel lines are thus represented by curves of sines which have two
                    points in common. There is no difficulty in making all the constructions on a
                    small scale on the drawing board and then transferring them to the cylinder.</p>
                <p>§ 60. A variety of instruments have been proposed to facilitate perspective
                    drawings. If the problem is to make a drawing from nature then a camera obscura
                    or, better, Wollaston’s camera lucida may be used. Other instruments are made
                    for the construction of perspective drawings. It will often happen that the
                    vanishing point of some direction which would be very useful in the construction
                    falls at a great distance off the paper, and various methode have been proposed
                    of drawing lines through such a point. For some of these see Stanley’s <hi

                <p>Literature.—Descriptive geometry dates from Monge, whose Géométrie Descrip, tive
                    appeared in 1800. Before his time plans and elevations, especially of buildings,
                    had been in use, and rules had been developed to determine by construction from
                    drawings the shapes of the stones required in buildings, especially in vaults
                    and arches. These rules were reduced to a consistent method by Monge.</p>
                <p>Perspective was investigated much earlier, as painters felt the need of it. Its
                    beginnings date from the time of the Greek mathematicians, but its modem
                    development from the time of the Renaissance, when the first books on the
                    subject appeared in Italy. Albrecht Durer also published a treatise on it and
                    constructed a machine for making perspective drawings of objects. Of later
                    writers we mention in the 17th century Desargues, and in the 18th Dr Brook
                    Taylor, whose Linear Perspective appeared first in 1715 and New Principles of
                    Linear Perspective in 1719. At present perspective is generally treated as a
                    special case of projection, and included in books on descriptive geometry.</p>
                <p>For the literature of projection in general, we refer to the list of books given
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Geometry,</hi> vol. x. p. 407. For descriptive
                    geometry and pcιspective, see Monge, Géométrie Descriptive; Leroy, Traité de
                    Géométrie Descriptive; Fiedler, Darstellende Geometrie;.Goumerie, Traité de
                    Perspective; Mannheim, Géométrie Descriptive. (1880) and Éléments de la
                    Géométrie Descriptive (1882); J. Woolley, Descriptive Geometry (1856), which is
                    based on Leroy’s work, and is the only scientific publication on the subject in
                    England. A number of other publications with titles such as “Practical Geometry”
                    and “Geometrical Drawing” contain more or less full explanations of the methods
                    of descriptive geometry. These are based generally on Euclidian as opposed to
                    projective geometry, and are therefore in their theoretical part more or less
                    unsatisfactory. We may mention Angel, Practical Plane Geometry and Projection.
