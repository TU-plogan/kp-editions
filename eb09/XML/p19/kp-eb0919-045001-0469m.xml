                    seventeen in the Social or Italian War on the side of Sulla against the party of
                    Marius and Cinna. Thus early in life he connected himself with the cause of the
                    aristocracy, and a decisive victory which he won in 83 over the Marian armies
                    gained for him from Sulla the title of “imperator.” He followed up his successes
                    in Italy by defeating the Marians in Sicily and Africa, and on his return to
                    Rome in 81, though he was still merely an “eques” and not legally qualified to
                    celebrate a triumph, he was allowed by general consent to enjoy this great
                    distinction, while Sulla greeted him with the surname of Magnus, a title he
                    always retained and handed down to his sons. Yet in 79 he used his influence in
                    getting elected to the consulship a man politically opposed to Sulla, Aemilius
                    Lepidus, who threatened Rome with another revolution and civil war in the
                    interest of the democratic party. Pompey, however, at this crisis was loyal to
                    his friends, and with the defeat of Lepidus the danger passed away. With some
                    fears and misgivings the senate permitted him to retain the command of his
                    victorious army, and decided on sending him to Spain, where, under a leader of
                    singular ability, Sertorius, the Marian party was still formidable. Pompey was
                    fighting in Spain from 76 to 71, and though at first he met with serious
                    reverses he was ultimately successful, his great opponent, Sertorius, having, it
                    would seem, lost the confidence of some of the native Spanish tribes. In 71 he
                    was again in Italy at the head of his army, and won fresh glory by giving a
                    finishing blow to the slave insurrection of Spartacus. That same year, amid
                    great popular enthusiasm, but without the hearty concurrence of the senate, whom
                    he had alarmed by talking of restoring the dreaded power of the tribunes, and
                    though still merely an “eques,” he was elected with Crassus to the consulship,
                    and entered Rome in triumph for his Spanish victories. The following year saw
                    the work of Sulla undone: the tribuneship was restored, and the administration
                    of justice was no longer left exclusively to the senate, but was to be shared by
                    them with the wealthier portion of the middle class, the “knights,” as from old
                    time they had been called, and the farmers and collectors of the revenue. The
                    change was really necessary, as the provincials could never get justice from a
                    court composed of senators, and it was carried into effect by Pompey with
                    Caesar’s aid. Pompey as a matter of course rose still higher in popularity, and
                    on the motion of the tribune Gabinius in 67 he was entrusted with an
                    extraordinary command over the greater part of the empire, specially for the
                    extermination of piracy in the Mediterranean, by which the corn supplies of Rome
                    were seriously endangered, while high prices of provisions caused great
                    distress. It soon appeared that the right man had been chosen for the work: the
                    price of corn fell immediately on Pompey’s appointment, and in forty days the
                    Mediterranean was swept from end to end and the pirates cleared out of its
                    waters. Next year, on the proposal of the tribune Manilius, he had a yet further
                    extension of his powers, the whole of Rome’s empire in the East being put under
                    his control for three years with the view of finally terminating the war with
                    Mithradates, king of Pontus, who had recovered from the defeats he had sustained
                    from Lucullus and regained his dominions. Both Caesar and Cicero supported the
                    tribune’s proposal, which was easily carried in spite of the interested
                    opposition of the senate and the aristocracy, several of whom held provinces
                    which would now be practically under Pompey’s command. Pompey was now by far the
                    first man in the Roman world. His operations in the East were thoroughly
                    successful, and, though no doubt he owed something to the victories of Lucullus,
                    he showed himself an able soldier. The wild tribes of the Caucasus were cowed by
                    the</p>
                <p>Roman arms, and the king of Pontus himself fled from Asia across the Black Sea to
                    Panticapaeum, the modern Kertch. In the years 64 and 63 Syria and Palestine were
                    annexed to Rome’s empire. After the capture of Jerusalem Pompey is said to have
                    entered the temple, and even the Holy of Holies. Asia and the East generally
                    were left under the subjection of petty kings who were mere vassals of Rome.
                    Several cities had been founded which became centres of Greek life and
                    civilization. A really great work had been accomplished, and Pompey, now in his
                    forty-fifth year, returned to Italy in 61 to celebrate the most magnificent
                    triumph which Rome had ever witnessed, and to be hailed as the conqueror of
                    Spain, Africa, and Asia.</p>
                <p>The remainder of Pompey’s life is inextricably interwoven with that of Caesar. He
                    was married to Caesar’s daughter Julia, and as yet the relations between the two
                    had been friendly. On more than one occasion Caesar had supported Pompey’s
                    policy, which of late had been in a decidedly democratic direction. Pompey was
                    now in fact ruler of the greater part of the empire, while Caesar had only the
                    two provinces of Gaul. The control of the capital, the supreme command of the
                    army in Italy and of the Mediterranean fleet, the governorship of the two
                    Spains, the superintendence of the corn supplies, which were mainly drawn from
                    Sicily and Africa, and on which the vast population of Rome was wholly
                    dependent, were entirely in the hands of Pompey. The senate and the aristocracy
                    disliked and distrusted him, but they felt that, should things come to the
                    worst, they might still find in him a champion of their cause. At the same time
                    the senate itself was far from unanimous: among many of its members there was a
                    feeling that a military imperialism had become a necessity, while to the rich
                    and idle world generally peace and quiet at any price seemed the best of all
                    blessings. Hence the joint rule of Pompey and Caesar was not unwillingly
                    accepted, and anything like a rupture between the two was greatly dreaded as the
                    sure beginning of anarchy throughout the Roman world. With the death of Pompey’s
                    wife Julia, in 54, came strained relations between him and Caesar, and soon
                    afterwards he drew closer to what we may call the old conservative party in the
                    senate and aristocracy. The end was now near, and Pompey blundered into a false
                    political position and an open quarrel with Caesar. In 50 the senate by a very
                    large majority revoked the extraordinary powers conceded to Pompey and Caesar in
                    Spain and Gaul respectively. Pompey’s refusal to submit gave Caesar a good
                    pretext for declaring war and marching at the head of his army into Italy. At
                    the beginning of the contest, the advantages were decidedly on the side of
                    Pompey, but very speedily the superior political tact of his rival, combined
                    with extraordinary promptitude and decision in following up his blows, turned
                    the scale against him. Pompey’s cause, with that of the senate and aristocracy,
                    was finally ruined by his defeat in 48 in the neighbourhood of the Thessalian
                    city Pharsalus. That same year he fled with the hope of finding a safe refuge in
                    Egypt, but was treacherously murdered as he was stepping on the shore by one of
                    his old centurions. He had just completed his fifty-eighth year.</p>
                <p>Pompey, though he had some great and good qualities, hardly deserved his surname
                    of “the Great.” He was certainly a very good soldier, and is said to have
                    excelled in all athletic exercises, but he fell short of being a first-rate
                    general. He won great successes in Spain and more especially in the East, but
                    for these he was no doubt partly indebted to what others had already done. Of
                    the gifts which make a good statesman he had really none. As plainly appeared in
                    the last years of his life, he was too weak and irresolute to choose a side and
                    stand by it. Pitted against such a man as Caesar, he could not but fail. But to
                    his credit be it said that in a corrupt time he never used his opportunities for
                    plunder and extortion, and his domestic life was pure and simple.</p>

                    (75-35 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> the younger son of Pompey the Great,
                    born 75 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> continued after his father’s death to
                    prolong the struggle against the new rulers of the Roman empire. Caesar’s
                    victory at Munda in 45 drove him out of Corduba (Cordova), though for a time he
                    held his ground in the south of Spain, and defeated Asinius Pollio, the governor
                    of the province. In 43, the year of the triumvirate of Octavius, Antony, and
                    Lepidus, he was proscribed along with the murderers of Caesar, and not daring to
                    show himself in Italy he put himself at the head of a fleet manned chiefly by
                    slaves or proscribed persons, by means of which he made himself master of
                    Sicily, and from thence ravaged the coasts of Italy. Rome was threatened with a
                    famine, as the corn supplies from Egypt and Africa were cut off by his ships,
                    and it was thought prudent to negotiate a peace with him, which was to leave him
                    in possession of Sicily, Sardinia, and Achaia, provided he would allow Italy to
                    be freely supplied with corn. But the arrangement could not be carried into
                    effect, as Sextus renewed the war and gained some considerable successes at sea.
                    However, in 36 his fleet was defeated and destroyed by Agrippa off the north
                    coast of Sicily, and in the following year he was murdered at Mitylene by an
                    officer of Antony. He had his father’s bravery as a soldier, but seems to have
                    been a rough uncultivated man. . (w. J. B.)</p>
