                    style was due rather to Giotto than to his earlier master. Of the three
                    world-famed bronze doors of the Florentine baptistery, the earliest one —that on
                    the south side—was the work of Andrea; he spent many years on it; and it was
                    finally set up in 1336.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The date on the door, 1330, refers to the completion of the wax model, not
                    of the casting, which was at first unsuccessful, and had to be done over again
                    by Andrea himself.</p></note> This marvellous piece of bronze work, in many
                    respects perhaps the finest the world has ever seen, has all the breadth of a
                    sculptor’s modelling, with the finish of a piece of gold jewellery. It consists
                    of a number of small quatrefoil panels—the lower eight containing single figures
                    of the Virtues (see the figure), and the rest scenes from the life of the
                    Baptist. In design the panels owe much to Giotto: the composition of each is
                    simple and harmonious, kept strictly within the due limits of the plastic art,
                    no attempt at pictorial effects and varied planes being made,— in this very
                    unlike the perhaps more magnificent but less truly artistic reliefs on the third
                    door, that last executed by Ghiberti. Andrea Pisano, while living in Florence,
                    also produced many important works of marble sculpture, all of which show
                    strongly Giotto’s influence. In some cases probably they were actually designed
                    by that artist, as, for instance, the double band of beautiful panel-reliefs
                    which Andrea executed for the great campanile. The subjects of these are the
                    Four Great Prophets, the Seven Virtues, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Works of
                    Mercy, and the Seven Planets. The duomo contains the chief of Andrea’s other
                    Florentine works in marble. In 1347 he was appointed architect to the duomo of
                    Orvieto, which had already been designed and begun by Lorenzo Maitani. The exact
                    date of his death is not known, but it must have been shortly before the year
                    1349.</p>
                <p>Andrea Pisano had two sons, Nino and Tommaso,—both, especially the former,
                    sculptors of considerable ability. Nino was very successful in his statues of
                    the Madonna and Child, which are full of human feeling and soft loveliness,—a
                    perfect embodiment of the Catholic ideal of the Divine Mother. Andrea’s chief
                    pupil was Andrea di Cione, better known as <hi rend="smallcaps">Orcagna
                    (j.v.).</hi> Balduccio di Pisa, another, and in one branch (that of sculpture)
                    equally gifted pupil, executed the wonderful shrine of S. Eustorgio at Milan—a
                    most magnificent mass of sculptured figures and reliefs.</p>
