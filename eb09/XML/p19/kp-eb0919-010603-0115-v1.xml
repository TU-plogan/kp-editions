                <p><label type="entry">PINEROLO</label>, a city of Italy, in the province of Turin
                    (Piedmont), is built in a straggling manner on a hill-side just above the
                    junction of the valleys of the Chisone and the Lemina, at a height of 1237 feet
                    above the sea, 23⅜ miles by rail south-west of Turin. It is the terminus of the
                    branch railway from Turin by Sangone or Nichellino, and has steam tramways
                    running up to Perosa (12 miles) and south to Saluzzo. Till 1696 it was strongly
                    fortified with a citadel on Santa Brigida, a castle on St Maurizio, and city
                    walls constructed by Thomas I. of Savoy. It has a cathedral (St Donatus), a
                    bishop’s palace, a large seminary, a theatre (1842), a hospital (1546), a public
                    library, a cavalry college, a school of music, and a Waldensian chapel and
                    schools. Cotton, silk, wool, and hemp are among the local manufactures. The
                    population of the city was 11,362 in 1871 and 12,003 in 1881 (commune 16,730 and
                    17,492).</p>
                <p>Pinerolo was bestowed on the bishops of Turin by Otho III. in 996; but in 1078
                    the countess Adelaide made it over to the Benedictine abbey of Santa Maria, in
                    whose possession it remained till 1159. Thomas I. of Savoy captured the castle
                    in 1188, and in 1246 the commune formally recognized the supremacy of Savoy.
                    Passing in 1295 into the hands of Philip, son of Thomas III., Pinerolo became
                    his residence and capital, a distinction which it retained under Amadeus VIII.
                    of Savoy, even after the extinction of the separate house of Piedmont in 1418.
                    Francis I. of France obtained possession of the town in his descent into Italy,
                    and tried to secure the allegiance of the people by relieving the woollen trade
                    from taxation; but Emmanuel Philibert received it back from Henry III. in 1574.
                    A second occupation by the French occurred under Cardinal Richelieu: the French
                    language was imposed on the people, great fortifications were constructed, and
                    the fortress was used as a state prison for such men as Fouquet, De Gaumont, and
                    the Man with the Iron Mask. Victor Amadeus bombarded the place in 1693, and
                    ultimately compelled Louis XIV. to relinquish his hold on it; but before the
                    withdrawal of the French troops the defences were demolished and the military
                    importante of Pinerolo brought to a close. In 1748 the town was made a bishop’s
                    see. Michele Buniva, pensioned by Victor Emmanuel I. as the introducer of
                    vaccination into Piedmont, was a native of Pinerolo and has a statue in the
                    Piazza del Palazzo. De Grossi and Massi are among the local historians.</p>
