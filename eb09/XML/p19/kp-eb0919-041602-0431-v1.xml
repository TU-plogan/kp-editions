                    the son of Aeaces. After distinguishing himself by his liberality towards his
                    poorer fellow-citizens he took advantage of a festival to Hera in order to make
                    himself master of Samos (537 or 536 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi><note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Eusebius gives the date
                            as 1484 (yeaτ of Abraham) «= Olymp. 61,4 — October 533 to October 532.
                            But codex N of the Armenian version of Eusebius has Abrah. 1480 = Olymp.
                            60,4 = Oct. 537 to Oct. 536. The former date, accepted by Clinton, would
                            leave only ten years for the tyranny of Polycrates, which seems too
                            little.</p></note> Allied with Amasis, king of Egypt, he prospered
                    greatly, so that his fame went forth through all Greece and Ionia. He had 100
                    ships and 1000 bowmen. He made war indiscriminately on friend and foe, declaring
                    with grim humour that he gratified his friends more by returning to them their
                    own than by not taking it at all. Many islands fell before him and many cities
                    on the mainland. Amongst the former was Rhenea, which he attached by a chain to
                    the neighbouring island of Delos, and dedicated to the Delian Apollo. When the
                    Lesbians would have succoured Miletus, he conquered and captured them in a
                    sea-fight and employed them to dig a moat round the walls of his fortress.
                    According to Herodotus, he was the first within historical times who aimed at
                    the sovereignty of the seas, and his ambitious schemes embraced not only the
                    Greek islands but also Ionia. In magnificence none of the Greek tyrants save
                    those of Syracuse could compare with him.</p>

                <p>Ηis great public works were executed, according to Aristotle, for the purpose of
                    employing his subjects and diverting their thoughts from the recovery of their
                        freedom.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Herodotus,
                            our chief authority for the life of Polycrates, mentions three great
                            engineering and architectural works for which Samos was remarkable :—(1)
                            a tunnel, about 1400 yards long, dug through a mountain, and serving to
                            bring water to the capital; (2) a great mole or breakwater round the
                            harbour; (3) a great temple (the temple of Hera, patron goddess of
                            Samos), said by Herodotus to be the largest he had ever seen. But we
                            cannot say what share Polycrates had in these works; certainly the
                            temple of Hera seems to have been begun before his time.</p></note> He
                    imported Spartan and Molossian hounds, goats from Naxos and Scyros, sheep from
                    Attica and Miletus. The splendour of his palace is attested by the design which
                    many centuries later the emperor Caligula formed of rebuilding it. Foreign
                    artists worked for him at high wages: from Athens he brought Demacedes, the
                    greatest physician of the age, at a salary of two talents. Polycrates was also a
                    patron of letters: he collected a library and lived on terms of intimate
                    friendship with the poet Anacreon, whose verses were full of references to his
                    patron. The philosopher Pythagoras, however, quitted Samos in order to escape
                    his tyranny. The good fortune of Polycrates is the subject of a famous story.
                    Amasis, moved with fear at the exceeding great prosperity of his friend,
                    reminded him that God is jealous, and that the man who is uplifted very high
                    must needs fall very low. Therefore he besought him, if he would avert the
                    jealous wrath of heaven, to cast from him that which he valued most. Polycrates
                    hearkened to him and flung into the sea an emerald signet set in gold, the work
                    of the Samian artist Theodorus. But a few days after the signet was found in the
                    belly of a large fish which a fisherman had presented to the king. When Amasis
                    heard of this he knew that Polycrates was doomed, and renounced his alliance.
                    Amasis died before his forebodings were fulfilled. When the Persians under King
                    Cambyses were preparing to invade Egypt, Polycrates, anxious to conciliate the
                    growing power of Persia, sent forty ships to their help (525 B.c.). But the
                    squadron was largely manned by malcontents whom Polycrates had hoped thus to get
                    rid of; hardly had it reached the island of Carpathus when the crews mutinied
                    and turned the ships’ heads back to Samos. They defeated the tyrant in an action
                    at sea, but were themselves overthrown in a land battle and compelled to flee
                    the island. Having taken refuge in Sparta, they prevailed on the Spartans to
                    make war on Polycrates. A powerful Spartan armament laid siege to Samos, but was
                    fain to retire after forty days without effecting its object. Not very long
                    afterwards Orcetes, the Persian satrap of Sardes, by working on the avarice and
                    ambition of Polycrates, lured him to Magnesia and put him to a shameful death
                    (522 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi></p>
                <p>The name of Polycrates was also borne by an Athenian rhetorician of some repute,
                    who flourished early in the 4th century B.c. He taught at Athens, and afterwards
                    in Cyprus. He composed declamations on paradoxical themes—an <hi rend="italic"
                        >Encomium on Cl·ytemnestra,</hi> an <hi rend="italic">Accusation of
                        Socrates,</hi> an <hi rend="italic">Encomium on Busiris</hi> (a mythical
                    king of Egypt, notorious for his inhumanity); also declamations on mice, pots,
                    and counters. His <hi rend="italic">Encomium on Busiris</hi> was sharply
                    criticized by his younger contemporary Isocrates, in a work still extant, and
                    Dionysius of Halicarnassus characterises his style as frigid, vulgar, and
                    inelegant. Nevertheless his works are said to have been studied by Demosthenes.
