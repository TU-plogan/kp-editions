                    published in 1569. At an early age he founded in Naples the Academia Secretorum
                    Naturae, otherwise known as the Accademia dei Oziosi, of which the history has
                    been briefly sketched elsewhere (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Academy,</hi> vol. i.
                    p. 70); and in 1610 he became a member of the Accademia dei Lincei at Rome. He
                    died at Naples on 4th February 1615.</p>
                <p>The following is a chronological list of the principal writings of this prolific

                    Porta also wrote several Italian comedies <hi rend="italic">(Olimpia,</hi> 1589;
                    <hi rend="italic">La Fantesca,</hi> 1592; <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi

                    >Cintia,</hi> 1628). Among all the above-mentioned works the chief interest
                    attaches to the <hi rend="italic">Magia naturalis,</hi> in which a strange
                    medley of subjects is discussed, including the reproduction of animals, the
                    transmutation of metals, pyrotechny, domestic economy, statics, hunting, the
                    preparation of perfumes; in book xvii. he describes a number of optical
                    experiments. They include a description of the camera obscura. If, says he, a
                    small aperture is made in the shutter of a dark room, distinct images of all
                    external objects will be depicted on the opposite wall in their true colours;
                    and he further adds that, if a convex lens be fixed in the opening so that the
                    images are received on a surface at the distance of its focal length, the
                    pictures will be rendered so much more distinct that the features of a person
                    standing on the outside of the window may be readily recognized in his inverted
                    image. He applied this instrument to a sort of magic lantern, the representation
                    of eclipses of the sun, and of hunting and other scenes, battles, and other
                    events produced by movable pictures and drawings. He considered the eye as a
                    camera obscura, the pupil as the hole in the window contracting and dilating
                    with different lights, and the crystalline lens as the principal organ of
                    vision, though he seems to have regarded it not as his convex lens but as the
                    tablet on which the images of external objects were formed, the cornea being, no
                    doubt, in his estimation, the part of the eye which formed the picture. After
                    speaking of spectacles and the like, he professed to know a combination of
                    lenses by which “we may contrive to recognize our friends at the distance of
                    several miles, and those of weak sight may read the most minute letters from a
                    distance. It is an invention of great utility, and grounded on optical
                    principles, nor is it at all difficult of execution; but it must be so divulged
                    as not to be understood by the vulgar, and yet be clear to the sharpsighted.”
                    The obscure description which follows does not, however, make it at all probable
                    that he had really anticipated Galilteo.</p>
                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">refractione</hi> Porta treats
                    of binocular vision. He repeats the propositions of Euclid on the dissimilar
                    pictures of a sphere when seen with each eye and when seen with both; and he
                    quotes from Galen on the dissimilarity of the three pictures thus seen. But,
                    maintaining as he does that we can see only with one eye at a time, he denies
                    the accuracy of Euclid’s theorem; and, while he admits that the observations of
                    Galen are correct, he endeavours to explain them on other principles. In
                    illustrating Galen’s views on the dissimilarity of the three pictures he gives a
                    diagram in which can be recognized not only the principle but the construction
                    of the stereoscope. It contains a view, represented by a circle, of the picture
                    of a solid as seen by the right eye, of the picture of the same solid as seen by
                    the left, and of the combination of these two pictures as seen by both eyes,
                    placed between the first two pictures. These results, as exhibited in three
                    circles, are then explained by copying the passage from Galen, and he requests
                    the observer to repeat the experiments so as to see the three dissimilar
                    pictures when looking at a solid column.</p>
