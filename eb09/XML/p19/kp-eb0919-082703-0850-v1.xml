                    coast of Caria, but resident in Rhodes during the latter half of the 4th century
                    B.c., was celebrated for the minute and laborious finish which he bestowed on
                    his pictures, both in drawing and in colour. Apelles, his great rival, standing
                    astonished in presence of one of these works, could only console himself that he
                    knew when to stop whereas Protogenes did not. So also Petronius <hi
                        rend="italic">(Satyr.,</hi> 83) experienced a sensation of horror at the too
                    vivid realization of nature in which Protogenes indulged. On one picture, the
                    Ialysus, he spent seven years; on another, the Satyr, he worked continuously
                    during the <pb break="no"

                    (305-4 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> notwithstanding that the garden in which
                    he painted was in the middle of the enemy’s camp. Demetrius unsolicited took
                    measures for his safety; more than that, when told that the Ialysus just
                    mentioned was in a part of the town exposed to assault, Demetrius changed his
                    plan of operations. Possibly the slowness and laboriousness of the work of
                    Protogenes was due partly to a want of training in his youth. .He appears to
                    have been self-taught; some said that he had begun life as a ship-painter, and,
                    though the painting of certain small figures of ships in a picture of his in
                    Athens, however excellent it may have been, can hardly be held to confirm this
                    account of his youth, it does not on the other hand render the account
                    unreliable. It may have been due also to a want of early training that he found
                    so much difficulty in rendering the foam at the mouth of a dog which occurred in
                    the picture of Ialysus. Angry at his many failures, he dashed the sponge wet
                    with the white colour which he had just wiped off at the mouth of the dog. The
                    result was a perfectly successful foam. Ialysus was a local hero, the founder of
                    the town of the same name in the island of Rhodes, and probably he was
                    represented as a huntsman. The picture was still in Rhodes in the time of
                    Cicero, but was afterwards removed to Rome, where it perished in the burning of
                    the temple of Peace. On another occasion Protogenes seems to have used his
                    sponge with a different effect. The picture painted during the siege of Rhodes
                    consisted of a satyr leaning idly against a pillar on which was a figure of a
                    partridge so life-like that ordinary spectators saw nothing but it. Enraged on
                    this account, the painter wiped out the partridge. The Satyr must have been one
                    of his last works. He would then be about seventy years of age, and had enjoyed
                    for about twenty years a reputation next only to that of Apelles, his friend and
                    benefactor. Both were finished colourists so far as the fresco-painting of their
                    day permitted, and both were laborious in the practice of drawing, doubtless
                    with the view to obtaining bold effects of perspective as well as fineness of
                    outline. It was an illustration of this practice when Apelles, finding in the
                    house of Protogenes a large panel ready prepared for a picture,, drew upon it
                    with a brush a very fine line which he said would tell sufficiently who had
                    called. Protogenes on his return home took a brush with a different colour and
                    drew a still finer line along that of Apelles dividing it in two. Apelles called
                    again; and, thus challenged, drew with a third colour another line within that
                    of Protogenes, who then admitted himself surpassed. This panel was seen by Pliny
                    (A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>.Zf., xxxv. 83) in Rome, where it was much
                    admired, and where it perished by fire. In the gallery of the Propylaea at
                    Athens was to be seen the panel by Protogenes in which occurred the figures of
                    ships already mentioned. The subject consisted of two figures representing
                    personifications of the coast of Attica, Paralus and Hammonias, to whom the
                    presence of ships would be the more appropriate as the Athenians actually
                    possessed two ships so named. For the council chamber at Athens he painted
                    figures of the Thesmothetae, but in what form or character is not known.
                    Probably these works were executed in Athens, and it may have been then that he
                    met Aristotle, who recommended him to take for subjects the deeds of Alexander
                    the Great. In his Alexander and Pan he may have followed that advice in the
                    idealizing spirit to which he was accustomed. To this spirit must be traced also
                    his Cydippe and Tlepolemus, legendary personages of Rhodes. Among his portraits
                    are mentioned those of the mother of Aristotle, Philiscus the tragic poet, and
                    King Antigonus. But Protogenes was also a sculptor to some extent, and made
                    several bronze statues of athletes, armed figures, huntsmen, and persons in the
                    act of offering sacrifices.</p>
