                    against a particular person. In Roman law the latter sense was the more common;

                    to say, it is granted to a person, as a peer, or to a place, as a university.
                    The most important instances at present existing in England are the privilege of
                    parliament (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Parliament),</hi> the privilege which
                    protects certain communications from being regarded as libellous (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Libel),</hi> and certain privileges enjoyed by the clergy and
                    others, by which they are to some extent exempt from public duties, such as
                    serving on juries. Privileged copyholds are those held by the custom of the
                    manor and not by the will of the lord. There are certain debts in England,
                    Scotland, and the United States which are said to be privileged, that is, such
                    debts as the executor may pay before all others—for example, funeral expenses or
                    servants’ wages. In English law the term “preferred” rather than “privileged” is
                    generally applied to such debts. There are certain deeds and summonses which are
                    privileged in Scotch law, the former because they require less solemnity than
                    ordinary deeds, the latter because the ordinary <pb break="no"

                <p><hi rend="italic">indudae</hi> are shortened in their case (see Watson, <hi

                <p>In the United States the term privilege is of considerable political importance.
                    By Art. IV. § 2 of the constitution, “the citizens of each State shall be
                    entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.” By
                    Art. XIV. § 1 of the amendments to the constitution (enacted July 28, 1868), “no
                    State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or
                    immunities of citizens of the United States.” It will be noticed that Art. IV.
                    applies to citizens of the States, Art. XIV. to citizens of the United States.
                    “The intention of this clause (Art. IV.) was to confer on the citizens of each
                    State, if one may so say, a general citizenship, and to communicate all the
                    privileges and immunities which the citizens of the same State would have been
                    entitled to under the like circumstances” (Story, <hi rend="italic">Constitution
                    of the United States,</hi> § 1806). The clauses have several times been the
                    subject of judicial decision in the supreme court. Their practical effect may be
                    thus illustrated. With regard to Art. IV., it was held that a State licence tax
                    discriminating against commodities the production of other States was void as
                    abridging the privileges and immunities of the citizens of such other States
                    (Ward <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> State of Maryland, 12 Wallace’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Reports,</hi> 418). With regard to Art. XIV. 1, it was held that
                    its main purpose was to protect from the hostile legislation of the States the
                    privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, looking more
                    especially to the then recent admission of negroes to political rights.
                    Accordingly it was held that a grant of exclusive right or privilege of
                    maintaining slaughter-houses for twenty-one years, imposing at the same time the
                    duty of providing ample conveniences, was not unconstitutional, as it was only a
                    police regulation for the health of the people (The Slaughter-House Cases, 16
                    Wallace, 36). The same has been held of a refusal by a State to grant to a woman
                    a licence to practise law (Bradwell <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> The State, 16
                    Wallace, 130), of a State law confining the right of suffrage to males (Minor
                    <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Happersett, 21 Wallace, 162), and of a State law
                    regulating the sale of intoxicating liquors (Bartemeyer <hi rend="italic"
                    >v.</hi> Iowa, 18 Wallace, 129). Suits to redress the deprivation of privilege
                    secured by the constitution of the United States must be brought in a United
                    States court. It is a crime to conspire to prevent the free exercise and
                    enjoyment of any privilege, or to conspire to deprive any person of equal
                    privileges and immunities, or under colour of law to subject any inhabitant of a
                    State or Territory to the deprivation of any privileges or immunities <hi
