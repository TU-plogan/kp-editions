                    substance for use as food implies the retention of its full nutritive power,
                    sapidity, and digestibility, with its natural odour and colour unimpaired, for
                    such length of time as may be required. The process employed must be
                    sufficiently cheap to allow of the preserved food being placed in the market at
                    a price which will insure a demand for it. The operations connected with the
                    preparation of many food-substances are partly directed to the production of
                    food in a new and more convenient form from that in which it is yielded by
                    nature, and partly with the view of preserving the alimentary body. Cheese is an
                    example of such a food-preparation, and to a smaller extent so also are butter
                    and other edible fats and oils, as well as fruit and vegetable jellies and
                    conserves. Concentrated foods and extracts, such as Liebig’s extract of beef,
                    belong to the same category, consisting of certain essential principles of
                    animal food easily preserved, and prepared partly on that account.</p>
                <p>Many of the most important food-staples require nothing more than favourable
                    natural conditions for their preservation, till they are ordinarily required for
                    consumption. Such is the case with the cereal grains, which are sufficiently
                    ripened and dried in the harvest field, and with all hard farinaceous and
                    oleaginous seeds, nuts, and fruits. Most soft succulent fruits and vegetables,
                    on the other hand, and all varieties of animal food require artificial
                    preservation, and it is to these that the various processes in use are applied.
                    These processes resolve themselves into four groups,—(1) drying, (2) use of
                    antiseptics, (3) exclusion of air, and (4) refrigeration. Several hundreds of
                    patents have been obtained in the United Kingdom alone for preservative
                    processes coming under one or more of these heads; but in reality the methods of
                    preservation in practical operation are not many.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Drying</hi> is the most ancient and primitive of all
                    processes for preserving food, and, although it answers but imperfectly for most
                    animal substances, yet in dry hot countries it is very extensively practised. In
                    the River Plate regions of South America a large quantity of beef is annually
                    prepared for export to Brazil and the West Indies under the name of “tasajo” or
                    “charqui dulce,” principally by drying. The meat is simply cut into pieces,
                    freed from fat, bone, and tendon, powdered with maize meal, and dried hard by
                    exposure to the sun, care being taken to keep it protected from rain. The dried
                    product has about one-fourth the weight of fresh meat, and is of a dark colour.
                    It requires to be soaked in water and cooked for a long time, yielding at best a
                    tough indigestible meat; but it makes a well-flavoured nutritive soup. The
                    greater part of the charqui or jerked beef of South America is, however,
                    slightly salted as well as sun-dried; and among many races where drying is
                    practised the use of salt and smoking are also appreciated. Many attempts have
                    been made to introduce dried meat in the form of powder or meal. For this
                    purpose fresh meat, deprived of fat, is cut into thin slices and slowly dried at
                    a low heat in an oven or heated chamber till the meat is hard, crisp, and dry.
                    When powdered, such a preparation keeps well if it is not exposed to damp; but
                    it cannot be said to offer any advantages for general use, although it might be
                    of value to an army during a campaign. Nevertheless a company, under the name of
                    the Carne Pura Company, has been established in Berlin within the last few years
                    for the manufacture of such meat-powder. Of an analogous nature are the
                    concentrated soup tablets or cakes, prepared, principally in Russia, by the
                    rapid evaporation of rich soups, with which dried vegetables and flour are
                    sometimes incorporated in proportion sufficient to yield a good soup on dilution
                    with boiling water. These soups are generally deficient in aroma and have
                    frequently an unpleasant gluey consistency and taste. Concentrated meat
                    biscuits, in which flour and extract of beef are prepared in a thoroughly dry
                    condition, and which were largely used in the American Civil War, the German pea
                    sausage (“Erbsen wurst ”), made famous during the Franco-Prussian War, and
                    pemmican are examples of food in which dried meat may be well preserved in
                    conjunction with farinaceous substances. Preservation by simple drying is
                    extensively practised among the Chinese for their gelatinous foods, such as
                    trepang, dried tendons, skins, mussels and other molluscs, and fish. Milk also
                    may be preserved in the form of a dry powder, but the result is not sufficiently
                    attractive to command a market.</p>
                <p>Succulent fruits and vegetables are satisfactorily preserved by simple drying.
                    The principal dried saccharine fruits of commerce are raisins, currants, figs,
                    dates, and prunes. These differ in their nutritive properties considerably from
                    the natural fruits they represent, as do also the farinaceous fruits and
                    vegetables preserved by drying, such as the banana, bread-fruit, mandioc,
                    &lt;fcc. A process of drying and compressing ordinary pot-vegetables and
                    potatoes, invented by Μ. Masson about 1845, is now carried out on a large scale
                    by Messrs Chollet &amp; Co. of Paris. The vegetables to be treated are carefully
                    picked, plunged into boiling water to coagulate the vegetable albumen<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n731/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0731-0708"/>, shred, and promptly dried in a current of heated
                    air. They are then submitted to powerful hydraulic pressure, condensing them
                    into thin dense cakes, ιvhich retain from 9 to 15 per cent, of the weight of the
                    original green substances, or 20 per cent, of the weight in the case of
                    potatoes, but all in greatly reduced compass. The saving of space is, equally
                    with the preservation, of the utmost importance for use on board ship or by
                    soldiers in the field. Within the space of a cubic metre 25,000 rations of
                    Chollet’s compressed vegetables can be packed, each ration weighing 25 grammes
                    and representing about 200 grammes of green vegetables. As anti-scorbutics such
                    preserved vegetables are inferior; but they are nevertheless exceedingly useful,
                    and when well cooked almost equal in taste to the fresh vegetables.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Use of Antiseptics.—</hi> The variety of antiseptic
                    substances which have been experimented with for the curing of food is
                    numberless. Bodies solid, liquid, and gaseous have been proposed, and these have
                    been variously recommended for superficial application, for injection, and for
                    forming an artificial atmosphere around the substance to be preserved; and
                    further, it has been suggested that the creature whose flesh is to be preserved
                    should, before killing, be impregnated with the antiseptic by inhalation or
                    otherwise. In practice the antiseptics used are very few in number, since many
                    of them have a physiological effect on the digestive and other internal organs
                    into which they are introduced with the food, and so must injure the health.
                    Besides, many proposed antiseptics are either in themselves unpleasant in smell
                    or taste, or alter the appearance, colour, taste, or consistency of the food
                    preserved. The least objectionable are substances which enter into human food
                    themselves, such as certain salts, sugar, vinegar, and alcohol. The most
                    ancient, most commonly used, and throughout most effective is common salt. Salt
                    acts on meat by withdrawing the animal juices, the place of which it takes, and
                    by hardening the muscular tissue. Consequently it seriously lessens the
                    nutritive value of animal food, and renders it much less digestible than fresh
                    meat. It appears to be least injurious in the case of pork, the fat of which it
                    renders more digestible, and, as a consequence, no animal food is more largely
                    preserved by the process of salting. A certain proportion of other saline
                    bodies, notably saltpetre (nitrate of potash), and of sugar is frequently
                    combined with salt in curing, and so also are other antiseptic and preservative
                    agencies. Bacon, for example, is both salted and smoked, while tongues and fish
                    are not only salted and smoked but also dried. Smoking alone is very effective
                    in preserving and flavouring fish intended for consumption within a limited time
                    after curing. The quantity of fish prepared for human food by salting, smoking,
                    and drying, together or separately, is incalculably great. Of other antiseptics
                    which have been suggested, and which may be used effectively for the
                    preservation of food, few possess any advantage whatever over common salt, which
                    is certain in its action, abundant, cheap, and, within limits, harmless. Among
                    the substances which have of recent years come into prominent notice are
                    bisulphite of lime and various preparations of boracic acid, notably that known
                    as “glacialin” salt and the boro-glycerin introduced by Professor Barff. Boracic
                    acid is a powerful, inodorous, and tasteless preservative; but in repeated small
                    doses it exercises a specific influence on the excretory organs which must be
                    detrimental to health. Salicylic acid has also been extensively tried as a
                    foodpreserver, more especially for milk, but, in addition to the unpleasant
                    taste it communicates to the substances, there are physiological objections to
                    its use.</p>
                <p>The use of non-saline preservative agents is exemplified on a large scale in the
                    pickling in vinegar of succulent fruits and vegetables (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pickles,</hi> p. 80 above). Sugar plays a similar part in the preparation of
                    jams, jellies, candied fruits, &lt;fcc., ajιd alcohol is also occasionally
                    employed as a medium for the preservation of fruits. Oil acts as a preservative
                    more by its power of excluding atmospheric air than from any antiseptic
                    influence it possesses, and therefore comes under the next category.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Exclusion of Air.—</hi> The principal method of food
                    preservation dependent on the exclusion of air is the invention of François
                    Appert and dates from 1809. It consists essentially in securing cooked food in
                    hermetically sealed vessels from which the atmospheric air is as far as possible
                    driven off before sealing, and in killing by heat or otherwise such germs or
                    ferments as may remain within the vessel either before or after it is sealed up.
                    The process does not depend for its success on the perfect exclusion of
                    air,—indeed, originally there was no attempt to drive it off, but air sealed up
                    with the food was immediately submitted to a temperature sufficiently high to
                    kill all germs introduced with it and existing in the food itself. Quite
                    recently experiments have been conducted by Mr J. J. Coleman, the inventor of
                    the cold-air process described below, with the view of preserving food in
                    hermetically sealed vessels, which, instead of being exposed to heat, are
                    subjected to an intense cold, supposed to be sufficient to kill all minute
                    putrefactive organisms; but he has found that a cold of 130° Fahr, below
                    freezing-point is insufficient to destroy all organic germs. At present the
                    innumerable varieties of tinned foods, both animal and vegetable, are entirely
                    the result of the application of Appert’s principle. In practice there are
                    several processes of “tinning” food, but the general method adopted is
                    everywhere uniform in principle.</p>
                <p>The tins used are manufactured with the greatest care, and most ingenious
                    machinery has been devised for their thorough and expeditious preparation. The
                    proper quantity of meat, generally, though not necessarily, free from bone,
                    tendon, and undue proportion of fat, is weighed out and placed raw in the tin,
                    over which the cover is soldered. In the cover a small “pin-hole” is left, and
                    the tins are placed in a bath or boiler of solution of chloride of calcium,
                    which boils at a temperature of from ‘260° to 270° Fahr. Each tin is immersed to
                    within an inch or two of the top, and as the heat is gradually raised steam
                    issues from the pin-hole, carrying off the atmospheric air from within the tin.
                    When all the air has been expelled the pin-hole is promptly closed with a drop
                    of solder, and the tin, hermetically sealed, is entirely immersed for some time
                    in the superheated solution. When withdrawn and cooled, the tins are placed in a
                    heated testing-house, in which after a few days those that have been imperfectly
                    treated manifest their defects by a bulging of the sides, due to the generation
                    of gases from the putrefying mass they contain. Those which have been
                    successfully preserved generally show both ends collapsed or depressed by the
                    pressure of the air outside; and usually on a well-preserved tin being pierced
                    the air is audibly sucked in.</p>
                <p>The process is applicable to all classes of food, vegetable as well as animal,
                    which may without destruction be submitted to a temperature sufficient to render
                    putrefactive organisms inert, and in experience the amount of heat to which
                    different substances must be exposed varies very considerably. The variety of
                    substances preserved by tinning is now very great, and the total weight of human
                    food so stored is enormous. Numerous modifications of the airexclusion
                    principle, effectual within certain limits, are in use. The preservation of
                    sardines is due partly to cooking them in oil and surrounding them with .it and
                    partly to sealing them in tins, and potted meats, the “conserves fines” of the
                    French, are partly preserved by the use of fat. The most effective means of
                    preserving eggs consists in coating the shells, as soon as they are laid, with
                    butter or some other fat, gum, or varnish. Such coating prevents the transfusion
                    of water from the egg which ordinarily goes on, the place of the water being
                    taken by atmospheric air, rendering the egg specifically lighter and promoting
                    its putrefactive change. Processes for the exclusion of air <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0732-0709"/> by the substitution of an atmosphere of some
                    inert gas have not proved successful, neither has the method proposed and
                    patented by Dr Redwood, which consisted in coating meat with a layer of
                    paraffin.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Refrigeration.—</hi> That cold checks putrefaction has long
                    been known from ordinary experience. Bodies of the prehistoric mammoth have been
                    found in the ice of the Siberian tundra so well preserved that the flesh was
                    eaten by dogs. Ice is much used by fish merchants and other provision dealers
                    for the temporary preservation of their perishable stores; but the cost and
                    inconvenience of the process in temperate, and still more in hot, climates
                    render it applicable only for brief spaces of time and to the more costly of
                    food-products. But about the year 1875 ice began to be used on a large scale for
                    the preservation of fresh meat during its transit from America to the European
                    markets. This, the first practically successful method of preserving fresh meat
                    for such a period as enabled it to be sold in remote markets, consisted in
                    cooling a large meat chamber hung full of carcases by continually blowing into
                    it air which had previously been cooled to near the freezing point by being made
                    to pass through reservoirs of ice. The process was not all that could be
                    desired, but it successfully solved a question which had previously been
                    attempted many times and ways. It continued to be the method by which large
                    quantities of fresh meat were brought in good condition to the European market,
                    till in 1879 Mr J. J. Coleman inaugurated a new era by the introduction, in
                    conjunction with Mr H. Bell and Mr J. Bell, of his Bell-Coleman dryair
                    refrigerator.</p>
                <p>In the Bell-Coleman machine atmospheric air is compressed to one-fourth or
                    one-third of its normal bulk in an air-pump by means of a steam cylinder. The
                    air so condensed becomes hot, and is cooled by injecting water into the
                    air-compressor, after which it is still further reduced in temperature and freed
                    from moisture by passing it through a range of pipes in the cold air of the
                    chamber that is being refrigerated. Being then conveyed to the expanding
                    cylinder, the work or energy it contains in virtue of its compression is
                    expended in moving a piston which forms part of the machinery. From the piston
                    the air, now cooled as much as 50° to 100°, or even 200° Fahr., according to the
                    degree of compression to which it has been subjected, is distributed through the
                    cold chamber by suitable pipes. Mr A. Seale Haslam has since brought out a
                    refrigerator in which the temperature of the air is lowered by passing it
                    through pipes cooled externally, instead of by injecting water into the tubes
                    containing it.</p>

                    612. By means first of the Bell-Coleman and subsequently of the Haslam method,
                    fresh meat has been regularly imported into Europe from America since March
                    1879, when the Anchor liner “Circassia” delivered the first cargo. In February
                    1880 the first shipment from Australia, consisting of 34 tons of beef and
                    mutton, was delivered in London by the “Strathleven,” and in June 1882 the
                    sailing ship “Dunedin” brought from New Zealand to London, after a passage of
                    ninety-eight days, 4909 carcases of sheep and twenty-two pigs, all in perfect
                    condition, notwithstanding the prolonged voyage and the excessive heat
                    encountered during the passage. The dry-air refrigerators have also been largely
                    adopted in passenger and emigrant vessels for preserving fresh provisions for
                    daily use throughout their voyages, and preserving chambers and freezing
                    chambers have been erected on land at the ports of lading and delivery. The
                    machinery at present in use is capable of freezing upwards of 300,000 tons of
                    meat per annum, and it is rapidly being added to; and it may be said that these
                    machines have accomplished a perfect solution of the great problem of fresh-meat
                    preservation and distribution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> It is impossible to tabulate any reliable
                    figures relating to the trade in products which are properly classed as
                    preserved food. Within the first five years in which the Bell-Coleman machine
                    was in use there were brought from America by its agency alone 563,568 quarters
                    of beef and 113,633 carcases of mutton. The following figures illustrate the
                    development of the frozen-mutton trade from the great sheep-growing localities,
                    giving the number of carcases imported.</p>

                <p>As these imports bear only an insignificant relation to the supplies which might
                    be drawn from the several countries at the present moment, it is obvious that a
                    most important factor has been introduced into the meat trade which will
                    exercise a powerful influence on the markets. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">pa.
