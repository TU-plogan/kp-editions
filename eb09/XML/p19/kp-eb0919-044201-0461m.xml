                <p><label type="entry">POMERANIA</label> (Germ. <hi rend="italic">Pommern)</hi> is a
                    maritime province of Prussia, bounded on the N. by the Baltic, on the W. by
                    Mecklenburg, on the S. by Brandenburg, and on the E. by West Prussia. Its area
                    is 11,620 square miles. The province is officially divided into the three
                    districts of Stralsund, Stettin, and Cöslin; but more historical interest
                    attaches to the names of Vorpommern and Hinter-pommern, or Hither and Farther
                    Pomerania, applied to the territory to the west and to the east of the Oder
                    respectively. As a whole Pomerania is one of the lowest and flattest parts of
                    Germany, but to the east of the Oder it is traversed by a range of low hills,
                    and there are also a few isolated eminences to the west. Off the west coast,
                    which is very irregular, lie the islands of Rügen, Usedom, and Wollin; the coast
                    of Farther Pomerania is smooth in outline and bordered with dunes or sandbanks.
                    Besides the Oder and its affluents, there are several small rivers flowing into
                    the Baltic, none of which, however, are navigable except for rafts. Many of
                    these end in small littoral lakes, separated from the sea by a narrow strip of
                    land, through which the water escapes by one or more outlets. The interior of
                    the province is also thickly sprinkled with lakes, the combined area of which is
                    equal to about one-twentieth of its entire surface. The soil of Pomerania is for
                    the most part thin and sandy, especially to the east of the Oder; but patches of
                    good soil occur here and there. About 55 per cent, of the surface is under
                    tillage, while 19 per cent, consists of meadow and pasture and 20 per cent, is
                    covered by forests. The principal crops are potatoes, rye, and oats, but wheat
                    and barley are grown in the more fertile districts; tobacco and beetroot for
                    sugar are also cultivated. Agriculture is still in many respects carried on in a
                    somewhat primitive fashion, and the live stock is as a rule of an inferior
                    quality. Large flocks of sheep are kept both for their flesh and wool, and geese
                    and goose-feathers form lucrative articles of export. (A tabular view of the
                    agricultural products of Pomerania will be found under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Prussia.)</hi> Owing to the long coast-line and the numerous lakes, fishing
                    forms a not unimportant industry, and large quantities of herring, eels,
                    lampreys, &lt;fcc., are sent from Pomerania to other parts of Germany. With the
                    exceptions of its inexhaustible layers of peat or soft coal, the mineral wealth
                    of Pomerania is insignificant. Its industrial activity is also of no great
                    importance, though there are a few manufactories of machinery, chemicals,
                    tobacco, sugar, and other articles, chiefly in or near the larger towns, and
                    linen-weaving is practised as a domestic industry. Shipbuilding is carried on at
                    Stettin and other places on the coast. Commerce, however, is relatively much
                    more flourishing. Stettin is one of the chief seaports of Prussia, and
                    Stralsund, Greifswald, and Colberg also possess a foreign trade, the exports
                    consisting mainly of grain, timber, and fish.</p>
                <p>In 1880 Pomerania contained 1,540,034 inhabitants, all of whom were Protestants
                    except 23,877 Roman Catholics and 13,886 Jews. The Slavonic element in the
                    population is now represented only by a few thousand Poles and a handful of the
                    ancient Cassubians on the east border. Pomerania is the most sparsely populated
                    province in Prussia, the ratio being 132 inhabitants per square mile. About 67
                    per cent, of the population belong to the rural districts, while the remainder
                    live in communities of 2000 and upwards. There are only nine towns with more
                    than 10,000 inhabitants, at the head of which stands Stettin with 91,000. The
                    Pomeranians belong mainly to the old Saxon stock, and are, as a rule, tall,
                    strong, and well-built. They somewhat resemble the Scots in their cautious and
                    persevering character, their strong theological bias (which perpetuates the
                    existence of numerous small Protestant sects), and their turn for dry humour;
                    but they are by no means so enterprising or so open to new ideas. In 1883 only
                    0’32 per cent, of the Pomeranian recruits were illiterate, a fact which speaks
                    well for the educational system of the province. There is a univeιsity at
                    Greifswald. The province sends 16 members to the reichstag and 26 to the
                    Prussian house of representatives. The heir-presumptive of the Prussian crown
                    bears the title of governor of Pomerania.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In prehistoric times the
                    southern coast of the Baltic seems to have been occupied by Celts, who
                    afterwards made way for tribes of Teutonic stock. These in their turn migrated
                    to other settlements and were replaced, about the beginning of the 6th century
                    of our era, by Slavonians. The name of Pomore or Pommern, meaning “on the sea,”
                    was attached to the district by the last of these immigrant racés, and has often
                    changed its political and geographical significance. Originally it seems to have
                    denoted the coast district between the Oder and the Vistula, a territory which
                    was at first more or less dependent on Poland, but which appears towards the end
                    of the 12th century as divided between two native dukes owning the supremacy of
                    the German emperor. Afterwards Pomerania spread much farther to the west, while
                    correspondingly curtailed on the east, and a distinction was made between
                    Slavinia, or modern Pomerania, and Pomerellen. The latter, corresponding
                    substantially to the present province of West <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0462-0443"/> Prussia, remained subject to Poland down to the
                    beginning of the 14th century, when part of it fell away to the Teutonic knights
                    and part of it was annexed to the duchy of Pomerania-Wolgast. Christianity was
                    introduced in the 12th century, and its advance went hand in hand with the
                    Germanizing of the district. The later mediaeval history of Pomerania is
                    occupied with an endless succession of subdivisions among different lines of the
                    ducal houses, and with numerous expansions and contractions of territory through
                    constant hostilities with the elector of Brandenburg, who claimed to be the
                    immediate feudal superior of Pomerania, and with other neighbouring powers. The
                    names Vorpommern and Hinterpom-mern were at first synonymous with Slavinia and
                    Pomerellen, but towards the close of the 14th century they were transferred to
                    the two duchies into which the former (Pomerania proper) was divided. In 1625
                    the whole of Pomerania became united under the sway of Bogeslaus XIV., and, on
                    his death without issue in 1637, Brandenburg laid claim to the duchy in virtue
                    of a compact of 1571. The Swedes, however, had in the meantime occupied the
                    country, and at the peace of Westphalia (1648) the elector had to content
                    himself with East Pomerania and see the other half awarded to Sweden. In 1720
                    Swedish Pomerania was curtailed by extensive concessions to Prussia, but the
                    district to the west of the Peene remained in possession of Sweden down to the
                    dissolution of the German empire. On the downfall of Napoleon, Sweden assigned
                    her German possessions to Denmark in exchange for Norway, whereupon Prussia,
                    partly by purchase and partly by the cession of Lauenburg, finally succeeded in
                    uniting the whole of Pomerania under her sway.</p>
