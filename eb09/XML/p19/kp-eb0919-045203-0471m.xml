                    London, where his father made a fortune in trade. He entered Trinity College,
                    Cambridge, at the age of sixteen, but took no degree, his course being
                    interrupted by severe pulmonary attacks which compelled a prolonged residence
                    abroad. His travels extended from Lisbon to Constantinople and the Nile, and
                    were turned to account for astronomical observation. In 1800 he settled at
                    Westbury near Bristol, and began to determine star-places with a fine altitude
                    and azimuth circle of 2∣ feet diameter by Troughton. His demonstration in 1806
                    <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.,</hi> xcvi. 420) of a change of form in the
                    Greenwich mural quadrant led to the introduction of astronomical circles at the
                    Royal Observatory, and to his own appointment as its head. Elected a fellow of
                    the Royal Society, February 26, 1807, he married and went to live in London in
                    the same year, and in 1811 succeeded Maskelyne as astronomer-royal.</p>
                <p>During an administration of nearly twenty-five years, Pond effected a reform of
                    practical astronomy in England comparable to that effected by Bessel in Germany.
                    In 1821 he began to employ the method of observation by reflexion; and in 1825
                    he devised means (see <hi rend="italic">Mem. R. A. Soc.,</hi> ii. 499) of
                    combining two mural circles in the determination of the place of a single
                    object, the one serving for direct and the other for reflected vision. (By an
                    invention of Airy’s, the same object is now attained with one instrument.)
                    During Pond’s term of office the instrumental equipment at Greenwich was
                    completely changed, and the number of assistants increased from one to six. The
                    superior accuracy of his determinations was due in part to his systematic
                    attention to the errors of his instruments, in part to his plan of multiplying
                    observations. During a prolonged controversy (1810-24), he consistently denied
                    the reality of Brinkley’s imaginary star-parallaxes (see his papers in <hi
                    rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> cviii. 477; cxiii. 53). Delicacy of health
                    impeded his activity, and compelled his retirement in the autumn of 1835. He
                    died at Blackheath, September 7, 1836, and was buried beside Halley in the
                    churchyard of Lee. The Copley medal was conferred upon him in 1823, and the
                    Lalande prize in 1817 by the Paris Academy, of which he was a corresponding
                    member. He published eight folio volumes of <hi rend="italic">Greenwich
                    Observations,</hi> translated Laplace’s <hi rend="italic">Système</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Monde</hi> (in 2 vols. 8vo., 1809), and contributed thirty-one
                    papers to scientific collections. His catalogue of 1112 stars (1833) was of
                    great value.</p>
