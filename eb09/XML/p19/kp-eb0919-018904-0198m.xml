                    METALS. The metals platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir),
                    ruthenium (Ru), and osmium (Os) are united into a family by a striking
                    similarity in chemical characters and by their association in natural
                    occurrence. A rather rare ore, called platinum ore or polyxene, is almost the
                    only native material which is available for their extraction; it contains them
                    all in the reguline form. <hi rend="italic">Traces</hi> of platinum are found in
                    almost all native gold.</p>
                <p>As early as the first half of the 16th century it appears to have been noticed
                    that the gold ore in the Spanish mines of Darien includes grains of a white
                    metal, endowed with the qualities of a noble metal and yet distinctly different
                    from silver; but the fact remained unknown in Europe because the Spanish
                    Government, having found out that the new metal lent itself most admirably for
                    the adulteration of gold, prohibited its exportation. Only from about the middle
                    of last century did the metal begin to find its way to Europe and to become
                    known there, at first as a curiosity, under its Spanish name of “platina del
                    Pinto” (the little silver from the river Pinto). Its chemical individuality and
                    qualities were established by the successive labours of Scheffer (1752),
                    Marggraft (1757), Bergmann (1777), and others. An amateur, Count von Sickingen,
                    it appears, was the first who succeeded in working<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0199-0190"/> the metal (1772); the first platinum crucible was
                    produced by Λchard (1784). Achard’s mode of rendering the native metal amenable
                    to mechanical working was founded upon the fact that it forms a readily fusible
                    alloy with arsenic, from which the latter can be driven off again by intense
                    heating. This method was worked industrially for a time, but subsequently
                    superseded by another superior process, which is usually credited to Wollaston,
                    because it was he who, after having wrought it as a rich source of revenue for
                    years, published it in 1828. But as early as 1800 Knight of London had published
                    all that is essential in the process; and Messrs Johnson, Matthey, &amp; Co.
                    inform the writer that Wollaston obtained the secrets of both the refining and
                    the compressing of the spongy into compact metal from a relative of theirs,
                    Thomas Cock, who, they are convinced, is the true inventor. Undisputed merits of
                    Wollaston’s are his discoveries of palladium (1803) and rhodium (1804). About
                    the same time iridium and osmium were discovered by Smithson Tennant.</p>
                <p>Platinum ore well deserves its cognomen of “polyxene,” because it is a most
                    complex mixture of mineralogical species, including (1) a number of heavy
                    reguline species designated as platinum, osmiridium, iron-platinum,
                    platiniridium, iridium, palladium (also gold), and (2) a number of non-metallic
                    species, notably chrome-iron ore, magnetic oxide of iron, zircone, corundum, and
                    occasionally also diamond. The reguline components always form detached
                    granules, which are generally small, but occasionally assume considerable
                    dimensions. The Demidoff museum contains a native platinum lump weighing 21
                    pounds troy. The ore, as already stated, was discovered first in South America;
                    it is found there chiefly in the provinces of Choco and Barbacos, New Granada,
                    and also in Brazil. It occurs besides in San Domingo, in California, at the
                    Rogue river in Oregon, in Canada, and in the island of Borneo. But the richest
                    deposits are those of the Ural Mountains; these were discovered about 1823, and
                    have been wrought by the Russian Government since about 1828. Part at least of
                    the Ural ore, as Daubré showed, was embedded originally with chrome-iron in a
                    serpentine derived from olivine. The very variable percentages of the several
                    components range approximately as follows :—platinum, 60 to 87; other polyxene
                    metals 3 to 7; gold up to 2 and more; iron 4 to 12; copper 0 to 4; non-metallic
                    gangue 1 to 3.</p>
                <p>Platinum, though a noble metal chemically, has too modest an appearance to lend
                    itself much to the jeweller’s purposes. The Russian Government used, for a
                    while, to strike platinum coins, but soon came to give up the practice on
                    account of the immense fluctuations in the commercial value of the metal. Almost
                    all the platinum produced now-a-days is made into chemical utensils. Platinum,
                    in fact, is the metal of the chemist. “Without platinum crucibles, which share
                    the infusibility of porcelain with the chemical inertness of gold ones the
                    composition of most minerals could not have been ascertained” (Liebig), and
                    chemistry generally could not have come up to its present level. In industrial
                    chemistry platinum is used chiefly for the construction of those stills for the
                    concentration of oil of vitriol which, although a single one costs a fortune,
                    are cheaper in the long run than glass retorts.</p>
                <p>The technical extraction of platinum from its ore is to the present day effected
                    everywhere by some modification or other of the so-called “Wollaston” process.
                    Heraeus of Hanau operates as follows. The ore is digested within glass retorts
                    in aqua regia diluted with three times its weight of water, an over-pressure of
                    some 12 inches of water being established within the retorts to accelerate the
                    process, which always takes several days. The whole of the osmiridium, along
                    with more or less of other polyxene metals, and the “sand” (corundum,
                    chrome-iron, &amp;c.) remain undissolved, as a heavy black deposit; the
                    platinum, palladium, part of the rhodium, and more or less of the other three
                    polyxene metals pass into solution, the platinum, iridium, and palladium as
                    tetrachlorides. From the clarified solution the whole (almost) of the platinum
                    can be precipitated as PtCl <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi> (NH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> by addition of a large
                    excess of sal-ammoniac; and this simple process used to be adopted formerly. But
                    the precipitate then includes much chloro-iridiate of ammonium lrCl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> β</hi> (NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> and other impurities. Heraeus, therefore, first evaporates to dryness and
                    heats the residue to 125° C. for a sufficient time, to reduce the palladic and
                    iridic chlorides to the lower stages of PdCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and lr
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, which form soluble
                    double salts with sal-ammoniac. The heated residue is dissolved in water
                    acidulated with hydrochloric acid, the solution filtered, and mixed with hot
                    concentrated solution of sal-ammoniac, when a (relatively) pure chloroplatinate
                    comes down as a yellow’ precipitate (the iridium compound is dark-red), which is
                    washed, first with saturated sal-ammoniac solution, then with dilute
                    hydrochloric acid. The precipitate needs only be exposed to a dull red heat to
                    be converted into “spongy platinum,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> metallic
                    platinum in the form of a grey porous mass. As platinum is infusible even at the
                    highest temperature producible in a windfurnace, the spongy metal cannot be
                    fused together into a regulus like an ordinary metal; but it shares with wrought
                    iron the rare quality of assuming a high degree of softness and viscosity at a
                    strong red heat; and consequently the sponge, after a preliminary compression by
                    purely mechanical means, needs only be exposed to a strong heat to “frit” into a
                    coherent mass; and this mass, by repeated forging at a wdιite heat is readily
                    made into a perfectly homogeneous compact bar, which, as the metal is very
                    ductile, is easily rolled out into sheet or drawn into wire. In the former form
                    more especially it goes into the workshop to be made into utensils.</p>
                <p>This process of welding at the time of Achard (who used it first) and of Knight
                    was a necessary make-shift; but it is singular that it was retained long after
                    the invention of the oxyhydrogen blast (see vol. xviii. p. 105), by means of
                    which platinum can be fused as easily as lead can in an ordinary fire. With the
                    oxyhydrogen-blowpipe Hare, as early as 1847, fused 970 grammes (upwards of two
                    pounds) of platinum into one regulus. Yet platinum manufacturers did not utilize
                    this obvious process until Deville and Debray, in 1859, again demonstrated its
                    practicability. Their furnace is of the simplest description. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> flat pieces of quicklime, scooped out so as to
                    represent two cupels, are placed one upon the other so that they enclose a flat
                    space similar in form to two superimposed soup-plates. The lower cupel has a
                    notch cut out of its side to serve as a spout for pouring out the liquefied
                    metal, the upper and shallower one is pierced with a central slightly conical
                    round hole through which the (platinum) nozzle of the blowpipe enters, so that
                    the flame flattens itself out on the introduced metal. By means of this simple
                    contrivance Deville and Debray had no difficulty in fusing as much as twelve
                    kilogrammes of platinum into one regulus; and Messrs Johnson, Matthey, &amp; Co.
                    of London now think nothing of fusing up as much as 1000 ounces of metal in one
                    operation. A regulus made under Mr Geo. Matthey’s superintendence for the metric
                    commission in Paris in 1874 weighed one quarter of a ton.</p>
                <p>The shaping of compact platinum is effected pretty much in the same way as that
                    of gold or silver; only the difficulties are less because platinum, unlike the
                    two ordinary noble metals, is susceptible of “welding”; <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> two pieces of the metal, at a white heat, can be united into one by
                    a stroke of the hammer. Soldering is rarely necessary; it used to be effected
                    (and still is occasionally) by means of gold as a connecting medium and an
                    ordinary blowpipe. But platinum workers, following the lead of Messrs Johnson,
                    Matthey, &amp; Co., have long learned to unite two .platinum seams by the ‘ ‘
                    autogenic” process—the local fusing of the two contiguous-parts in the
                    oxyhydrogen flame.</p>
                <p>For the preparation of chemically pure platinum Schneider’s process is the one
                    most easily executed and explained. The commercial metal is dissolved in aqua
                    regia and the excess of nitric acid removed by evaporation to a syrup in a
                    water-bath. The residue is redissolved in water and boiled for a long time with
                    a large excess of potash-free caustic soda. If care be taken to maintain a
                    strong alkaline reaction, all the foreign polyxene chlorides are reduced to
                    lower forms than that of tetrachloride; while only the platinum itself retains
                    this state of combination. The hypochlorite formed is then reduced (to NaCl) by
                    addition of a little alcohol to the boiling alkaline liquid, which is now
                    allowed to cool and acidified strongly with hydrochloric acid so as to
                    re&lt;lissolve any hydrated platinic oxide which may have been precipitated by
                    the first instalments of acid. The liquid at last is filtered, and precipitated
                    by sal-ammoniac to obtain a <hi rend="italic">pure</hi> chloroplatinate (PtCl
                    <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi> (NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), which, on ignition, of course, yields an equally pure
                    spongy metal.</p>
                <p>Pure compact platinum is a tin-white metal about as soft as pure copper and
                    neatly (but not quite) equal in plasticity to gold. The specific gravity of the
                    fused metal is 21 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 48 to 21 '50 at 17° <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 C. (Deville and Debray). The breaking strain is 34
                    1 kilos for hard-drawn and 23 5 kilos for annealed wires; the modulus of
                    elasticity 15,518 (kilogramme and millimetre as units; by Werthum’s
                    experiments<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0200-0191"/> on annealed welded wire). Unit length of the
                    (fused) metal expands by 0’000907 from 0° to 100° C. (Fizean). The specific
                    conductivity for heat at 12° C. is 8’4, for electricity at 0° C. 16 '4 (silver =
                    100). The statement regarding electricity refers to the annealed metal. The
                    fusing point, according to recent determination by Violle, is 1779 C.; the same
                    experimenter finds for the true specific heat δQ∕δi = OO317 + 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 000012i (centigrade scale). When platinum is heated
                    beyond its fusing point, it soon begins to volatilize. The fused metal, like
                    silver, absorbs oxygen, and consequently “spits” on freezing. At a red heat the
                    then viscid metal, as Graham has shown, “occludes” hydrogen gas; <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it dissolves the gas (just as, for instance, liquid
                    water would), which explains the fact previously discovered by Deville that a
                    platinum tube, although it may be perfectly gas-tight in the cold, at a red heat
                    allows hydrogen (but not, for instance, oxygen, nitrogen, or carbonic acid) to
                    pass through its walls. According to Graham the quantity of gas occluded is
                    independent of the surface of the metal operated on, but proportional to its
                    weight. No gas is taken up in the cold; but the gas occluded at a red heat,
                    though extractable at that temperature by means of an absolute vacuum as
                    producible by a Sprengel pump (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mercurial Air Pump,</hi>
                    vol. xvi. p. -"' '. is retained on cooling and cannot be thus liberated at the
                    ordinary temperature. The volume of hydrogen absorbed by unit-volume of metal at
                    a red heat under one atmosphere’s pressure was found, in the case of fused
                    metal, to vary from 0 ’ 13 to 0’21 volume measured cold; in the case of merely
                    welded metal, from 2 ’34 to 3’8 volumes (compare <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palladium</hi> below). Oxygen gas, though absorbed by the liquid, is not
                    occluded by the solid metal at any temperature, but when brought in contact with
                    it at moderate temperatures suffers considerable condensation at its surface.
                    The thin condensed film of oxygen exhibits a high degree of chemical activity: a
                    perfectly clean piece of platinum foil, when immersed in a mixture of hydrogen
                    or ammonia or other combustible gas and air, begins to glow and starts a process
                    of slow combustion or there may be an explosion. The spongy metal of course
                    exhibits a very high degree of activity: a jet of hydrogen gas when made to
                    strike against a layer of spongy platinum causes it to glow and takes fire. This
                    is the principle of the (now defunct) Döbereiner lamp. But the most striking
                    effects are produced by a peculiar kind of very finely divided platinum, which
                    was discovered by Liebig and called by him platinum black on account of its
                    resemblance to lamp-black. A particularly active “black” is produced by dropping
                    platinum chloride solution into a boiling mixture of three volumes of glycerin
                    and two of caustic potash of 1Ό8 specific gravity. Platinum black, according to
                    Liebig, absorbs 800 times its volume of oxygen from the air, and in virtue
                    thereof is a most active oxidizing agent, which, in general, acts
                    “catalytically” because the black, after having given up its oxygen to the
                    oxidizable substance present, at once takes up a fresh supply from the
                    atmosphere. For examples see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fermentation,</hi> vol. ix.

                <p><hi rend="italic">Platinum Alloys.</hi></p>
                <p>Platinum alloys of almost any kind are easily produced synthetically; and, as a
                    rule, a temperature little if at all above the fusing point of the more fusible
                    component suffices to start the union. We will begin with the cases in which the
                    metal combines with auother member of its own family. <hi rend="italic"

                    platinum, but it is less fusible," harder, more elastic, specifically heavier,
                    and less readily attacked by aqua regia,—all these qualities increasing as the
                    percentage of iridium increases. The 19 per cent, alloy was produced for the
                    first time by G. Matthey. It has the hardness and elasticity of soft steel
                    (modulus of elasticity = 22,000 for millimetre and kilogramme), and is hardly
                    attacked by aqua regia. Alloys richer in iridium are difficult to work. The 10
                    per cent, alloy on the other hand still retains enough of the virtues referred
                    to to be far superior to platinum itself—perhaps we might say, to any other
                    solid—as a material for standard measures of length or weight. In 1870 Messrs
                    Johnson, Matthey, &amp; Co. exhibited a standard metre made of this alloy, and
                    it gave such unqualified satisfaction that the international metric committee
                    which sat in Paris some years ago adopted it for the construction of their
                    standards. <hi rend="italic">Rhodium.—</hi> An alloy of 30 per cent, of this
                    metal and 70 of platinum is absolutely proof against aqua regia, but is verv
                    expensive. Deville and Debray once elaborated an igneous process for producing,
                    directly from the ore, a triple alloy of platinum, iridium, and rhodium, which
                    is quite workable and, besides being more highly infusible than platinum, is
                    almost proof against aqua regia. Crucibles made of this alloy used to be sold in
                    Paris and elsewhere at moderate prices; but they are now no longer to be had.
                    <hi rend="italic">Gold.</hi> —This metal unites with platinum in all
                    proportions, forming greyish-yellow or greyish-white alloys. A graduated series
                    of these alloys was recommended by Schertel and Ehrhard as a means for defining
                    certain ranges of high temperatures. According to their experiments, while the
                    fusing-point for gold was 1075° C., and for platinum 1775°, it was 1130° for 10
                    per cent, of platinum, 1190° for 20, 1255° for 30, 1320° for 40, 1385° for 50,
                    1460° for 60, 1535° for 70, 1610° for 80, and 1690° for 90 per cent. <hi
                    rend="italic">Silver</hi> and platinum unite readily in any proportion, but the
                    alloys are in general liable to “liquation” (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Metals,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 67). Now platinum is as proof against nitric acid as
                    gold; and yet these alloys cannot, like gold-silver, be parted by means of
                    nitric acid; because, if the alloy is rich enough in silver to be at all
                    attacked by the acid, part at least of the platinum passes into solution along
                    with the silver. But concentrated oil of vitriol effects a sharp separation; the
                    platinum remains. A considerable variety of alloys of platinum with other noble
                    metals are used in mechanical dentistry. The following examples may be quoted
                    :—667 percent. of gold and 33 of platinum; platinum 50, silver 25, palladium 25;
                    platinum 417, gold 25, palladium 33’3.</p>

                <p>Platinum is not changed by air, water. or steam at any temperature. It is proof
                    against the action of all ordinary single acids, including hydrofluoric, in the
                    heat or cold. Aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids) dissolves
                    it slowly as chloroplatinic acid PtCl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. The metal is not attacked by even very strong boiling
                    caustic potash or soda ley, nor is it changed by fusion with carbonate of soda
                    or potash. Carbonate of lithia, and the hydrates of potash, soda, and baryta,
                    however, when fused in platinum vessels, attack them strongly, with formation of
                    compounds of PtO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> with the respective bases.
                    According to recent experiments by the writer, none of these reactions go on in
                    the absence of air; hence, for instance, a fusion with caustic baryta or potash
                    can safely be earned out in a platinum crucible if the latter is protected by an
                    atmosphere of hydrogen or nitrogen. Fused hepar (alkaline sulphide) dissolves
                    platinum at a red heat; so does fused cyanide of potassium, especially if mixed
                    with caustic potash.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chloroplatinic Acid.—</hi> The solution of the metal in aqua
                    regia is evaporated down repeatedly in a water bath with hydrochloric acid to
                    destroy the excess of nitric acid and the very concentrated solution allowed to
                    stand, when the acid gradually separates out in brown-red deliquescent crystals
                    of the composition PtClθH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 6H <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 2</hi> O, which are abundantly soluble in water and also easily in even strong
                    alcohol. The aqueous solution, if free of iridium and platinous chlorides, is of
                    a rich but clear yellow colour free of any tinge of brown. The “chloride of
                    platinum” solution of the analyst is an aqueous solution of this acid. When the
                    solution is mixed with those of certain chlorides, the 2HC1 are displaced by
                    their equivalent of metallic chloride, and metallic “chloroplatinates” are
                    produced. Of these the potassium (rubidium and caesium) and the ammonium salts
                    are most easily prepared,—by addition of the respective chlorides to a
                    moderately strong solution of chloroplatinic acid; they come down almost
                    completely as pale yellow crystalline precipitates, little soluble in cold water
                    and very nearly insoluble in alcohol. The sodium salt PtCl <hi rend="subscript">

                    aqueous alcohol (the Li <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-compound dissolves even in
                    absolute alcohol); hence “chloride of platinum” is used for the separation of K,
                    NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, Rb, Cs from Na and Li. On the other hand
                    chloride of potassium or ammonium may serve as a precipitant for platinum, but
                    in this case a large excess of a concentrated solution of the precipitant must
                    be used to bring the solubility of the chloroplatinate precipitate to its
                    minimum. Gold, copper, iron, and many other metals not belonging to the polyxene
                    group, if present, remain dissolved. Real <hi rend="italic">ρlatinic
                    chloride,</hi> PtCl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, can be produced from the acid

                    precipitating from its solution the chlorine of the 2HC1 by the exact equivalent

                    even in the heat; but the finely-divided metal, at some temperature below 800°

                <p>For this the residues obtained in the industrial extraction of platinum from the

                    part of the ore which resisted the action of aqua regia (we will call it the
                    osmiridium residue), and (2) the filtrate from the chloroplatinate of
                    ammonia.</p>
                <p>1. Part of the osmiridium in the first residue consists of scales or grains so
                    hard that they cannot be powdered even in a steel mortar. They must be reduced
                    to a fine powder, which is best done by fusing them up with eight to ten parts
                    of zinc and then driving off the “solvent” in a wind-furnace. The osmiridium
                    remains as a dark friable mass, which is easily powdered and incorporated with
                    the originally sifted-off part. The disintegration of the residue may then be
                    effected, according to Wöhler, by mixing it with its own weight of common salt
                    and exposing the mixture to a current of chlorine at a dull red heat within a
                    combustion tube. If the chlorine is moist much of the osmium goes off as vapour
                    of tetroxide, which must be collected in solution of caustic potash. After
                    complete chlorination the contents of the tube are treated with water, when as a
                    rule some undisintegrated osmiridium remains which is filtered off. The solution
                    is mixed with nitric acid and distilled as long as any osmic tetroxide vapours
                    are going off, which are readily recognized by their powerful pungent smell, and
                    of course must be carefully collected in caustic potash ley. The residual liquor

                    needs only be heated in hydrogen to be reduced to metal, from which the alkali
                    is now easily removed by washing with water. Such iridium is always contaminated
                    with more or less osmium, ruthenium, rhodium, and platinum, to remove which the
                    crude metal is fused up with ten parts of lead, and the alloy treated with
                    dilute nitric acid to dissolve the bulk of the lead, when the polyxene metals
                    remain in the shape of a black powder. From this the platinum is extracted by
                    prolonged treatment with dilute aqua regia, and from the residue the rhodium by
                    fusion with bisulphate of potash and subsequent treatment with water, which
                    dissolves away the sulphate of rhodium formed. The residue now left is fused in
                    a gold crucible with ten parts of caustic and three of nitrate of potash, when
                    the ruthenium and osmium assume the form of soluble MeO <hi rend="subscript">

                    and thus removed. What remains is an alkaliferous (blue) sesquioxide of iridium,
                    which as a rule still retains some iron, ruthenium, and traces of gold and
                    silica (G. Matthey). For the final purification of the metal and the recovering
                    of the ruthenium and rhodium see G. Matthey’s memoir <hi rend="italic">(Chem.

                <p>The osmium, as already stated, is obtained at an early stage of the process in
                    the shape of a solution of its volatile tetroxide in caustic potash. This
                    solution is mixed with a little alcohol to bring the osmium into the state of

                    in sal-ammoniac. This liquor is kept in contact with metallic iron, when the
                    dissolved polyxene metals, and any gold or copper present, come down as a black
                    heavy precipitate. This precipitate includes all the palladium and part of the
                    rhodium as principal components. Bunsen has worked out an exhaustive method for
                    the extracting of all its polyxene metals in pure forms; but it is too
                    complicated to be reproduced here.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the palladium is to treat the metallic precipitate with aqua regia, which
                    dissolves the palladium and platinum along with some of the iridium and rhodium,
                    to filter, evaporate the residue to a syrup (for bringing the palladium into the
                    form of PdCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), redissolve and precipitate the
                    palladium by addition of the exact quantity of mercuric cyanide as cyanide
                    Pd(NC) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. This cyanide needs only be ignited strongly
                    to leave a residue of metal. But this metal includes at least part of the copper
                    of the original material. To remove it and other impurities, the crude metal is
                    dissolved in hydrochloric acid with the help of free chlorine, and the solution
                    next evaporated to dryness to reduce the PdCl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi

                    redissolved, the solution mixed with enough of ammonia to redissolve the
                    precipitate first produced, and hydrochloric acid gas is now passed into the
                    solution. Yellow palladiochloride of ammonium, PdCl <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>
                    (NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is precipitated,
                    while copper and iron remain dissolved. After removal of the mother liquor the
                    double salt is ignited and thus converted into palladiumsponge, which is easily
                    fused up in the oxyhydrogen flame and thus brought into the form of regulus.</p>

                    rend="italic">Palladium,</hi> a silver-white metal of great ductility, is much
                    used, notwithstanding its high price, in mechanical dentistry and occasionally
                    also for the graduated limbs of theodolites and other instruments, because,
                    unlike silver, it remains bright in sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>
                <p>Of all the properties of this metal the most remarkable is its extraordinary
                    power of “occluding” hydrogen. According to Graham (to whom we owe almost all
                    our knowledge on the subject) the compact metal when immersed in <hi
                    rend="italic">cold</hi> hydrogen gas takes up none or at most very little of it;
                    but at higher temperatures very considerable occlusions take place. A certain
                    specimen of foil was found to occlude 526 volumes of the gas at 245° C., and 643
                    at 90° to 97° C., measured at 17°'5 to 18° and one atmosphere’s pressure, per
                    unit-volume of metal. The hydrogen, as in the case of platinum, is retained on
                    cooling, and from the cold compound cannot be extracted by means of an absolute
                    vacuum, which reextracts the gas at a red heat.</p>
                <p>Far more striking results can be obtained by using palladium as a negative pole
                    in the electrolysis of (acidulated) water. The coefficient of occlusion then
                    assumes very high values; in Graham’s hands it attained its maximum when the
                    palladium'was produced electrolytically from a 1 ’ 6 per cent, solution of its
                    chloride, and thus hydrogenized while itself in the nascent state. The
                    galvanically deposited sheet ¼ ’ as found to contain 982 volumes of hydrogen
                    (measured cold) per unit-volume of original metal, corresponding approximately
                    to the formula Pd <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    for the compound. When palladium unites with (nascent or free) hydrogen it
                    suffers a very appreciable expansion which on the removal of the hydrogen is
                    followed by a contraction beyond the original volume of the plain metal. This
                    can be most beautifully illustrated by electrolysing water in an apparatus in
                    which the negative electrode consists of a long strip of palladium-foil of which
                    one side is covered over with varnish or electrolytically deposited platinum.
                    The hydrogen goes in at the bare side of the electrode; this side consequently
                    expands more strongly than the other and the originally straight strip of metal
                    becomes curved. When the current is reversed, hydrogen bubbles at once rise from
                    what is now the negative pole, but the oxygen due at the palladium plate is for
                    a time taken up by the hydrogen occluded there; this hydrogen is gradually
                    consumed, and as it diminishes the plate unbends more and more completely and at
                    last gets bent over in the opposite sense. Palladium by being hydrogenized does
                    not lose any of its metallic properties, but (in tlιe case of complete
                    saturation) its density sinks from 12 38 to 1179, its tenacity to 82 per cent,
                    of its original value, its electric conductivity in the ratio of 8 1 to 5‘9.</p>
                <p>Graham views hydrogenized palladium as a true alloy, containing its hydrogen in
                    the form of a metal “hydrogenium.” He found that certain palladium alloys take
                    up hydrogen as readily (though less abundantly) as the pure metal does with
                    corresponding expansion, but when dehydrogenized shrink back into exactly their
                    original volume. He calculated that the density of hydrogenium lies somewhere
                    about the value 0733 (water=l),—which of course means only that the weight of
                    the occluded hydrogen, measured by the weight of a volume of water equal to the
                    expansion observed, is =0733. Dewar arrived at 0'620 as being probably nearer
                    the truth, and for* the specific heat of hydrogenium found values from 379 to
                    5∙88.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Osmium.—</hi> According to Deville and Debray, powdery osmium
                    is most readily obtained by mixing the vapour of the tetroxide with that gas (CO
                    + CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) which is prepared by the decomposition of
                    oxalic acid with oil of vitriol, and passing the mixture through a red-hot
                    porcelain tube. The powdery metal readily fuses up with 3 or 4 parts of tin into
                    a homogeneous alloy. When this alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid most of
                    the tin dissolves, and the rest of it can be driven off by heating the residue
                    in HC1 gas. There remains ultimately pure osmium in the form of blue crystals
                    endowed with a grey to violet reflex, which are hard enough to scratch glass.
                    Their specific gravity is 22'48, so that osmium, besides being the most
                    infusible of metals, is the heaviest of all known bodies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Osmiridium.—</hi> Native osmiridium forms crystalline
                    plate-shaped grains, distinguished by an extraordinary degree of hardness, which
                    certainly exceeds that of hard-tempered steel. Most of the grains are very
                    minute; the larger ones are utilized for making the so-called “diamond points”
                    of gold pens. Osmiridium would lend itself for endless other applications if it
                    were possible to unite the native dust into large compact masses. From a series
                    of articles in the <hi rend="italic">Chemical News</hi> (Jan. 2, 9, and 16,
                    1885), by Nelson W. Perry, it would appear that this problem has been solved, in
                    a sense. John Holland, an American pen-maker, starting from the long-known fact
                    that platinum metals readily unite with phosphorus into relatively easily
                    fusible alloys, succeeded in producing a phosphorized osmiridium which can be
                    cast (and pressed while liquid) into thin continuous slabs even harder than the
                    native substance, and susceptible of being wrought into drills, knife-edges,

                    1845, amounted to 2623'8 kilogrammes per annum. In 1870 it was only 2005'8
                    kilos, of which about 80 per cent, came from the Ural Mountains.<note

                <p>The manufacture of platinum utensils is in the hands of a very few firms, of
                    which that of Messrs Johnson, Matthey, &amp; Co. of London is generally
                    understood to be the most important. Even the total amount of metal which passes
                    through these works in the aggregate is difficult of ascertainment, the more so
                    as some of them at least are discounting large reserves of old metal, including
                    more or less of the obsolete coins. According to an approximate estimate which a
                    very competent authority has kindly furnished, the consumption during the last
