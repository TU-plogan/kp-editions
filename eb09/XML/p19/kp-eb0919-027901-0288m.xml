                    (1781-1840) a celebrated French mathematician, was born at Pithiviers in the
                    department of Loiret, on the 21st June 1781. His father, Siméon Poisson, served
                    as a common soldier in the Hanoverian wars; but, disgusted by the ill treatment
                    he received from his patrician officers, he deserted. About the time of the
                    birth of his son Siméon Denis he occupied a small administrative post at
                    Pithiviers, and seems to have been at the head of the local government of the
                    place during the revolutionary period. The infant Poisson was put out to nurse,
                    and concerning his nursing Arago relates the following story, which he had from
                    its hero himself. One day the anxious father went to visit his son, but found
                    that the nurse had gone to the fields. Impatient, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0289-0280"/> he broke into the cottage, and there saw, with
                    painful astonishment, the object of all his hopes suspended by a small cord to a
                    nail fixed in the wall. This was a precaution on the part of the peasant nurse
                    to prevent her charge from perishing under the teeth of the carnivorous and
                    unclean animals that circulated in the house. Poisson, in telling the story,
                    added—·“A gymnastic effort carried me incessantly from one side of the vertical
                    to the other; and it was thus, in my tenderest infancy, that I made my prelude
                    to those studies on the pendulum that were to occupy so much of my maturer
                    age.”</p>
                <p>Having survived the perils of infancy, and received the elements of his education
                    (reading and writing) from his father, the question arose what calling he was to
                    follow. It was at first suggested that he should be made a notary; but the
                    family council, with amusing irony, decided that this profession made too great
                    demands upon the intellect, and surgery was preferred. He was sent to an uncle
                    who exercised this art at Fontainebleau, and forthwith began to take lessons in
                    bleeding and blistering, then the leading branches of a surgeon’s practice. To
                    train him in the former, he was set to prick the veins of cabbage leaves with a
                    lancet, but made little progress; how he sped in the latter he himself relates
                    as follows :—“Once my uncle sent me, with one of my comrades. Μ. Vanneau, now
                    established in the colonies, to put a blister on the arm of a child; the next
                    day, when I presented myself to remove the apparatus, I found the child dead;
                    this event, very common they say, made the most profound impression upon me; and
                    I declared at once that I would never be either physician or surgeon. Nothing
                    could shake my resolution, and they sent me back to Pithiviers.” Here accident
                    and the bent of nature solved the problem that had passed the wisdom of the
                    family council. The elder Poisson, being .a Government official, received a copy
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">École
                    Polytechnique</hi>; the son read it, and soon began unaided to solve the
                    problems propounded there from time to time; and thus his mathematical talent
                    was discovered. He was sent to the École Centrale of Fontainebleau, and was
                    fortunate in having a kind and sympathetic teacher, Μ. Billy, who, when he
                    speedily found that his pupil was becoming his master, devoted himself to the
                    study of higher mathematics in order to follow and appreciate him, and predicted
                    his future fame by the punning quotation from Lafontaine<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This prediction is sometimes attributed to
                    Laplace.</p></note> —</p>
                <p>“Petit Poisson deviendra grand Pourvu que Dieu lui prête vie.”</p>
                <p>At the age of seventeen the young provincial, less remarkable for the elegance of
                    his attire than for the profundity of his scientific knowledge, came up to Paris
                    to undergo the entrance examination for the Polytechnic School He passed first
                    in his year, and immediately began to attract the notice of the professors of
                    the school, who, seeing his obvious genius, excused him from the ordinary
                    drudgery of the curriculum, and left him free to follow the studies of his
                    predilection. The wisdom of this course was soon proved; for, in 1800, less than
                    two years after his entry, he published two memoirs, one on Bezout’s method of
                    elimination, the other on the number of integrals of an equation of finite
                    differences. The latter of these memoirs was examined by Lacroix and Legendre,
                    who recommended that it should be published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Recueil</hi><hi rend="italic">des Savants</hi><hi rend="italic">Étrangers,</hi>
                    an unparalleled honour for a youth of eighteen. This success at once procured
                    for Po⅛son an entry into the Parisian scientific society of the day, the like of
                    which for brilliancy has never elsewhere been seen. Its two kings both
                    patronized him. Lagrange, whose lectures on the theory of functions he attended
                    at the Polytechnic School, early recognized his talent, and became his friend;
                    while Laplace, in whose footsteps Poisson followed, regarded him almost as his
                    son. The rest of his career, till his death on the 25th of April 1840, was
                    almost entirely occupied in the composition and publication of his many works,
                    and in discharging the duties of the numerous educational offices to which he
                    was successively appointed. Immediately after finishing his course at the
                    Polytechnic School he was appointed repetiteur there, an office which he had
                    discharged as an amateur while still a pupil in the school; for it had been the
                    custom of his comrades often to resort to his room after an unusually difficult
                    lecture to hear him repeat and explain it. He was made professeur suppléant in
                    1802, and full professor in succession to Fourier in 1806. In 1808 he became
                    astronomer to the Bureau des Longitudes; and, when the Faculté des Sciences was
                    instituted in 1809, he was appointed Professeur de la Mécanique Rationelle. He
                    further became member of the Institute in 1812, examiner at the military school
                    at St Cyr in 1815, leaving examiner at the Polytechnic in 1816, councillor of
                    the university in 1820, and geometer to the Board of Longitude in succession to
                    Laplace in 1827.</p>
                <p>In 1817 he married Mademoiselle Nancy de Bardi, daughter of a French family which
                    had emigrated to England, and by her he had two sons and two daughters.</p>
                <p>Poisson was a simple-minded affectionate man. This is seen in the close relations
                    which he kept up with his old teacher Μ. Billy, who ardently loved and admired
                    his former pupil, and whose presence at the Institute was a well-known sign that
                    Poisson was to read a paper there. Although he never returned to Pithiviers
                    after his entry into the Polytechnic School, he corresponded constantly with his
                    parents, more especially with his mother; and he regularly sent copies of his
                    memoirs to his father, who read and re-read with unwearied patience the parts of
                    them within his comprehension. His tastes seem to have been of the simplest
                    description; he took little exercise, and he had more than a Frenchman’s horror
                    of travelling. Arago says that he only travelled once, and that by medical
                    prescription, disguised under the form of some mission connected with the
                    Polytechnic School, and that, after devoting his savings to the purchase of a
                    beautiful farm in the department of Seine-et-Marne, he never so much as visited
                    it.</p>
                <p>It is probable that his simplicity of character had much to do with his passing
                    apparently quite undisturbed through the stormy time in which he lived, a period
                    in which many men of mark lost their heads, and few such escaped without loss of
                    office and fortune. His father, whose early experiences led him to hate
                    aristocrats, bred him in the stern creed of the first republic. Throughout the
                    empire Poisson faithfully adhered to the family principles, and refused to
                    worship Napoleon. Napoleon, however, never interfered with Poisson’s promotion.
                    He said once himself that he never did anything uselessly, certainly never
                    committed a useless crime; and he was wise enough to see that nothing was to be
                    gained by persecuting the harmless academician, whose fame he doubtless regarded
                    like that of the other savants of France as an apanage of his own glory. When
                    the Bourbons were restored, his hatred against Napoleon led him to become a
                    Legitimist—a conclusion which says more for the simplicity of his character than
                    for the strength or logic of his political creed.</p>
                <p>He was faithful to the Bourbons during the Hundred Days, in fact was with
                    difficulty dissuaded from volunteering to fight in their cause. After the second
                    restoration his fidelity was recognized by his elevation to the dignity of baron
                    in 1825; but he never either took out his <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0290-0281"/> diploma or used the title. The revolution of July
                    1830 threatened him with the loss of all his honours; but this disgrace to the
                    Government of Louis Philippe was adroitly averted by Arago, who, while his <hi
                    rend="superscript"> u</hi> revocation” was being plotted by the council of
                    ministers, procured him an invitation to dine at the Palais Royale, where he was
                    openly and effusively received by the citizen king, who “remembered” him. After
                    this, of course, his degradation was impossible; he was left in undisturbed
                    possession of all his well-earned appointments; and seven years later he was
                    made a peer of France, not for political reasons, but as a representative of
                    French science.</p>
                <p>As a teacher of mathematics Poisson is said to have been more than ordinarily
                    successful, as might have been expected from his early promise as a repetiteur
                    at the Polytechnic School. As a scientific worker his activity has rarely if
                    ever been equalled. Notwithstanding his many official duties, he found time to
                    publish more than three hundred works, several of them extensive treatises, and
                    many of them memoirs dealing with the most abstruse branches of pure and applied
                    mathematics. There are two remarks of his, or perhaps two versions of the same
                    remark, that explain how he accomplished so much: one, “La vie n’est bonne qu’ à
                    deux choses—à faire des mathématiques et à les professer;” the other, “La vie
                    c’est le travail.”</p>
                <p>A list of Poisson’s works, drawn up by himself, is given at the end of Arago’s
                    biography. A lengthened analysis of them would be out of place here, and all
                    that is possible is a brief mention of the more important. There are few
                    branches of mathematics to which he did not contribute something, but it was in
                    the application of mathematics to physical subjects that his greatest services
                    to science were performed. Perhaps the most original, and certainly the most
                    permanent in their influence, were his memoirs on the theory of electricity and
                    magnetism, which virtually created a new branch of mathematical physics. They
                    have been already repeatedly referred to in the articles <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Electricity</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Magnetism</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{q.v.).</hi> Next (perhaps in the opinion of some first) in importance stand
                    the memoirs on celestial mechanics, in which he proved himself a worthy
                    successor to Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs “Sur les
                    inégalités séculaires des moyens mouvements des planètes,’' “Sur la variation
                    des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de mécanique,” both published in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> of the Polytechnic School, 1809; “Sur la
                    libration de la lune,” in <hi rend="italic">Connaiss. d. Temps,</hi> 1821,
                    &amp;c.; and “Sur la mouvement de la terre autour de son centre de gravité,” in
                    <hi rend="italic">Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic">d. l'Acad.,</hi> 1827, &amp;c. In
                    the first of these memoirs Poisson discusses the famous question of the
                    stability of the planetary orbits, which had already been settled by Lagrange to
                    the first degree of approximation for the disturbing forces. Poisson showed that
                    the result could be extended to a second approximation, and thus made an
                    important advance in the planetary theory. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as
                    it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age
                    one of the greatest of his memoirs/viz., that “Sur la théorie des variations des
                    éléments des planètes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs
                    orbites.” So highly did he think of Poisson’s memoir that he made a copy of it
                    with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson
                    made important contributions to the theory of attraction. His well-known
                    correction of Laplace’s partial differential equation for the potential was
                    first published in the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                    Société Philomatique,</hi> 1813. His two most important memoirs on the
                    subjectare “Sur l’attraction des sphéroïdes” <hi rend="italic">(Connaiss. d.
                    Temps,</hi> 1829), and “Sur l’attraction d’un ellipsoïde homogène <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mém. d. l'Acad.,</hi> 1835). In concluding our selection from his
                    physical memoirs we may mention his memoir on the theory of waves <hi
                    rend="italic">{Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic">d. ΓAcad.,</hi> 1825).</p>
                <p>In pure mathematics, his most important works were his series of memoirs on
                    definite integrals, and his discussion of Fourier’s series, which paved the way
                    for the classical researches of Dirichlet and Riemann on the same subject; these
                    are to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> of the Polytechnic School
                    from 1813 to 1823, and in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of the Academy for
                    1823. In addition we may also mention his essay on the calculus of variations
                    (<hi rend="italic">Mem. d. I’Acad.,</hi> 1833), and his memoirs on the
                    probability of the mean results of observations <hi rend="italic">{Connaiss. d.
                    Temps,</hi> 1827, &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>Besides his many memoirs Poisson published a number of treatises, most of which
                    were intended to form part of a great work on mathematical physics, which he did
                    not live to complete. Among these may Ire mentioned his <hi rend="italic">Traité
                    de Mécanique,</hi> 2 vols. 8vo, 1811 and 1833, which was long a standard work;

                    &amp;c. 4to, 1837, all published at Paris.</p>
                <p>Enough has been said to establish Poisson’s fertility as a writer on mathematical
                    subjects, and the question naturally suggests itself, What is his rank among the
                    mathematicians of all ages? Since his own age was more productive of great
                    mathematicians than any other the world has yet seen, it is natural to compare
                    him with his contemporaries, chief among whom were Lagrange and Laplace. In so
                    doing we see at once that, although we cannot seat him alongside of these mighty
                    sovereigns, yet it is impossible to deny him the nearest rank to them in the
                    temple of mathematical fame. In confirmation of this judgment, we cannot do
                    better than quote one of them—“I am old,” said Lagrange to Poisson one day;
                    “during my long intervals of sleeplessness I divert myself by making numerical
                    approximations. Keep this one; it may interest you. Huygens was thirteen years
                    older than Newton, I am thirteen years older than Laplace; D’Alembert was
                    thirty-two years older than Laplace, Laplace is thirty-two years older than
                    you.” Arago, who gives this story, justly remarks that no more delicate way
                    could be conceived of intimating to Poisson his admission into the inner circle
                    of the fraternity of mathematical genius. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g. ch.)</hi></p>
