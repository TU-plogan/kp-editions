                <p><label type="entry">PILGRIMAGE</label>. The word Pilgrimage (derived from the
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">pereger,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e., per-ager,</hi> “one
                    who traverses a region,” through the intermediate forms <hi rend="italic"
                    >peregrinus,</hi><hi rend="italic">pellegrino, pelegriri)</hi> denotes the act
                    of journeying to some place esteemed sacred, for the purpose of discharging a
                    religious obligation, or to obtain some supernatural assistance or benefit. The
                    practice is common to many religions, and mounts back to prehistoric ages. It is
                    ultimately traceable to the nature of tribal religion, in its early form of
                    worship of a deity regarded as purely local in the sphere of his special
                    influence. As community in religious acts was one of the principal ties between
                    members of the same tribe, to the exclusion of outsiders, it would naturally
                    become the rule, and then the duty, of the tribesmen to present themselves at
                    recurrent intervals at the sanctuary of their tribal god. As they scattered away
                    from their own settlement, and became travellers or sojourners amongst aliens,
                    the belief that they were in some sense cut off from the protection of their
                    tribal deity, and subjected to the influence of others in whose worship they had
                    no share, would induce visits from a distance to the seat of their own religion,
                    not merely for the purpose of keeping up their tribal relations, but to
                    propitiate a power which perhaps could not hear supplications addressed from a
                    distance, and would in any case be more ready to hear and answer prayers made in
                    his own special shrine, attended with the appropriate rites performed by his own
                    body of ministers. This latter consideration would operate even in the case of
                    cults directed to the Sun-God, the Moon-Goddess, and the planetary bodies, which
                    could hardly be regarded as localized within earthly boundaries, but might well
                    be supposed more placable in shrines of exceptional splendour and sanctity,
                    officered by a trained and numerous priesthood. And wherever it was believed
                    that the deity not merely responded to prayer, but gave direct answers by omen
                    or by oracle to inquirers, the fréquentation of the prophetic seat would
                    naturally increase. Further, as the political strength of any tribe grew, that
                    would be attributed in a multitude of cases to the superior power of its
                    tutelary god, or, where they worshipped the same deity as their neighbours, to
                    some more acceptable mode of paying that worship, whence the custom would grow
                    of making the principal temple of the most powerful tribe the meeting-place of
                    the confederacy, as well for political deliberation as for the more directly
                    religious purpose of reaffirming the common pact with sacrificial ceremonies.
                    And if the strongest tribe passed from the stage of hegemony to that of
                    sovereignty, whether by cession or by conquest, so becoming the nucleus of a
                    nation or kingdom, the same feelings would operate yet more powerfully,—the
                    subject tribes being either compelled to accept the gods of their conquerors, or
                    voluntarily adopting them from a conviction of their superior might. Certain
                    temples would in this wise become national from having been tribal, and in large
                    empires, such as Egypt and Assyria, would collect worshippers from all the
                    various peoples ruled under a common sceptre. The second stage in the genesis of
                    special sanctuaries is peculiar to religions with a real or supposed historical
                    basis, and takes the form of devotion towards localities which have been the
                    scenes of important events in the lives of personages reverenced in the creeds
                    of those religions. And the third stage, belonging to a much later period than
                    either of the former, when self-consciousness had become more developed, is that
                    where the aim of the pilgrims is primarily subjective, to stir up certain
                    emotions in their own minds, through the means of the associations connected
                    with special localities. But in each and all of these the fundamental underlying
                    thought is the same, the localization of deity, the almost insuperable
                    difficulty which the ideas of omniscience and omnipresence offer to undeveloped
                    intellects.</p>
                <p>It will be convenient, in tracing the history of pilgrimages, to begin with those
                    which belong to the various forms of heathenism, ancient and modern, as
                    pertaining, whatever be their actual date, to an earlier stage of mental
                    evolution than the Jewish, Christian, and Mohammedan ones.</p>
                <p>The first pilgrimages, then, of which we have any trustworthy knowledge, are
                    those of ancient Egypt. The mythology of the Egyptians is even yet but
                    imperfectly understood, but it is at any rate clear that, just as the votaries
                    of Vishnu and of Siva keep apart in modern Hindustan, so the chief deities of
                    the Egyptian pantheon had cults which were as often rival as complementary, and
                    that the emulation of the competing temples took the form of bidding against
                    each other for popular favour by the splendour of their chief yearly festivals.
                    We are obliged to have recourse to Herodotus and Plutarch for information as to
                    the general cycle of feasts nationally observed; for, although local calendars
                    and rubrics of festivals have been discovered in several places, nothing cognate
                    with Ovid’s <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> has yet been found in Egypt. Herodotus
                    notices that, instead of having but one yearly national festival <hi
                    rend="italic">(πavηyvρc&lt;i),</hi> the Egyptians had six, the principal of
                    which was that of Artemis <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> Bast or Sekhet) at
                    Bubastis, to which the pilgrims went in boats crowded with both sexes, playing
                    on castanets and flutes, and singing to this accompaniment. They landed at every
                    town along the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n100/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0100-0091"/> river to perform orgie dances, and at Bubastis
                    itself offered great sacrifices, besides feasting copiously, in particular
                    consuming vast quantities of grape-wine. He states the numbers assembling on
                    this occasion, exclusive of children, to average 700,000. Next to this ranked
                    the festival of Isis at Busiris, attended with ceremonies of mourning, most
                    probably in memory of the sufferings of Osiris. Third in order was the feast of
                    Athene (Neith) at Sais, celebrated at night, with illuminations. Fourth was the
                    festival of the Sun (Ra) at On or Heliopolis; fifth that at Buto in honour of
                    Latona (Buto or Uat). These two were attended with simply sacrificial rites, and
                    there were no symbolical ceremonies in addition. Last came the festival of Ares
                    (Har-tash, the Hertosi of Cedrenus) at Papremis, at which there was a rough
                    tussle, symbolizing war, between the temple-attendants and the pilgrims, in
                    which lives were sometimes lost. There was another high festival, that of Apis
                    at Memphis, not included by Herodotus in his list, perhaps because not of yearly
                    recurrence, besides the much frequented oracle of Ammon at Thebes, whither it
                    had been transferred from Meroe, its first seat in Egypt. And it is noticeable
                    that there was no pilgrimage at all to the most sacred spot in Egypt, the island
                    of Philae, the burial-place of Osiris, because its very sanctity made it “tabu”
                    to lay folk. The mysteries, in like manner, being rigidly confined to a few, did
                    not form an occasion of pilgrimage.</p>
                <p>As regards the great Mesopotamian empires, our knowledge does not yet enable us
                    to say that pilgrimages entered into their religious system, though we may not
                    unreasonably infer so from the size and wealth of several temples, notably those
                    of Ishtar, from the Assyrian custom of imposing their own deities upon conquered
                    nations, and from the example of one great religious assembly from all the
                    provinces of the Babylonian empire, recorded in Daniel iii. There may, perhaps,
                    be indirect proof of Babylonian pilgrimages in what Cyrus states in his
                    cylinder-inscription, namely, that Nabonidus had offended the gods by
                    transporting their images to Babylon, and thus, as it were, making them perform
                    pilgrimage.</p>
                <p>The ancient Zend creed of the Medes and Persians, having no temples for worship,
                    had no pilgrimages; but in its later Mithraic form, the initiation of neophytes
                    by the Magians into the mysteries, through a painful course of purgation
                    (curiously resembling one prevalent in Ireland far within the present century),
                    in a cavern or grotto at Babylon, necessitated a pilgrimage thither on the part
                    of those who desired to become experts; and Lucian has left some account of its
                    rules in his <hi rend="italic">Menippus.</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is probably the source of the Moslem
                    legend of Harût and Marût, the fallen angels chained in a cavern at Babylon, who

                <p>Amongst the Phoenicians there are clear traces of at least two great pilgrimages
                    in honour of Ashtoreth, one to Aphaca (probably the Aphek of Scripture),
                    celebrated for a yearly miracle of a ball of fire appearing on the mountain
                    summit, and thence falling into the sea. The obscene rites for which this temple
                    was infamous led to its destruction by Constantine the Great (Euseb., <hi
                    rend="italic">Vit.</hi><hi rend="italic">Const.,</hi> iii. 56). The other great
                    Ashtoreth pilgrimage was to Hierapolis in Syria, frequented by votaries from all
                    the Semitic races except the Jews. Antioch was also a great centre of this cult,
                    as also of that of Thammuz, but, ^tPictly speaking, there is no proof of a
                    Thammuz pilgrimage, nor of one in honour of Melkarth, though his worship was
                    carried from Tyre, its chief seat, into all the Phoenician colonies, and the
                    famous oracle of his temple at Gades drew crowds of inquirers annually. · In
                    Palestine proper, though the cults of Baal, Ashtoreth, Moloch, Dagon, and
                    Beelzebub were widespread and persistent, and though the name Jericho probably,
                    and Ashtaroth-Karnaim certainly, point to a seat of moon-worship, as Bethshemesh
                    does to one of sunworship, there is no direct evidence of organized pilgrimages
                    to these places.</p>
                <p>In ancient Hellas there were four classes of religious observance more or less
                    cognate with pilgrimage, though not in any case identical therewith. First may
                    be placed the consultation of oracles,—those of Apollo at Delphi, of Zeus at
                    Dodona, of Trophonius at Lebadeia, and of Asclepius at Epidaurus (the last of
                    which was resorted to also for the cure of disease) being the most famous and
                    most frequented, while, outside Greece and its colonies, the oracle of the
                    Libyan Ammon in the desert south of Cyrene was also in much esteem. Next come
                    the four great national festivals and games, the Olympic, Pythian, Nemean, and
                    Isthmian, attended by crowds from all Greek states, not only as attractive
                    shows, but as religious ceremonies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Panhellenic festival at Aegina is omitted, as a mere
                    factitious device of the emperor Hadrian, when classical paganism was dying, and
                    not a real Greek custom.</p></note> Thirdly may be named the more local or
                    tribal festivals, such as the Panathenaea, the feast of the Charites at
                    Orchomenus, that of Hera at Samos, of Aphrodite at Paphos, and of Artemis at
                    Ephesus, which drew together many worshippers besides those who were specially
                    bound to visit the shrines in question. But the closest parallel to the
                    Christian theory of pilgrimage is found in the celebration of the Eleusinian
                    mysteries (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mysteries),</hi> the special likeness of
                    which to pilgrimages of a later day lies in the notion of merit and spiritual
                    benefit, attached to initiation, to the belief that happiness in a future state
                    of existence would be promoted, nay, insured, by admission to the ranks of the
                    mystae.</p>
                <p>The Latin customs bear a certain superficial likeness to the Greek, in that local
                    oracles, such as those of Faunus, of Albunea, of Fortuna, and of the Sibyls,
                    were much frequented; there are traces of great tribal sanctuaries and
                    gatherings, such as the worship of Jupiter Latiaris on the Alban Mount, of more
                    narrowly restricted tribal cults, such as the Julian worship of Vejovis at
                    Bovillae and the Fabian sacrifice to Hercules on the Quirinal, and of at least
                    two temples to which regular pilgrimages seem to have been made—those of Juno
                    Sospita at Lanuvium, and of Vesta (perhaps of all the Penates also) at Lavinium.
                    But, apart from racial and theosophic differences of belief, there was one
                    factor at work in Italy which tended to bring about a wholly different character
                    of popular religion from that which was evolved in Hellas—the overmastering
                    centralization of Rome, and the practical identification of all solemn worship
                    (apart from the rustic ceremonies in honour of minor and little known deities)
                    with the apotheosis of the Republic. Hence, after the chief seat of Roman
                    worship was transferred from the Regia to the Capitol, pilgrimage proper
                    disappeared, for the local gods of each newly absorbed city or state were added
                    to the original triad of Roman gods, and to the other Sabine triad, moved from
                    the Quirinal to the new sanctuary, and it becomes impossible to distinguish
                    clearly between the purely political ceremonies performed in honour of gods
                    viewed primarily as the tutelars of Rome and voluntary resort to the great
                    temple for the personal cult of any particular deity enshrined there. One relic
                    of the older custom seems to have survived till later times, namely, the
                    pilgrimage of Roman women barefoot to the temple of Vesta in the Forum on June 9
                    every year.</p>
                <p>No pilgrimages seem to have been usual in the Teutonic and Slavonic religions,
                    though both had special temples regarded as more sacred than the remainder, and
                    in the case of the latter we know with tolerable accuracy that Kieff, Novgorod,
                    Rethra in Mecklenburg, Karenz, Winneta <pb break="no"

                    Arkona in the isle of Rügen, succeeded one another as the chief seat of the
                    worship of Perun, Lada, Bielbog, and other principal Slavic deities, and were
                    necessarily attended by much larger bodies of worshippers than temples of less
                    account, more thinly officered, and inferior in repute for the learning and
                    prophetic powers of their priests.</p>
                <p>Directing our attention to an entirely different region of the world, we learn
                    that in 1519, when Cortes entered Cholula in Mexico, he found it a great resort
                    of pilgrims to the huge temple of Quetzalcoatl, then of unknown antiquity, as
                    founded by a race earlier than the Aztecs, and built upon a colossal mound,
                    vying in dimensions with the largest pyramids of Egypt. And what is yet more
                    curious, besides this principal shrine, there were subsidiary tribal temples in
                    the city, restricted to the uses of the several allied or kindred nations, who
                    desired to have their own sanctuary in the holy city, precisely as churches of
                    different nationalities are found in Jerusalem and in Rome to-day. And similarly
                    in Peru, the great Temple of the Sun at Cuzco, with its encircling girdle of
                    chapels dedicated to minor deities, was visited by pilgrims from all parts of
                    the empire <hi rend="italic">; nay,</hi> it was even regarded as a misfortune to
                    fail in accomplishing the journey.</p>
                <p>India, however, is above all others the land of pilgrimages, for it has observed
                    them during a longer unbroken period than any other country of which we possess
                    sufficient records, and for frequency and multitude it would be difficult to
                    find any parallel. The most celebrated of them are those to the temple of
                    Jagan-nâth at Puri in Orissa, Benares, Hurd war, Ganga-Sagara, Gangotri,
                    Jumnotri, Prayâga (Allahabad), Râmêswara, Gaya in Behar, and Ayodhya or Oudh.
                    Apart from the motives, common to all pilgrims, of acquiring religious merit or
                    expiating sins, these Indian shrines are frequented for the performance of <hi
                    rend="italic">sraddha</hi> ceremonies in honour of deceased ancestors or as
                    votive acts for the recovery of the sick, or, again, to carry the ashes of
                    deceased kindred to be scattered in the waters of some sacred or purifying
                    river. Every great river in India, with some lakes, tanks, and springs, is
                    regarded as permeated with the divine essence, and as capable of cleansing from
                    all sin. Hence the favourite resorts are river sources and confluences, while
                    Benares, as situated on the Ganges itself, is the holiest spot in Hindustan. The
                    other most frequented shrines are usually associated with the cults of Krishna,
                    Siva, and Râma. All these are exclusively connected with Brahman rites, for the
                    entire extirpation of Buddhism from the Hindu peninsula has prevented any
                    special sacredness from continuing to attach to the scenes of Gautama Buddha’s
                    life (though the Buddhists allege that the sanctity of Benares is due to its
                    having been the residence of Buddha himself and the scene of his earliest
                    preachings); and it is in Ceylon only that two Indo-Buddhist pilgrimages
                    survive,—that of Adam’s Peak, and the yet more popular one to the temple of
                    Kandy, where the <hi rend="italic">Dalada Malagawa,</hi> or tooth of Buddha, is
                    an object of special veneration. For northern Buddhism the chief shrines are
                    Lhassa in Tibet, the seat of the Dalai Lama, and Urga in northern Mongolia, the
                    seat of the Tesho-Lama or Bogdo-Lama. Before the Brahman revolution, which drove
                    Buddhism out of India, pilgrimages to the chief scenes of Gautama Buddha’s life
                    were common; and notably Kapilavastu, his birthplace, Benares, where he began
                    his mission, and Kasinagara, where he died, were much frequented, especially by
                    Chinese converts. The narratives of some of these, Fa Hian, Hwai-Seng, and
                    Sung-yun, and Hwen-T’sang, the most noteworthy of them all (see vol. xii. p.
                    418), who came to visit the holy places and to collect the sacred books, are
                    still extant.</p>
                <p>In China pilgrimages are made to several of the more sacred spots both by
                    Buddhists and Confucianists. Wutai-shan in Shan-si is the chief resort of
                    Buddhist pilgrims, and Tai-shan, the mountain sacred to Confucius, that of
                    Confucianists (Williamson, <hi rend="italic">Journeys in North China).</hi> In
                    Japan both the older Shinto nature-worship and the newer Buddhist creed have
                    their several sanctuaries and pilgrimages. The principal Shinto pilgrimages are
                    those to Isé in the department of Watarai, and to the sacred mountain Fuji.
                    There are two temples at Isé, ranking in sanctity first of all Shintô shrines,
                    and the special seat of the worship of Ten-shôkô-daigin, the Sun-Goddess, from
                    whom the Mikado is held to descend. Two great festivals are held yearly at Isé,
                    in the sixth and twelfth months, and are known as <hi rend="italic">O-barai no
                    matsuri,</hi> “great purification feast,” being held to effect the purifying of
                    the whole nation from the sins of the previous half year. Tickets inscribed with
                    the names of the gods of Isé, and especially that of the Sun-Goddess, are issued
                    at the temples and their agencies (being formerly sold by hawkers corresponding
                    to the pardoners of mediaeval Europe), and are carefully preserved in the
                    domestic shrine of Japanese houses, being supposed to avert all peril for six
                    months, but requiring renewal at the end of that period. The pilgrims to Isé
                    number many thousands yearly, and are known as they return by bundles of charms
                    wrapped in oiled paper, and hanging from the neck by a string. The pilgrimage to
                    Fuji takes place in summer, and the pilgrims go clad in white, and carrying
                    bells. They ascend the mountain so as to reach the summit before sunrise, when
                    they turn to the east, clap their hands, and chant a hymn to the Sun-Goddess.
                    There are also many local Shintô pilgrimages of less note. Buddhism in Japan is
                    broken up into several sects, having each of them their own pilgrimages; but the
                    most frequented are those of the god Fudo at Narita and the sacred mountain of
                    Oyama, each some 30 miles distant from Tokio. These both belong to the Shingou
                    sect, the earliest introduced into Japan. The Hokke or Nichiren sect make
                    pilgrimages to the monastery of Ikegami near Tokio, and to that at Mount Minobu,
                    about 100 miles to the west, between which two shrines the relics of the founder
                    are divided. Ninety miles north of Tokio are the shrines of Mount Nikko, also a
                    great Buddhist pilgrimage, where the shoguns are buried, and where the founder
                    of the Tokugawa dynasty is worshipped under the name of Gongen.</p>
                <p>So much will suffice to have said concerning the various heathen pilgrimages, and
                    we may now consider those of the Hebrew religion and its two derivatives, Islam
                    and Christianity.</p>
                <p>The legislation of the Pentateuch is precise in making resort to one central
                    shrine a positive and fundamental precept, binding on the whole nation,
                    obviously with the double object of cementing national unity and of guarding
                    against the erection of local sanctuaries, which were liable to be diverted to
                    idolatrous cults (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pentateuch).</hi> Under the judges
                    and the kings we find many traces of pilgrimage, not only to the sanctuary of
                    the ark at Shiloh, and afterwards to Jerusalem, but to local high flaces, such
                    as Ophrah, Mizpeh, Dan, Bethel, and Beersheba. In truth, it is not till the
                    post-exilic period that the supremacy of one national sanctuary is assured
                    (though a pilgrimage even after the destruction of the temple is recorded in
                    Jeremiah xli. 5, showing that the mere site was held sacred), for the local
                    devotion of the high places resisted all the efforts of the reforming party
                    under Hezekiah and Josiah even in the kingdom of Judah itself. Since the final
                    overthrow of the Jewish polity by Titus and Hadrian, no effort has been made
                    either to establish a centre of sacrificial worship anywhere outside Palestine
                    (as in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n102/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0102-0093"/> curious episode of the temple of Heliopolis in
                    Egypt), or to revive it in Jerusalem itself, where, even now, the synagogues and
                    colleges of the Sephardim and Ashkenazim are entirely separate and independent
                    organizations, and show no tendency to coalesce into the nucleus of a national
                    system. Hence, as the political and religious motives for the pilgrimage to
                    Jerusalem have both dropped into abeyance, the custom itself is no longer
                    regarded as binding, and, though it is not obsolete, inasmuch as a visit to the
                    Holy City is considered a meritorious act, yet it has now, like the pilgrimage
                    to Hebron, more of an emotional and historical character than a ceremonial one,
                    so that it is not in the strict sense a pilgrimage any longer.</p>
                <p>Although the Mohammedan pilgrimages are much later in chronological order than
                    the Christian ones, it will be more convenient to consider them briefly first.
                    They consist, then, of two main classes, which may be distinguished conveniently
                    by Latin theological terms, as those of “obligation” and those of “devotion.”
                    There is properly only one Moslem pilgrimage of obligation, that to Mecca, which
                    still often draws an annual contingent of from 70,000 to 80,000 pilgrims (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mecca).</hi> It is in truth a pagan survival which proved
                    too powerful for extirpation by Mohammed. The Kaaba had been constituted the
                    national sanctuary of Arabia about 100 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and
                    contained, besides the famous Black Stone, some three hundred and sixty idols of
                    various Bedouin tribes, united in one pantheon, exactly as with the Capitol of
                    Rome; and, though it was possible to sweep the idols out of the Kaaba, it was
                    not so easy to deconsecrate the spot, but far more convenient to give it a new
                    sanction.</p>
                <p>The Mohammedan pilgrimages of devotion are very numerous, and are chiefly
                    connected with the saint-worship which has overlaid and obscured the original
                    strict monotheism of Islam. Chief amongst the sacred shrines of this second
                    class stands the tomb of Mohammed at <hi rend="smallcaps">Medina</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q. υ.),</hi> but, holy as it is considered, and meritorious as a
                    visit to it is accounted, it is in no sense binding on a Moslem’s conscience,
                    and only about one-third of the Meccan pilgrims proceed thither. Other
                    sanctuaries abound in all Mohammedan countries, of which a few, like Abraham’s
                    tomb at Hebron, are honoured by all Mohammedan sects, while others are peculiar
                    to the Sunnites and Shiites respectively, and others again, such as Kairwân in
                    Tunis, and Wazan in Morocco, and still more the tombs and oratories of merely
                    local saints or <hi rend="italic">welis,</hi> found in almost every Moslem town
                    or village, are restricted to a comparatively small body of votaries. The most
                    famous, after the Pan-Islamic pilgrimages, are the great Shiite sanctuaries, of
                    which there are three :—Meshed in Khorâsân, with the tomb and mosque of Imam
                    Riza, said to attract almost as many yearly pilgrims as Mecca itself; Khoum in
                    Irak Ajemi, where Fatima, wife of Imam Riza, is buried; and, yet more sacred
                    than either, Kerbela in Mesopotamia, in the Turkish dominions, about 28 miles
                    north-west of the ruins of Babylon, where is the tomb and mosque of Imam Hosein,
                    grandson of Mohammed (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Kerbela</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mohammedanism).</hi> There is a passion-play performed there at
                    the yearly commemoration, which draws enormous crowds from all parts of Persia
                    and other Shiite regions, and the title hajj attaches to all who make the
                    journey. Some idea of the multiplicity of minor pilgrimages amongst Moslems may
                    be gathered from the fact that in the city of Damascus alone there are one
                    hundred and ninety-four places of resort by pilgrims, and fourteen more in the
                    environs. A great reaction against the whole system, inclusive of the invocation
                    of saints, took place under the Wahhabis in the last century, in the course of
                    which countless <hi rend="italic">welis</hi> or tombs of Moslem saints were
                    destroyed, including even those of Hosein and Mohammed himself; but, on the
                    overthrow of the fanatics by Mohammed Ali, the customary practices were
                    restored, and have continued in full vigour ever since.</p>
                <p>Christian pilgrimages were at first limited to Jerusalem and its immediate
                    neighbourhood, including Bethlehem. It is probable enough that the local church
                    of Jerusalem regarded the various scenes of the gospel history, and notably of
                    the Passion and Resurrection, with special reverence, and would guide the steps
                    of visitors to the most sacred localities while the city yet stood, and point
                    out the sites, as nearly as possible, after the work of Titus had been completed
                    by Hadrian, and a vast mound of earth, on whose summit rose a temple of Venus,
                    had been raised over the Holy Sepulchre. But this is matter of conjecture rather
                    than of knowledge. There is no actual proof of very early Christian pilgrimage
                    to the holy places, though the belief was already current at the close of the
                    4th century that the custom had prevailed unbroken from apostolic times, as is
                    distinctly asserted by Paula and Eustochium in their letter to Marcella <hi
                    rend="italic">(Epist. Hieronym.,</hi> xvii.), written in 386, wherein they state
                    also that of which they are more trustworthy witnesses, that pilgrims then
                    flocked from Armenia, Persia, India, Ethiopia, and even Gaul and Britain, to
                    visit the cradle of Christianity. But in point of fact the earliest pilgrim of
                    whose visit as a religious act we have definite proof is Alexander, a
                    Cappadocian bishop, who came to Jerusalem in consequence of a dream (212), and
                    was elected coadjutor to Narcissus, then bishop of the diocese (Euseb., <hi
                    rend="italic">E. H.,</hi> vi. 11). Origen, who was a friend of Alexander, is
                    another early example, but his own words <hi rend="italic">(Comm, in Evang.
                    Joann.,</hi> vi. § 24) imply that he came rather in the modern spirit of devout
                    scholarly inquiry than as a pilgrim in the strict sense. He paid a short visit
                    in 216, and returned in 231, to settle down for a time at Caesarea, where he
                    opened a school of theology in 238. It is not till after the pilgrimage of the
                    empress Helena (the first quite unquestionable event of the kind) about 326 or
                    328, that the fashion set in, accompanied with the desire to bring back some
                    relic, either inherently sacred or at least hallowed by contact with certain
                    venerated spots. That the temper of the time was not a very critical one is
                    sufficiently proved by the casual mention by St Chrysostom of a pilgrimage as
                    commonly practised to Arabia in order to see the dunghill on which Job sat, and
                    that by visitors from the very ends of the earth <hi rend="italic">(Hom.</hi> V.
                    <hi rend="italic">de,</hi><hi rend="italic">Statuis).</hi></p>
                <p>But another kind of pilgrimage, destined to be more powerful than that to
                    Jerusalem, began to be popular nearly at the same time, that to the tombs of
                    distinguished martyrs or confessors. In the present day, the passionate
                    admiration of the Christians of the 3d, 4th, and 5th centuries for the martyrs
                    as a class seems somewhat disproportioned to the part they actually played in
                    the history of Christianity, which was more effectually propagated and
                    maintained by the eminent teachers and divines of the ancient church. But the
                    truth is that they supplied just the element of enthusiasm which was needed to
                    sustain the courage and endurance of the humbler Christian laity under the
                    stress of recurrent persecutions; and, when peace was finally secured under
                    Constantine the Great, there were so many families which counted one or more
                    martyrs amongst their kindred, and viewed such kinship as a patent of nobility,
                    that everything favoured the rapid development of pilgrimages to places in which
                    so many had a direct personal, as well as a corporate religious, interest. So
                    much did the notion begin to prevail that pilgrimage was almost a necessity of
                    religion, and that prayer could be heard more assuredly in particular places,
                    that warnings against error of the kind were uttered by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n103/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0103-0094"/> teachers whose own acts had helped to propagate
                    the opinion in question. Thus, only a few years after the letter above cited,
                    urging Marcella to migrate to Bethlehem, St Jerome writes to Paulinus (393)
                    pointing out that many of the most celebrated saints and ascetics had never
                    visited the holy places, that heaven is just as open from Britain as from
                    Jerusalem, and that the circumstances of life in Jerusalem itself were far from
                    helpful to devotion. But his own abode at Bethlehem, the celebrity of the
                    religious houses he founded and directed there, and the unlike tenor of other
                    letters he wrote, entirely counteracted this advice. St Chrysostom at one time
                    speaks of the needlessness of pilgrimage <hi rend="italic">(Hom.</hi> i. <hi
                    rend="italic">in Philem.; Hom.</hi> iii. and iv. <hi rend="italic">ad pop.
                    Antioch.),</hi> and at another expresses his own wish to see the relics of St
                    Paul at Rome <hi rend="italic">(Hom.</hi> xxxii. <hi rend="italic">in Rom.</hi>
                    ii., iii.; <hi rend="italic">Hom.</hi> viii. <hi rend="italic">in Eph.</hi> it).
                    So, too, St Augustine contributed powerfully to promote pilgrimages to the
                    shrines of saints, by sending in 404 two clerical disputants to the shrine of St
                    Felix of Nola, in the hope that some miracle would be worked there to decide the
                    matter, though no such signs had been granted at the grave of any African saint
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> Ixxviii.). And in another place he attests the
                    working of many miracles by the relics of the protomartyr St Stephen in various
                    African towns where portions of them had been shrined <hi rend="italic">(De Civ.
                    Dei,</hi> xxii. 8). Nevertheless, in yet a third place he appears to condemn
                    tiιis very temper as mere superstition, stating that, while he knows many
                    professing Christians who are worshippers of tombs and pictures, “the church

                <p>Here, too, example proved stronger than precept, and the only unqualified
                    opposition to the popular tendency which issued from any quite unimpeachable
                    source (for Vigilantius and Jovinian cannot be fairly cited) is the remarkable
                    letter of St Gregory of Nyssa to a friend, on the subject of pilgrimages to
                    Jerusalem, the heads of which are as under:—there is no divine precept for the
                    usage; the moral dangers of the journey, from bad companions and from the
                    quality of the inns, are great, especially to women, and above all to nuns; the
                    immorality and irréligion of Jerusalem itself are gross and notorious. True, he
                    had gone thither himself, but it was on public ecclesiastical business,
                    connected with the Arabian Church, and he had travelled in a public vehicle with
                    a company of monks. He did not find his faith stimulated or improved in any way
                    by a sight of the scenes of the gospel history, and he recommends others to stay
                    at home, assuring them that no spiritual benefit is lost by so doing, and no
                    spiritual gain acquired by visiting the most sacred places without inward
                    amendment <hi rend="italic">(Epist.</hi> ii.). The authenticity of this epistle
                    has been challenged, but on no sufficient grounds.</p>
                <p>What makes the devotion to the tombs of saints such a powerful factor in
                    ecclesiastical history is that, after the Holy Sepulchre itself, no grave had
                    such a hold on Christian imagination as that where the bodies of the two chief
                    apostles, St Peter and St Paul, were held to rest in Rome. And consequently, as
                    the division of the empire lessened the intercourse between East and West, as
                    the decay of the old lines of communication made travelling more difficult, and
                    as the advance of Mohammedanism in Syria and Palestine made it more dangerous
                    also in that direction, Rome gradually supplanted Jerusalem to a great degree in
                    the West as the goal of pilgrimage, and the enthusiasm of the visitors did much
                    to consolidate the papal monarchy over Latin Christendom. So markedly did this
                    new influence prevail that it has left its trace in more than one European
                    language. The Low Latin <hi rend="italic">romerius, romipeta</hi> for a pilgrim

                    >Romeo,</hi> and the English <hi rend="italic">roτnare (Piers Plowman)</hi>
                    attest the celebrity and popularity of this pilgrimage, into which soon entered
                    such further ideas as the desirability of confessing sins to the pope personally
                    and obtaining absolution from him, the reference of private cases to papal
                    arbitration on the part of bishops and other ecclesiastical judges, and the
                    injunction of the journey as in itself a penance, a notion prevalent in the
                    Gallic churches as early as the close of the 5th century (Caesar. Arelat., <hi
                    rend="italic">Hom.</hi> iii.). Nowhere was the pilgrimage to Rome more popular
                    than in Saxon England, and amongst the crowds of penitents who made the journey
                    were four kings, Ceadwalla, Ine, Coinred, and Offa, all of whom died in Rome,
                    two of them as monks (Beda, <hi rend="italic">H.E.,</hi> V. 7, 19). There were
                    not wanting efforts to check the movement. Apart from the theological objections
                    raised by Claudius of Turin, there is a letter extant from Boniface of Mainz, an
                    Englishman born, to Cuthbert, archbishop of Canterbury, written about 743,
                    begging him to get a canon enacted to forbid the pilgrimage to Rome, especially
                    to nuns, on the ground of the moral perils of the road, stating that no city of
                    France, Lombardy, or Italy was without Englishwomen leading depraved lives,
                    whose virtue had fallen during pilgrimage. And the council of Chalons, in 813,
                    enacted a canon to check pilgrimages both to Rome and to the shrine of St Martin
                    at Tours (then the most famous sanctuary in France), on the ground of serious
                    abuses on the part of both clergy and laity; and the council of Seligenstadt
                    made a like effort in 1022. But even the robber barons who looked on pilgrims as
                    their natural prey could not arrest the movement (which was specially
                    stimulated, as we learn from Radulphus Glaber, in 999 and 1000 by the belief
                    that the end of the world was at hand), and the Roman pilgrimage reached its
                    height in the Middle Ages through the institution of the Jubilee, or plenary
                    indulgence to pilgrims, by Boniface VIII. in 1300, -when 200,000 are said to
                    have availed themselves of it, and smaller but still considerable numbers on its
                    various repetitions at irregular intervals since. The pilgrimage to Jerusalem
                    received fresh stimulus in the 9th century by the first occurrence of the
                    alleged miracle of the heavenly fire on Easter Eve at the Holy Sepulchre, and
                    continued to be frequented till checked by the fanaticism of the caliph
                    Hakem-Biamr’illah about 1018, and more severely and permanently by the Seljukian
                    Turks on their conquest of Syria, which occasioned those armed pilgrimages, the
                    crusades, to whose history this branch of the subject thenceforward belongs.
                    Meanwhile, a third class of sanctuaries had been steadily coming into notice and
                    popularity, consisting neither of the seats of great historical events nor of
                    the ascertained resting-places of eminent saints. These were the purely
                    legendary shrines, the sites of some alleged vision, of the supernatural
                    discovery of hidden relics, or of the presence of a wonder-working image or
                    picture. One of the earliest and most famous of these was that of Compostella,
                    where the relics of St James the Great were said to be discovered in 816, and,
                    after being again hidden for many centuries, to have been discovered afresh in
                    1884. This was one of those most frequented by English pilgrims, no fewer than
                    2460 licences being granted for the journey in the one year 1434 (Rymer, <hi
                    rend="italic">Foed.,</hi> xi.).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This concourse of English pilgrims was soon looked on in
                    France as politically dangerous, so that in the 14th century, when Pedro the
                    Cruel was dethroned by Henry of Trastamara, the latter was compelled by his
                    allies to refuse entrance into Spain to all pilgrims who had not licence of
                    transit from the king of France. This kind of jealousy <pb
                    corresp="kp-eb0919-0104-0095" xml:id="pbn9095"/> lasted very long, for there are
                    edicts of Louis XIV. and XV. forbidding foreign pilgrimage to French subjects
                    without the written permission of their bishop, and the counter-signature of a
                    state official, under pain of the galleys for life. They bear date 1671, 1686,
                    and 1738.</p></note></p>

                <p>Another, which became the Bethlehem of the West, as Rome had become its
                    Jerusalem, was Loreto, where, ever since 1295, the Santa Casa, declared to be
                    the home of the Holy Family, miraculously transported from Nazareth, has been
                    frequented by pilgrims till very recent times, when its popularity has waned.
                    Other famous shrines, some few of which even still attract yearly crowds of
                    pilgrims, are Einsiedeln in Switzerland; Assisi, Oropa, Varese and Vicovaro in
                    Italy; Monserrat and Guadalupe in Spain; Mariazell in Austria; Getting and
                    Eberhards-clausen in Germany; Walsingham, Becket’s shrine at Canterbury,
                    Peterborough, St Davids, and Holywell in England and Wales; St Andrews in
                    Scotland; Chartres, Notre Dame de Liesse, Notre Dame de Rocamadour, and Notre
                    Dame des Victoires, with Ste Anne d’Auray in Britanny, in France; and Hal in
                    Belgium. Devotion to these shrines was encouraged and developed by copious
                    indulgences annexed to them; but this system in the long run became adverse to
                    pilgrimages, because exactly the same privileges were annexed at a later time to
                    acts much more easy of performance. Thus, the wearers of the cord of St Francis,
                    every time of reciting certain brief prayers, acquire all the indulgences
                    attached to the holy places of Palestine, Rome, Assisi, and so forth, and have
                    naturally little inducement to perform toilsome and costly journeys thither.</p>
                <p>There is a further small class of pilgrimages, differing from all others in being
                    neither permanent nor yearly, but periodical at various long intervals. They are
                    usually connected with the exposition of the principal relic or relics in some
                    important church, an event which rarely occurs. Such are the pilgrimages of
                    Cologne, to the shrine of the Three Kings, and that of Treves, where the alleged
                    seamless coat of Christ has been displayed for popular devotion, and has been
                    visited by vast crowds of pilgrims.</p>
                <p>Pilgrims in the Middle Ages were known by a peculiar garb and various badges, the
                    hood and cape, the staff and scrip and water-bottle, and the low-crowned hat,
                    turned up in front, and fastened with strings, being common to alξ while the
                    palm specially marked a pilgrim from the Holy Land; a shell, one from
                    Compostella; a bottle or bell, one from Canterbury, and so forth. They had many
                    privileges and advantages. They were exempt from toll, their persons were
                    inviolable, and any injury done to them incurred the penalty of excommunication;
                    they were entitled to shelter, fire, and water in all convents on their road,
                    and the needier ones to food in addition; and there were resting-stations
                    erected for them on all the great lines of travel, sustained sometimes by
                    voluntary offerings, and sometimes by public imposts; while in Rome, above all,
                    institutions for their reception and relief were established early, and are
                    still in active operation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>For more details see Mr Scudamore’s articles, “Holy Places” and
                    “Pilgrimages,” in Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Christian
                    Antiquities.</hi></p></note> Nevertheless they declined in repute, not only by
                    reason of the feigned devotees who joined them for purposes of vagrancy and
                    mendicancy, and even from worse motives, but because many notorious criminals
                    were customarily sent on pilgrimage as a punishment, with no care to isolate
                    them from their innocent companions. The general charge of moral deterioration
                    as a result of pilgrimage, which recurs from the fourth century onwards, is
                    specifically brought by Langland in respect of truthfulness :—</p>
                <p>“Pilgrims and palmeres plighten hem togidere, For to seken seint Jame and seintes
                    at Rome. They wenten forth in hire wey, with many wise tales, And hadden leve to
                    lyen all hire lif after.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">—( Vision of Piers Plowman,</hi> pass. i. line 82).</p>
                <p>Hence pilgrimages were attacked with the weapons of ridicule, and the most
                    celebrated satires upon them are the chapter in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reineke</hi><hi rend="italic">Fuchs,</hi> describing Reynard’s adventures as a
                    pilgrim, and the yet wittier squib of Erasmus, <hi rend="italic">Peregrinatu)
                    religionis</hi><hi rend="italic">ergo,</hi> in which he gives a sarcastic
                    account of the pilgrimage to Walsingham, which had much to do with destroying
                    the prestige of not only that particular one, but most others also. The French
                    Revolution all but completed the work of the Reformation in causing pilgrimages
                    to decline seriously, where they were not entirely abolished, in the West,
                    though they were still able to maintain their ground in retired and unchanging
                    places such as Britanny, various places in central Italy, and in Ireland, where
                    the severely penitential pilgrimages of Lough Finn, Lough Dearg, and Croagh
                    Patrick are not yet obsolete. There was a remarkable recrudescence of the spirit
                    of pilgrimage under the pontificate of Pius IX., notably to the new sanctuaries
                    of La Salette and Lourdes in France, which reached its height about 1872-73, but
                    has shown signs of subsiding again since.</p>
                <p>In the Eastern Church, pilgrimages have not for many centuries formed so
                    important a part of popular religion as in Latin Christendom, and the number of
                    frequented shrines is very small. In the Greek Church properly so called, Mount
                    Athos, with its numerous monasteries, where the great yearly gathering is on the
                    feast of the Transfiguration, ranks next to the visit to the Jordan (Tozer, <hi
                    rend="italic">Highlands of Turkey,</hi> i. 103). After Mount Athos comes a
                    shrine in the island of Tenos, where, in the cathedral church of the Panagia
                    Evangelistria, is preserved an icon of the Madonna, alleged to be
                    wonder-working, and said to have been discovered by means of a dream in 1824;
                    the annual concourse of pilgrims twice a year, on the feasts of the Annunciation
                    and the Assumption, is very great. Three alleged pictures of the Blessed Virgin
                    by St Luke—at Megas-pelion, at Sumelas in the mountains behind Trebizond, and at
                    Stiri in Mount Helicon—are also much visited. Etchmiadzin is the chief Armenian
                    pilgrimage, besides which are those of Kaisariyeh and Mush (Tozer, <hi
                    rend="italic">Turkish Armenia,</hi> pp. 161, 271). And finally, the chief
                    Russian pilgrimages are to the Petcherskoilavra at Kieff (said to be visited by
                    200,000 pilgrims yearly), the Solovetsk monastery near Archangel, and the
                    Troitsa, close to Moscow, besides many more locally popular shrines. <hi
