                    United States, though no longer appearing in the countless numbers that it did
                    of old, when a flock seen by Wilson was estimated to consist of more than 2230
                    millions. The often-quoted descriptions given by him and Audubon of
                    Pigeon-haunts in the then “back woods” of Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana need not
                    here be reproduced. That of the latter was declared by Water ton to be a gross
                    exaggeration if not an entire fabrication; but the critic would certainly have
                    changed his tone had he known that, some hundred and fifty years earlier,
                    Passenger-Pigeons so swarmed and ravaged the colonists’ crops near Montreal that
                    a bishop of his own church was constrained to exorcise them with holy water, as
                    if they had been demons.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    >Amérique septentrionale,</hi> ed. 2, Amsterdam, 1705, vol. i. pp. 93, 94. In
                    the first edition, published at The Hague in 1703, the passage, less explicit in
                    details but to the same effect, is at p. 80. The author’s letter, describing the
                    circumstance, is dated May 1687.</p></note> The rapid and sustained flight of
                    these Pigeons is also as well-established as their former overwhelming
                    abundance—birds having been killed in the State of New York whose crops
                    contained undigested grains of rice that must have been not long before plucked
                    and swallowed in South Carolina or Georgia. The Passenger-Pigeon is about the
                    size of a common Turtle-Dove, but with a long, wedge-shaped tail. The male is of
                    a dark slate-colour above, and purplish-bay beneath, the sides of the neck being
                    enlivened by gleaming violet, green, and gold. The female is drab-coloured above
                    and dull white beneath, with only a slight trace of the brilliant
                    neck-markings.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There are
                    several records of the occurrence in Britain of this Pigeon, but in most cases
                    the birds noticed cannot be supposed to have found their own way hither. One,
                    which was shot in Fife in 1825, may, however, have crossed the Atlantic
                    unassisted by man.</p></note></p>
                <p>Among the multitudinous forms of Pigeons very few can here be noticed. A species
                    which seems worthy of attention as being one that might possibly repay the
                    trouble of domestication, if any enterprising person would give it the chance,
                    is the Wonga-wonga or White-fleshed Pigeon of Australia, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leucosarcia</hi><hi rend="italic">picata,</hi> a bird larger than the
                    Ring-Dove, of a slaty-blue colour above and white beneath, streaked on the
                    flanks with black. It is known to breed, though not very freely, in captivity,
                    and is said to be excellent for the table. As regards flavour, however, those
                    who have been so fortunate as to eat them declare that the Fruit-Pigeons of the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Treron</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Vinago</hi> of some
                    authors) and its allies surpass all birds. These inhabit tropical Africa, India,
                    and especially the Malay Archipelago; but the probability of domesticating any
                    of them is very remote. Hardly less esteemed are the Pigeons of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Ptilopus</hi> and its kindred forms, which have their headquarters
                    in the Pacific Islands, though some occur far to the westward, and also in
                    Australia. Among them are found the most exquisitely-coloured of the whole
                    Family. There may be mentioned the strange Nicobar Pigeon, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caloenas,</hi> an inhabitant of the Indian Archipelago, not less remarkable for
                    the long lustrous hackles with which its neck is clothed than for the structure
                    of its gizzard, which has been described by Prof. Flower <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1860, p. 330), though this peculiarity is matched or
                    even surpassed by that of the same organ in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaenorrhina</hi><hi rend="italic">goliath,</hi> of New Caledonia <hi
                    rend="italic">{Rev.</hi><hi rend="italic">de Zoologie,</hi> 1862, p. 138) and in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Carpophaga</hi><hi rend="italic">latrans</hi> of Fiji. In
                    this last the surface of the epithelial lining is beset by horny conical
                    processes, adapted, it is believed, for crushing the very hard fruits of <hi
                    rend="italic">Onocarpus vitiensis</hi> on which the bird feeds <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Proc. Zool./Society,</hi> 1878, p. 102). The modern giants of the group,
                    consisting of about half a dozen species of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Goura</hi> and known as</p>
                <p>Crowned-Pigeons, belong to New Guinea and the neighbouring islands, but want of
                    space forbids further notice of their characteristics, of which the most
                    conspicuous are their large size and the reticulated instead of scutellated
                    covering of their “tarsi.”</p>
                <p>A very distinct type of Pigeon is that represented by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didunculus strigirostris,</hi> the “Manu-mea <hi rend="italic">” of</hi> Samoa,
                    still believed by some to be the next of kin to the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Dodo</hi> (vol. vii. p. 321), but really presenting only a superficial
                    resemblance in the shape of its bill to that effete form, from which it differs
                    osteologically quite as much as do other Pigeons <hi rend="italic">{Phil.
                    Transactions,</hi> 1869, p. 349). It remains to be seen whether the Papuan genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Otidiphaps, oi</hi> which several species are now known, may
                    not belong rather to the <hi rend="italic">Didunculidae</hi> than to the true
                    <hi rend="italic">Columbidae</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ornithology,</hi>
                    vol. xviii. p. 46).</p>
                <p>At least 500 species of Pigeons have been described, and many methods of
                    arranging them suggested. That by Garrod <hi rend="italic">{Proc. Zool.
                    Society,</hi> 1874, pp. 249-259) is one of the most recent; but, for reasons
                    before assigned (vol. xviii. p. 40), it is not satisfactory. Temminck’s great
                    work on the group with its continuation by Μ. Florent-Provost, already mentioned
                    (vol. xviii. p. 11), is of course wholly out of date, as also Selby’s more
                    modest <hi rend="italic">Natural History of the</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Columbidae</hi> (forming vol. ix. of Jardine’s <hi rend="italic">Naturalist's

                    containing all the recent discoveries, is much wanted. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.
