                    division) an alimentary canal, but are without an anus. The Turbellarians,
                    excluding the <hi rend="smallcaps">Nemertines</hi><hi rend="italic">(g.υ.),</hi>
                    which until recently were classed with them, form an order of the class <hi
                    rend="italic">Platyhelminthes,</hi> and the old name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Planaria</hi> is now confined to a group of the fresh-water representatives of
                    this order.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Size and External Characters. —</hi> Many forms of the
                    Turbellarians are so minute as to be hardly visible with the naked eye, while
                    others attain to a length of several inches, and a land Planarian of no less
                    than 9 inches in length has been described by Moseley. The freshwater forms are
                    generally small, the largest representatives of the order being marine or
                    terrestrial. The smaller species are mostly cylindrical, or convex dorsally and
                    flat ventrally; the anterior extremity is commonly truncated and the posterior
                    extremity pointed (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">a, b).</hi> The larger aquatic
                    forms are thinner in proportion to the increasing surface of the body, so that
                    they come to resemble thin leaf-like lamellae <hi rend="italic">(d),</hi> while
                    the large land Planarians instead of increasing in superficies grow in length
                    <hi rend="italic">(e</hi> and ∕), so that they may be best compared to leeches.
                    The larger aquatic forms are frequently provided with tentacles in the shape of
                    paired finger-like processes or ear-like folds of the anterior part of the body
                    <hi rend="italic">(d</hi> and &lt;∕); sometimes the tentacles are papillary
                    outgrowths of the dorsal surface; the land Planarians are often to be
                    distinguished by a crescent-shaped area at the fore end of the body, which is
                    separated off from the rest (∕). In many cases the whole dor sal surface is
                    beset with papillae (&lt;Z). The aperture of the mouth varies greatly in its
                    position; sometimes it is situated at the anterior extremity, sometimes in the
                    middle of the ventral surface of the body, occasionally quite close to the
                    posterior extremity; the single common or distinct male and female generative
                    apertures are also situated upon the ventral surface of the body, and the former
                    in rare cases open in common with the mouth; the genital apertures always lie
                    behind the mouth.</p>
                <p>Many Turbellarians have a sucker which serves to attach the animal to surrounding
                    objects, or to another individual during copulation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Integument.—</hi> The integument is composed of a single layer
                    of ciliated epithelium; between the cilia there are often long flagella and
                    stiff tactile hairs and even (in a single instance) chitinous spines; these
                    latter must be regarded as local thickenings of the firm cuticle which covers
                    the epidermic cells. The epidermic cells are flat or columnar, and are united to
                    each other by smooth opposed margins or by denticulate processes which fit into
                    similar processes in the adjacent cells (fig. 2). Sometimes the epidermic cells
                    are separated by an interstitial nucleated tissue. The structure and functions
                    of the cells of the epidermis differ, and four varieties are to be found :—(a)
                    indifferent ciliated cells; (6) cells containing certain definite structures
                    (rhabdites, nematocysts); (c) gland cells; and (J) glutinous cells (Klebzellen).
                    The rhabdites are refracting homogeneous rod-like bodies, of a firm consistency,
                    which are met with in most Turbellaria, and often fill all the cells of the
                    epidermis; they are not always found entirely within the cells, but the
                    extremity often projects freely on to the exterior of the body. They are readily
                    extruded from the cells by pressure, and are often found in great abundance in
                    the mucus secreted by the glandular cells (many Turbellarians, like snails,
                    deposit threads of mucus along their track); in this case the epidermic cells
                    become perforated like a sieve. In many Turbellarians the rhabdites are chiefly
                    massed in the anterior part of the body; frequently there are several varieties
                    of rhabdites in one and the same species,—some being pointed at both ends,
                    others cylindrical with truncated extremities. These structures are either
                    formed directly in the ordinary epidermis cells as a kind of secreted product of
                    the cell, or in special formative cells which lie beneath the integument and are
                    connected with the epidermis cells by protoplasmic filaments, by means of which
                    the rhabdites reach the surface of the body. These-cells must be regarded as
                    epidermic <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n180/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0180-0171"/> cells which have become disconnected with the
                    epidermis itself, and wandered into the subjacent parenchyma. The function of
                    the rhabdites seems to be to support the tactile sense. In rare instances
                    nematocysts are present which in structure and development entirely resemble
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">Coelentera</hi> (see vol. xii. p. 550). Very
                    commonly structures known as pseudo-rhabdites are present; these have a rod-like
                    form, but instead of being homogeneous are finely granular; they are an
                    intermediate step between the rhabdites proper and a granulated secretion
                    occasionally thrown off by the gland cells. The unicellular glands are either
                    situated among the epidermic cells or in the parenchyma, in which case they are
                    connected with the exterior only by the excretory duct. A peculiar modification
                    of the epidermic cells are the so-called “glutinous cells,” which occur on the
                    ventral surface or at the hinder end of the body of many Turbellarians, and
                    compensate for the suckers; the surface of these cells is furnished with
                    numerous minute processes by means of which and a sticky secretion the animals
                    can attach themselves to surrounding objects. Sometimes the epidermic cells
                    contain calcareous concretions, and very commonly pigment is found either in the
                    cells themselves or within the interstitial tissue. The colours of Turbellarians
                    are, however, not always due to the pigment of the epidermis but to pigment
                    contained in the parenchyma. Beneath the epidermis is a basement membrane (fig.
                    2, <hi rend="italic">bm)</hi> which is in some cases very delicate and
                    structureless, and in other eases much thicker and enclosing branched cells;
                    this membrane is attached more firmly to the subjacent tissue than to the
                    epidermis. Since this tissue is the strongest in the body, and serves as a
                    surface of attachment for the muscles, it has been termed by Lang a skeletal
                    membrane.</p>
                <p>The third section of the integument is formed by the muscular layers. These, form
                    a continuous covering to the rest of the body, but their arrangement and
                    thickness are very different in different forms. In the smaller species <hi
                    rend="italic">(Rhabdocoelida)</hi> there are two layers, an outer circular and
                    an inner longitudinal, only in a few cases the circular layer is external to the
                    longitudinal; sometimes there are three distinct layers, as in fig 2, where a
                    diagonal layer is interposed. The larger forms <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dendrocoelidd)</hi> have a much more complicated muscular system: in the most
                    differentiated forms there are six separate layers (two circular, two diagonal,
                    and two longitudinal), which are, however, always less developed upon the dorsal
                    than upon the ventral surface in that the thickest layer of the ventral surface
                    (the innermost longitudinal) is absent or very feebly developed upon the dorsal
                    side. Besides the integumentary muscular system, there are also found
                    dorso-ventral muscular bands which traverse the whole body from the dorsal to
                    the ventral basement membrane, being branched at both extremities, and the
                    special muscles of the pharynx, genital organs, and suckers.</p>
                <p>The perivisceral cavity, bounded by the integument and traversed by the
                    dorso-ventral muscles, contains the organs of the body—alimentary canal,
                    excretory system, nervous system, and genital glands. The space left between
                    these organs is filled with parenchyma; the latter varies much in appearance and
                    is very difficult to study. Generally it consists of a network of fibres and
                    trabeculae, which contain nuclei, and between which is a system of cavities
                    filled during life with the perivisceral fluid. These cavities are generally but
                    few in number and vary with the stronger or feebler development of the
                    reticulum; they occasionally contain free cells.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alimentary Canal.—</hi> All Turbellarians are furnished with a
                    mouth, which, as there is no anus, serves both to take in nutriment and expel
                    the undigested remains of food. The alimentary canal consists of a muscular
                    pharynx and an intestine. The pharynx (figs 3, 5 to 8, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ph)</hi> is cylindrical in form, rather complicated in structure, and
                    surrounded by a muscular sheath, which opens on to the exterior by the mouth <hi
                    rend="italic">(m).</hi> Often the pharynx consists merely of a circular fold
                    lying within the pharyngeal pouch (fig. 8); it can be protruded through the
                    mouth and acts like a sucker, so that the animal can fasten itself upon its prey
                    and draw it into the intestine by suction. At the junction of the pharynx with
                    the intestine open the salivary glands, which are frequently large and
                    well-developed (fig. 5, <hi rend="italic">s).</hi> The intestine <hi
                    rend="italic">(i)</hi> has a very characteristic form in the different sections,
                    and has long served to divide the <hi rend="italic">Turbellaria</hi> into two
                    groups :—(1) <hi rend="italic">Rhabdocoelida,</hi> with a straight unbranched
                    intestine (figs. 5, 6), and (2) <hi rend="italic">Dendrocoelida,</hi> with a
                    branched intestine (figs. 7, 8). In the latter group Lang has recently called
                    attention to further differences that exist in the form of the intestine: in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tricladida</hi> (fig. 7) there is no central “stomach,” but
                    three equally-sized intestinal branches (which have secondary ramifications)
                    unite together to open into the pharynx; in the second group, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Polycladida</hi> (fig. 8), there is a median stomach <hi
                    rend="italic">(st),</hi> from which numerous intestinal branches arise; this
                    stomach communicates directly with the pharynx; the branches of the intestine
                    are much ramified and often form an anastomosing network. The epithelium of the
                    intestine is a single layer of cells generally not ciliated, capable of
                    protruding amoeboid processes by which the food is absorbed; the digestion of
                    these animals is intracellular. Sometimes a muscular coat surrounds the
                    intestine, the lumen of which is thus capable of being totally or partially
                    contracted. To the above-mentioned divisions of the group, distinguished from
                    each other by the varying form of the alimentary tract, another has been added,
                    viz., the <hi rend="italic">Acoela</hi> (Ulianin), which are characterized by
                    the entire absence of any intestine. In these forms (fig. 4) the mouth leads
                    directly into the parenchyma of the body by a short tube which is merely an
                    invagination of the integument; the parenchyma is a syncytium, consisting of a
                    soft protoplasmic mass with scattered nuclei, which represents the elements of
                    the intestine and the body parenchyma (ento-and mesoderm) completely fused and
                    without any traces of differentiation. This fact, as well as the disappearance
                    of a nervous and excretory system, reduces the <hi rend="italic">Acoela</hi> to
                    the lowest position not only among the <hi rend="italic">Turbellaria,</hi> but
                    among the whole group of the <hi rend="italic">Vermes.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Excretory System.—</hi> The excretory system of the Turbellarians is quite
                    similar to that of the Trematodes and Cestoids; it consists of (1) the main
                    trunks with their <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n181/mode/1up"

                    these, and (3) the excretory cells with the fine tubules leading from them.
                    Rarely is there but a single main excretory trunk present opening at the hinder
                    end of the body <hi rend="italic">(Steno-</hi><hi rend="italic">stoma)∙,</hi>
                    generally there are a pair of such trunks which open in common at the hinder end
                    of the body, or separately (most <hi rend="italic">Rhabdocoela),</hi> or by the
                    mouth (fig. 3). In the <hi rend="italic">Trieladida</hi> there are two or four
                    lateral trunks present which open by a number of pores arranged in pairs upon
                    the dorsal surface of the body; the same appears to be the case in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Polycladida.</hi> The main trunks of the excretory system are
                    generally much twisted in their course, and anastomose with each other; they
                    receive the fine tubules either directly or, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhabdocoela,</hi> there is a network of secondary tubules interposed. The
                    excretory cells are pear-shaped; they are branched and furnished with a nucleus
                    and a large vacuole which is directly continuous with the lumen of the tubule;
                    from the boundary wall of the vacuole springs a single flagellum, which depends
                    into the lumen of the tubule and is capable of active movement. Lang discovered
                    in a marine form of the <hi rend="italic">Trieladida (Gunda)</hi> similar
                    vacuolated cells with a single flagellum among the epithelial cells of the
                    intestine, and came to the conclu sion that the excretory cells were on that
                    account derived from the epithelium of the intestine. The movements of the
                    excretory fluid towards the external pore are directed by this flagellum as well
                    as by cilia developed upon the walls of the fine tubules; the motion of all
                    these cilia is such as to drive the contents of the tubules towards the
                    excretory pore. The main trunks of the excretory system are either sparsely <hi
                    rend="italic">(Trieladida</hi> according to Jijima) or completely <hi
                    rend="italic">(Polycladida</hi> according to Lang) lined with cilia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nervous System.—</hi> The central organ of the nervous system,
                    the brain <hi rend="italic">(cn),</hi> is a double ganglion at the anterior end
                    of the body, and has been noticed in all the known forms with the exception of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Acoela.</hi> It is situated in front of or above the
                    pharynx; in those species in which a process of the intestine extends beyond the
                    region of the brain <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> figs. 7 and 8 viewed from the
                    ventral surface) it is placed below this. In such cases there is sometimes a
                    commissure encircling the prolongations of the intestine. Each of the two
                    ganglia gives off a strong longitudinal nerve cord (figs. 5-8, <hi rend="italic"
                    >In)</hi> from which arise branches going to the various organs of the body. The
                    structure of the nervous system is somewhat different in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhabdocoela,</hi><hi rend="italic">Tricladida,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polycladida.</hi> In the first group (figs. 5, 6) the two longitudinal cords
                    and their branches are the most feebly developed, and there is but rarely <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mesostoana, Monotus)</hi> a transverse commissure uniting the
                    longitudinal cords. These cords are very large in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trieladida,</hi> where the brain is to be regarded as a simple thickening of
                    them; in this group there are numerous transverse commissures between the
                    longitudinal nerve cords (fig. 7), and the nerves arising from them and passing
                    to the periphery form a subcutaneous nerve plexus within the muscular coat. Lang
                    has observed a similar nerve plexus in the <hi rend="italic">Polycladida,</hi>
                    the central nervous system of which differs from that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trieladida</hi> in that a number of stout nerve cords radiate outwards from the
                    brain as well as the two longitudinal cords; they are all united together by
                    numerous commissures, and a network is thus formed which extends throughout the

                    surface of the body is very sensitive and <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Polycladida)</hi> contains cells which end in tufts of fine
                    hairs, so that certain regions thus become specially sensitive and serve as
                    tactile organs. The anterior pointed extremity of the body in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhabdocoela</hi> is characterized by an abundant development of
                    rhabdites and tactile hairs, and thus becomes a special tactile organ; in other
                    cases this region of the body is transformed into a conical tactile proboscis
                    which can be retracted into a sheath <hi rend="italic">(Proboscida).</hi> In the
                    freshwater <hi rend="italic">Tricladida</hi> the anterior margin of the head is
                    richly innervated, and is beset with a special row of tactile cells which
                    contain no rhabdites; in the terrestrial forms of the same family <hi
                    rend="italic">(Bipalium)</hi> Moseley has described a row of papillae along the
                    crescent-shaped anterior extremity which can be extended and form tactile
                    organs; between the papillae are peculiar ciliated grooves connected with
                    nerves. In the <hi rend="italic">Polycladida</hi> there are tactile cells with
                    stiff hair-like processes on the summit of the dorsal papillae and the various
                    tentacular structures; the tentacles in this family also serve to support the
                    eyes.</p>
                <p>The majority of the Turbellarians possess eyes; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhabdocoelida</hi> commonly have two or four, as also have the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tricladida;</hi> the latter, however, are in some instances
                    furnished with a greater number arranged in a continuous row round the anterior
                    end of the body; in the <hi rend="italic">Polycladida</hi> there are from
                    fourteen to several hundred eyes arranged in two symmetrical groups round the
                    brain or scattered over the whole of the anterior margin of the body and upon
                    the tentacles. The eyes are always situated beneath the integument within the
                    parenchyma, sometimes directly upon the brain or connected with it by special
                    optic nerves. In its simplest form the eye is a pigmented spot with or without a
                    refractory lens-like body; the more complicated eyes consist of a pigmented
                    sheath containing a number of refracting rods which are connected at their outer
                    extremity with a series of retinal cells, one to each rod; the retinal cells are
                    prolonged into a nerve thread running to the brain; the arrangement of the
                    visual elements is therefore precisely the same as in the vertebrate eye. Of
                    great interest is the fact that in the <hi rend="italic">Polycladida</hi> the
                    number of eyes increases with the growth of the animal, and Lang has shown that
                    the eyes increase in number by actual division. On the other hand Carrière has
                    discovered by experimenting with certain freshwater <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tricladida</hi> that the compound eyes (those containing a number of rods) are
                    formed by the coalescence of several simple eyes. Only a single eye is found in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Monotida,</hi> which has the form of a simple pigment spot
                    in front of the otolith.</p>
                <p>Auditory organs are found in the shape of vesicles filled with fluid and
                    containing circular lenticular or spindle shaped otoliths formed of carbonate of
                    lime. Otolithic vesicles of this kind are found in many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhabdocoelida</hi><hi rend="italic">(Acoela,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Monotida,</hi> fig. 4, <hi rend="italic">ot)</hi> embedded in a depression on
                    the anterior surface of the brain. In the <hi rend="italic">Dendrocoelida</hi>
                    these organs are but rarely present.</p>
                <p>As a sensory organ of unknown function must be mentioned the paired lateral
                    ciliated grooves which are met with on either side of the brain in many <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhabdo</hi><hi rend="italic">oela</hi> (fig. 9, c); they are also
                    found commonly in <hi rend="smallcaps">Nemertines</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.
                    υ.),</hi> but are here more complicated in structure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reproductive</hi><hi rend="italic">Organs.—</hi> With a few
                    exceptions all the Turbellarians are hermaphrodite, and reproduce themselves
                    sexually. Only among the <hi rend="italic">Microstonιida</hi> is there an
                    asexual as well as a sexual reproduction. The male and female organs open to the
                    exterior, either through a common cloaca <hi rend="italic">{atrium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">genitale)</hi> on the ventral surface (most <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhabdocoelida</hi> and all <hi rend="italic">Tricladida,</hi> figs. 4-7), or
                    there are separate male and female apertures. In this case the male aperture is
                    generally placed in front of the female aperture (some <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhabdo-</hi><hi rend="italic">coelida</hi> and all <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polycladida,</hi> fig. 8), but occasionally the positions are reversed (certain
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhabdocoelida).</hi> The genital glands display a primitive
                    condition in being paired, though frequently the germarium (fig. 5, <hi
                    rend="italic">g)</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Rhabdocoela,</hi> and
                    occasionally also the testis, is developed only upon one side of the body.</p>
                <p>The structure of the female organs varies. In some cases there are simple ovaries
                    <hi rend="italic">{oυ</hi> in figs. 4, 8) in which the ova originate and become
                    fully mature without being furnished with the secretion of a second gland; in
                    other cases there is a division into germarium (fig. 5-7, <hi rend="italic"
                    >g)</hi> and yelk gland <hi rend="italic">{v)</hi>; the primordial ova or germs
                    originate in the former, and absorb the products of the yelk gland in the
                    atrium, where they become ready for fertilization. An intermediate condition is
                    seen in those forms where there is but a simple gland present which produces
                    germs in its upper portion and yelk in the lower portion. The ovaries are
                    generally compact round or tubular glands (fig. 4); sometimes they are formed of
                    a number of pear-shaped follicles (fig. 8); there is usually a simple or paired
                    uterus <hi rend="italic">{u)</hi> which retains the ova for some time before
                    they are deposited; sometimes, however, the ova undergo their development within
                    the uteras and are completely developed before expulsion; in some cases the
                    egg-shell is detached within the uterus so that the young are produced
                    alive.</p>
                <p>In Turbellarians without a yelk gland the uterus is a simple widening of the
                    oviduct (fig. 8); in those forms which possess additional yelk glands the uterus
                    is a simple or paired diverticulum of the atrium genitale (figs. 5, 7). The ova
                    are either surrounded by a more or less hard chitinous shell, or one shell
                    contains a number of ova (“cocoon” of <hi rend="italic">Tricladida</hi> and many
                    <hi rend="italic">Polycladida).</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Polycladida</hi>
                    deposit an egg-string which like that of the <hi rend="italic">Gastropoda</hi>
                    consists of a number of eggs bound together by a transparent albumen-like mass.
                    Many Rhabdocoel Turbellarians <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Mesostoma
                    ehrenbergii)</hi> produce two sorts of ova, thin-shelled summer ova and
                    thick-shelled winter ova; the latter are capable of withstanding a considerable
                    amount of desiccation, and are deposited in the autumn. The accessory female
                    organs of reproduction are represented by bursae seminales, which receive the
                    semen during copulation and retain it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n183/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0183-0174"/> until fertilization is accomplished. A further
                    division of labour is brought about by the presence of two diverticula of the
                    atrium genitale, one of which serves as a bursa copulatrix (fig. 5, <hi
                    rend="italic">be)</hi> and the other as a receptaculum seminis (τs) in the same
                    sense as the equivalent organs of insects. In the place of a special
                    receptaculum seminis the efferent duct of the ovary is often <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Mesostomida)</hi> metamorphosed into a chamber to contain the semen. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tricladida</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polycladida</hi> the
                    female efferent duct is often differentiated into a muscular vagina which
                    closely resembles the penis (figs. 7, 8, $ ).</p>
                <p>Finally, the female generative apparatus is furnished with a number of glands
                    which have been termed cement glands, albuminiparous glands, and shell
                    glands.</p>
                <p>The male sexual glands (figs. 4-8, <hi rend="italic">t)</hi> resemble the ovaries
                    in being either compact tubular (fig. 5) or follicular (figs. 4, 6, 7, 8)
                    structures. The vasa deferentia <hi rend="italic">{vd)</hi> are often widened
                    out into vesiculae seminales (figs. 4, 6, <hi rend="italic">vs)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> or there are special vesiculae seminales present, formed by
                    a portion of the penis (fig. 5, <hi rend="italic">vs).</hi> In the male organ of
                    copulation there is frequently found in addition to the spermatozoa an accessory
                    granulated secretion produced by special glands, but of unknown function.</p>
                <p>The muscular penis, especially in the <hi rend="italic">Rhabdocoela,</hi> has a
                    number of chitinous spines and hooks which serve to assist the animal in
                    maintaining a firm hold during copulation, but also in capturing and retaining
                    its prey. In <hi rend="italic">Macrorhynchus helgolandicus,</hi> Gff., there is
                    a peculiar poison dart connected with the male copulatory organ which only
                    serves the latter purpose. Very remarkable is the opening of the penis into the
                    mouth cavity in <hi rend="italic">Stylostomum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{Polycladida)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Prorhynchus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Rhabdocoela),</hi> and also the existence of several (2-15) pairs of male
                    copulatory organs and genital apertures in certain <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polycladida.</hi></p>
                <p>The spermatozoa vary much in form, especially in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhabdo</hi><hi rend="italic">coelida,</hi> where frequently the species of one
                    and the same genus are distinguished by the different form of the spermatozoa.
                    Copulation in the Turbellarians is generally reciprocal; only in those cases
                    where both summer and winter ova (see above) are formed do the former arise from
                    self-fertilization; the latter are the result of the copulation of two
                    individuals. The fertilization of the ova always takes place in the atrium
                    genitale. Many Turbellarians, especially the <hi rend="italic">Acoela,</hi>
                    display the phenomenon known as “successive hermaphroditism,” the male organs of
                    an individual attain to maturity first, and the female organs become ripe
                    subsequently. During copulation, therefore, one individual is physiologically a
                    male and the other a female.</p>
                <p>Asexual generation' is met with only in the <hi rend="italic">Microstomida</hi>;
                    it takes thé form of transverse division accompanied by budding. The posterior
                    third of the body becomes separated off by a septum running from the gut to the
                    integument and an external furrow corresponding to this; this part of the body
                    grows in length until it equals the anterior portion. By further repetition of
                    this double procedure of separation and equalization there, chains of 4, then 8,
                    16, and 32 buds are formed, which remain attached (fig. 9), and, although fresh
                    mouth apertures <hi rend="italic">{m', m'', m"')</hi> have been formed, are
                    still in communication by the intestinal lumen; this becomes closed before or
                    after the several buds break off from their connexion with each other.
                    Throughout the whole summer chains of zooids are met with; in autumn this
                    asexual division probably ceases to occur; the several individuals become
                    sexually mature, separate from each other, and lay eggs which remain quiescent
                    during the winter and in the spring develop into fresh individuals reproducing
                    asexually.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Development. —</hi> The study of the development of the
                    Turbellarians is unfortunately not very far advanced, particularly among the
                    small <hi rend="italic">Rhabdocoelida,</hi> which are extremely difficult to
                    investigate, and about which hardly any developmental facts are known. The

                    larval condition, during which they are furnished with provisional ciliated
                    processes (fig. 10); the <hi rend="italic">Acoela</hi> have also a free larval
                    form; pelagic larvae with a coat of long cilia apparently belonging to this
                    group have been observed by Ulianin. The segmentation of the ovum is total, but
                    unequal; an epibolic gastrula is formed and the aperture of invagination becomes
                    the permanent mouth of the adult.</p>
