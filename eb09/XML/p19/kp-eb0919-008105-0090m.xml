                    Hawthorne, who was in the class below him, and was his intimate friend, mentions
                    as his most notable characteristic at this time his “fascination of manner,
                    which has proved so magical in winning him an unbounded popularity.” The same
                    characteristic remained with him through life, and was the chief <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0091-0082"/> cause of his success. His abilities did not
                    greatly impress his classmates, and, although he took at length a good position,
                    he was not distinguished for scholarship. After leaving college in 1824 he
                    studied law with Judge Woodbury at Portsmouth, and afterwards in the law school
                    at Northampton, Mass., and with Judge Parker at Amherst, and came to the bar in
                    1827. His first appearance as a pleader was a failure, but this only incited him
                    to redoubled perseverance and determination. From the first he was a zealous
                    supporter of the Democratic party, and he took an active part in promoting the
                    election of Andrew Jackson to the presidency. In 1829 he was elected by his
                    native town to the State legislature, of which he was speaker in 1832-33. In the
                    latter year he was chosen a member of Congress, and in 1837 he was elected to
                    the senate of the United States. He displayed no striking oratorical gifts, but
                    as a member of the judiciary and other committees gained general respect. In
                    1842 he resigned his seat in the senate, and returned to the practice of the
                    law. His reputation at the bar was very high, his success being largely due to
                    his power of identifying himself with his client’s cause, and his strong
                    personal influence over a jury. In 1846 he was offered the position of
                    attorney-general of the United States, but declined it. On the outbreak of the
                    Mexican War he joined as a volunteer one of the companies raised in Concord. He
                    was soon after appointed colonel of the 9th regiment, and in March 1847
                    brigadier-general. At the battle of Contreras on the 19th of August he was
                    severely injured by the fall of his horse. At the close of the war in December
                    1847 he resigned his commission. In 1850 he was president of the convention for
                    revising the constitution of New Hampshire. In 1852, as candidate of the
                    Democratic party, he was elected president of the United States by 254 electoral
                    votes against 42 given to General Scott. The special feature of his inaugural
                    address was the support of slavery in the United States, and the announcement of
                    his determination that the Fugitive Slave Act should be strictly enforced. This
                    was the keynote of his administration, and pregnant with vital consequences to
                    the country. From it came during his term the Ostend conference and “manifesto,”
                    the repeal of the Missouri compromise, and the troubles in Kansas and Nebraska,
                    which crystallized the opposing forces into the Republican party, and led later
                    to the great rebellion. President Pierce, surrounded by an able cabinet, among
                    them Jefferson Davis as Secretary of War, firmly adhered throughout his
                    administration to the pro-slavery party. He failed, notwithstanding, to obtain
                    re-nomination, but was succeeded by James Buchanan, March 4, 1857, and retired
                    to his home in Concord, N. H., after spending some years in Europe. During the
                    war of 1861-65 his sympathies were wholly with the South, but, with the
                    exception of delivering a strong speech at Concord in 1863, he took no veιy
                    active part in politics. He died 8th October 1869.</p>
                <p>Among several lives of General Pierce, published during his candidature for the
                    presidency, special mention may be made of that by his friend Nathaniel
                    Hawthorne.</p>
