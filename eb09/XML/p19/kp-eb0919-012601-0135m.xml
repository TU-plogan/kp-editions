                <p><label type="entry">PISCICULTURE</label>. This art as at present pursued is not
                    limited to those animals which are grouped by zoologists in the class of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pisces,</hi><hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> Fishery” is now
                    understood to signify the exploitation of all products of the sea, lake, and
                    river, the capture of whales, turtles, pearls, corals, and sponges, as well as
                    of fish proper. The purpose of fish-culture (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >aquiculture,</hi> as it is in France more appropriately named) is to counteract
                    by reparative and also by preventive measures the destructive effects of
                    fishery.</p>
                <p>The possibility of exterminating aquatic animals within the restricted limits of
                    a lake or a river cannot be doubted; authorities are decidedly at variance,
                    however, as to the extent of the influence of man upon the abundance of life in
                    the open seas. Distinction must be made between the extermination of a species,
                    even in a restricted locality, and the destruction of a fishery; the former is
                    very unusual, and is seemingly impossible in the case of oceanic species, but
                    the latter, especially for limited regions, is of almost yearly occurrence.
                    Aquatic mammals, such as seals, may be entirely exterminated, especially when,
                    like the fur seal, they forsake the water for a season and resort to the land
                    for breeding purposes. The fur seals of the Pacific and Antarctic are now nearly
                    gone, except in two groups of islands, the Pribylovs in Alaska and the Commander
                    Islands in Siberia, where they enjoy Government protection, the islands being
                    leased to the Alaska Commercial Company by whom only a stated number, all
                    non-breeding males, may be killed each year, the permanence of the fishery being
                    thus perfectly secured. Aquatic mammals also which never leave the water, like
                    whales and sirenians, being conspicuous by reason of their size, and incapable
                    of rapid multiplication, may, especially when they breed near the shore, suffer
                    extermination. As examples may be cited the Arctic sea cow <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Rhytina stelleri}</hi> and the Pacific grey whale <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Rhachianectes</hi><hi rend="italic">glaucus},</hi> the former extinct, the
                    latter having practically become so within the present century. The sperm whale
                    is also rapidly disappearing. In the case of fixed animals like the oyster, the
                    corals, and the sponges, again, the colonies or beds may be swept out of
                    existence exactly as forests are hewn down. The native oyster beds of Europe are
                    for the most part gone, and still more rapid has been the recent destruction of
                    the oyster reefs in Pocomoke Sound, Maryland, a large estuary, formerly very
                    productive—the result being due more directly to the choking up of the beds by
                    the rubbish dragged over them by dredges, and the demolition of ledges suitable
                    for the reception of young spat, than to the removal of all the adult oysters,
                    which could, of course, never have been effected. The preservation of
                    oyster-beds is a matter of vital importance to the United States, for
                    oyster-fishing, unsupported by oyster-culture, will soon destroy the employment
                    of tens of thousands and a cheap and favourite-food of tens of millions of the
                    people. Something may undoubtedly be effected by laws which shall allow each bed
                    to rest for a period of years after each season of fishing upon it. It is,
                    however, the general belief that shell-fish beds must be cultivated as carefully
                    as are garden beds, and that this can be done only by giving to individuals
                    rights in submerged lands, similar to those which may be acquired upon shore. It
                    is probable that the present unregulated methods will prevail until the dredging
                    of the natural beds shall cease to be remunerative, and that the oyster industry
                    will then pass from the improvident fishermen to the painstaking oyster-grower,
                    with a corresponding increase in price and decrease in consumption. Such a
                    change has already taken place in France and Holland, and to a large extent in
                    England, but there appear to be almost unsurmountable difficulties in the way of
                    protecting the property of oyster-culturists from depredations—difficulties
                    apparently as formidable in England as in America.</p>
                <p>Fishes in ponds, lakes, or streams are quickly exterminated unless the young be
                    protected, the spawning season undisturbed, and wholesale methods of capture
                    prohibited. Salmon and trout streams are preserved in all countries of northern
                    Europe; and in Canada also a large service of fishery wardens is maintained. In
                    the United States there are in many of the older commonwealths excellent codes
                    of laws for the preservation of fish and game, which are enforced by anglers’
                    clubs. A river may quickly be emptied of its anadromous visitors, salmon, shad,
                    and alewives, by over-fishing in the spawning season, as well as by dams which
                    cut off the fish from their spawning-grounds. Numerous rivers in Europe and
                    America might be named in which this has occurred. In the same way, sea fishes
                    approaching the coasts to spawn in the bays or upon the shoals may be
                    embarrassed, and the numbers of each school decimated,—particularly if, as in
                    the case of the herring, the eggs are adhesive and become entangled in nets. Sea
                    fishes spawning in estuaries are affected much in the same manner as the salmon
                    in rivers, though in a less degree, by wholesale capture in stationary nets. The
                    shad and alewife fisheries of the United States are protected by an extensive
                    code of laws, varying in the several States and in the different rivers of each
                    State. The most satisfactory laws appear to be those which regulate the dates
                    when fishery must commence and end, and prescribe at least one day in each week,
                    usually Sunday, during which the ascent of the fish may not be interrupted.
                    Migratory, semi-migratory, or wandering fishes, ranging singly or in schools
                    over broad stretches of ocean, the mackerels, the tunnies, the sardines or
                    pilchards, the menhaden, the bluefish, the bonitoes, and the sque-teague, stand
                    apparently beyond the influence of human agency, especially since, so far as is
                    known, they spawn at a distance from the coast, or since the adults, when about
                    to spawn, cannot be reached by any kind of fishery apparatus. Their fecundity is
                    almost beyond comprehension, and in many instances their eggs float free near
                    the surface, and are quickly disseminated over broad areas. The conclusions
                    gained by Prof. Baird, U.S. commissioner of fisheries, agree exactly with those
                    of Prof. Huxley, that the number of any given kind of oceanic fish killed by man
                    is perfectly insignificant when compared with the destruction effected by their
                    natural enemies. Almost any body of water, be it a bay or sound, or be it the
                    covering of a ledge or shoal at sea, may be over-fished to such a degree that
                    fishing becomes unprofitable, especially if fishing be carried on in the
                    spawning season. In this manner, no doubt, have the coasts of England been
                    robbed of the formerly abundant supplies of turbot and sole.</p>
                <p>The character of the various destructive influences which man brings to bear upon
                    the inhabitants of the water and their effects having thus been briefly noticed,
                    the student of fish culture is confronted by the question, What can be done to
                    neutralize these destructive tendencies? There are evidently three things to
                    do:—(1) to preserve fish waters, especially those inland, as nearly as it may be
                    possible in their normal condition; (2) to prohibit wasteful or immoderate
                    fishing; and (3) to put into practice the art of fish breeding—(a) to aid in
                    maintaining a natural supply, (δ) to repair the effects of past improvidences,
                    and (c) to increase the supply beyond its natural limits rapidly enough to meet
                    the necessities of a constantly increasing population.</p>
                <p>The preservation of normal conditions in inland waters is comparatively -simple.
                    A reasonable system of forestry and water-purification is all that is required;
                    and this is needed not only by the fish in the streams but by the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0136-0127"/> people living on the banks. It has been shown
                    that a river which is too foul for fish to live in is not fit to flow near the
                    habitations of man. Obstructions, such as dams, may, in most instances, be
                    overcome by fish ladders. The salmon has profited much by those devices in
                    Europe, and the immense dams in American rivers will doubtless be passable even
                    for shad and alewives if the new system of fishway construction devised by Col.
                    M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Donald, and now being applied on the Savannah,
                    James, and Potomac, and other large rivers, fulfils its present promises of
                    success.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Report</hi> of United States Fish Commission for
                    1883.</p></note></p>
                <p>The protection of fish by law is what legislators have been trying to effect for
                    many centuries, and the success of their efforts must be admitted to have been
                    very slight indeed. Great Britain has at present two schools of
                    fisheryeconomists,—the one headed by Prof. Huxley, opposed to legislation, save
                    for the preservation of fish in inland waters; the other, of which Dr Francis
                    Day is the chief leader, advocating a strenuous legal regulation of sea
                    fisheries also. Continental Europe is by tradition and belief committed to the
                    last-named policy. In the United States, on the contrary, public opinion is
                    generally antagonistic to fishery legislation; and Prof. Baird, the commissioner
                    of fisheries, after carrying on for fourteen years, with the aid of a large
                    staff of scientific specialists, investigations upon this very question, has not
                    yet become satisfied that laws are necessary for the perpetuation of the sea
                    fisheries, nor has he ever recommended to Congress the enactment of any kind of
                    fishery laws</p>
                <p>Just here we meet the test problem in fish culture. Many of the most important
                    commercial fisheries of the world, the cod fishery, the herring fishery, the
                    sardine fishery, the shad and alewife fishery, the mullet fishery, the salmon
                    fishery, the whitefish fishery, the smelt fishery, and many others, owe their
                    existence to the fact that once a year these fishes gather together in closely
                    swimming schools, to spawn in shallow water, on shoals, or in estuaries and
                    rivers. There is a large school of <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> economists who
                    clamour for the complete prohibition of fishing during spawning time. Their
                    demand demonstrates their ignorance. Deer, game, birds, and other land animals
                    may easily be protected in the breeding season, and so may trout and other
                    fishes of strictly local habits. Not so the anadromous and pelagic fishes. If
                    they are not caught in the spawning season, they cannot be caught at all.</p>
                <p>The writer recently heard a prominent fish-culturist advocating before a
                    committee of the United States Senate the view that shad should not be caught in
                    the rivers because they come into the rivers to spawn. When asked what would
                    become of the immense shad-fisheries if this were done, he ventured the remark
                    that doubtless some ingenious person would invent a means of catching them at
                    sea. The fallacy in the argument of these economists lies, io part, in supposing
                    that it is more destructive to the progeny of a given fish to kill it when its
                    eggs are nearly ripe than to kill the same fish eight or ten months earlier. We
                    must not, however, ignore the counter-argument. Such is the mortality among fish
                    that only an infinitesimal percentage attains to maturity. Professor Möbius has
                    shown that for every grown qy⅛ter upon the beds of Schleswig-Holstein 1,045,000
                    have died. Only a very small percentage, perhaps not greater than this, of the
                    shad or the smelt ever comes upon the breeding grounds. Some consideration,
                    then, ought to be shown to those individuals which have escaped from their
                    enemies and have come up to deposit the precious burden of eggs. How much must
                    they be protected? Here the fish-culturist comes in with the proposition that
                    “it is cheaper to make fish so plentiful by artificial means that every
                    fisherman may take all he can catch than to enforce a code of protection
                    laws.”</p>
                <p>The salmon rivers of the Pacific slope of the United States, the shad rivers of
                    the east, and the whitefish fisheries of the lakes are now so thoroughly under
                    control by the fish-culturist that it is doubtful if any one will venture to
                    contradict his assertion. The question is whether he can extend his domain to
                    other species.</p>
                <p>Fish-culture in a restricted sense must sooner or later be resorted to in all
                    densely populated countries, for, with the utmost protection, nature unaided can
                    do but little to meet the natural demand for fish to eat. Pond-culture <hi
                    rend="italic">(Teichwirthschaft'),</hi> has been practised for many centuries,
                    and the carp and the gold-fish have become domesticated like poultry and cattle.
                    The culture of carp is an important industry in China and in Germany, though
                    perhaps not more so than it was in England three and four centuries ago; the
                    remains of ancient fish-stews may be seen upon almost every large estate in
                    England, and particularly in the vicinity of old monasteries. Strangely enough,
                    not a single well-conducted carp-pond exists in England to-day to perpetuate the
                    memory of the tens of thousands which were formerly sustained, and the carp,
                    escaping from cultivation, have reverted to a feral state and are of little
                    value. Until improved varieties of carp are introduced from Germany,
                    carp-culture can never be made to succeed in England. Carp-culture is rapidly
                    coming into favour in the United States; a number of young scale carp and
                    leather carp were imported in 1877 for breeding purposes, and the fish
                    commission has since distributed them to at least 30,000 ponds. Two railway cars
                    especially built for the purpose are employed during the autumn months
                    delivering cargoes of carp, often making journeys of over three thousand miles,
                    and special shipments have been made to Mexico and Brazil. The carp is not
                    recommended as a substitute for the salmon, but is especially suited to regions
                    remote from the sea where better-flavoured fish cannot be had in a fresh
                    condition.</p>
                <p>A kind of pond-culture appears to have been practised by the ancient Egyptians,
                    though in that country as in ancient Greece and Rome, the practice seems to have
                    been similar to that now employed in the lagoons of the Adriatic and of Greece,
                    and to have consisted in driving the young fish of the sea into artificial
                    enclosures or vivaria, when they were kept until they were large enough to be
                    used.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the art of artificially fecundating the ova of fish must
                    apparently be accredited to Stephen Ludwig Jacobi of Hohenhausen in Westphalia,
                    who, as early as 1748, carried on successful experiments in breeding salmon and
                    trout. The importance of this discovery was thoroughly appreciated at the time,
                    and from 1763 to 1800 was a fruitful subject of discussion in England, France,
                    and Germany. George III. of England in 1771 granted to Jacobi a life pension. It
                    has been claimed by many French writers that the process of artificial
                    fecundation was discovered as early as 1420 by Dorn Pinchon, a monk in the abbey
                    of Reome, but this claim is but a feeble one, not having been advanced until
                    1854, and it is believed by many that the practice of the French monk was simply
                    to collect and transplant the eggs which he had already found naturally
                    fertilized. However interesting to the antiquarian, the proceedings of Dom
                    Pinchon had no influence upon the progress of fish-culture. To Germany, beyond
                    question, belongs the honour of discovering and carrying into practical
                    usefulness the art of fishculture. Upon the estate of Jacobi, by the discoverer

                    years—from 1741 to 1825—though it was nearly a hundred years before public

                    a period during which its practice was never abandoned by the Germans.</p>
                <p>Fish-culture in Britain was inaugurated in 1837 by Mr John Shaw, gamekeeper to
                    the duke of Buccleuch at Drumlanrig, who, in the course of ichthyological
                    investigations, had occasion to fecundate the eggs of salmon and rear the young;
                    and, as regards France, an illiterate fisherman, Joseph Remy, living in the
                    mountains of the Vosges, rediscovered, as it is claimed, or at any rate
                    successfully practised, in association with Antoine Gehin, the culture of trout
                    in 1842. The originality and practical influence of Remy and Gehin’s work appear
                    to have been exaggerated by French writers. On the other hand the establishment
                    in 1850 at Huningue (Hiiningen) in Alsace by the French Government of the first
                    fish-breeding station, or “pisci-factory,” as it was named by Professor Coste,
                    is of great significance, since it marks the beginning of public fishculture.
                    The art discovered in Germany was practised in Italy as early as 1791 by
                    Baufalini, in France in 1820, in Bohemia in 1824, in Great Britain in 1837, in
                    Switzerland in 1842, in Norway under Government patronage in 1850, in Finland in
                    1852, in the United States in 1853, in Belgium, Holland, and Russia in 1854, in
                    Canada about 1863, in Austria in 1865, in Australasia, by the introduction of
                    English salmon, in 1862, and in Japan in 1877.</p>

                    the most difficult problem in American oyster-culture by completing a mechanical
                    device for preventing the escape of the newly hatched oysters while swimming

                <p>The fertilization of the <hi rend="italic">fish egg</hi> is the simplest of
                    processes, consisting, as every one knows, in simply pressing the ripe ova from

                    male upon them. Formerly a great deal of water was placed in the pan; now the
                    <hi rend="italic">“dry</hi> method, with only a little, discovered by the
                    Russian Vrasski in 1854, is preferred. The eggs having been fertilized, the most
                    difficult part of the task remains, namely, the care of the eggs until they are
                    hatched, and the care of the young until they are able to care for
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>The apparatus employed is various in principle, to correspond to the physical
                    peculiarities of the eggs. Fish-culturists divide eggs into four classes, viz.
                    :—(1) heavy eggs, non-adhesive, whose specific gravity is so great that they
                    will not float, such as the eggs of the salmon and trout; (2) heavy adhesive
                    eggs, such as those of the herring, smelt, and perch; (3) semi-buoyant eggs,
                    like those of the shad and’whitefish <hi rend="italic">(Coregonus)</hi>; and (4)
                    buoyant eggs, like those of the cod and mackerel. (1) Heavy non-adhesive eggs
                    are placed in thin layers either upon gravel, grilles of glass, or sheets of
                    wire cloth, in receptacles through which a current of water is constantly
                    passing. There are numerous forms of apparatus for eggs of this class, but the
                    most effective are those in which a number of trays of wire cloth, sufficiently
                    deep to carry single layers of eggs, are placed one upon the other in a box or
                    jar into which the water enters from below, passing out at the top. (2) Heavy
                    adhesive eggs are received upon bunches of twigs or frames of glass plates to
                    which they adhere, and which are placed in receptacles through which water is
                    passing. (3) Semi-buoyant eggs, or those whose specific gravity is but slightly
                    greater than that of the water, require altogether different treatment. They are
                    necessarily placed together in large numbers, and to prevent their settling upon
                    the bottom of the receptacle it is necessary to introduce a gentle current from
                    below. For many years these eggs could be hatched only in floating receptacles
                    with wire-cloth bottoms, placed at an angle to the current of the stream in
                    which they were fixed, the motion of which was utilized to keep the eggs in
                    suspension. Later an arrangement of plunging-buckets was invented, cylindrical
                    receptacles with tops and bottoms of wire cloth, which were suspended in rows
                    from beams worked up and down at the surface of the water by machinery. The eggs
                    in the cylinders were thus kept constantly in motion. Finally the device now
                    most in favour was perfected; this is a receptacle, conical, or at least with a
                    constricted termination, placed with its apex downward, through which passes
                    from below a strong current, keeping the eggs constantly suspended and in
                    motion. This form of apparatus, of which the Μ‘Donald and Clark hatching-jars
                    are the most perfect development, may be worked in connexion with any common
                    hydrant.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    contrivances for sustaining a lateral circular eddy of water in the
                    receptacle.</p>
                <p>The use of refrigerators, to retard the development of the eggs until such time
                    as it is most convenient to take care of the fry, has been extensively
                    introduced in the United States, and has been experimented upon in Germany.</p>
                <p>The distinction between private and public fish-culture must be carefully
                    observed. The maintenance of ponds for carp, trout, and other domesticated
                    species is an industry to be classed with poultryraising and bee-keeping, and
                    its interest to the political economist is but slight. The proper function of
                    public fish-culture is the stocking of the public waters with fish in which no
                    individual can claim the right of property. This is being done in the rivers of
                    the United States, with salmon, shad, and alewives, and in the lakes with
                    whitefish. The use of steamships and steam machinery, the construction of
                    refrigerating transportation cars, two of which, with a corps of trained
                    experts, are constantly employed by the United States Fish Commission, moving
                    fish and eggs from Maine to Texas, and from Maryland to California, and the
                    maintenance of permanent hatching stations, seventeen in number, in different
                    parts of the continent, are forms of activity only attainable by Government aid.
                    Equally unattainable by private effort would be the enormous experiments in
                    transplanting and acclimatizing fish in new waters,—such as the planting of
                    Californian salmon in the rivers of the east, land-locked salmon and smelt in
                    the lakes and rivers of the interior, and shad in California and the Mississippi
                    valley, and the extensive acclimatization of German carp; the two last-named
                    experiments carried out within a period of three years have met with successes
                    beyond doubt, ami are of the greatest importance to the country; the others have
                    been more or less successful, though their results are not yet fully realized.
                    It has been demonstrated, however, that the great river fisheries of the United
                    States, which produced in 1880 48,000,000 lb of alewives, 18,000,000 lb of shad,
                    52,000,000 lb of salmon, besides bass, sturgeon, and smelt, and worth “at first
                    hand” between 4,000,000 and 6,000,000 dollars, are entirely under the control of
                    the fish-culturist to sustain or to destroy, and are capable of immense
                    extension.</p>
                <p>Having now attempted to define the field of modern fish-culture, and to show what
                    it has already accomplished, it remains to be stated what appear to be its
                    legitimate aims and limitations.</p>
                <p>The aims of modern fish-culture, as understood by the present writer, are—(1) to
                    arrive at a thorough knowledge of the life history from beginning to end of
                    every species of economic value, the histories of the animals and plants upon
                    which they feed or upon which their food is nourished, the histories of their
                    enemies and friends, and the friends and foes of their enemies and friends, as
                    well as the currents, temperatures, and other physical phenomena of the waters
                    in relation to migration, reproduction, and growth; and (2) to apply this
                    knowledge in such a practical manner that every form of fish shall be at least
                    as thoroughly under control as are now the salmon, the shad, the alewife, the
                    carp, and the whitefish. Its limitations are precisely those of scientific
                    agriculture and animal rearing, since, although certain physical conditions may
                    constantly intervene to thwart man’s efforts in any given direction, it is quite
                    within the bounds of reasonable expectation to be able to understand what these
                    are, and how their effects are produced. An important consideration concerning
                    the limitations of fish-culture must always be kept in mind in weighing the
                    arguments for and against its success, viz., that effort towards the
                    acclimatization of fishes in new waters is not fish-culture, but is simply one
                    of the necessary experiments upon which fish-culture may be based. The
                    introduction of carp from Germany to the United States was not fish-culture; it
                    was an experiment; the experiment has succeeded, and fish-culture is now one of
                    its results. The introduction of California salmon to the Atlantic slope was an
                    experiment; it has not succeeded; its failure has nothing to do with the success
                    of fish-culture. If any one wants to see successful fishculture in connexion
                    with this fish let him go to the Sacramento river. The introduction of shad to
                    the Pacific coast was an experiment; it succeeded; shad culture can now be
                    carried on without fear of failure by the Fish Commission of the Pacific States.
                    An equally established success is whitefish culture in the Great Lakes. The
                    experiments with cod and Spanish mackerel were not fish-culture, though it is
                    hoped that they may yet lead up to it. And there is every reason to believe,
                    from experiments in part completed, that the dominion of fish-culture may be
                    extended in like manner to certain of the great sea fisheries, such as the cod,
                    haddock, herring, mackerel, and Spanish mackerel fisheries.</p>

                <p>Public fish-culture exists only in the United States and Canada. European
                    fish-culturists have always operated with only small numbers of eggs. The
                    hatchery of Sir James Maitland at Howie ton near Stirling, Scotland, may be
                    specially mentioned in this connexion, since it is undoubtedly the finest
                    private fish-cultural establishment in the world. It is described in one of the
                    Conference papers of the International Fishery Exhibition.</p>
                <p>The recent organization of the Scottish Fishery Board, and the establishment of a
                    society for the biological investigation of the coasts of Great Britain, are
                    indications that England, having at last recognized the importance of protecting
                    its extensive fishery industries, will at no distant time become a leader in
                    matters of fishery economy.</p>
                <p>Holland, Germany, and Norway have hitherto been the only European nations
                    manifesting intelligent enterprise in the consideration of fishery questions in
                    general, although fair work has been done by Sweden and other countries in the
                    treatment ol limited special branches of this industry. In Germany the functions
                    of the German Fishery Union <hi rend="italic">{Deutscher Fischerei-Verein')</hi>
                    and of the commission for the investigation of the German seas <hi rend="italic"

                    together, represent practically the two divisions of the work of the United
                    States Fish Commission, —propagation and investigation. The latter body is
                    composed of a commission of scientific men, whose head is appointed by the
                    Government; it is carried on with Government funds, but is not in any way
                    subjected to Government control, the central headquarters being at Kiel instead
                    of Berlin. The Fischerei-Verein is also a private body, under the patronage of
                    the emperor, and with funds partly furnished by the Government and having also
                    the general direction of the National Fish Cultural Society at.Hiiningen. This,
                    also, is not a bureau of any Government department, but managed entirely by its
                    own officers. It is the only European fisheries institution that has so far
                    constituted a thoroughly successful experiment. The Netherlands Commission of
                    Sea Fisheries <hi rend="italic">{Collegie voor de Zeevisscherijen)</hi> is a
                    body of fifteen men, chiefly workers in science, occupying a responsible
                    position in the national economy, their function being “to advise Government in
                    all subjects connected with the interest of the fisheries.” During the
                    twenty-five years of its existence, says its historian, ‘ ‘ the commission has
                    constantly been consulted by Government on the different measures that might be
                    beneficial, or on the abolition of others that were detrimental, to the
                    fisheries.” The Society for the Development of Norwegian Fisheries <hi
                    rend="italic">{Selskabet for de Norske Fiskeriers Fremme)</hi> is an
                    organization independent of the Government, and electing its own officers, but
                    receiving large grants from Government to carry on work precisely similar to
                    that of the United States Commission. In 1882-83 these grants amounted to 49,000
                    kroner.</p>
                <p>As an illustration of the interest manifested in fish-culture in the United
                    States, it may be stated that from 1871 to 1883 $1,190,955 has been appropriated
                    by Congress for the use of the United States Fish Commission, and that
                    thirty-five of the State Governments have made special grants for fish-culture,
                    in the aggregate equal to $1,101,000. To show the wholesale methods employed in
                    this, a letter by Mr Livingston Stone, superintendent of one of the seventeen
                    hatcheries supported by the United States Fish Commission, that on the Μ‘Cloud
                    river in California, may be quoted :—</p>
                <p>“In the eleven years since the salmon-breeding station has been in operation
                    67,000,000 eggs have been taken, most of which have been distributed in the
                    valions States of the Union. Several millions, however, have been sent to
                    foreign countries, including Germany, France, Great Britain, Denmark, Russia,
                    Belgium, Holland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the Sandwich Islands.
                    About 15,000,000 have been hatched at the station, and the young fish placed in
                    the M <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> Cloud and other tributaries of the
                    Sacramento river. So great have been the benefits of this restocking of the
                    Sacramento that the statistics of tire salmon fisheries show that the annual
                    salmon catch of the river has increased 5,000,000 pounds each year during the
                    last few years.”</p>
                <p>Fifteen canneries now are fully supplied, whereas in 1872 the single
                    establishment then on the river was obliged to close for lack of fish. In the
                    two Government hatcheries at Alpena and Northville, Michigan, there have been
                    produced in the winter of 1883-84 over 100,000,000 eggs of the whitefish, <hi
                    rend="italic">Coregonus clupeif ormis,</hi> and the total number of young fish
                    to be placed in the Great Lakes this year by these and the various State
                    hatcheries will exceed 225,000,000. The fishermen of the Great Lakes admit that
                    but for public fish-culture half of them would be obliged to abandon their
                    calling. Instances of great improvement might be cited in connexion with nearly
                    every shad river in the United States. In the Potomac alone the annual yield has
                    been brought up by the operations of fish-culture from 668,000 lb in 1877 to an
                    average of more than 1,600,000 lb in recent years. In 1882 carp bred in the Fish
                    Commission ponds in Washington were distributed in lots of 20 to 10,000
                    applicants throughout every State and Territory, at an average distance of more
                    than 900 miles, the total mileage of the shipments being about 9,000,000 miles,
                    and the actual distance traversed by the transportation car 34,000 miles. There
                    still exists in Europe some scepticism as to the beneficial results of
                    fishculture. Such doubts do not exist on the other side of the Atlantic, if the
                    continuance from year to year of liberal grants of public money may be
                    considered to be a test of public confidence.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the best general treatises upon the methods of artificial propagation
                    practised by pisciculturists are Herr Max Von Dem Borne’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fischzucht,</hi> Berlin, 1880, and from the philosophical standpoint, Dr
                    Francis Day’s <hi rend="italic">Fish Culture,</hi> one of the handbooks of the
                    International Fisheries Exhibition of 1883. The reports and bulletins of the
                    United States Fish Commission, in twelve volumes, from 1873 to 1884, contain
                    full descriptions of American methods, and discussions of all foreign
                    discoveries and movements. Two prominent London journals, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Field</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Land and Water,</hi> contain authoritative
                    articles upon the subject, and the museum of fisheries and fish-culture at South
                    Kensington, enriched as it has been by the contributions of exhibitors at the
                    Fisheries Exhibition of 1883, is an excellent exponent of the methods and
                    implements in use in the past and at present. For a history of the subject see
