                    over the first half of the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> His
                    father’s name was Ariston, and his mother’s family, which claimed descent from
                    Solon, included Critias, one pf the thirty tyrants, and other Athenian notables.
                    That throughout his early manhood he was the devoted friend of Socrates, that in
                    middle life he taught those who resorted to him in the grove named of Academus,
                    near the Cephisus, and there founded the first great philosophical school, that
                    (with alleged interruptions) he continued to preside over the Academy until his
                    death, are matters of established fact. It is said by Aristotle that he was at
                    one time intimate with Cratylus the Heraclitean. Beyond this we have no
                    authentic record of his outward life. That his name was at first Aristocles, and
                    was changed to Plato because of the breadth of his shoulders or of his style or
                    of his forehead, that he wrestled well,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    that (as is told of other Greek philosophers) he travelled to Cyrene and
                    conversed with priests in Egypt, are statements of Diogenes Laertius, which rest
                    on more or less uncertain tradition. The express assertion—which this author
                    attributes to Hermodorus—that after the death of Socrates Plato and other
                    Socratics took refuge with Euclides in Megara, has a somewhat stronger claim to
                    authenticity. But the fact cannot be regarded as certain, still less the
                    elaborate inferences which have been drawn from it. The romantic legend of
                    Plato’s journeys to Sicily, and of his relations there with the younger
                    Dionysius and the princely but unfortunate Dion, had attained some degree of
                    consistency before the age of Cicero, and at an unknown but probably early time
                    were worked up into the so-called <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> of Plato, now
                    all but universally discredited. Nor is there sufficient ground for supposing,
                    as some have done, that an authentic tradition is perceptible behind the myth.

                <p>It is more important than any further balancing of uncertainties to observe the
                    intellectual tendencies of the preceding generation (c. 430-400 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi></p>
                <p>The later years of the Peloponnesian War witnessed much mental disturbance and
                    restlessness at Athens. Thoughtful minds looked forward with apprehension and
                    backwards with regret, while even the most thoughtless were stirred into
                    superficial activity. More than at any time since the age of Clisthenes, the
                    city was divided, and a man’s foes were often men of his own tribe or deme.
                    Athenian politics were more factious and less significant than ever. Contention
                    in the law-courts and rivalries in the assembly had for many men a more
                    absorbing interest than questions of peace and war. Hereditary traditions had
                    relaxed their hold, and political principles were not yet formulated. Yet there
                    was not less scope on this account for personal ambition, while the progress of
                    democracy, the necessity of conciliating the people, and the apportionment of
                    public offices by lot had a distracting and, to reflecting persons, often a
                    discouraging effect.</p>
                <p>For those amongst whom Plato was brought up this effect was aggravated by the
                    sequel of the oligarchical revolution, while, on the other hand, for some years
                    after the restoration of the democracy, a new stimulus had been imparted, which,
                    though of shσr∙t duration, was universally felt.</p>
                <p>The events and circumstances thus briefly summarized appear in two ways to have
                    encouraged the diffusion of ideas. The ambitious seem to have welcomed them as a
                    means of influence, while those who turned from public life were the more
                    stimulated to speculative disputation. However this may have been, it is
                    manifest that before the beginning of the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> the intellectual atmosphere was already charged with a new force,
                    which although essentially one may be differently described, according to the
                    mode of its development, as (1) rhetorical and (2) theoretical and
                    “sophistical.” This last word indicates the channel through which the current
                    influences were mostly derived. A new want, in the shape both of interested and
                    of disinterested curiosity, had insensibly created a new profession. Men of
                    various fatherlands, some native Athenians, but more from other parts of Hellas,
                    had set themselves to supplement the deficiencies of ordinary education, and to
                    train men for the requirements of civic life. More or less consciously they
                    based their teachings on the philosophical dogmas of an earlier time, when the
                    speculations of Xenophanes, Heraclitus, or Parmenides had interested only a few
                    “wise men.” Those great thoughts were now to be expounded, so that “even
                    cobblers might understand.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Theset.,</hi> 180 D.</p></note> The self-appointed
                    teachers found a rich field and abundant harvest among the wealthier youth, to
                    the chagrin of the old-fashioned Athenian, who sighed with Aristophanes for the
                    good old days when men knew less and listened to their elders and obeyed the
                    customs of their fathers. And such distrust was not wholly unfounded. For,
                    amidst much that was graceful and improving, these novel questionings had an
                    influence that, besides being unsettling, was aimless and unreal. A later
                    criticism may discern in them the two great tendencies of naturalism and
                    humanism. But it may be doubted if the sophist was himself aware of the
                    direction of his own thoughts. For, although Prodicus or Hippias could debate a
                    thesis and moralize with effect, they do not appear to have been capable of
                    speculative reasoning. What passed for such was often either verbal quibbling or
                    the pushing to an extreme of some isolated abstract notion. That <hi
                    rend="italic">prudens</hi><hi rend="italic">quaestio</hi> which is <hi
                    rend="italic">dimidium,</hi><hi rend="italic">scientiae</hi> had not yet been
                    put. And yet the hour for putting it concerning human life was fully come. For
                    the sea on which men were drifting was profoundly troubled, and would not sink
                    back into its former calm. Conserva tive reaction was not less hopeless than the
                    dreams of theorists were mischievously wild. In random talk, with gay,
                    irresponsible energy, the youth were debating problems which have exercised
                    great minds in Europe through all after time.</p>
                <p>Men’s thoughts had begun to be thus disturbed and eager when Socrates arose. To
                    understand him is the most necessary preliminary to the study of Plato. In our
                    first authentic knowledge of him he is a man in mature life, attracting the
                    attention of his fellow-citizens no less by his courage as a soldier than by his
                    strange-familiar presence in the Athenian agora. Like the cicada of the trees by
                    the Hissus, his voice was never silent—except when checked by his divine
                    monitor, or when wrapt, as he sometimes<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n204/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0204-0195"/> was for hours, in a catalepsy of reverie (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Socrates).</hi> When he appeared in the market-place about
                    midday, ready to single out his man for questioning, he had already spent some
                    hours in the wrestling-schools, conversing with the youth. This was not, as it
                    appeared to his contemporaries, mere idleness or mental dissipation (αδoλ∈σχια),
                    but the exercise of his self-chosen profession. There is no reason to doubt the
                    general truth of the assertion which Plato attributes to him in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Apologia.</hi> He felt a divine vocation to examine himself by
                    questioning other men. Gifted with an iron frame, and having trained himself to
                    have fewer wants than a soldier or a slave, he could devote all his time to this
                    one object, without engaging in remunerative business, or setting hours apart
                    for recreation, since he was indefatigable alike in body and mind. He was really
                    doing for the Athenians, whether they would or no, what the sophist professed to
                    do for his adherents, and what such men as Protagoras and Prodicus had actually
                    done in part. One obvious difference was that he would take no fee. But there
                    was another and more deep-lying difference, which distinguished him not only
                    from the contemporary sophists but from the thinkers of the previous age. This
                    was the Socratic attitude of inquiry.</p>
                <p>The sceptical movement had confused men’s notions as to the value of ethical
                    ideas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Caird,, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hegel,</hi> p. 168.</p></note> “If ‘ right ’ is one thing in
                    Athens and another at Sparta, why strive to follow right rather than expediency?
                    The laws put restraint on Nature, which is prior to them. Then why submit to
                    law?” And the ingenuities of rhetoric had stirred much unmeaning disputation.
                    Every case seemed capable of being argued in opposite ways. Even on the great
                    question of the ultimate constitution of things, the conflicting theories of
                    absolute immutability and eternal change appeared to be equally irrefragable and
                    equally untenable.</p>
                <p>Now Socrates first of all maintained imperturbably the simple habits of an
                    ordinary Athenian citizen, observing scrupulously even minute religious customs,
                    entering also unreservedly into the lightest pastimes of his associates, while
                    the plain and strenuous tenor of his own peculiar life remained unaffected. But
                    into all he carried the same irrepressible, insatiable spirit of search, to
                    which nothing human was alien or uninteresting. Taking men and women as he found
                    them, and conversing casually, as it appeared, on the topic which chanced to
                    interest his hearer, he had not gone far before he had unmasked some vain
                    pretence, cut folly to the quick, or raised some doubt of wide significance.
                    And, though he often ended with negation, his negative achievements had a
                    positive aim. For there underlay the process even when most ironical the
                    conviction, not less profound because implicit, that in spite of false
                    appearances, in spite of error, there are realities not undiscoverable, and
                    whatsoever is real is good. His hearers had been confused by contradictory
                    voices,—one crying “All is motion,” another “All is rest”; one “The absolute is
                    unattainable,” another “The relative alone is real ”; some upholding a vague
                    sentiment of traditional right, while some declared for arbitrary convention and
                    some for the “law of nature.” Some held that virtue was spontaneous, some that
                    it was due to training, and some paradoxically denied that either vice or
                    falsehood had any meaning. The faith of Socrates, whether instinctive or
                    inspired, remained untroubled by these jarring tones. He did not ask—“Is virtue
                    a reality ?” or “Is goodness a delusion ?” But, with perfect confidence that
                    there was an answer, he asked himself and others “What is it ?” (τι εστi); or,
                    more particularly, as Xenophon testifies, “What is a state? What is a statesman?
                    What is just? What is unjust?</p>
                <p>What is government? What is it to be a ruler of men ?” In this form of question,
                    however simple, the originality of Socrates is typified; and by means of it he
                    laid the first stone, not only of the fabric of ethical philosophy, but of
                    scientific method. The secret of his success lay in the combination of a deep
                    sense of human ignorance with a confidence not less deep in the power of
                    reason.</p>
                <p>The first result, and, as the Platonic Socrates declares, the only result he had
                    obtained, was the consciousness of knowing nothing. But he who knows that he
                    knows nothing is disposed to seek, and only those who seek will find. And the
                    seeking mind attains, if not to knowledge, yet to a new standard of knowing. So
                    long as results are contradictory, so long as negative instances are
                    successfully applied, the searcher may make progress but is still to seek. For
                    the aim of inquiry is the universal.</p>
                <p>Human life and experience the sphere of search; truth and good, regarded as
                    identical, the end of it; universality the test of reality, conversation the
                    method, rational thought the means,—these are the chief notes of the dialectic
                    of Socrates. Applying the native strength of his intelligence directly to the
                    facts of life, he revealed their significance in countless ways, by unthought-of
                    generalizations, by strange analogies, combining what men had not combined,
                    distinguishing what they had not distinguished, —but always with the single aim
                    of rousing them to the search after eternal truth and good.</p>
                <p>The spirit which led on towards this unseen goal was not less practical than
                    speculative. Socrates desired not only that men might know, but that they might
                    know and do. Utility is the watchword no less of the Socratic than of the
                    Baconian induction. But Socrates never doubted that if men once know they will
                    also do. His own conscious conviction of the unity of truth and good he believed
                    to be unconsciously the basis of all men’s actions. They erred, he thought, from
                    not seeing the good, and not because they would not follow it if seen. This is
                    expressed in the Socratic <hi rend="italic">dicta,</hi> “Vice is ignorance,”
                    “Virtue is knowledge.” Men therefore must be brought to see the good and true,
                    and that they may see it they must first be made aware that they do not see.</p>
                <p>This lifelong work of Socrates, in which the germs of ethics, psychology, and
                    logic were contained,—after it had been sealed by the death in which he
                    characteristically at once obeyed his countrymen and convinced them of error,—
                    was idealized, developed, dramatized—first embodied and then extended beyond its
                    original scope—in the writings of Plato, which may be described as the literary
                    outcome of the profound impression made by Socrates upon his greatest
                    follower.</p>
                <p>These writings (in pursuance of the importance given by Socrates to conversation)
                    are all cast in the form of imaginary dialogue. But in those which are
                    presumably the latest in order of composition this imaginative form interferes
                    but little with the direct expression of the philosopher’s own thoughts. The
                    many-coloured veil at first inseparable from the features is gradually worn
                    thinner, and at last becomes almost imperceptible.</p>
                <p>Little more will be attempted in the following pages than to give a general
                    outline of these immortal works in the order which is on the whole most
                    probable, omitting those whose claim to authenticity is weakest, and passing
                    lightly over some which, although genuine, are less important than the rest, or
                    have less to do with the main current of Plato’s thought.</p>
                <p>The Platonic dialogues are not merely the embodiment of the mind of Socrates and
                    of the reflexions of Plato. They are the portraiture of the highest intellectual
                    life of Hellas in the time of Plato,—a life but distantly related to <pb

                    interrupted by them. Athens appears as the centre of the excitable Hellenic

                    questions of Socrates, although in the pages of Plato, even more than in
                    reality, he only “whispers with a few striplings in a corner.” For, in the
                    Platonic grouping, the agora, which was the chief scene of action for the real
                    Socrates, retires into the background, and he is principally seen consorting
                    with his chosen companions, who are also friends of Plato, and with the
                    acquaintances whom he makes through them. The scene is narrowed (for the Academy
                    was remote from the bustle of resort, and Plato judged the Hellenic world
                    securely from the vantage-ground of partial retirement)— but the figures are
                    distinct and full of life. In reading the dialogues, we not only breathe the
                    most refined intellectual atmosphere, but are also present witnesses of the
                    urbanity, the freedom, the playfulness, the generous warmth of the “best
                    society” in Athens. For Plato has a numerous repertory of <hi rend="italic"
                    >dramatis personae,</hi> who stand in various relations to his chief
                    character—the impetuous Chaerephon, Apollodorus the inseparable weak brother,
                    old Crito the true-hearted, Phaedo the beloved disciple, Simmias and Cebes, who
                    have been with Philolaus, the graceful and ingenuous Phaedrus, the petulant
                    Philebus, Theaetetus of the philosophic nature, who is cut ofi in his prime, and
                    the incorrigible Alcibiades; then Plato’s own kinsmen—Glaucon the irrepressible
                    in politics, in quarrel, and in love, Adimantus, solid and grave, Critias in his
                    phase of amateur philosopher, and not as what he afterwards became, Charmides,
                    not in fiery manhood, but in his first bloom of diffident youth; and many others
                    who appear as mere acquaintances, but have an interest of their own—the
                    accomplished Agathon, the gay Aristophanes, Eryximachus the all-worthy
                    physician, Meno, light of spirit, Callias, entertainer of sophists, Callicles
                    the wilful man of the world, Cephalus the aged father of Lysias, and Nicias the
                    honoured soldier. All these appear, not as some of them do on the page of
                    history, in sanguinary contention or fierce rivalry, but as peaceful Athenians,
                    in momentary contact with Socrates, whose electric touch now benumbs and now
                    exhilarates, and sometimes goads to frenzy of love or anger. Still more
                    distantly related to him, as it were standing in an outer circle, are the
                    imposing forms of Gorgias and Protagoras, surrounded with the lesser lights of
                    Hippias, Prodicus, and Polus. Thrasymachus, Euthydemus, Dionysodorus hang round
                    like comic masks, adding piquancy to the design. The adversaries Anytus and
                    Meletus are allowed to appear for a moment, but soon vanish. The older
                    philosophers, though Socrates turned away from them, also make their entrance on
                    the Platonic stage. Parmenides with his magnificent depth is made to converse
                    with the imaginary Socrates, who is still quite young. A stranger from Elea
                    plays an important part in some later dialogues, and Timaeus the Pythagorean is
                    introduced discoursing of the creation of the world. In these dialogues Socrates
                    is mostly silent; in the <hi rend="italic">Philebus</hi> he has lost himself in
                    Plato; and in the twelve books of the <hi rend="italic">Laws,</hi> where an
                    unnamed Athenian is the chief speaker, even the Platonic Socrates finally
                    disappears.</p>
                <p>Now, in evolving his philosophy from the Socratic basis, Plato works along three
                    main lines,—the ethical and political, the metaphysical or scientific, and the
                    mystical. All three are often intimately blended, as in the close of <hi
                    rend="italic">Rep.,</hi> bk. vi., and even where one element is uppermost the
                    others are not wholly suppressed. But this distinction, like that sometimes made
                    in modern philo sophy between the good, the true, and the beautiful, is one
                    which, if not unduly pressed, may be usefully borne in mind. Having noted this
                    once for all, we pass to the more detailed consideration of the several
                    dialogues.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Laches, Charmides, Lysis.—</hi> In this first group Socrates
                    is dealing tentatively with single ethical notions. The result in each case is a
                    confession of ignorance, but the subject has been so handled as to point the way
                    to more fruitful discussions in the future. And suggestions are casually thrown
                    out which anticipate some of the most far-reaching of Plato’s subsequent
                    contemplations.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Laches</hi> is a vigorous sketch, in which the characters
                    of the soldier, the aged citizen, and the prudent general are well preserved;
                    and Socrates is seen conversing with his elders, although with reference to the
                    treatment of the young. The question raised is the definition of courage; and
                    the humour of the piece consists in showing that three men, all of whom are
                    unquestionably brave, are unable to give an account of bravery, or to decide
                    whether courage is an animal instinct or a mental accomplishment.</p>
                <p>Similarly, in the dialogue which bears his name, the temperate Charmides, of whom
                    all testify that (as Aristophanes has it<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Nub.,</hi> 995, τηs <hi rend="italic"
                    >a'Λoυs μtλλtιs</hi><hi rend="italic">τ&amp;γαλμ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ivaπλησaι.</hi></p></note>) he “fills up the gracious mould of modesty,” is
                    hopelessly embarrassed when challenged by the Socratic method to put in words
                    his conception of the modesty or temperance which he possesses, and which, as
                    Socrates assures him, is a priceless gift. The <hi rend="italic">Charmides</hi>
                    contains some hints of Platonic notions, such as that of knowledge as
                    self-consciousness, and of virtue as “doing one’s own business.”</p>
                <p>The graceful little dialogue which bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Lysis</hi>
                    ends, like the two former, with a confession of failure. Socrates, Lysis, and
                    Menexenus are all friends, and think highly of friendship, yet after many
                    efforts they are unable to tell “what friendship is.” Yet some of the
                    suggestions which are here laid aside are afterwards allowed to reappear. The
                    notion that “what is neither good nor evil loves the good because of the
                    presence of evil” is expanded and emphasized in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Symposium.</hi> And the conception of an ideal object of friendship, an <hi
                    rend="italic">avτb</hi><hi rend="italic">φίλον</hi> (though rejected as in the
                    criticism of Aristotle by the characteristic <hi rend="italic">reductio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad infinitum'),</hi> is destined to have a wider scope in the
                    history of Platonism.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Protagoras, Io, Meno.—</hi> The previous dialogues have
                    marked the distinction between unconscious and conscious morality, and have also
                    brought out the Socratic tendency to identify virtue with the knowledge of good.
                    Now, the more strongly it is felt that knowledge is inseparable from virtue the
                    more strange and doubtful appears such unconscious excellence as that of Laches,
                    Charmides, or Lysis. Hence arises the further paradox of Socrates,—“Virtue is
                    not taught, and that which is commonly regarded as virtue springs up
                    spontaneously or is received unconsciously by a kind of inspiration.”</p>
                <p>Protagoras, in the dialogue named after him, is the professor of popular,
                    unscientific, self-complacent excel- <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> lence; while
                    Socrates appears in his life-long search after the ideal knowledge of the best.
                    The two men are naturally at cross purposes. Protagoras contends that virtue is
                    taught by himself and others more or less successfully, and is not one but many.
                    Socrates disputes the possibility of teaching virtue (since all men equally
                    profess it, and even statesmen fail to give it to their sons), but affirms that,
                    if it can be taught, virtue is not many, but one. The discussion, as in the
                    former dialogues, ends inconclusively. But in the course of it Plato vividly
                    sets forth the natural opposition between the empiric and scientific points of
                    view, between a conventional and an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n206/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0206-0197"/> intellectual standard. He does full justice to
                    the thesis of Protagoras, and it is not to be supposed that he was contented to
                    remain in the attitude which he has here attributed to Socrates. In his ideal
                    state, where the earlier training of the best citizens is a refinement on the
                    actual Hellenic education, he has to some extent reconciled the conceptions
                    which are here dramatically opposed.</p>
                <p>The preparations for the encounter and the description of it include many
                    life-like touches,—such as the eagerness of the young Athenian gentleman to hear
                    the sophist, though he would be ashamed to be thought a sophist himself; the
                    confusion into which the house of Callias has been thrown by the crowd of
                    strangers and by the eelf-importance of rival professors; the graceful dignity
                    of the man who has been forty years a teacher, the graphic description of the
                    whole scene, the characteristic speeches of Prodicus and Hippias (from which
                    some critics have elicited a theory of their doctrines), and the continued irony
                    with which Socrates bears them all in hand and soothes the great man after
                    disconcerting him.</p>
                <p>In the argument there are two points which chiefly deserve notice. (1)
                    Protagoras, in accordance with his relative view of things (which Plato
                    afterwards criticized in the <hi rend="italic">Theaetetus\</hi> claims not to
                    give men principles but to improve them in those virtues which Providence has
                    given in some measure to all civilized men. (2) Socrates in postulating a
                    scientific principle, which he expressly reserves for future consideration,
                    would have it tested by the power of calculating the amount of pleasure. Grote
                    dwells with some complacency on the “utilitarianism” of Socrates in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Protagoras.</hi> And it is true that a principle of utility is
                    here opposed to conventional sentiment. But this opposition is intended to
                    prepare the way for the wider and deeper contrast between an arbitrary and a
                    scientific standard, or between impressions and conceptions or ideas. And when
                    Plato (in the <hi rend="italic">Gorgias</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philebus~)</hi> endeavours to define the art of measurement, which is here
                    anticipated, it is not wonderful that differences here unthought of should come
                    into view, or that the pleasant should be again contradistinguished from the
                    good. In all three dialogues he is equally asserting the supremacy of
                    reason.</p>
                <p>On the first vision of that transcendental knowledge<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Phaed.,</hi> 82 B; Λφ., x.
                    619 C ’.</p></note> which is to be the key at once to truth and good, philosophy
                    is apt to lose her balance, and to look with scorn upon “the trivial round, the
                    common task,” and the respectable common-places of “ordinary thinking.” Yet, as
                    Socrates is reminded by Protagoras, this unconscious wisdom also has a value.
                    And Plato, who, when most ideal, ever strives to keep touch with experience, is
                    fully convinced of the reality of this lower truth, of this unphilosophic
                    virtue. But he is long puzzled how to conceive of it. For, if knowledge is all
                    in all, what are we to make of wisdom and goodness in those who do not know?
                    Protagoras had boldly spoken of honour and right as a direct gift from Zeus, and
                    Socrates, in the <hi rend="italic">Io</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Meno,</hi> is
                    represented as adopting an hypothesis of inspiration in order to account for
                    these unaccredited graces of the soul.</p>
                <p>Socrates has observed that rhapsodists and even poets have no definite knowledge
                    of the things which they so powerfully represent (comp. <hi rend="italic">Apol.,
                    22;</hi><hi rend="italic">Phaed.,</hi> 245 A; <hi rend="italic">Rep.,</hi> iii.
                    398 A). He brings the rhapsode Io to admit this, and to conclude that he is the
                    inspired medium of a magnetic influence. The Muse is the chief magnet, and the
                    poet is the first of a series of magnetic rings. Then follow the rhapsode and
                    the actor, who are rings of inferior power, and the last ring is the hearer or
                    spectator.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Meno</hi> raises again the more serious question, Can
                    virtue be taught? Socrates here states explicitly the paradox with which the <hi
                    rend="italic">Protagoras</hi> ended. “Virtue is knowledge; therefore virtue can
                    be taught. But virtue is not taught. Therefore (in the highest sense) there can
                    be no virtue.” And he repeats several of his former reasons, —that Athenian
                    statesmen failed to teach their sons, and that the education given by sophists
                    is unsatisfying. (The sophists are here denounced by Anytus, who is angered by
                    Socrates’s ironical praise of them.) But the paradox is softened in two ways
                    :—(1) the absence of knowledge does not preclude inquiry, and (2), though virtue
                    cannot be taught, yet there is a sense in which virtue exists.</p>
                <p>1. Meno begins in gaiety of heart to define virtue, but is soon “benumbed” by the
                    “torpedo” shock of Socrates, and asks “How can one inquire about that which he
                    does not know?” Socrates meets this “eristic” difficulty with the doctrine of
                    reminiscence <hi rend="italic">(av&lt;lμvησ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">s).</hi> All knowledge is latent in the mind from birth and
                    through kindred (or association) of ideas much may be recovered, if only a
                    beginning is made. Pindar and other poets have said that the soul is immortal
                    and that she has passed through many previous states.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The origin of this traditional belief is very
                    obscure. The Greeks themselves were apt to associate it with Pythagoras and with
                    the ‘ ‘ Orphic” mysteries.</p></note> And Socrates now gives a practical
                    illustration of the truth that knowledge is evolved from ignorance. He elicits,
                    from a Greek slave of Meno’s, the demonstration of a geometrical theorem.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Eucl.,</hi>
                    i. 47 (the case where the triangle is isosceles).</p></note> About the middle of
                    the process he turns to Meno and observes that the slave (who has made a false
                    start) is now becoming conscious of ignorance. He then gradually draws from the
                    man, by leading questions, the positive proof.</p>
                <p>2. Though virtue is not yet defined, it may be affirmed “hypothetically” that, if
                    virtue is knowledge, virtue can be taught. And experience leads us to admit two
                    phases of virtue—the one a mode of life based on scientific principle, which
                    hitherto is an ideal only; the other sporadic, springing of itself, yet of
                    divine origin, relying upon true opinion, which it is, however, unable to make
                    fast through demonstration of the cause or reason. But, if there were a virtuous
                    man who could teach virtue, he would stand amongst his fellows like Tiresias
                    amongst the shades.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>This mystical account of ordinary morality is in keeping with the semi-mythical

                    supposing that these four dialogues were written consecutively, or that they
                    belong strictly to the same period of Plato’s industry. But they are linked
                    together for the reader by their common reference to the trial and death of
                    Socrates; no one of them has been proved to be in the author’s earliest or
                    latest manner; and they may therefore fitly end the series of dialogues in which
                    the personal traits of the historic Socrates are most apparent, and Plato’s own

                    rend="italic">Lysis,</hi> as dealing inconclusively with a single notion. But,
                    although slight and tentative in form, it has an undertone of deeper
                    significance, in keeping with the gravity of the occasion. Plato implies that
                    Socrates had thought more deeply on the nature of piety than his accusers had,
                    and also that his piety was of a higher mood than that of ordinary religious
                    men.</p>
                <p>Euthyphro is a soothsayer, well-disposed to Socrates, but not one of his
                    particular friends. They meet at the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0207-0198"/> door of the king archon, whither Socrates has
                    been summoned for the “precognition” <hi rend="italic">(άνάκρισις)</hi>
                    preliminary to his trial. Both men are interested in cases of alleged impiety.
                    For Euthyphro’s business is to impeach his father, who has inadvertently caused
                    the death of a criminal labourer. The prophet feels the duty of purging the
                    stain of blood to be more imperative the nearer home. Socrates is struck by the
                    strong opinion thus evinced respecting the nature of piety, and detains
                    Euthyphro at the entrance of the court, that he may learn from so clear an
                    authority “what piety is,” and so be fortified against Meletus. He leads his
                    respondent from point to point, until the doubt is raised whether God loves
                    holiness because it is holy, or it is holy because loved by God. Does God will
                    what is righteous, or is that righteous which is willed by God? Here they find
                    themselves wandering round and round. Socrates proves himself an involuntary
                    Daedalus who makes opinions move, while he seeks for one which he can “bind fast
                    with reason.”</p>
                <p>“The holy is a portion of the just.” But what portion <hi rend="italic">1</hi>
                    “Due service of the gods by prayer and sacrifice.” But how does this affect the
                    gods? “It pleases them.” Again we are found to be reasoning in a circle.</p>
                <p>“Thus far has Socrates proceeded in placing religion cn a moral foundation. He is
                    seeking to realize the harmony of religion and morality, which the great poets
                    Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Pindar had unconsciously anticipated, and which is the
                    universal want of all men. To this the soothsayer adds the ceremonial element, ‘
                    attending upon the gods. ’ When further interrogated by Socrates as tot the
                    nature of this ‘attention to the gods,’ he replies that piety is an affair of
                    business, a science of giving and asking and the like. Socrates points out the
                    anthropomorphism of these notions. But when we expect him to go on and show that
                    the true service of the gods is the service of the spirit and co-operation with
                    them in all things true and good, he stops short; this was a lesson which the
                    soothsayer could not have been made to understand, and which every one must
                    learn for himself.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> the fate of Socrates is no longer the
                    subject of mere allusions, such as the rage of Anytus at the end of the Λfeno,
                    and the scene and occasion of the <hi rend="italic">Euthyphro.</hi> He is now
                    seen face to face with his accusers, and with his countrymen who are condemning
                    him to death.</p>
                <p>What most aggravated his danger (after life-long impunity) is thus stated by Mr
                    James Riddell, in the introduction to his edition of the dialogue :—“The
                    επιείκεια” (clemency) “of the restored people did not last long, and was
                    naturally succeeded by a sensitive and fanatical zeal for their revived
                    political institutions. Inquiry into the foundations of civil society was
                    obviously rather perilous for the inquirer at such a time. Socrates knew the
                    full extent of his danger. But, according to Xenophon <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mem.,</hi> iv. c. 8, § 14), he prepared no defence, alleging that his whole
                    life had been a preparation for that hour.”</p>
                <p>The tone of the Platonic <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> is in full accordance
                    with that saying; but it is too elaborate a work of art to be taken literally as
                    a report of what was actually said. Professor Jowett well compares it to “those
                    speeches of Thucydides in which he has embodied his conception of the lofty
                    character and policy of the great Pericles.” Yet “it is significant that Plato
                    is said to have been present at the defence, as he is also said to have been
                    absent at the last scene of the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo.</hi> Some of the
                    topics may have been actually used by Socrates, and the recollection of his very
                    words may have rung in the ears of his disciple.”</p>
                <p>The Platonic <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> is in three parts :—(1) before
                    conviction, (2) after conviction and before sentence, (3) after the
                    sentence.</p>
                <p>1. Socrates cares not for acquittal. But he does care to explain his life. And he
                    selects those aspects of it which there is hope of making his audience
                    understand. That he partly succeeded in this is shown by the large number of
                    those (220 out of 500) who voted for his acquittal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">α.</hi> His answer to Meletus, as least important, is reserved
                    for the middle of his speech. He addresses himself first to “other
                    accusers,”—comic poets and the rest, who have prejudiced his reputation by
                    falsely identifying him with the physical philosophers and the sophists. But
                    what then is the strange pursuit which has given to Socrates the name of wise?
                    It is the practice of cross-examining, to which he was first impelled by the
                    oracle at Delphi, and which he has followed ever since as a religious mission.
                    The god said “Socrates is wise,” when he was conscious of no wisdom great or
                    small. So he went in search of some one wiser than himself, but could find none,
                    though he found many who had conceit of wisdom. And he inferred that the god
                    must mean “He is wisest who, like Socrates, is most aware of his own ignorance.”
                    This unceasing quest has left him in great poverty, and has made him enemies,
                    who are represented by Anytus, Meletus, and Lycon. And their enmity is further
                    embittered by the pleasure which young men take in seeing pretence unmasked, and
                    in imitating the process of refutation. Hence has arisen the false charge that
                    Socrates is a corrupter of youth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Here he turns to Meletus. “If I corrupt the youth, who
                    does them good?” <hi rend="italic">Mel.</hi> “The laws, the judges, the
                    audience, the Athenians generally” (comp. <hi rend="italic">Protagoras</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Meno).</hi> “Strange, that here only should be one to corrupt
                    and many to improve; or that any one should be so infatuated as to wish to have
                    bad neighbours.” <hi rend="italic">Mel.</hi> “Socrates is an atheist. He
                    believes the sun to be a stone.” “You are accusing Anaxagoras. I have said that
                    I know nothing of such theories. And you ⅞ccuse me of introducing novel notions
                    about divine things. How can I believe in divine things (<hi rend="italic"
                    >δαιμόνια)</hi> and not in divine beings <hi rend="italic">(δaiμoves) I</hi> and
                    how in divine beings, if not in gods who are their authors ?”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">c.</hi> That is a sufficient answer for his present accuser. He
                    returns to the general long-standing defamation, which may well be his death, as
                    slander has often been and again will be the death of many a man.</p>
                <p>Yet if spared he will continue the same course of life, in spite-of the danger.
                    As at Potidaea and Delium he faced death where the Athenians posted him, so now
                    he will remain at the post where he is stationed by the god. For to fear death
                    is to assume pretended knowledge.</p>
                <p>One thing is certain. A worse man cannot harm a better. But if the Athenians kill
                    Socrates, they will harm themselves. For they will lose the stimulus of his
                    exhortations;—and his poverty is a sufficient witness that he was sincere. Not
                    that he would engage in politics. If he had done that he would have perished
                    long before,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Comp. <hi
                    rend="italic">Gorg.,</hi> 521; <hi rend="italic">Rsp.,</hi> vi. 496.</p></note>
                    as he nearly did for his independent vote after the battle of Arginusae, and for
                    disobeying the murderous command of the thirty tyrants.</p>
                <p>But have not Socrates’s disciples, Alcibiades, Critias, Charmides, proved bad
                    citizens? He has no disciples. Any one, bad or good, may come and hear him, and
                    the talk which is his life-work is not unamusing. But why are no witnesses
                    brought to substantiate this charge? There are elder friends of his companions,
                    who would be angry if he had used his influence for harm. But these men’s
                    confidence in Socrates is unshaken.</p>
                <p>He will not appeal <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">misericordiam.</hi>
                    That would be a disgrace for one who (rightly or not) has been reputed wise, and
                    to admit such an appeal in any case is a violation of the juror’s oath.</p>
                <p>Socrates has told the Athenians the whole truth, so far as a mixed audience of
                    them could receive it. Elaboration and subtlety could have no place in
                    addressing the Heliastic court, nor could that universal truth towards which he
                    was leading men be made intelligible to a new audience while the clepsydra was
                    running. But his tone and attitude must have made a strong appeal to the better
                    nature of his hearers. With Meletus he “played rather than fought,” but he has
                    shown clearly that he has no fear of death, that he chooses to obey God rather
                    than man, and that for very love of the Athenians he will not be swayed by their
                    desires.</p>
                <p>2. One convicted on a capital charge had the right of pleading before sentence in
                    mitigation of the penalty proposed by his accuser. Socrates was convicted by
                    fewer votes than he himself anticipated. The indictment of Meletus was
                    ineffectual, and if it had not been for the speeches of Anytus and Lycon the
                    defendant would have been triumphantly acquitted. Could he but have conversed
                    with his judges more than once, he might have removed their prejudices. In no
                    spirit of bravado, therefore, but in simple justice to himself, he meets the
                    claim of Meletus that he shall be punished with death by the counter claim that
                    he shall be maintained in the prytaneum as a public benefactor. He cannot ask
                    that death, which may be a good, shall be commuted for imprisonment or exile,
                    which are certainly evils. A fine would be no evil: but he has no money;—he can
                    offer a mina. Here Plato and others interpose, and with their friendly help he
                    offers thirty minae.</p>
                <p>3. He is sentenced to death, and the public business of the court <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n208/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0208-0199"/> is ended. But, while the record is being entered
                    and the magistrates are thus occupied, Socrates is imagined as addressing (a)
                    the majority, and (δ) the minority in the court.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a.</hi> To those who have condemned him he speaks in a
                    prophetic tone. “For the sake of depriving an old man of the last dregs of life,
                    they have given Athens a bad name. He would not run away, and so death has
                    overtaken him. But his accusers are overtaken by unrighteousness, and must reap
                    the fruits of it.</p>
                <p>“Nor will the Athenians find the desired relief. Other reprovers, whom Socrates
                    has hitherto restrained, will now arise, not in a friendly but in a hostile
                    spirit. The only way for the citizens to escape reproof is to reform their
                    lives.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">b.</hi> To the minority, who would have acquitted him, he
                    speaks with gentle solemnity. “Let them know to their comfort that the divine
                    voice has not once checked him throughout that day. This indicates that death is
                    not an evil. And reason shows that death is either a long untroubled sleep, or
                    removal to a better world, where are no unjust judges.</p>
                <p>“No evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death. Wherefore
                    Socrates will not be angry with his condemners, who have done him no harm,
                    although they meant him anything but good. He will only ask of them to do to the
                    sons of Socrates as Socrates has done to them.”</p>
                <p>Is the love of truth consistent with civic duties? Is the philosopher a good
                    citizen? are questions which are sure to arise where the truth involves
                    practical improvement. In the <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> Socrates appears as
                    an intrepid reformer; the <hi rend="italic">Crito</hi> gives an impressive
                    picture of him as a loyal and law-abiding Athenian.</p>
                <p>Execution had been delayed during the annual mission to Delos (during which no
                    one could be put to death). But the returning vessel had just been reported as
                    descried from Sunium. At early dawn Crito, the oldest friend of Socrates,
                    obtained access to his cell, and found him sleeping peacefully. Presently he
                    awoke, and Crito told him of the approach of the fatal ship. Socrates replies by
                    telling his dream. A fair form stood over him and said,</p>
                <p>“The third day hence to Phthia shalt thou come.”</p>
                <p>And it would seem that the day after to-morrow will really be the day for going
                    home.</p>
                <p>Crito then reveals his plan for an escape. And Socrates argues the question in
                    the old familiar way. “Crito’s zeal is excellent, and most men would think his
                    object right. But the few who think soundly say that it is wrong to return evil
                    for evil. The laws of Athens (through the fault of men) are doing Socrates harm.
                    But ought he therefore to infringe the law? Might not the laws of his country
                    plead with him and say :—‘You owe to us your birth and breeding; and when grown
                    up you voluntarily submitted to us. For you might have gone elsewhere. But you
                    preferred us to all other laws, and have been the most constant resident in
                    Athens. Even at the last you accepted death rather than exile. If you now break
                    your covenant, you will ruin your friends and will be rejected by all
                    well-ordered cities. You might be received in Thessaly, but could only live
                    there by cringing to foreigners for food. Where in that case will be your talk
                    about virtue? You would not take your sons thither. And your friends would be
                    equally kind to them if you were dead.</p>
                <p>“Think not of life and children first and of justice afterwards, but think of
                    justice first, that you may be justified in the world below.” Crito admits these
                    arguments to be unanswerable.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Meno</hi> referred to the immortality and pre-existence of
                    the soul as a traditional doctrine, and it was there associated with the
                    possibility of inquiry. In the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> Plato undertakes to
                    substantiate this belief and base it anew, by narrating the last hours of
                    Socrates, who is represented as calmly discussing the question with his friends
                    when his own death was immediately at hand. The argument turns chiefly on the
                    eternity of knowledge, and is far from satisfying. For, granting that eternity
                    of knowledge involves eternity of mind, does the eternity of mind assure
                    continued being to the individual?<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    can doubt that Plato, at the time of writing it, sincerely believed in a

                    declares his hope of going to be with other friends, are absolutely unambiguous,
                    and his reply to Crito’s question, “How shall we bury you ?” has a convincing
                    force beyond all dialectic :— <hi rend="italic">“I</hi> cannot persuade Crito
                    that I here am Socrates—I who am now reasoning and ordering discourse. He
                    imagines Socrates to be that other, whom he will see by and by, a corpse.” This
                    and similar touches not only stamp the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> as a marvel
                    of art, but are indisputable evidences of the writer’s profound belief. They may
                    be inventions, but they have nothing “mythical” about them, any more than the
                    charge of Socrates to his friends, that they would best fulfil his wishes by
                    attending to their own lives.</p>
                <p>The narrative, to be appreciated, must be read in full. But a short abstract of
                    the argument may be given here.</p>
                <p>1. Death is merely the separation of soul and body. And this is the very
                    consummation at which philosophy aims. The body hinders thought. The mind
                    attains to truth by retiring into herself. Through no bodily sense does she
                    perceive justice, beauty, goodness, and other ideas. The philosopher has a
                    life-long quarrel with bodily desires, and he should welcome the release of his
                    soul. Thus he alone can have true courage, even as temperance and all the
                    virtues are real in him alone.</p>
                <p>But does the soul exist after death?</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">α.</hi> An old tradition tells of many successive births, the
                    soul departing to Hades and returning again, so that the living are born from
                    the dead. And if the dead had no existence, this could not be, since from
                    nothing nothing can arise. Moreover, experience shows that opposite states come
                    from their opposites, and that such a process is always reciprocal. Death
                    certainly succeeds to life. Then life must succeed to death. And that which
                    undergoes these changes must exist through all. If the dead came from the
                    living, and not the living from the dead, the universe would ultimately be
                    consumed in death.</p>
                <p>This presumption is confirmed by the doctrine (here attributed to Socrates, comp.
                    <hi rend="italic">Meno)</hi> that knowledge comes through recollection. What is
                    recollected must be previously known. Now we have never since birth had
                    intuition of the absolute equality of which (through association) we are
                    reminded by the sight of things approximately equal. And we cannot have seen it
                    at the moment of birth, for at what other moment can we have forgotten it?
                    Therefore, if ideals be not vain, our souls must have existed before birth, and,
                    according to the doctrine of opposites above stated, will have continued
                    existence after death.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">b.</hi> To charm away the fears of the “child within,” Socrates
                    adds, as further considerations:—</p>
                <p>(1) The soul is uncompounded, incorporeal, invisible, and therefore indissoluble
                    and immutable.</p>
                <p>(2) The Soul commands, the body serves; therefore the soul is. akin to the
                    divine.</p>
                <p>(3) Yet even the body holds together long after death, and the bones are all but
                    indestructible.</p>
                <p>The soul, if pure, departs to the invisible world, but, if tainted by communion
                    with the body, she lingers hovering near the earth, and is afterwards born into
                    the likeness of some lower form. That which true philosophy has purified alone
                    rises ultimately to the gods. This lesson is impressively applied.</p>
                <p>2. A pause ensues; and Simmias and Cebes are invited to express their doubts.
                    For, as the swan dies singing, Socrates would die discoursing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Simmias desires not to rest short of demonstration,
                    though he is willing to make the highest attainable probability the guide of
                    life.</p>
                <p>If the soul is the harmony of the body, what becomes of her “when the lute is
                    broken”?</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Cebes compares the body to a garment which the soul
                    keeps weaving at. The garment in which the weaver dies outlasts him. So the soul
                    may have woven and worn many bodies in one lifetime, yet may perish and leave a
                    body behind. Or even supposing her to have many lives, does even this hypothesis
                    exempt her from ultimate decay?</p>
                <p>Socrates warns his friends against losing faith in inquiry. •Theories, like men,
                    are disappointing; yet we should be neither misanthropists nor misologists. Then
                    he answers his two friends.</p>
                <p>(a) (1) The soul is acknowledged to be prior to the body, But no harmony is prior
                    to the elements which are harmonized.</p>
                <p>(2) The soul has virtue and vice, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> harmony and
                    discord. Is there harmony of harmony? Comp, <hi rend="italic">Rep., x.</hi>
                    609.</p>
                <p>(3) All soul is equally soul, but all harmony is not equally harmonious.</p>
                <p>(4) If the soul were the harmony of the body, they would be agreed; but, as has
                    been already shown, they are perpetually quarrelling.</p>
                <p>(5) The soul is not conditioned by the bodily elements, but has the power of
                    controlling them.</p>
                <p>(δ.) Cebes has raised the wide question whether the soul is independent of
                    generation and corruption. Socrates owns that he himself<pb break="no"

                    been fascinated by natural philosophy, and had sought to give a physical account
                    of everything. Then, hearing out of Anaxagoras that mind was the disposer of
                    all, he had hoped to learn not only how things were, but also why. But he found
                    Anaxagoras forsaking his own first principle and jumbling causes with
                    conditions. (“The cause why Socrates sits here is not a certain disposition of
                    joints and sinews, but that he has thought best to undergo his sentence,—else
                    the joints and sinews would have been ere this, by Crito’s advice, on the way to
                    Thessaly. ”) Physical science never thinks of a power which orders everything
                    for good, but expects to find another Atlas to sustain the world more strong and
                    lasting than the reason of the best.</p>
                <p>Socrates had turned from such philosophers and found for himself a way, not to
                    gaze directly on the universal reason, but to seek an image of it in the world
                    of mind, wherein are reflected the ideas, as, for example, the idea of beauty,
                    through partaking of which beautiful things are beautiful. Assuming the
                    existence of the ideas, he felt his way from hypothesis to hypothesis.</p>
                <p>Now the participation of objects in ideas is in some cases essential and
                    inseparable. Snow is essentially cold, fire hot, three odd, two even. And things
                    thus essentially opposite are exclusive of each other’s attributes. (When it was
                    said above that opposites come from opposites, not opposite things were meant,
                    but opposite states or conditions of one thing. ) Snow cannot admit heat, nor
                    fire cold; for they are inseparable vehicles of heat and cold respectively. The
                    soul is the inseparable vehicle of life, and therefore, by parity of reasoning,
                    the soul cannot admit of death, but is immortal and imperishable.</p>
                <p>3. What follows is in the true sense <hi rend="italic">mythological,</hi> and is
                    admitted by Socrates to be uncertain.—“Howbeit, since the soul is proved to be
                    immortal, men ought to charm their spirits with such tales. ”—</p>

                    brighter, some lower and darker than our present habitation. We who dwell about
                    the Mediterranean Sea are like frogs at the bottom of a pool. In some higher
                    place, under the true heaven, our souls may dwell hereafter, and see not only
                    colours and forms in their ideal purity but truth and justice as they are.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo,</hi> more than elsewhere, Plato preaches
                    withdrawal from the world. The Delian solemnity is to Socrates and his friends a
                    period of “retreat,” in which their eyes are turned from earthly things to dwell
                    on the eternal. The theory of ideas here assumes its most transcendental aspect,
                    and it is from portions of this dialogue and of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaedrus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> that the popular conception of
                    Platonism has been principally derived. But to understand Plato rightly it is
                    not enough to study isolated passages which happen to charm the imagination; nor
                    should single expressions be interpreted without regard to the manner in which
                    he presents the truth elsewhere.</p>
                <p>It has already been shown (1) that Socratic inquiry implied a standard of truth
                    and good, undiscovered but endlessly discoverable, and to be approached
                    inductively; and (2) that in Plato this implicit assumption becomes explicit, in
                    the identification of virtue with knowledge <hi rend="italic">(Lack.,
                    Charm.)</hi> as an art of measurement <hi rend="italic">(Protag.</hi>), and in
                    the vision (towards the end of the <hi rend="italic">Lysis)</hi> of an absolute
                    object of desire. The Socratic “self-knowledge” has been developed <hi
                    rend="italic">(Charm.)</hi> into a science of mind or consciousness, apart from
                    which no physical studies can be fruitful. (3) Co-ordinate with these
                    theoretical tendencies there has appeared in Plato the determination not to
                    break with experience.—The bearing of these remarks on the further progress of
                    Plato’s thoughts will appear in the sequel. Meanwhile, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaedo,</hi> a long step is made in the direction of pure idealism. The
                    ordinary virtue, which in the <hi rend="italic">Protagoras</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Meno</hi> was questioned but not condemned, is here rejected as
                    unreal, and the task proposed to the philosopher is less to understand the world
                    than to escape from it. The universal has assumed the form of the ideal, which
                    is supposed, as elsewhere in Plato, to include mathematical as well as moral
                    notions. The only function of perception is to awaken in us some reminiscence of
                    this ideal. By following the clue thus given, and by searching for clearer
                    images of truth in the world of mind, we may hope to be emancipated from
                    sensation, and to lay hold upon the sole object of pure reason.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that when he wrote the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> Plato
                    conceived of universals as objective entities rather than as forms of thought.
                    The notion of “ideal colours” (though occurring in the myth) is an indication of
                    his ontological mood.</p>
                <p>Yet even here the <hi rend="italic">eβη</hi> are not consistently hypostatized.
                    The notion of “what is best” has a distinctly practical side, and the “knowledge
                    through reminiscence” is in one aspect a process of reflexion on experience,
                    turning on the laws of association.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Comp. <hi rend="italic">Theset.,</hi> 184-186.</p></note> It
                    is also said that objects “partake” of the ideas, and some concrete natures are
                    regarded as embodiments or vehicles of some of them. Still, if taken as a whole,
                    notwithstanding the scientific attitude of Socrates, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaedo</hi> is rather a meditation than an inquiry,—a study of the soul as
                    self-existent, and of the mind and truth as co-eternal.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Symposium,</hi><hi rend="italic">Phaedrus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cratylus.—</hi> Socrates is again imagined as in the fulness of
                    life. But the real Socrates is becoming more and more inextricably blended with
                    Platonic thought and fancy. In the <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> there is a
                    distinct echo of the voice of Socrates; the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> gives
                    many personal traits of him; but the dialogues which are now to follow are
                    replete with original invention, based in part, no doubt, on personal
                    recollections.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Symposium</hi> admits both of comparison and of contrast
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo.</hi> Both dialogues are mystical, both are
                    spiritual, but the spirituality in either is of a different order. That is here
                    immanent which was there transcendent; the beautiful takes the place of the
                    good. The world is not now to be annihilated, but rather transfigured, until
                    particular objects are lost in universal light. Instead of flying from the
                    region of growth and decay, the mind, through intercourse with beauty, is now
                    the active cause of production. Yet the life of contemplation is still the
                    highest life, and philosophy the truest <hi rend="italic">ρονσ^κρ.</hi></p>
                <p>The leading conception of the <hi rend="italic">Symposium</hi> has been
                    anticipated in the <hi rend="italic">Lysis,</hi> where it was said that “the
                    indifferent loves the good, because of the presence of evil.”</p>
                <p>The banqueters (including Socrates), who are met to celebrate the tragic victory
                    of Agathon, happen not to be disposed for hard drinking. They send away the
                    flute-girl and entertain each other with the praise of Love.</p>
                <p>Phaedrus tells how Love inspires to honourable deeds, and how Alcestis and
                    Achilles died for Love.</p>
                <p>Pausanias rhetorically distinguishes the earthly from the heavenly Love.</p>
                <p>The physician Eryximachus, admitting the distinction, yet holds that Love
                    pervades all nature, and that art consists in following the higher Love in each
                    particular sphere. So Empedocles had spoken of Love as overcoming previous
                    discord. For opposites cannot, as Heraclitus fancied, coexist.</p>
                <p>Aristophanes, in a comic myth, describes the origin of Love as an imperfect
                    creature’s longing for completion. The original double human beings were growing
                    impious, and Zeus split them in twain, ever since which act the bereaved halves
                    wander in search of one another.</p>
                <p>Agathon speaks, or rather sings, of Love and his works. He is the youngest, not
                    the eldest of gods, living and moving delicately wherever bloom is and in the
                    hearts of men,—the author of all virtue and of all good works, obeyed by gods,
                    fair and causing all things fair, making men to be of one mind at feasts—pilot,
                    defender, saviour, in whose footsteps all should follow, chanting strains of
                    love.</p>
                <p>Socrates will not attempt to rival the poet, and begins by stipulating that he
                    may tell the truth. He accepts the distinction between Love and-his works, but
                    points out that, since desire implies want, and the desire of Love is toward
                    beauty, Love, as wanting beauty, is not beautiful. So much being established in

                    mystery once revealed to him by Diotima, the Mantinean wise woman.</p>
                <p>Love is neither beautiful nor ugly, neither wise nor foolish, neither god nor
                    mortal. Between gods and mortals is the world of mediating spirits (τδ <hi
                    rend="italic">δαιμόνιον).</hi> And Love is a great spirit, child of Resource
                    (the son of Prudence) and Poverty the beggar maid, who conceived him at the
                    birthday feast of Aphrodite. He is far from living “delicately,” but is ragged
                    and shoeless, always in difficulties, yet always brimming with invention, a
                    mighty hunter after wisdom and all things fair; sometimes “all full with
                    feasting” on them, the next moment “clean starved” for lack; never absolutely
                    knowing nor quite ignorant. That is to say, he is a “philosopher.” For knowledge
                    is the most beautiful thing, and love is of the beautiful.</p>
                <p>But what does love desire of the beautiful? The possession is enough. But there
                    is one kind of love—called “being in love ”— which desires beauty for a peculiar
                    end. The lover is seeking, not his “other half,” but possession of the beautiful
                    and <hi rend="italic">birth in beauty.</hi></p>
                <p>For there is a season of puberty both in body and mind, when human nature longs
                    to create, and it cannot save in presence of beauty. This yearning is the
                    earnest of immortality. Even in the bird’s devotion to its mate and to its young
                    there is a craving after continued being. In individual lives there is a flux,
                    not only of the body, but in the mind. Nay, the sciences themselves also come
                    and go (here the contrast to the <hi rend="italic">Phaecto</hi> is at its
                    height). But in mortal things the shadow of continuity is succession.</p>
                <p>The love of fame is a somewhat brighter image of immortality than the love of
                    offspring. Creative souls would bring into being not children of their body, but
                    good deeds. And such a one is readiest to fall in love with a fair mind in a
                    fair body, and then is filled with enthusiasm and begets noble thoughts. Homer,
                    Hesiod, Lycurgus, Solon, were such genial minds. But they stopped at the
                    threshold (comp. <hi rend="italic">Prot., Meno),</hi> and saw not the higher
                    mysteries, which are reserved for those who rise from noble actions,
                    institutions, laws, to universal beauty. The true order is to advance from one
                    to all fair forms, then to fair practices, fair thoughts, and lastly to the
                    single thought of absolute beauty. In that communion only, beholding beauty with
                    the eye of the mind, one shall bring forth realities ana become the friend of
                    God and be immortal, if mortal man may.</p>
                <p>Alcibiades here breaks in and is vociferously welcomed. He is crowning Agathon,
                    when, on perceiving Socrates, he declares that he will crown him too. Then he
                    announces himself king of the feast, and insists upon hard drinking (though this
                    will make no difference to Socrates).</p>
                <p>Eryximachus demands from the newcomer a speech in praise of love. But Alcibiades
                    will praise no one else when Socrates is near. And with the freedom of one who
                    is deep in wine he proceeds with his strange encomium of “this Marsyas.”</p>
                <p>“In face and outward bearing he is like a Satyr or Silenus, and by his voice he
                    charms more powerfully than they do by their pipings. The eloquence of Pericles
                    has no effect in comparison with his. His words alone move Alcibiades to shame,
                    and fascinate him until he stops his ears and runs from him.”—“I often wish him
                    dead. Yet that would break my heart. He brings me to my wit’s end.”—“And, as
                    carved Sileni are made to encase images of gods, so this Silenus-mask
                    entreasures things divine. He affects ignorance and susceptibility to beauty.
                    Thus he mocks mankind. But he cares nothing for outward shows, and his
                    temperance <hi rend="italic">(σωφροσύνη)</hi> is wonderful.”</p>
                <p>To prove this Alcibiades reveals his own heart-secret. (He is not ashamed to
                    speak it amongst others who have felt the pang which Socrates inflicts. ) And he
                    makes it abundantly manifest that in their widely-rumoured intercourse (comp.
                    <hi rend="italic">Protag.</hi> init. ) Socrates had never cared for anything but
                    what was best for his younger friend. Alcibiades then relates as an eyewitness
                    the endurance shown by Socrates at Potidaea, his strange persistence in solitary
                    meditation, —standing absorbed in thought for a day and a night together, —and
                    his intrepid conduct in the retreat from Delium (comp. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laches).</hi> “The talk of Socrates is of pack-asses and cobblers, and he is
                    ever saying the same things in the same words; but one λvho lifts the mask and
                    looks within will find that no other words have meaning.” Alcibiades ends by
                    warning his companions against the wiles of Socrates.</p>
                <p>Some raillery follows, and they are invaded by another band of revellers, who
                    compel them to drink still more deeply. The soberly inclined (led by
                    Eryximachus) slink off, and Aristodemus, the reporter of the scene, only
                    remembers further that when he awoke at cock-crow Socrates was still conversing
                    with Agathon and Aristophanes, and showing them that tragedy and comedy were
                    essentially one. He talked them both asleep, and at daybreak went about his
                    usual business.</p>
                <p>The philosopher of the <hi rend="italic">Symposium,</hi> is in the world and yet
                    not of it, apparently yielding but really overcoming. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaedo</hi> the soul was exhorted to “live upon her servant’s loss,” as in
                    Shakspeare’s most religious sonnet; this dialogue tells of a “soul within sense”
                    in the spirit of some more recent poetry. By force of imagination rather than of
                    reason, the reconciliation of becoming (γεv∈σις) with being (o⅛√α), of the
                    temporal with the eternal, is anticipated. But through the bright haze of fancy
                    and behind the mask of irony, Socrates still appears the same strong, pure,
                    upright, and beneficent human being as in the <hi rend="italic">Apology,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Crito,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phaedo.</hi></p>
                <p>The impassioned contemplation of the beautiful is again imagined as the beginning
                    of philosophy. But the “limitless ocean of beauty” is replaced by a world of
                    supramundane forms, beheld by unembodied souls, and remembered here on earth
                    through enthusiasm, proceeding by dialectic from multiform impressions to one
                    rational conception, and distinguishing the “lines and veins” of truth. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> records Plato’s highest “hour of insight,” when he
                    willed the various tasks hereafter to be fulfilled. In it he soars to a pitch of
                    contemplation from whence he takes a comprehensive and keen-eyed survey of the
                    country to be explored, marking off the blind alleys and paths that lead astray,
                    laying down the main lines and chief branches, and taking note of the erroneous
                    wanderings of others. Reversing the vulgar adage, he flies that he may
                    creep.</p>
                <p>The transcendent aspiration of the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> and the mystic
                    glow of the <hi rend="italic">Symposium</hi> are here combined with the notion
                    of a scientific process. No longer asking, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protagoras,</hi> Is virtue one or many? Plato rises to the conception of a
                    scientific one and many, to be contemplated through dialectic,—no barren
                    abstraction, but a method of classification according to nature.</p>
                <p>This method is to be applied especially to psychology, not merely with a
                    speculative, but also with a practical aim. For the “birth in beauty” of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Symposium</hi> is here developed into an art of education, of
                    which the true rhetoric is but the means, and true statesmanship an accidental
                    outcome.</p>
                <p>Like all imaginative critics, Plato falls to some extent under the influence of
                    that which he criticizes. The art of rhetoric which he so often travestied had a
                    lasting effect upon his style. Readers of his latest works are often reminded of
                    the mock grandiloquence of the <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus.</hi> But in this
                    dialogue the poetical side of his genius is at the height. Not only can he
                    express or imitate anything, and produce any effect at will, but he is standing
                    behind his creation and disposing it with the most perfect mastery, preserving
                    unity amidst profuse variety, and giving harmony to a wildness bordering on the
                    grotesque.</p>
                <p>The person of Socrates is here deliberately modified. He no longer (as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Symposium)</hi> teaches positive wisdom under the pretence of
                    repeating what he has heard, but is himself caught by an exceptional
                    inspiration, which is accounted for by the unusual circumstance of his finding
                    himself in the country and alone with Phaedrus. He has been hitherto a stranger
                    to the woods and fields, which would tempt him away from studying himself
                    through intercourse with men. But by the promise of discourse —especially of
                    talk with Phaedrus—he may be drawn anywhither.</p>
                <p>Phaedrus has been charmed by a discourse of Lysias, which after some coy excuses
                    he consents to read.</p>
                <p>It is a frigid erotic diatribe, in which one not in love pleads for preference
                    over the lover. Socrates hints at criticism, and is challenged to produce
                    something better on the same theme.</p>
                <p>1. Distinguishing desire from true opinion, he defines love as desire prevailing
                    against truth, and then expatiates on the harmful tendencies of love as so
                    defined. But he becomes alarmed at his own unwonted eloquence, and is about to
                    remove, when the “divine token” warns him that he must first recite a “palinode”
                    in praise of love. For no divine power can be the cause of evil.</p>
                <p>2. Love is madness; but there is a noble madness, as is shown by soothsayers
                    (called <hi rend="italic">μdvτtιs</hi> from <hi rend="italic">μαίνομαι).</hi>
                    And of the higher madness there are four kinds.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n211/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0211-0202"/>
                <p>To explain this it is necessary to understand psychology. The soul is
                    self-existent and self-moving, and therefore eternal. And her form is like a
                    pair of winged steeds with their charioteer. In divine souls both steeds are
                    good, but in human souls one of them is bad. Now before entering the body the
                    soul lost her wings, which in her unembodied state were nourished by beauty,
                    wisdom, goodness, and all that is divine. For at the festival of souls, in which
                    they visit the heaven that is above the heavens, the unruly steed caused the
                    charioteer to see imperfectly. So the soul cast her feathers and fell down and
                    passed into the human form. And, according to the comparative clearness or
                    dimness of that first vision, her earthly lot is varied from that of a
                    philosopher or artist down through nine grades (including woman) to that of a
                    tyrant. On her conduct in this state of probation depends her condition when
                    again born into the world. And only in ten thousand years can she return to her
                    pristine state, except through a life of philosophy (comp. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaedo)</hi> or of pure and noble love (comp. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Symposium).</hi></p>
                <p>The mind of the philosopher alone has wings. He is ever being initiated into
                    perfect mysteries, and his soul alone becomes complete. But the vulgar deem him
                    mad and rebuke him; they do not see that he is inspired.</p>
                <p>This divine madness (the fourth kind of those above mentioned) is kindled through
                    the renewed vision of beauty. For wisdom is not seen; her loveliness would have
                    been transporting if she had a visible form. The straggle of the higher passion
                    with the lower is then described with extraordinary vividness, under the image
                    of the two steeds. When the higher impulse triumphs, the issue is a philosophic
                    friendship, at once passionate and absolutely pure.</p>
                <p>3. From his “palinode” Socrates returns to Lysias, who is advised to leave
                    speech-writing for philosophy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Phaedrus remarks that the speech-writer is despised by
                    the politician. Socrates replies that speech-writing and politics are one
                    concern. The real difference is between those who base their teaching on
                    philosophy and those who are content with rules of art. For example, if the
                    first speech of Socrates is compared with that of Lysias, the one is found to
                    distinguish and define, the other not; the one observes order in discourse, the
                    other “begins where he should end,” and his utterance is like a disordered
                    chain. A speech should be an organic whole, a “creature having hands and feet.”
                    So in the “palinode” there λvas a classification of the kinds of madness, λvhich
                    led the way to “a possibly true though partly erring myth.”</p>
                <p>This approximation to truth in the midst of much that was playful was due to the
                    observance of two principles, generalization and division <hi rend="italic"
                    >{συvayωγt], Bιaipe&lt;τιs).</hi> Whoever sees the one and many in nature, him
                    Socrates follows and walks in his footsteps, as if he were a god.</p>
                <p>In comparison of dialectic, as thus conceived, the frigid rules of Lysias,
                    Thrasymachus, Theodorus, Evenus, Tisias, Gorgias, Polus, and Protagoras are
                    futile and absurd.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Another condition of teaching (or true rhetoric) is the
                    science of mind. Whether the soul be one or many, complex or multiform, and if
                    multiform what are its parts and kinds, are questions which the teacher must
                    have already solved. And he must likewise have classified all arguments and know
                    them in their various applicability to divers souls. An art of speaking that
                    should fulfil this condition is non-existent. Yet how can even verisimilitude be
                    attained without knowledge of truth?</p>
                <p>c. The art of writing is kindred to the art of speech. But Socrates maintains
                    that oral teaching through the living contact of mind with mind has many
                    advantages over written composition, which is, comparatively speaking, a dead
                    thing. Men may write for amusement or to record the intercourse that has been.
                    But the serious occupation of the true thinker and teacher is the communication
                    of truth through vital converse with others likeminded,—the creation of
                    “thoughts that breathe” in spirits conscious of their value.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, a friendly hint is given to Isocrates that he may do better than
                    Lysias if he will but turn his attention to philosophy.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> anticipates much that Plato afterwards slowly
                    elaborated, and retains some things which he at last eliminated. (1) The
                    presence of movement or impulse in the highest region is an aspect of truth
                    which reappears in the <hi rend="italic">Sophistes</hi> and other later
                    dialogues. It has been thought strange that it should be found so early as in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus.</hi> But does not this remark imply an
                    unwarrantable assumption, viz., that Plato’s idealism took its departure from
                    the being of Parmenides? Is it not rather the fact that his own theory was
                    formulated before the Megarian ascendency led him to examine the Eleatic
                    doctrine, and that it was by a tendency from the first inherent in Platonism
                    that that doctrine was modified in his final teaching? (2) The outlines of
                    method which are thrown out at white heat in the <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi>
                    are a preparation for the more sober treatment of the ideas in the dialectical
                    dialogues. In these, however, the conception of classification is somewhat
                    altered through contact with Eleaticism. (3) The <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi>
                    aims, not merely at realizing universals, but at grasping them in and through
                    particulars. This is an ideal of knowledge which was “lost as soon as seen,” but
                    one which in some of his latest dialogues, such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Politicus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Philebus,</hi> Plato again endeavours to
                    work out. (4) The <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> contains the elements of that
                    true psychology into which the ontological theory of the ideas is gradually
                    transmuted in Plato’s more advanced writings, when the difficulties of his ideal
                    doctrine in its cruder forms have been clearly felt and understood. (5) Plato
                    here appears as a professor of education, preferring oral intercourse to
                    authorship. In this paradox he at once exalts the work of Socrates and avows his
                    own vocation as a teacher. The passage throws an interesting light upon the form
                    of dialogue in which his works are cast. But it is not to be supposed that he
                    remained long unconscious of the influence he was destined to wield by writing.
                    In undertaking a great task like the <hi rend="italic">Republic,</hi> he
                    practically receded from the untenable view asserted here; and in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Laws</hi> he recommends his longest and most prosaic work as a
                    suitable basis for the .education of the future. (6) It must always appear
                    strange, even to those most familiar with the conditions of Hellenic life, that
                    in portraying the idealizing power of passionate love Plato should have taken
                    his departure from unnatural feeling.</p>

                    mere talent, or to demand for philosophy the service of the heart as well as the
                    head, nor yet that friendship was less valued by him in later years. All this
                    remained unchanged. And in the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> the passion of
                    love is still distantly referred to as the symbol of ideal aspiration. But a
                    time came when he had learned to frown on the aberration of feeling which in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Symposium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> he appears
                    to regard as the legitimate stimulus of intellectual enthusiasm. And already in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Theaetetus</hi> not love but wonder is described as the
                    only beginning of philosophy.</p>
                <p>While calling attention to this change of sentiment, it is right to add that
                    Platonic love in the “erotic” dialogues of Plato is very different from what has
                    often been so named, and that nothing even in the noble passage of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Laws</hi> above referred to casts the slightest shadow of blame on
                    the Socrates of the <hi rend="italic">Symposium.</hi></p>
                <p>Such changes are, amongst other things, a ground for caution in comparing the two
                    steeds of the <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> with the spirit (0υ∕zoς) and
                    desire (eτrι0υ∕uα) of the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Timaeus.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus,</hi> in common with these
                    dialogues, asserts the existence of higher and lower impulses in human nature,
                    but there is no sufficient ground for supposing that when Plato wrote the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> he would have defined them precisely as they are
                    defined in the <hi rend="italic">Republic.</hi></p>

                <p>Three persons maintain different views respecting the nature and origin of
                    language.</p>
                <p>Hermogenes affirms that language is conventional, Cratylus (the Heraclitean) that
                    it is natural. Socrates, mediating between these sophistical extremes, declares
                    that language, like other institutions, is national, and therefore (1) is based
                    on nature, but (2) modified by convention.</p>
                <p>In his dialectical treatment of the subject, Socrates displays a tissue of wild
                    etymologies in reliance on the “inspiration” of Euthyphro. Presently a
                    distinction appears between primary and secondary words. Many primary words
                    convey the notion of movement and change. It follows that the legislator or
                    word-maker held Heraclitean views. Socrates thus far presses on Hermogenes the
                    view of Cratylus. Then turning to Cratylus he asks if there are no false names.
                    “False language, Cratylus argues, “is impossible.” Socrates shows that a true
                    image may be inadequate, so that we have a right to criticize the work of the
                    word-maker. And the facts indicate an element of meaningless convention. Nor was
                    the original word-maker consistently Heraclitean. For some important words point
                    not to motion but to rest.</p>
                <p>But the question returns—Are we sure that the theory of nature which the
                    word-maker held was true? This difficulty cannot be touched by verbal arguments.
                    In seeking to resolve it we must consider, not words, but things. If there is a
                    true beauty and a true good, which are immutable, and if these are accessible to
                    knowledge, that world of truth can have nothing to do with flux and change.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Gorgias, Republic.—</hi> In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Symposium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phxdrus</hi> Plato largely redeems the
                    promise implied in the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo,</hi> where Socrates tells his
                    friends to look among themselves for a charmer who may soothe away the fear of
                    death. But he was pledged also to a sterner duty by the warning of Socrates to
                    the Athenians, in the <hi rend="italic">Apology,</hi> that after he was gone
                    there would arise others for their reproof, more harsh than he had been. To this
                    graver task, which he had but partially fulfilled with the light satire upon
                    Lysias or the gentle message to Isocrates, the philosopher now directs his
                    powers, by holding up the mirror of what ought to be against what is, the
                    principles of truth and right against the practice of men. For the good has more
                    than one aspect. The beautiful or noble when realized in action becomes the
                    just. And to the question, What is just? are closely allied those other
                    questions of Socrates— What is a state? What is it to be a statesman?</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Gorgias</hi> Plato asserts the absolute supremacy of
                    justice through the dramatic portraiture of Socrates in his opposition to the
                    world; in the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> he strives at greater length to
                    define the nature of justice through the imaginary creation of an ideal
                    community.</p>
                <p>In the former dialogue the Platonic Socrates appears in direct antagonism with
                    the Athenian world. The shadow of his fate is hanging over him. Chaerephon (who
                    is still alive) understands him, but to the other interlocutors, Gorgias, Polus,
                    Callicles, he appears perversely paradoxical. Yet he effectively dominates them
                    all. And to the reader of the dialogue this image of “Socrates contra mundum” is
                    hardly less impressive than that former image of Socrates confronting death.</p>
                <p>1. Gorgias asserts that rhetoric is an art concerned with justice, and that
                    persuasion is the secret of power.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a.</hi>. Socrates, after suggesting some ironical doubts,
                    declares his opinion that rhetoric is no art, but a knack of pleasing, or in
                    other words “the counterfeit of a subsection of statesmanship.” This oracular
                    definition rouses the interest of Gorgias, and Socrates proceeds with the
                    following “generalization and division—</p>

                <p>Flattery influences men through pleasure without knowledge. And the rhetor is a
                    kind of confectioner, who can with difficulty be distinguished from the
                    sophist.</p>
                <p>δ. Rhetoric, then, is not an art. And persuasion is not the secret of power. Here
                    Socrates maintains against Polus the three paradoxes :—</p>
                <p>The tyrant does what he chooses but not what he λvishes;</p>
                <p>It is less evil to suffer wrong than to do wrong;</p>
                <p>It is better for the wrongdoer to be punished than to escape punishment.</p>
                <p>The only use of rhetoric, therefore, is for self-accusation, and (if it is ever
                    permissible to do harm) to prevent the punishment of one’s enemy.</p>
                <p>2. Callicles here loses patience and breaks in. He propounds his theory, which is
                    based on the opposition of nature and custom.</p>
                <p>“There is no natural right but the right of the stronger. And natural nobility is
                    to have strong passions and power to gratify them. The lawful is a word that
                    cowards use, Devised at first to keep the strong in awe.’’</p>
                <p>Socrates entangles him in an argument in which it is proved that pleasure is
                    different from good, and that there are good and bad pleasures.</p>
                <p>Now the question is whether the life of philosophy, or the life which Callicles
                    defends, is conducive to good. And it has been shown that rhetoric is one of a
                    class of pursuits which minister to pleasure without discriminating what is
                    good.</p>
                <p>Callicles again becomes impatient. Did not Themistocles, Cimon, Pericles labour
                    for their country’s good? Socrates then renews his demonstration, proving that
                    if the just man is wronged the evil lies with the wrongdoer, not with him, and
                    that it is worst for the wrongdoer if he escape. And for avoidance of this
                    greatest evil not rhetoric avails anything, nor any of the arts which save life
                    (seeing that life may be used well or ill), nor even such an art of politics as
                    Themistocles, Cimon, or Pericles knew, but another science of politics which
                    Socrates alone of the Athenians practises. The pursuit of it may well endanger
                    him; but his strength lies in having done no wrong. For in the world to come he
                    can present his soul faultless before her judge. Not the show of justice but the
                    reality will avail him there.</p>
                <p>This truth is enforced by an impressive myth. And Callicles is invited to leave
                    the life which relies on rhetoric and to follow Socrates in practising the life
                    of philosophic virtue.</p>
                <p>The value of justice has been shown. But what is justice? Is the life upheld by
                    Socrates sufficiently definite for practical guidance? The views of Callicles
                    have been overborne; but have they been thoroughly examined? Socrates claims to
                    be the only politician. But how can that deserve the name of policy which
                    results in doing nothing? These and cognate questions may well have haunted
                    Plato when he planned the greatest of his works. For that which lay deepest in
                    him was not mere speculative interest or poetic fervour, but the practical
                    enthusiasm of a reformer. The example of Socrates had fired him with an ideal of
                    wisdom, courage, temperance, and righteousness, which under various guises, both
                    abstract and concrete, has appeared and reappeared in the preceding dialogues.
                    But the more vividly he conceived of this ideal life, the more keenly he felt
                    its isolation in the present world—that of the restored Athenian democracy. For
                    to a Greek mind above all others life was nothing Without the social
                    environment, and justice, of all virtues, could least be realized apart from a
                    community. Hence it became necessary to imagine a form of society in which the
                    ideal man might find himself at home, a state to which the philosopher might
                    stand in harmonious relationship, no longer as an alien sojourner, but as a
                    native citizen, not standing aloof in lonely contemplation, but acting with the
                    full consent of other men and ruling in the right of wisdom. Plato did not
                    regard his own republic as a barren dream. He believed that sooner or later in
                    the course of time a state essentially resembling his ideal commonwealth would
                    come into being. Still more firmly was he convinced that until then mankind
                    would not attain their highest possible development. To ignore this real aspect
                    of his most serious work is to lose much of the author’s meaning. Yet it is
                    hardly less erroneous to interpret a great imaginative creation <hi

                    in anticipation or retrospect, an air of sober reality and matter-of-fact. He is
                    more in earnest about principles than about details, and if questioned would
                    probably be found more confident with regard to moral than to political truth.

                    iv. contain the outlines of the perfect state, including the education of the
                    “guardians,” and leading up to the definition of justice (a) in the state, and
                    <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> in the individual. (3) Bks. v., vi,, vii. (which to

                    vi. and vii. (which have again, as some think, the appearance of an outgrowth
                    from bk. v.). (4) Bks. viii. and ix., resuming the general subject from bk. iv.,
                    present the “obverse side,” by showing the declension of the state and
                    individual through four stages, until in the life of tyranny is found the image
                    of ideal injustice, as that of justice was found in the life of the perfect
                    state. (5) Bk. X. forms a concluding chapter, in which several of the foregoing
                    enactments are reviewed, and the work ends, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gorgias,</hi> with a vision of judgment.</p>
                <p>Thus the main outlines of the scheme are contained in bks. ii., iii., iv., viii.,
                    ix. And yet bks. v., vi., vii. form the central portion, a sort of inner kernel,
                    and are of the highest significance.</p>
                <p>In speculating about the composition of the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> (as
                    is the fashion of some interpreters), it is important to bear in mind the
                    general character of Plato’s writings.</p>
                <p>“The conception of unity,” says Professor Jowett,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jowett, Introd, to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaedrus.</hi></p></note> “really applies in very different degrees to
                    different kinds of art,—to a statue, for example, far more than to any kind of
                    literary composition, an&lt;l to some species of literature far more than to
                    others. Nor does the dialogue appear to be a style of composition in which the
                    requirement of unity is most stringent; nor should the idea of unity derived
                    from one sort of art be hastily transferred to another. . . . Plato subjects
                    himself to no rule of this sort. Like every great artist he gives unity of form
                    to the different and apparently distracting topics which he brings together. He
                    works freely, and is not to be supposed to have arranged every part of the
                    dialogue before he begins to write. He fastens or weaves together the frame of
                    his discourse loosely and imperfectly, and which is the warp and which the woof
                    cannot always be determined.”</p>
                <p>It should be added, that as Dialectic was still a “world not realized,” and he
                    was continually conscious of using imperfect methods, he was not solicitous to
                    bind himself to any one method, or to watch carefully over the logical coherence
                    of his work. “Sailing with the wind of his argument,” he often tacks and veers,
                    changing his method with his subject-matter, much as a poet might adopt a change
                    of rhythm. Absorbed as he is in each new phase of his subject, all that precedes
                    is cancelled for the time. And much of what is to come is deliberately kept out
                    of view, because ideas of high importance are reserved for the place where their
                    introduction will have most effect. Another cause of apparent inconsequence in
                    Plato is what he himself would call the use of hypothesis. He works less
                    deductively and more from masses of generalized experience than Platonists have
                    been ready to admit. And in the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> he is as much
                    engaged with the criticism of an actual as with the projection of an ideal
                    condition of society.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    If we knew more of the working of</p>
                <p>Attic institutions as he observed them, we should often understand him
                    better.</p>
                <p>These general considerations should be weighed against the inequalities which
                    have led some critics to suppose that the “first sketch of the state” in bks.
                    ii∙-iv. is much earlier than the more exalted views of bks. v.-vii. If in these
                    later books new conditions for choosing the future rulers are allowed to emerge,
                    if in discussing the higher intellectual virtues the simple psychology of bk.
                    iv. is lost sight of (it reappears in the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus'),</hi> if
                    the “knowledge of the expedient” at first required falls far short of the
                    conception of knowledge afterwards attained, all this is quite in keeping with
                    Plato’s manner elsewhere, and may be sufficiently accounted for by artistic and
                    dialectical reserve. It can hardly be an altogether fortuitous circumstance that
                    the culminating crisis, the third and highest wave of difficulty,—the
                    declaration that philosophers must be kings and kings philosophers,—comes in
                    precisely at the central point of the whole long work.</p>
                <p>The great principle of the political supremacy of mind, though thus held back
                    through half the dialogue, really dominates the whole. It may be read between
                    the lines all through, even in the institution of gymnastic and the appraisement
                    of the cardinal virtues. It is a genuine development of Socratic thought. And it
                    is this more than any other single feature which gives the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Republic</hi> a prophetic significance as “an attempt towards anticipating the
                    work of future generations.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Grote.</p></note></p>
                <p>Other aspects of the great dialogue, the Dorian framework, so inevitable in the
                    reaction from Ionian life, the traces of Pythagorean influence, the estimate of
                    oligarchy and democracy, the characters of the interlocutors in their bearing on
                    the exposition, have been fully treated by recent writers, and for brevity’s
                    sake are here passed over.</p>
                <p>There are other points, however, which must not be omitted, because they are more
                    intimately related to the general development of Plato’s thoughts.</p>
                <p>1. The question debated by Proclus has been raised before and since, whether the
                    proper subject of the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> is justice or the state.
                    The doubt would be more suggestive if put in a somewhat different form: Is Plato
                    more interested in the state or the individual? That he is in earnest about
                    both, and that in his view of them they are inseparable, is an obvious answer.
                    And it is almost a truism to say that political relations were prior to ethical
                    in the mind of a Greek. Yet if in some passages the political analogy reacts on
                    moral notions (as in the definition of temperance), in others the state is
                    spoken of in language borrowed from individual life. And it remains questionable
                    whether the ethics or the politics of the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> are
                    less complete. On the whole Plato himself seems to be conscious that the ideal
                    derived from the lifework of Socrates could be more readily stamped on
                    individual lives than on communities of men (see especially <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rep.,</hi> vii. 528 A, ix. 592).</p>
                <p>2. The analogy of the individual is often used to enforce the requirement of
                    political unity and simplicity (see especially v. 462 C). This is also to be
                    referred, however, to Plato’s general tendency to strain after abstractions. He
                    had not yet reached a point of view from which he could look steadily on
                    particulars in the light of universal principles. He recurs often to experience,
                    but is soon carried off again into the abstract region which to him seemed
                    higher and purer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See,
                    for example, the admission of luxury and the after-purification through “music,”
                    bks. ii., iii.</p></note> “It has been said that Plato flies as well as walks,
                    but this hardly expresses the whole truth, for he flies and walks at the same
                    time, and is in the air and on firm ground in successive instants
                    ’’(Jowett).</p>

                <p>Plato’s scheme of communism had been suggested to him partly by Dorian
                    institutions and partly by the Pythagorean rule. But it was further commended by
                    the general consideration that the state is a higher and more abstract unity
                    than the family. The lower obligation must give way to the higher; the universal
                    must overrule the particular bond.</p>
                <p>3. Similarly it may be argued that, while the subordination of music to state
                    discipline, and the importance attached to rhythm and harmony in education, had
                    likewise a connexion with Sparta and the Pythagoreans severally, Plato’s
                    deliberate attitude towards poetry and art could hardly be other than it is.
                    Philosophy, while still engaged in generalization, could not assign to the
                    imagination its proper function. “Aesthetik” could not enter into her purview.
                    For a moment, in the <hi rend="italic">Symposium,</hi> the ancient quarrel of
                    poetry and philosophy had seemed to be melted in a dominant tone, but this was
                    only a fond anticipation. Plato, if man ever did so, had felt the siren charm,
                    but he is now embarked on a more severe endeavour, and, until the supreme unity
                    of truth and good is grasped, vagrant fancy must be subdued and silent.</p>
                <p>4. In the early education of the guardians a place is found for the unconscious
                    virtue acquired through habit which the <hi rend="italic">Protagoras</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Meno</hi> stumbled over and the <hi rend="italic">Phεedo</hi>
                    treated with disdain. In the ideal state, however, this lower excellence is no
                    longer a wild plant, springing of itself through some uncovenanted grace of
                    inspiration, but cultivated through an education which has been purified by
                    philosophy so as to be in harmony with reason. But if Plato were
                    cross-questioned as to the intrinsic value of habits so induced as a
                    preservative for his pupils against temptation, he would have replied, “I do not
                    pretend to have removed all difficulties from their path. Enough of evil still
                    surrounds them to test their moral strength. I have but cleared the well-springs
                    of the noxious weeds that have been fatal to so many, in order that they may
                    have little to unlearn, and be exposed only to such dangers as are
                    inevitable.”</p>
                <p>5. It is a singular fact, and worth the attention of those who look for system in
                    Plato, that the definition of justice here so laboriously wrought out, viz., the
                    right division of labour between the three classes in the state and between the
                    three corresponding faculties in the individual soul, is nowhere else repeated
                    or applied, although the tripartite division of the soul recurs in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Timaeus,</hi> and the notion of justice is of great importance to
                    the arguments of the <hi rend="italic">Politicus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laws.</hi></p>
                <p>6. Before leaving the <hi rend="italic">Republic,</hi> it is important to mark
                    the stage which has now been reached by Plato’s doctrine of ideas. The
                    statements of the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> on this subject are by no
                    means everywhere consistent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Towards the end of bk. v. philosophers are defined as
                    lovers of the whole, who recognize the unity of justice, goodness, beauty, each
                    in itself, as distinguished from the many just or good or beautiful things. The
                    former are said to be objects of knowledge, the latter of opinion, which is
                    intermediate between knowledge and ignorance. Knowledge is of being, ignorance
                    of the non-existent, opinion of that which is and is not.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">b.</hi> In bk. vi. there is a more elaborate statement,
                    implying a more advanced point of view. The “contemplation of all time and all
                    existence” is a riper conception than “the love of each thing as a whole.”
                    Ignorance and nonentity have now disappeared, and the scale is graduated from
                    the most evanescent impression of sense to the highest reach of absolute
                    knowledge. And in the highest region there is again a gradation, rising to the
                    form of good, and descending from it to the true forms of all things. In the
                    application of this scheme to the theory of education in bk. vii. there are
                    still further refinements. The psychological analysis becomes more subtle, and
                    more stress is laid on the connexion of ideas.</p>
                <p>c. The doctrine reverts to a cruder aspect in bk. x., where we are told of an
                    ideal bed, which is one only and the pattern of all the many actual beds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">d.</hi> A yet different phase of idealism presents itself in
                    bk. ix. <hi rend="italic">(sub Jin.),</hi> in the mention of a “pattern” of the
                    perfect state laid up in heaven which the philosopher is to make his rule of
                    life.</p>
                <p>What is said above concerning Plato’s mode of composition has some bearing on
                    these inconsistencies of expression. And that bks. vi., vii., as being the most
                    important, were finished last is a not untenable hypothesis. But that Plato, in
                    preparing the way for what he had in contemplation, should content himself with
                    provisional expressions which he had himself outgrown, or that in a casual
                    illustration (as in bk. x.) he should go back to a crude or even childish form
                    of his own theory, is equally conceivable and in accordance with his manner
                    elsewhere. Socrates in the <hi rend="italic">Parmenides</hi> confessedly wavers
                    on this very point. And there are “ideas” of the four elements in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Timaeus.</hi></p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Euthydemus, Parmenides,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theaetetus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sophist, Statesman, Philebus</hi> (the
                    dialectical dialogues).—Even in the most advanced metaphysics of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Republic</hi> there is a hyperbolical, transcendental tendency,
                    from which Plato ultimately to some extent worked himself free. But it was not
                    in conversation with “dear Glaucon,” or “between the lines” of an
                    ethico-political writing, that this partial emancipation could be effectually
                    attained. We have now to consider a series of dialogues, probably intended for a
                    narrower circle of readers, in which Plato grapples directly with the central
                    difficulties of his own theory of knowing and being. It is not necessary to
                    assume that all of these are later than the <hi rend="italic">Republic.</hi> The
                    position of the <hi rend="italic">Euthydemus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parmenides</hi> in the order of composition is very uncertain. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Theaetetus</hi> has points of affinity with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Republic.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Sophist,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Politicus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Philebus</hi> are in a later style. But,
                    on account of their cognate subject-matter, these six dialogues may be
                    conveniently classed together in a group by themselves. And the right place for
                    such a group is intermediate between the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Laws.</hi></p>
                <p>The unity of the object of definition, the identity of virtue and knowledge, the
                    existence of an absolute good, which would be universally followed if
                    universally known, and of a standard of truth which is implied in the confession
                    of ignorance, were postulates underlying the Socratic process, which in so far
                    made no claim to be a “philosophy without assumptions.” These postulates, when
                    once apprehended, drew Plato on to speculate concerning the nature, the object,
                    and the method of knowledge. Now, so far as we have hitherto followed him, his
                    speculation has either been associated with ethical inquiry, or has been
                    projected in a poetical and semi-mythical form. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaedrus,</hi> however, the vision of ideas was expressly conjoined with an
                    outline of psychology and a foreshadowing of scientific method. And, while the
                    opposition of ideas to phenomena and of knowledge to opinion has been repeatedly
                    assumed, it has also been implied that there is a way between them, and that the
                    truth can only be approached by man through interrogation of experience. For it
                    is nowhere supposed that the human inquirer is from the first in a position to
                    deduce facts from ideas. Much rather, the light of the ideas is one which
                    fitfully breaks in upon experience as men struggle towards the universal.</p>
                <p>But it is not less true that the metaphysical aspirations from which Socrates had
                    seemed to recall men’s thoughts had been reawakened in consequence of the
                    impulse which <pb break="no"

                    virtue one? Can virtue be taught? Plato passes on to ask, What is , unity? What
                    are knowledge and being? From criticizing imperfect modes of teaching virtue, he
                    has begun to speculate about the right and wrong uses of the intellect, and from
                    dramatic portraits of the individual Protagoras or Gorgias goes on to the ideal
                    delineation of the sophist. He has entered upon the “longer way,” and is no
                    longer contented with mere “hypotheses.” With this demand for scientific
                    precision his conception of the ideas themselves is modified, and he strives
                    anew to conceive of them in relation to one another, to the mind, and to the
                    world. As the balance of ethical truth was restored by admitting an unconscious
                    (or inspired) conformity to reason, so now a fresh attempt is made on the
                    intellectual side to bridge the gulf between sense and knowledge.</p>
                <p>This endeavour involves, not only an expansion of the method of Socrates, but an
                    examination of the earlier philosophies from which Socrates had turned away.
                    Their influence on Plato has been traceable in the preceding dialogues, though,
                    except in the case of Pythagoreanism <hi rend="italic">(Phxd., Rep.),</hi> it
                    has been mostly indirect and casual. But in these dialectical dialogues he
                    manifests his serious conviction that the contemporary fallacies which formed
                    the chief hindrance to inquiry were deeply rooted in forms of thought created by
                    earlier thinkers, above all by Heraclitus and Parmenides. To the exclusiveness
                    of their first principles as held by their followers Plato attributed the
                    barrenness and impracticable unreality of many discussions, which put
                    shadow-fighting and controversy in the place of real investigation, and led men
                    to think that truth <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> was unattainable. He
                    therefore enters into conversation, as it were, with the great minds of former
                    times, and in the spirit of Socrates compels each of them to yield up his
                    secret, and to acknowledge a supplemental truth. To this effort he may very
                    probably have been stimulated by the dialectical activity of his Socratic
                    friends at Megara, whose logical tastes had drawn them towards Eleaticism. But,
                    unlike them, while strengthening his metaphysical theory, he was also led to
                    give to his political speculations a more practical turn.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Euthydemus</hi> is a treatise “De Sophisticis Elenchis” in
                    the form of a farce, and may serve to introduce the five other dialogues, as the
                    encounter with Thrasymachus introduces the serious part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Republic.</hi> Under the veil of mockery there is more of concentrated thought,
                    and also more of bitterness, in this dialogue than in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protagoras</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Gorgias.</hi></p>
                <p>A sample of educational dialectic—in which Socrates draws out of young Clinias
                    the admissions (1) that a philosophy is needed, (2) that the highest philosophy
                    is a science of king-craft, which remains for the present undefined,—is
                    contrasted with a series of ridiculous sophisms, propounded by Dionysodorus and
                    his brother Euthydemus, in which absolute and relative notions, whether
                    affirmative or negative, object and subject, universal and particular, substance
                    and attribute, action and modality, are capriciously confused. Crito, to whom
                    Socrates narrates the scene, is moved to contempt. But Socrates warns him not on
                    this account to despair of philosophy. In conclusion, Isocrates, or some one
                    else, who prematurely mixes up philosophy with practical politics, is cautioned
                    against spoiling two good things.</p>
                <p>Such puzzles as—How can I learn either what I know or what I do not know?<note

                <p>Plato appears in the same act to have become aware of his affinity with
                    Parmenides, and to have been led to reconsider the foundations of his own
                    doctrine. The one being of Parmenides was a more abstract notion than justice,
                    beauty, or the good. And the Zenonian method had more pretension to exactness
                    than the Socratic. But it remained barren, because contented to repeat its own
                    first essays in the destructive analysis of experience, without rising to the
                    examination of its own first principles. For this higher criticism, of which he
                    himself also stood in need, Plato looks up from the disciples to the master,
                    Parmenides. The appeal to him is put into the mouth of Socrates, as a very young
                    man, who has framed for himself a theory of ideas, and would gladly see the
                    Zenonian process applied to the notions of sameness, difference, likeness,
                    unlikeness, unity, and being.</p>
                <p>Parmenides, whom Plato treats with tender reverence not unmixed with irony,
                    proposes to the youth a series of questions which reveal the crudity of the
                    doctrine of ∈ιδιy. (1) Are there ideas of trivial things?<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Comp. <hi rend="italic">Rep.,</hi> x,

                    proceed <hi rend="italic">in infinitum 1</hi> (4) If ideas are thoughts, do they
                    and their participants think? (5) If they are patterns, and things resemble
                    them, must there not be a pattern of the resemblance, and so on <hi
                    rend="italic">in infinitum?</hi> (6) If absolute, are they thinkable by man?</p>
                <p>These difficulties are real, and yet to deny ideas is to destroy philosophy. (As
                    the paradoxical doubts in the <hi rend="italic">Protagoras</hi> do not shake the
                    faith of Socrates in the existence of good, so neither does Plato here intend
                    for a moment to derogate from the belief in the existence of the One and the
                    True.)</p>
                <p>Parmenides advises Socrates to arm himself for the further pursuit of truth (1)
                    by the higher application and (2) by the extension or completion of the Zenonian
                    method. (1) The method is to be applied to abstractions. (2) It is not enough to
                    show the inferences which may be drawn from the admission of an hypothesis, but
                    account must also be taken of the inferences which follow from its
                    rejection.</p>
                <p>Parmenides exemplifies his suggestion by examining his own first principle in
                    conversation with a youth who, while a contemporary of Socrates, is a namesake
                    of Plato’s pupil Aristotle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Comp, the younger Socrates of the <hi rend="italic">Politicus.</hi> It would
                    be precarious to draw any inference from this minute fact.</p></note> Not
                    content with the affirmative and negative hypotheses, he pursues either along
                    two lines, according as either term of the proposition is emphasized, and this
                    not only as regards the hypothesis of unity, but also as applied to the
                    alternative hypothesis of plurality. The result, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protagoras,</hi> is purely destructive, and the dialogue ends abruptly without
                    a word of reply from Socrates.</p>
                <p>The second part of the <hi rend="italic">Parmenides</hi> may be regarded as an
                    experiment in which Plato “assays to go” in Eleatic armour. Yet the strange web
                    is “shot” with colours of original thought. The mode of conceiving time and
                    becoming, and the vision of nothingness towards the end, may be noted as
                    especially Platonic. These passages may be regarded in the same light as the
                    wise words of Protagoras or the sober truths which occur amidst the wild fancies
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Cratylus.</hi> They should not mislead the interpreter
                    into a search for recondite meanings.</p>
                <p>The Zenonian method has been carried out to the utmost in application to the
                    highest subject, and has led the mind into a maze of contradiction. It remains
                    to call in question the method itself, and the notion of absolute identity and
                    difference on which it hinges, and so to lay anew the foundation-stone of
                    thought.</p>
                <p>Before this can be attempted, however, another set of difficulties have to be
                    met, and another set of philosophers examined. For the current scepticism had
                    undermined the conception of knowledge as well as that of being, and the fame of
                    Heraclitus was hardly second to that of Parmenides. Protagoras appeared in a
                    former dialogue as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n216/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0216-0207"/> the champion of ordinary morality; he is now made
                    the exponent of ordinary thinking. His saying “Man the measure” is shown to rest
                    on the unstable basis of the Heraclitean flux. By an elaborate criticism of both
                    theories knowledge is at last separated from the relativity of sense; but the
                    subsequent attempt to distinguish on abstract grounds between true and false
                    opinion, and to define knowledge as true opinion with a reason (comp. 3∕eno),
                    proves ineffectual. Plato still shows traces of Megarian influence. But the
                    disjunctive method of the <hi rend="italic">Parmenides</hi> is not resumed. The
                    indirect proofs are so arranged as to exhibit the skill of Socrates in “bringing
                    to the birth” the germs of thought in a richly-endowed and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> κ</hi> pregnant” young mind. Theaetetus is the embodiment of
                    the philosophic nature described in <hi rend="italic">Rep.,</hi> bk. vi., and
                    has already been trained by Theodorus of Cyrene in geometry and the other
                    preparatory sciences of <hi rend="italic">Rep.,</hi> bk. vii. It is in
                    conversation with Theodorus that Socrates impressively contrasts the lives of
                    the lawyer and the philosopher. The <hi rend="italic">Theaetetus</hi> marks a
                    great advance in clearness of metaphysical and psychological expression. See for
                    example the passage (184-186) in which the independent function of the mind is
                    asserted, and ideas are shown to be the truth of experience. There is also a
                    distinct approach towards a critical and historical method in philosophy, while
                    the perfection of style continues unimpaired, and the person of Socrates is as
                    vividly represented as in any dialogue.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the persistence of an indirect and negative method, the spirit of
                    this dialogue also is the reverse of sceptical. “Socrates must assume the
                    reality of knowledge or deny himself” (197 A). Perhaps in no metaphysical
                    writing is the balance more firmly held between experience, imagination, and
                    reflexion. Plato would seem to have made a compact with himself to abstain
                    rigidly from snatching at the golden fruit that had so often eluded his grasp,
                    and to content himself with laboriously “cutting steps” towards the summit that
                    was still unsealed.</p>
                <p>With Plato, as with other inventive writers, a time seems to have arrived when he
                    desired to connect successive works in a series. Thus in planning the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sophistes</hi> he linked it to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theaetetus</hi> (which had been written without any such intention), and
                    projected a whole tetralogy of dialectical dialogues, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theaetetus, Sophistes,</hi><hi rend="italic">Politicus, Philosophus,</hi> of
                    which the last piece seems never to have been written.</p>
                <p>After an interval, of which our only measure is a change of style, the
                    philosopher returns to the great central question of knowledge and being. The
                    obstacle in his path, on which he has often played with light satire, dramatic
                    portraiture, and indirect allusion, is now to be made the object of a seriously
                    planned attack. He has made his approaches, and the enemy’s fortress is to be
                    forthwith sapped and overthrown. This hostile position is not merely the
                    “Sophistik” which, as some tell us, is an invention of the Germans, and as Plato
                    himself declares is only the reflexion or embodiment of the average mind,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Rep.,</hi>
                    vi. 493.</p></note> but the fallacy of fallacies, the prime falsehood (πρώτον
                    ψευδός) of all contemporary thought. This is nothing else than the crude
                    absoluteness of affirmation and negation which was ridiculed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Euthydemus,</hi> and has been elsewhere mentioned as the first
                    principle of the art of controversy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>άντιλογική.</p></note> For dramatic purposes this general
                    error is personified. And the word “sophist,” which had somehow become the <hi
                    rend="italic">bête</hi><hi rend="italic">noire</hi> of the Platonic school, thus
                    for the first time fixedly acquires the significance which has since clung to
                    the name.—That Plato himself would not adhere pedantically to the connotation
                    here implied is shown by the admission, at the opening of the dialogue, that
                    amongst other disguises under which the philosopher walks the earth, the sophist
                    is one.—In this dialogue, as in the <hi rend="italic">Parmenides,</hi> a new
                    method is introduced, and again by an Eleatic teacher. This method is repeated
                    with improvements in the <hi rend="italic">Politicus,</hi> and once more
                    referred to in the <hi rend="italic">Philebus.</hi> It bears a strong
                    resemblance to the “synagoge” and “diaeresis” of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaedrus,</hi> but is applied by the “friend from Elea” with a degree of
                    pedantry which Socrates nowhere betrays. And the two methods, although kindred,
                    have probably come through different channels,— the classifications of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> being Plato’s own generalization of the Socratic
                    process, while the dichotomies of the <hi rend="italic">Sophistes</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Politicus</hi> are a caricature of Socrates cast in the Megarian
                    mould. Plato seems to have regarded this method as an implement which might be
                    used with advantage only when the cardinal principles on which it turned had
                    been fully criticized.</p>
                <p>1. After various attempts to “catch the sophist,” he is defined as the maker of
                    an unreal likeness of truth. Here the difficulty begins—for the definition
                    implies the existence of the unreal, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of not-being.
                    In our extremity it is necessary to “lay hands on our father Parmenides.”</p>
                <p>2. The contradictions attendant on the notion of “being,” whether as held by
                    Parmenides or his opponents or by the “less exact” thinkers who came after them,
                    are then examined, and in an extremely subtle and suggestive passage (246-249)
                    an attempt is made to mediate between idealism and materialism. The result is
                    that while consummate being is exempt from change it cannot be devoid of life
                    and motion. “Like children, ‘ Give us both,’ say we.”</p>
                <p>3. This leads up to the main question :—(a) are different notions incommunicable,
                    or (δ) are all ideas indiscriminately communicable, or (c) is there communion of
                    some kinds and not of others? The last view is alone tenable, and is confirmed
                    by experience. And of the true combination and separation of kinds the
                    philosopher is judge.</p>
                <p>4. Then it is asked (in order to “bind the sophist ”) whether being is predicable
                    of not-being.</p>
                <p>Five chief kinds (or categories) are now examined, viz., being, rest, motion,
                    sameness, difference. Rest and motion are mutually incommunicable, but
                    difference is no less universal than being itself. For everything is “other”
                    than the rest, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> is not. Thus positive and negative
                    not only coexist but are coextensive.</p>
                <p>5. And, in spite of Parmenides, we have discovered the existence, and also the
                    nature, of not-being. It follows that the mere pursuit of contradictions is
                    childish and useless and wholly incompatible with a philosophic spirit.</p>
                <p>Negation, falsity, contradiction, are three notions which Plato from his height
                    of abstraction does not hold apart. His position is the converse of the
                    Spinozistic saying, “Omnis determinatio est negatio.” According to him, every
                    negative implies an affirmative. And his main point is that true negation is
                    correlative to true affirmation, much as he has said in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaedrus</hi> that the dialectician separates kinds according to the “lines and
                    veins of nature.” The <hi rend="italic">Sophistes</hi> is a standing protest
                    against the error of marring the finely-graduated lineaments of truth, and so
                    destroying the vitality of thought.</p>
                <p>The idealists whom the Eleatic stranger treats so gently have been identified
                    with the Megarians. But may not Plato be reflecting on a Megarian influence
                    operating within the Academy?</p>
                <p>Here, as partly already in the <hi rend="italic">Parmenides</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Theaetetus,</hi> the ideas assume the nature of categories, and
                    being is the sum of positive attributes, while negation, as the shadow of
                    affirmation, is likewise finally comprehended in the totality of being.</p>
                <p>The remark made incidentally, but with intense emphasis, that the universe lives
                    and moves “according to God,” is an indication of the religious tone which
                    reappears increasingly in the <hi rend="italic">Politicus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philebus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Timaeus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laws.</hi></p>
                <p>In passing on to consider the statesman, true and false, the Eleatic stranger
                    does not forget the lesson which has just been learned. While continuing his
                    method of dichotomies<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n217/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0217-0208"/>, he is careful to look on both sides of each
                    alternative, and he no longer insists on dividing between this and not-this when
                    another mode of classification is more natural. A rule not hitherto applied is
                    now brought forward, the rule of proportion or right measure <hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> (to</hi><hi rend="italic">μeτpιov),</hi> as distinguished from
                    arbitrary limitations. Nor is formal logical treatment any longer felt to be
                    adequate to the subject in hand, but an elaborate myth is introduced. On the
                    ethico-political side also a change has come over Plato. As he has stripped his
                    ideas of transcendental imagery, so in reconsidering his philosopher-king he
                    turns away from the smiling optimism of the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> and
                    looks for a scientific statesmanship that shall lay a strong grasp upon the
                    actual world. He also feels more bitterly towards the demagogues and other
                    rulers of Hellas. The author of the <hi rend="italic">Politicus</hi> must have
                    had some great quarrel with mankind. But so far as they will receive it he is
                    still intent on doing them good.</p>
                <p>1. The king is first defined as a herdsman of men, who as “slow bipeds” are
                    distinguished from the pig and the ape. But the king is not all in all to his
                    charges, as the herdsman is. The above definition confuses human with divine
                    rule.</p>
                <p>2. Now the universe is like a top, which God first winds in one direction and
                    then leaves to spin the other way. In the former or divine cycle all was
                    spontaneous, and mankind, who had all things in common, were under the immediate
                    care of gods. They were happy, if they used their leisure in interrogating
                    nature. But in this reign of Zeus it is far otherwise. Men have to order their
                    own ways and try to imitate in some far-off manner the all-but forgotten divine
                    rule.</p>
                <p>3. Therefore in our present definition the term “superintendent” must be
                    substituted for “herdsman.”</p>
                <p>What special kind of superintendence is true statesmanship?</p>
                <p>4. By way of an example, the art of weaving is defined. The example shows that
                    kingcraft has first to be separated from other kindred arts, both causal and
                    co-operative. Nine categories are adduced which exhaust social functions. Eight
                    are eliminated, and the ninth, the class of ministers, remains. Of these (a)
                    slaves, (δ) hirelings, (c) traders, (&lt;Z) officials, (e) priests are again
                    parted off, although the last are only with difficulty separated from the king,
                    when (∕) a strange medley of monstrous creatures come into view. Some are fierce
                    like lions, some crafty like the fox, and some have mixed natures like centaurs
                    and satyrs. These are the actual rulers of mankind, more sophistical and
                    juggling than the sophist himself. And they too must be separated from the true
                    king.</p>
                <p>5. The familiar tripartite distinction of monarchy, oligarchy, democracy, is
                    doubled by introducing into each the distinction involved in the presence or
                    absence of wealth, and in the observance or non-observance of law. But no one of
                    the six carries in itself a scientific principle.</p>
                <p>The true government is the rule, not of many, but of one or of a few. “And they
                    may govern, whether poor or rich, by freewill or compulsion, and either with or
                    without law, so long as they govern scientifically.”</p>
                <p>6. The respondent, a youthful namesake of Socrates, is shocked at the remark that
                    the true ruler may govern without law.</p>
                <p>This leads to a discussion of the nature of law, which is compared to the
                    prescription left by a physician. If present, he might dispense with his own
                    rule. So the presence of a competent ruler is better than the sovereignty of
                    law, which makes no allowance for nature or circumstance, but tyrannically
                    forces its own way. Imagine medicine, navigation, &amp;c., similarly conducted
                    by time-honoured prescription, with penalties for innovation;—what would become
                    of civilization? Yet if law is disregarded by rulers who are unscientific and
                    warped by self-interest, this leads to far worse evils. For the laws are based
                    on some experience and wisdom. Hence, in the continued absence of the true
                    ruler, the best course, though only second best, is the strict observance of
                    law. And he who so rules in humble imitation of the scientific governor may be
                    truly called a king, although if the divine lawgiver were to appear his living
                    will would supersede the law.</p>
                <p>7. As it is, though cities survive many evils, yet many are shipwrecked because
                    of the ignorance of those at the helm. ' The order of badness in the actual
                    states is—</p>

                </table>
                <p>8. It remains to separate from the true ruler those who co-operate with him as
                    subordinates, the general, the judge, the orator. His own peculiar function is
                    an art of weaving strength (the warp) with gentleness (the woof), when education
                    has prepared them,—and this (1) by administration, (2) by marriage.</p>
                <p>The four preceding dialogues have shown (1) the gradual transformation of the
                    Platonic ideas (while still objective) into forms of thought, (2) the tendency
                    to group them into series of categories, (3) a corresponding advance in
                    psychological classification, (4) an increasing importance given to method, (5)
                    the inclination to inquire into processes (γev∈σeις) as well as into the nature
                    of being.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Plato’s approach to the Eleatics, though in the way of criticism, has
                    brought into prominence the notions of unity, being, sameness, difference, and
                    has left somewhat in abeyance the idea of good. To this “highest of all studies”
                    Plato now returns, equipped with his improved instruments, and ready to forge
                    new ones in the same laboratory, or in some other, should occasion serve. His
                    converse with Parmenides ended in his assertion of an element of difference
                    pervading all things, in other words, of an indeterminate element underlying all
                    determinations. This brings him again into relation with the Pythagoreans, who
                    had similarly asserted the combination of finite and infinite in the
                    universe.</p>
                <p>Taking advantage of their help, he gains a more advanced (but still ideal)
                    conception of the concrete harmony of things, and approaches the definition of
                    that which in the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> he but shadowed forth.</p>
                <p>With this most serious inquiry there is combined (as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sophistes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Politicus)</hi> an ironical and
                    controversial use of dialectic, by which the juggler and false pretender (who is
                    in this case the goddess of pleasure), after claiming the highest place, is
                    thrust down to the lowest.</p>
                <p>It must be admitted that the style of the <hi rend="italic">Philebus</hi> is far
                    from brilliant, or even clear. In the effort of connecting abstractions Plato’s
                    movement is more laboured than in his first glad realization of them.</p>
                <p>Instead of attempting here to follow the windings of the dialogue, it must
                    suffice to state the main result. Neither pleasure nor knowledge is the highest
                    good, and the good eludes definition; but the shrine, or habitation, of the good
                    is a complex life of which the elements are, in order of merit—(1) measure, the
                    cause of all right mixture; (2) <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> beauty, the effect,
                    and <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> reality, the inseparable condition; (3)
                    intellect; (4) science, art, and right opinion; (5) pure pleasure unaccompanied
                    with pain. “Not all the animal kingdom shall induce us to put pleasure
                    first.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Philebus</hi> introduces us to the interior of the Academy
                    in the lifetime of the master. More than any other of the dialogues it recalls
                    Aristotle’s description of Plato’s teaching. But, while his followers seem early
                    to have fallen under the dominance of the latest phase of his doctrine, Plato
                    himself, even in the <hi rend="italic">Philebus,</hi> is still detached from any
                    servitude to the creations of his own mind. He manipulates them as the medium
                    for expressing his fresh thoughts, but they are not yet crystallized into a
                    system.</p>
                <p>“I will remind you,” Socrates, “of what has been omitted,” says Protarchus at the
                    conclusion of this dialogue. The last (presumably) of Plato’s metaphysical
                    writings thus fitly ends with a confession of incompleteness. But if, as Μ.
                    Renan says, “the most fatal error is to believe that one serves one’s country by
                    calumniating those who founded it,” neither is. it for the interest of science
                    to ignore these imperfect anticipations. By methods elaborated in the course of
                    centuries, and far more sure than any which Plato had at his command, mankind
                    have gained an extent of knowledge which he dreamt not of.<note anchored="true"

                    rend="italic">[Hermocratesy—</hi> As the <hi rend="italic">Sophistes</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Politicus</hi> were written in continuation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Theaetetus,</hi> so, at some uncertain time, Plato conceived the
                    design of writing a great trilogy, for which the ideal state depicted in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Republic</hi> should be the point of departure. The grand outline
                    there sketched by Socrates was now to be filled up by Critias and Hermocrates.
                    The form set up by reasoning should be made alive, the “airy burghers” should be
                    seen “making history.” As a prelude to this magnificent celebration, Timaeus,
                    the Pythagorean philosopher, who is present at the Panathenaea, is invited to
                    discourse of the origin of all things, and to bring down the glorious theme to
                    the creation of man. What should have followed this, but is only commenced in
                    the fragment of the <hi rend="italic">Critias,</hi> would have been the story,
                    not of a fall, but of the triumph of reason in humanity.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Philebus</hi> (59 A, comp. 62 D) Plato speaks with a
                    touch of contempt of the life-long investigation of nature, as being concerned
                    only with this visible universe, and immersed in the study of phenomena, whether
                    past, present, or to come, which admit of no stability and therefore of no
                    certainty. “These things have no absolute first principle, and can never be the
                    objects of reason and true science.”</p>
                <p>Yet even this lower knowledge is there admitted as an element of that life which
                    is the habitation of the good. And there are not wanting signs in his later
                    dialogues that Plato’s imagination had again been strongly drawn towards those
                    physical studies which, as the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> shows, had
                    fascinated him in youth. That nature and the world proceed “according to God and
                    not according to chance” is the belief of the Eleatic stranger, to which he
                    perceives that Theaetetus will be irresistibly drawn as he grows older. In the
                    midst of dialectical abstractions, the processes of actual production (γα√σ-∈ιs)
                    have been increasingly borne in mind. And the myth in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Politicus</hi> turns on cosmological conceptions which, although differing from
                    those in the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus,</hi> and more accordant with Plato’s
                    bitterest mood, yet throw a new light on the deeper current of his thoughts. In
                    the same passage (272 C) there occurs the first clear anticipation of an <hi
                    rend="italic">interrogatio</hi><hi rend="italic">naturae.</hi></p>
                <p>The impulse in this new direction, if not originated, was manifestly reinforced,
                    through closer intercourse with the Pythagorean school. And the choice of
                    Timaeus the Pythagorean as chief speaker is an acknowledgment of this obvious
                    tendency. If in the course of the dialogue there occur ideas apparently borrowed
                    from the Atomists, whom Plato persistently ignored, this fact ought probably to
                    be referred to some early reaction of Atomic on Pythagorean doctrine. It is
                    important to observe, however, that not only the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus,</hi>
                    but the unfinished whole of which it forms the introduction, is professedly an
                    imaginative creation. For the legend of prehistoric Athens and of Atlantis,
                    whereof Critias was to relate what belonged to internal policy and Hermocrates
                    the conduct of the war, would have been no other than a prose poem, a
                    “mythological lie,” conceived in the spirit of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Republic,</hi> and in the form of a fictitious narrative. And, therefore, when
                    Timaeus professes to give only a probable account of shadowy truths, he must be
                    taken at his word, and not criticized in too exacting a spirit. His descriptions
                    have much the same relation to the natural philosophy of Plato’s time that
                    Milton’s cosmology has to the serious investigations of Galileo or
                    Copernicus,—except that all physical speculation hitherto partook in some
                    measure of this half-mythological character, and that Plato’s mind, although
                    working in an unfamiliar region, is still that of a speculative philosopher.</p>
                <p>As Parmenides, after demonstrating the nonentity of growth and decay, was yet
                    impelled to give some account of this non-existent and unintelligible phenomenal
                    world, so Plato, although warned off by Socrates, must needs attempt to give a
                    probable and comprehensive description of the visible universe and its creation.
                    In doing so he acknowledges an imperfect truth in theories which his dialectic
                    had previously set aside. In examining the earlier philosophers he has already
                    transgressed the limits prescribed by Socrates, and the effort to connect ideas
                    has made him more and more conscious of the gap between the ideal and the
                    actual. He cannot rest until he has done his utmost to fill up the chasm—calling
                    in the help of imagination where reason fails him.</p>
                <p>His dominant thought is still that of a deduction from the “reason of the best,”
                    as in the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo,</hi> or “the idea of good,” as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Republic.</hi> But both his abstract idealism and his absolute
                    optimism were by this time considerably modified, and, although not confounding
                    “causes with conditions,” as he once accused Anaxagoras of doing, he yet assigns
                    more scope to “second causes” than he would then have been willing to attribute
                    to them. This partly comes of ripening experience and a deepening sense of the
                    persistency of evil, and partly from the feeling—which seems to have grown upon
                    him in later life—of the distance between God and man.</p>
                <p>Timaeus begins by assuming (1) that the universe being corporeal is caused and
                    had a beginning, and (2) that its mysterious author made it after an everlasting
                    pattern. Yet, being bodily and visible, it can only be made the subject, humanly
                    speaking, of probable discourse.</p>
                <p>Thus much being premised, he proceeds to unfold—(A) the work of mind in creation,
                    (B) the effects of necessity, including the general and specific attributes of
                    bodies, (C) the principles of physiology, and (D) an outline of pathology and
                    medicine.</p>
                <p>To give a full account of such a comprehensive treatise is beyond the scope of
                    this article, and the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus,</hi> however great and
                    interesting, has been well described as an out-building of the great fabric of
                    original Platonism. A very few scattered observations are all that there is
                    space for here.</p>
                <p>(A) 1. In the mythology of the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> some of the
                    conceptions which attained logical clearness in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sophist</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Philebus</hi> resume an ontological form.
                    Thus, in compounding the soul-stuff of the universe, the father of all takes of
                    the'continuous and discrete and fuses them into an essence (the composite being
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Philebus).</hi> Again he takes of the same and other
                    (comp, the <hi rend="italic">Sophist),</hi> overcoming their inherent repugnance
                    by his sovereign act.</p>
                <p>2. The notion of an economy or reservation in Plato has been often exaggerated
                    and misapplied. But it is difficult to acquit him of intentional obscurity in
                    speaking of the creation of the Earth. It is clear, though Plato does not say
                    so, that she is meant to have been created together with the Heaven and together
                    with Time, and so before the other “gods within the heaven,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the sun and moon and five planets, and it is a plausible supposition
                    that she is the “artificer of day and night” by interposing her bulk to the
                    sun’s rays. If the word <hi rend="italic">eiκλoμεvη</hi> in p. 40 implies motion
                    (as Aristotle thought<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Aristotle, however, uses <hi rend="italic">etKovuwn,</hi> a different
                    word.</p></note>), it cannot be, as Grote supposed, a motion consentaneous with
                    that of the outer sphere, but either some far slower motion, perhaps assumed in
                    order to account for the shifting of the seasons, or an equal retrograde motion
                    which is supposed to neutralize in her case the “motion of the same.” She clings
                    to the centre, as her natural abode. And the diurnal motion of the heavens is
                    due not to any mechanical force but to the soul of the world extending from the
                    centre to the poles and comprehending all.</p>
                <p>3. Immortality is in the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> dependent on the will of
                    the Eternal. And the sublime idea of eternity is here first formulated.</p>
                <p>4. The phenomena of vision and hearing are included among the works of reason,
                    because the final cause of these higher senses is to give men perception of
                    number, through contemplation of the measures of time.</p>
                <p>(B) 1. It has been commonly said that the four elements of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Timaeus</hi> are geometrical figures, without content. This is not true. For
                    what purpose does Plato introduce, “besides the archetype and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n219/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0219-0210"/> the created form, a third kind, dim and hard to
                    conceive, a sort of limbec or matrix of creation,” if not to fill up the
                    triangles which are elements of elements, and to be the vehicle of the forms
                    compounded of them? It has been supposed that this “nurse of generation” is
                    identical with “space,” and it cannot be said that they are clearly kept apart
                    by Plato. But he had a distinct nomenclature for either, and, although gravity
                    is explained away (so that his molecules, unlike Clerk Maxwell’s, may be called
                    imponderable), yet extension, or the property of filling space, is sufficiently
                    implied.</p>
                <p>2. The difference of size in the triangles and varying sharpness of their
                    outlines are ingenious though inadequate expedients, adopted in order to account
                    for qualitative difference and physical change.</p>
                <p>3. In criticizing the illusory notion of up and down Plato broaches the
                    conception of antipodes.</p>
                <p>4. More distinctly than in the <hi rend="italic">Philebus,</hi> bodily pleasure
                    is explained by “a sudden and sensible return to nature” (comp. Ar., <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhet.,</hi> i. 11, § 1; <hi rend="italic">N. E.,</hi> vii.
                    10).</p>
                <p>5. Natural philosophers are warned against experimenting on the mixture of
                    colours, which is a divine process and forbidden to man.</p>
                <p>(C) 1. Plato tends more and more in his later writings to account for moral evil
                    by physical conditions, thus arriving at the Socratic principle of the
                    involuntariness of vice by a different road.</p>
                <p>Hence in the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> not the body only is made by the
                    inferior gods, but they also create the lower and mortal parts of the human soul
                    :—the principle of anger which is planted in the breast, within hearing of
                    reason, and that of appetite which is lodged below the diaphragm like an animal
                    tied in a stall, with the stomach for a crib and the liver for a “soothsaying”
                    looking-glass to soothe or terrify it when tempted to break loose.</p>
                <p>2. The brain-pan was left bare of protecting flesh “because the sons of God who
                    framed us deliberately chose for us a precarious life with capability of reason,
                    in preference to a long secure existence with obstruction of thought.”</p>
                <p>3. The nails are a rudimentary provision for the lower animals, into which
                    degenerate souls were afterwards to be transformed.</p>
                <p>4. Vegetables have sensation but not motion.</p>
                <p>5. By -way of illustrating the very curious account here given of respiration, it
                    is asserted that what is commonly thought to be the attraction of the magnet is
                    really due to rotatory motion and displacement.</p>
                <p>6. When the original particles wear out, and the bonds of soul and body in the
                    marrow give way, the soul escapes delightedly and flies away. This is the
                    painless death of natural decay.</p>
                <p>(D) 1. The dependence of mental disease on bodily conditions is more fully
                    recognized in the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> than elsewhere in Plato
                    (contrast the <hi rend="italic">Charmides,</hi> for example).</p>
                <p>2. He has also changed his mind abo,ut the treatment of disease, and shows more
                    respect for regimen and diet than in the <hi rend="italic">Republic.</hi>
                    Diseases are a kind of second nature, and should be treated accordingly·</p>
                <p>3. It is also a remark in contrast with the <hi rend="italic">Republic,</hi> that
                    overstudy leads to head complications, which physicians ascribe to chill and
                    find intractable.</p>
                <p>Lastly, it is one of the strange irregularities in the composition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> that the creation of woman and the relation of the
                    sexes<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is an
                    anticipation of microscopic observation in the words <hi rend="italic">αόρατα

                    other are subjects reserved to the end, because this is the place given to the
                    lower animals, and woman (compare the <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus)</hi> is the
                    first transmigration from the form of man. This order is probably not to be
                    attributed to Plato’s own thought, but to some peculiarity of Pythagorean or
                    Orphic tradition.</p>

                    concession, and such as he still hoped that some Hellenic state might sanction.
                    The motive for this great work may be gathered from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Politicus.</hi> The physician in departing is to give a written prescription,
                    adapted as far as possible to the condition of those from whom he goes away.
                    This is the second-best course, in the absence of the philosopher-king. And, as
                    the Hellenic world will not listen to Plato’s heroic remedy, he accom modates
                    his counsel to their preconceptions. He returns once more from abstract
                    discussions to study the application of ideas to life, and though, by the
                    conditions of the problem, his course is “nearer earth and less in light,” this
                    long writing, which is said to have been posthumous,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Published by Philippus the
                    Opuntian.</p></note> has a peculiar interest. The ripeness of accumulated
                    experience and the mellowness of wise contemplation make up for the loss of
                    prophetic insight and poetic charm.</p>
                <p>The form of dialogue is still retained, and an aged Athenian is imagined as
                    discoursing of legislation with the Lacedaemonian Megillus and the Cretan
                    Clinias, who has in view the foundation of a new colony, and is on his way with
                    his two companions from Cnossus to the temple and oracle of Zeus.</p>
                <p>Plato now aims at moderating between Dorian and Ionian law, freely criticizing
                    both, and refining on them from a higher point of view. “The praise of
                    obedience, the authority assigned to elders, the prohibition of dowries, the
                    enforcement of marriage, the common meals, the distribution and inalienability
                    of land, the institution of the Crypteia,. the freedom of bequest to a favourite
                    son, the dislike of city walls—all reflect the custom of Sparta.” . . . “The use
                    of the lot, the scrutiny of magistrates, the monthly courses of the council, the
                    pardon of the forgiven homicide, most of the regulations about testaments and
                    the guardianship of orphans, the degrees of consanguinity recognized by law,
                    correspond to Athenian laws and customs” (Jowett).</p>
                <p>The philosopher’s own thoughts come out most strongly in the “preludes” to the
                    laws,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See especially iv.

                    1st, atheism, 2d, denial of providence, 3d and worst, immoral superstition). The
                    difficulty which is met in the <hi rend="italic">Politicus</hi> by the
                    abandonment of the world for a time, and in the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi>
                    by the lieutenancy of lower gods, here leads to the hypothesis of an evil soul.
                    The priority of mind (often before asserted) and the increased importance
                    attached to numbers are the chief indications of Plato’s latest thoughts about
                    the intelligible world. But it must be remembered that the higher education
                    (answering to <hi rend="italic">Rep.,</hi> vi,, vii.) is expressly
                    reserved.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Legg.,</hi> xii. 968 E. (Ath.) “I am willing to share with you the
                    danger of stating to you my views about education and nurture, which is the
                    question coming to the surface again.”</p></note> Had Plato written his own <hi
                    rend="italic">Epinomis,</hi> the proportions of the whole work (not then
                    “acephalous”) might have been vastly changed.</p>
                <p>The severity of the penalties attached to the three forms of heresy, especially
                    to the third and worst of them, has led to the remark that Plato, after
                    asserting “liberty of prophesying,” had become intolerant and bigoted in his old
                    age. But the idea of toleration in the modern sense was never distinctly present
                    to thé mind of any ancient philosopher. And, if in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laws</hi> the lines of thought have in one way hardened, there are other ways
                    in which experience has softened them. Plato’s “second-best” constitution
                    contains a provision, which was not admissible in the “perfect state,” for
                    possible changes and réadaptations in the future. The power of self-reformation
                    is hedged round indeed with extreme precautions; and no young or middle-aged
                    citizen is ever to hear a word said in depreciation of any jot or tittle of the
                    existing law. But that it should be provided, however guardedly, that select
                    commissioners, after travelling far and wide, should bring back of the fruit of
                    their observations for the consideration of the nocturnal council, and that a
                    power of constitutionally <pb break="no"

                    the state, is sufficiently remarkable, when the would-be finality of ancient
                    legislation is considered. Plato even comes near to the reflexion that
                    “constitutions are not made, but grow” (iv. 709 A).</p>
                <p>Plato in the <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> desists finally from impersonating
                    Socrates. But he is in some ways nearer to his master in spirit than when he
                    composed the <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus.</hi> The sympathy with common life, the

                    Socratic than the love of truth which breathes in every page. And some
                    particular aspects of Socratism reappear, such as the question about

                <p>Two great forces are persistent in Plato, the love of truth and zeal for human
                    improvement. In the period culminating with the <hi rend="italic">Republic,</hi>
                    these two motives, the speculative and the practical, are fused in one
                    harmonious working. In the succeeding period, without excluding one another,
                    they operate with alternate intensity. In the varied outcome of his long
                    literary career, the metaphysical “doctrine of ideas” which has been associated
                    with Plato’s name underwent many important changes. But pervading all of these
                    there is the same constant belief in the supremacy of reason and the identity of
                    truth and good. From that abiding root spring forth a multitude of thoughts
                    coucerning the mind and human things,—turning chiefly on the principles of
                    psychology, education, and political reform, —thoughts which, although
                    unverified, and often needing correction from experience, still constitute Plato
                    the most fruitful of philosophical writers. While general ideas are powerful for
                    good or ill, while abstractions are necessary to science, while mankind are apt
                    to crave after perfection, and ideals, either in art or life, have an
                    acknowledged value, so long the renown of Plato will continue. “All philosophic
                    truth is Plato rightly divined; all philosophic error is Plato misunderstood
                    ”—is the verdict of one of the keenest of modern metaphysicians.<note

                <p>Plato’s followers, however, have seldom kept the proportions of his teaching. The
                    diverse elements of his doctrine have survived the spirit that informed them.
                    The Pythagorizing mysticism of the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> has been more
                    prized than the subtle and clear thinking of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theaetetus.</hi> Logical inquiries have been hardened into a barren ontology.
                    Semi-mythical statements have been construed literally, and mystic fancies
                    perpetuated without the genuine thought which underlay them. A part (and not the
                    essential part) of his philosophy has been treated as the whole. But the
                    influence of Plato has extended far beyond the limits of the Platonic schools.
                    The debt of</p>
                <p>Aristotle to his master has never yet been fully estimated. Zeno, Chrysippus,
                    Epicurus borrowed from Plato more than they knew. The moral ideal of Plutarch
                    and that of the Roman Stoics, which have both so deeply affected the modern
                    world, could not have existed without him. Neopythagoreanism was really a crude
                    Neoplatonism. And the Sceptics availed themselves of weapons either forged by
                    Plato or borrowed by him from the Sophists. A wholly distinct line of
                    infiltration is suggested by the mention of Philo and the Alexandrian schools,
                    and of Clement and Origen, while Gnostic heresies and even Talmudic mysticism
                    betray perversions of the same influence. The effect of Hellenic thought on
                    Christian theology and on the life of Christendom is a subject for a volume, and
                    has been pointed out in part by Professor E. Zeller and others (comp. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Neoplatonism).</hi> Yet when Plotinus in the 3d century (after
                    hearing Ammonius), amidst the revival of religious paganism, founded a new
                    spiritualistic philosophy upon the study of Plato and Aristotle combined, this
                    return to the fountain-head had all the effect of novelty. And for more than two
                    centuries, from Plotinus to Proclus, the great effort to base life anew on the
                    Platonic wisdom was continued. But it was rather the ghost than the spirit of
                    Plato that was so “unsphered.” Instead of striving to reform the world, the
                    Neoplatonist sought after a retired and cloistered virtue. Instead of vitalizing
                    science with fresh thought, he lost hold of all reality in the contemplation of
                    infinite unity. He had some skill in dealing with abstractions, but laid a
                    feeble hold upon the actual world.</p>
                <p>“Hermes Trismegistus” and “Dionysius Areopagita” are names that mark the
                    continuation of this influence into the Middle Ages. The pseudo-Dionysius was
                    translated by Erigena in the 9th century.</p>
                <p>Two more “Platonic” revivals have to be recorded,— at Florence in the 15th and at
                    Cambridge in the 17th century. Both were enthusiastic and both uncritical. The
                    translation of the dialogues into Latin by Marsiglio Ficino was the most lasting
                    effect of the former movement, which was tinged with the unscientific ardour of
                    the Renaissance. The preference still accorded to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Timaeus</hi> is a fair indication of the tendency to bring <hi rend="italic"
                    >fumum</hi><hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">fulgore</hi> which
                    probably marred the discussions of the Florentine Academy concerning the “chief
                    good.” The new humanism had also a sentimental cast, which was alien from Plato.
                    Yet the effect of this spirit on art and literature was very great, and may be
                    clearly traced not only in Italian but in English poetry.</p>
                <p>“The Cambridge Platonists” have been described by Principal Tulloch in his
                    important work on <hi rend="italic">Rational Theology in England in the VIth
                    Century.</hi> Their views were mainly due to a reaction from the philosophy of
                    Hobbes, and were at first suggested as much by Plotinus as by Plato. It is
                    curious to find that, just as Socrates and Ammonius (the teacher of Plotinus)
                    left no writings, so Whichcote, the founder of this school, worked chiefly
                    through conversation and preaching. His pupils exercised a considerable
                    influence for good, especially on English theology; and in aspiration if not in
                    thought they derived something from Plato, but they seem to have been incapable
                    of separating his meaning from that of his interpreters, and Cudworth, their
                    most consistent writer, was at once more systematic and less scientific than the
                    Athenian philosopher. The translations of Sydenham and Taylor in the 18th
                    century and the beginning of the 19 th are proofs of the continued influence of
                    Platonism in England.</p>
                <p>The critical study of Plato begins from Schleiermacher, who did good work as an
                    interpreter, and tried to arrange the dialogues in the order of composition. His
                    attempt, which, like manv efforts of constructive criticism, went far <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n221/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0221-0212"/> beyond possibility, was vitiated by the
                    ground-fallacy of supposing that Plato had from the first a complete system in
                    his mind which he partially and gradually revealed in writing. At a considerably
                    later time Karl Friedrich Hermann, to whom all students of Plato are indebted,
                    renewed the same endeavour on the far more plausible assumption that the
                    dialogues faithfully reflect the growth of Plato’s mind. But he also was too
                    sanguine, and exaggerated the possibility of tracing a connexion between the
                    outward events of Plato’s life and the progress of his thoughts. This great
                    question of the order of the dialogues, which has been debated by numberless
                    writers, is one which only admits of an approximate solution. Much confusion,
                    however, has been obviated by the hypothesis (first hinted at by Ueberweg, and
                    since supported by the present writer and others) that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sophistes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Politicus,</hi> whose genuineness had been
                    called in question by Socher, are really intermediate between the <hi
                    rend="italic">Republic</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Laws.</hi> The allocation
                    of these dialogues, and consequently of the <hi rend="italic">Philebus,</hi> not
                    only on grounds of metaphysical criticism, but also on philological and other
                    evidence of a more tangible kind, supplies a point of view from which it becomes
                    possible to trace with confidence the general outlines of Plato’s literary and
                    philosophical development. Reflecting at first in various aspects the
                    impressions received from Socrates, he is gradually touched with an inspiration
                    which becomes his own, and which seeks utterance in half-poetical forms. Then
                    first the ethical and by and by the metaphysical interest becomes predominant.
                    And for a while this last is all absorbing, as he confronts the central problems
                    which his own thoughts have raised. But, again, the hard-won acquisitions of
                    this dialectical movement must be fused anew with imagination and applied to
                    life. And in a final effort to use his intellectual wealth for the subvention of
                    human need the great spirit passed away.</p>
