                    by no means easy. There is no legal definition of what constitutes a poison, and
                    the definitions usually proposed are apt to include either too much or too
                    little. Generally, a poison may be defined to be a substance having an inherent
                    deleterious property, rendering it capable of destroying life by whatever avenue
                    it is taken into the system; or it is a substance which when introduced into the
                    system, or applied externally, injures health or destroys life irrespective of
                    mechanical means or direct thermal changes. In popular language, a poison is a
                    substance capable of destroying life when taken in small quantity; but a
                    substance which destroys life by mechanical means as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> powdered glass, is not, strictly speaking, a poison.</p>
                <p>The subject of toxicology forms one of the most important branches of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Medical Jurisprudence</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υ.).</hi> The
                    medical jurist should be familiar with the nature and actions of poisons, the
                    symptoms which they produce, the circumstances which modify their working, the
                    pathological results of their action, and the methods of combating these.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Action of Poisons.—</hi> Poisons may exert a twofold action.
                    This may be either local, or remote, or both local and remote. The local action
                    of a poison is usually one of corrosion, inflammation, or a direct effect upon
                    the sensory or motor nerves. The remote actions of poisons are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n285/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0285-0276"/> usually of a specific character, though some
                    writers group the remote effects of poisons under two heads, and speak of the
                    common and the specific remote effects of a poison. The local action of a poison
                    of the corrosive class is usually so well marked and obvious that the fact of
                    the administration of a poison of this class is generally unmistakable. The same
                    may be said, in a less degree, of the irritant poisons, especially the mineral
                    irritants; but here the symptoms sometimes so closely simulate those of natural
                    disease as to render the recognition of the administration of poison a matter of
                    difficulty. Hence an accurate acquaintance with the remote specific effects of
                    the various poisons is indispensable to the medical jurist. The class of poisons
                    which has been administered or taken will thus be suggested to his mind by the
                    observation of the symptoms; and not unfrequently the specific poison taken will
                    be suspected. It is almost universally admitted that absorption of a poison is
                    necessary for the production of its specific remote effects, and the old notion
                    that a poison may kill, by its action through the nervous system, without
                    absorption, is abandoned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Modifying Circumstances.—</hi> The ordinary action of a poison
                    may be greatly modified by the largeness of the dose, by the state of
                    aggregation, admixture, or of chemical combination of the poison, by the part or
                    membrane to which it is applied, and by the condition of the patient. Thus, for
                    example, opium may be a medicine or a poison according to the dose in which it
                    is given; and a dose of the drug which may be beneficial to an adult in certain
                    states of the system may be fatal to a child, or to an adult when suffering from
                    some forms of disease. All barium salts, again, are poisonous, except the quite
                    insoluble sulphate. The simple cyanides, and many double cyanides, are highly
                    poisonous; but yellow prussiate of potash, which is a double cyanide of iron and
                    potassium, is almost without action upon the system. The part or tissue to which
                    a poison is applied greatly affects the activity of a poison, owing to the
                    varying rapidity with which absorption takes place through the cutaneous,
                    mucous, and serous surfaces, and by the other tissues of the body. Curare, an
                    arrow poison, may be swallowed in considerable quantity without appreciable
                    result, whilst a minute quantity of the same substance introduced into a wound
                    is speedily fatal. Idiosyncracy has an important bearing in toxicology. Pork,
                    mutton, certain kinds of fish, more especially shell fish so-called, and
                    mushrooms have each produced all the symptoms of violent irritant poisoning,
                    whilst other persons who have partaken of the same food at the same time have
                    experienced no ill effects. Some persons are stated, on good authority, to be
                    capable of taking with impunity such poisons as opium, corrosive sublimate, or
                    arsenic, in enormous doses,—and this irrespective of habit, which is known to
                    have such an influence in modifying the effects of some poisons, notably the
                    narcotics. A tolerance of poisons is sometimes engendered by disease, so that a
                    poison may fail to produce its customary effect. Thus, opium is tolerated in
                    large quantities in tetanus, and in delirium tremens; and mercurial compounds
                    may in some febrile affections fail to produce the usual constitutional effects
                    of the metal. On the other hand, diseases which impede the elimination of a
                    poison may intensify its effects.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> that a poison has been administered is based
                    upon the symptoms produced, on the appearances met with in the body after death,
                    on the analysis of articles of food and drink, of excreta and ejecta, and of the
                    organs of the body after death, and on physiological experiments made with
                    substances extracted from the same articles. These physiological experiments are
                    usually made upon animals, but in some cases, as for instance when aconite has
                    to be searched for, the physiological experiments must be made also upon the
                    human subject. The evidence obtained from one or more of these sources, as
                    compared with the properties or effects of various known poisons, will enable
                    the medical jurist to form an opinion as to the administration or
                    non-administration of a poison.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">symptoms</hi> exhibited by the patient during life rarely
                    fail to afford some clue to the poison taken. Persons may, however, be found
                    dead of whose history nothing can be learned. Here post-mortem appearances,
                    chemical analysis, and, it may be, physiological experiments are all-important
                    for the elucidation of the nature of the case.</p>
                <p>Poisoning may be <hi rend="italic">acute</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chronic.</hi>
                    The general conditions which should arouse a suspicion of acute poisoning are
                    the sudden onset of serious and increasingly alarming symptoms in a person
                    previously in good health, especially if there be pain in the region of the
                    stomach, or, where there is complete prostration of the vital powers, a
                    cadaveric aspect, and speedy death. In all such cases the aid of the analytical
                    chemist must be called in either to confirm well-founded or to rebut ill-founded
                    suspicions.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">mode of treatment</hi> to be adopted in the case of
                    poisoned persons varies greatly according to the nature of the poison. The first
                    indication, when the poison has been swallowed, is to evacuate the stomach; and
                    this may usually be done by means of the stomach-pump when the poison is not of
                    the corrosive class; or the stomach may be gently washed out by means of a
                    funnel and flexible siphon-tube. In many cases emetics are valuable. Antidotes
                    and counter-poisons may then be given. The former are such substances as chalk
                    to neutralize the mineral acids and oxalic acid; the latter have a physiological
                    counteraction, and are such as atropine, which is a counter-poison to morphia.
                    These may usually be administered most effectively by hypodermic injection. The
                    stomach may to a certain degree be protected from the injurious effects of
                    irritants by the administration of mucilaginous drinks; alkaloids may be
                    rendered sparingly soluble by means of astringent substances containing tannin;
                    and pain may be relieved by means of opium, unless contra-indicated by the
                    nature of the poison. The effects of the convulsant poisons, such as strychnine,
                    may be combated by means of the inhalation of chloroform.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">classification</hi> of poisons is a matter of difficulty.
                    Various attempts have been made to classify them scientifically, but with no
                    signal success; and perhaps the best system is that which groups the various
                    poisons according to the more obvious symptoms which they produce. Our knowledge
                    of the more intimate action of poisons is still too imperfect to admit of any
                    useful classification according to the manner in which they specifically affect
                    the vital organs. Poisons may in the manner indicated be classified as (1) <hi
                    rend="italic">Corrosives,</hi> (2) <hi rend="italic">Irritants,</hi> (3) <hi
                    rend="italic">Neurotics,</hi> and (4) <hi rend="italic">Gaseous Poisons.</hi>
                    The subject of poisonous food has already been treated under the heading <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Medical Jurisprudence</hi> (vol. XV. pp. 781-2).</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Corrosives.</hi></p>
                <p>The typical member of this class is corrosive sublimate, the soluble chloride of
                    mercury. In it are included also the concentrated mineral acids (sulphuric,
                    nitric, and hydrochloric); oxalic acid; the alkalies (potash, soda, and ammonia)
                    and their carbonates; acid, alkaline, and corrosive salts of the metals (such as
                    bisulphate of potash, alum, butter of antimony, and nitrate of silver); also
                    carbolic acid. I</p>
                <p>The symptoms produced by the mineral acids and the alkalies are almost altogether
                    referrible to local action; but some corrosive poisons, such as carbolic acid,
                    produce, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n286/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0286-0277"/> besides a local action, remote and specific
                    constitutional effects. The symptoms of corrosive poisoning are marked and
                    unmistakable, except in infants. Immediately on swallowing the corrosive
                    substance, an acid, caustic, or metallic burning sensation is experienced in the
                    mouth, fauces, gullet, and region of the stomach, and this speedily extends over
                    the whole belly <hi rend="italic">; as</hi> a rule vomiting speedily follows. In
                    the case of the mineral acids, and in oxalic acid poisoning, the vomit is so
                    acid that if it falls upon a marble or concrete floor effervescence ensues. No
                    relief follows the evacuation of the stomach. The ejected matters contain blood,
                    and even fragments of the corroded walls of the alimentary canal. The belly
                    becomes distended with gas, and horribly tender. High fever prevails. The mouth
                    is found to be corroded. Death usually ensues within a few hours; or, if the
                    patient survives, he or she may perish miserably, months after the poison was
                    taken, through starvation consequent upon the gradual contraction of the gullet,
                    brought about by its corrosion and subsequent healing.</p>
                <p>The treatment of corrosive poisoning consists in very gently emptying and washing
                    out the stomach by means of a soft siphon-tube. The stomach-pump cannot be used
                    with safety in consequence of the weakening of the walls of the stomach by
                    corrosion. Demulcents and opiates may be subsequently administered. After death
                    from corrosive poisoning the walls of the stomach are found corroded, and even
                    perforated.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Corrosive Sublimate.—</hi> Here all the signs and symptoms
                    of corrosive poisoning are produced in their severest form. A grain or two of
                    this poison may prove fatal. Fortunately there is an efficient antidote in white
                    of egg, the albumen of which, if administered at once, renders the salt
                    insoluble. The eggs should be divested of their yolks, beaten up with water, and
                    given promptly, repeatedly, and abundantly, followed by emetics. Poisoning by
                    corrosive sublimate may be followed by the specific toxic effects of mercury,
                    such as salivation and tremor.</p>
                <p>Workers in mercury, such as water-gilders, looking-glass makers, and the makers
                    of barometers and thermometers, are apt to suffer from a peculiar form of
                    shaking palsy, known as “the trembles,” or mercurial tremor. This disease
                    affects most frequently those who are exposed to mercurial fumes. The victim is
                    affected with tremors when an endeavour is made to exert the muscles, so that he
                    is unable, for instance, to convey a glass of water to the lips steadily, and
                    when he walks he breaks into a dancing trot. The treatment consists in removal
                    from the mercurial atmosphere, baths, fresh air, and the administration of iron
                    and other tonics.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Mineral Acids.—</hi> These are oil of vitriol or sulphuric
                    acid, aqua fortis or nitric acid, and spirit of salt or hydrochloric (muriatic)
                    acid. These when taken in a concentrated form produce well-marked symptoms of
                    corrosion. When they are diluted, the symptoms are those of an irritant poison.
                    Nitric acid stains the mouth and skin of a yellow colour. The treatment consists
                    in the administration of alkalies or their carbonates, chalk, whiting, or even
                    uncoloured plaster scraped off the walls or ceiling, with the view of
                    neutralizing the acid.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Oxalic acid</hi> is a vegetable acid. When taken in the
                    state of concentrated solution it acts as a corrosive, but when diluted as an
                    irritant. But it also exerts a specific effect, killing the patient by cardiac
                    syncope not unfrequently within a few minutes. When a person after taking a
                    crystalline substance, tasting strongly acid, dies within 15 or 30 minutes,
                    after the manifestation of great weakness, small pulse, and failure of the
                    heart’s power, poisoning by oxalic acid is almost certain. The treatment
                    consists in promptly administering an emetic, followed by chalk, whiting, or any
                    substance containing carbonate of calcium. The alkaline carbonates are
                    valueless, for the alkaline oxalates are almost as poisonous as oxalic acid
                    itself.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Alkalies.—</hi> Potash, soda, and their carbonates and
                    sulphides produce symptoms resembling those of the mineral acids, except that
                    purging is a usual accompaniment.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Carbolic acid</hi> when taken in the form of a concentrated
                    liquid acts as a corrosive, causing whitening and shrinking of all the animal
                    membranes with which it comes in contact. The patient, however, becomes speedily
                    comatose, the poison acting profoundly upon the great nervous centres. A curious
                    phenomenon—black or dark green urine—is commonly observed after the
                    administration of this poison. Saccharated lime-water, diluted and drunk freely,
                    and a solution of sulphate of soda are perhaps the most useful remedies.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Irritant Poisons.</hi></p>
                <p>Irritant poisons are of two classes—metallic irritants, and vegetable and animal
                    irritants, these latter being for convenience grouped together. Perhaps none of
                    the irritants act purely as such, the irritant symptoms being usually
                    accompanied by well-marked effects upon the nervous system. An irritant is a
                    substance which causes inflammation of the part to which it is applied,·—usually
                    the alimentary canal. Arsenic is by far the most important of the metallic
                    irritants. Other irritants are the moderately diluted acids, many metallic
                    salts, such as those of antimony, lead, copper, zinc, and chromium. Elaterium,
                    gamboge, aloes, colocynth, and croton oil are good examples of vegetable
                    irritants; and cantharides of animal irritants. Animal and vegetable food when
                    decomposed, or infested with certain organisms known as bacteria, may produce
                    violent irritant symptoms. The symptoms produced by irritant poisons are usually
                    more slow in their development than where a corrosive has been administered.
                    Usually, after an interval, greater or less according to the specific nature of
                    the irritant swallowed, a burning pain is felt in the mouth, throat, and gullet,
                    with a sense of constriction of the parts, and followed by burning pain in the
                    region of the stomach. This is increased, and not alleviated, by pressure, a
                    mark which serves to distinguish the attack from one of ordinary colic. Nausea,
                    vomiting, and thirst ensue, speedily followed by distension of the whole
                    abdomen, which is exceedingly tender to the touch. Ordinarily the vomiting is
                    followed by profuse diarrhoea. Should the poison not be speedily eliminated in
                    the vomited and faecal matters, inflammatory fever sets in, followed by
                    collapse; and death may ensue in a few hours.</p>
                <p>There is danger of confounding irritant poisoning with some forms of natural
                    disease, such as gastritis and gastric ulcer, colic, peritonitis, cholera, and
                    rupture of the intestines.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Arsenic</hi> is a specific irritant poison. Almost all the
                    compounds of this metal are poisonous. The term “arsenic” is, however, most
                    commonly applied, not to the metal itself, but to its loλver oxide, arsenious
                    oxide, which is also known as <hi rend="italic">white arsenic.</hi> By whatever
                    channel arsenic is introduced into the system, it invariably affects
                    specifically the stomach and intestines, causing congestion or inflammation. The
                    common sources of arsenical poisoning are the taking of white arsenic, which
                    causes acute poisoning, and the inhalation of dust from arsenical wall-papers
                    and textile fabrics, whereby a chronic form of poisoning is induced.</p>
                <p>The symptoms of acute arsenical poisoning do not come on, as in the case of
                    corrosive poisoning, immediately after the poison is swallowed. There is usually
                    an interval of half an hour or so before prominent symptoms supervene.
                    Generally, after a feeling of faintness and depression, an intense burning pain
                    is felt in the region of the stomach, with tenderness on pressure. Nausea and
                    vomiting generally follow, increased by every act of swallowing. Unlike what
                    occurs in ordinary vomiting, the pain and sickness are not relieved by the
                    evacuation of the stomach. Vomiting is followed by purging, blood being
                    frequently distinguishable in the evacuations. There is thirst, a feeble
                    irregular pulse, and a perspiring clammy skin. The victim usually succumbs
                    within eighteen to seventy-two hours; if he survives the latter period, good
                    hopes may be entertained of his recovery. The treatment consists in the use of
                    the stomach-pump, emetics, such as mustard and warm water, demulcents, and the
                    free administration of magnesia emulsion and either freshly precipitated ferric
                    hydrate or dialysed iron. Ferric hydrate, and the solution known as dialysed
                    iron, have the property of rendering arsenious anhydride insoluble.</p>
                <p>Chronic arsenical poisoning is usually accidental. The inhalation of arsenical
                    vapours in factories, or of arsenical dust from green wall-papers and in the
                    manufacture of artificial flowers, are common sources of this form of poisoning.
                    Arsenic when thus slowly absorbed into the system produces congestion and
                    inflammation of the mucous membranes, redness and irritation of the
                    conjunctiva?, sore throat, a peculiar eruption of the skin, and diarrhoea. The
                    treatment consists in removal from the poisoned atmosphere, and the
                    administration of tonics.</p>
                <p>Arsenic-eating, or the ability of some persons to take relatively large doses of
                    arsenic habitually, is a well-established fact. The <pb break="no"

                    results of arsenic is quite unknown.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Lead. —</hi> The salts of lead, more especially the acetate
                    (sugar of lead), are irritant poisons of no very great activity; and, though
                    occasionally death ensues, recovery is the rule. Chrome yellow, or lead
                    chromate, is a powerful irritant poison. All chromates are, indeed, irritant
                    poisons.</p>
                <p>Chronic lead poisoning is a much more common affection than acute irritant
                    poisoning by lead. When lead in any form is slowly absorbed into the system, a
                    peculiar affection results, known as saturnine poisoning, and characterized by
                    two prominent symptoms— colic and paralysis. Workers in lead and its compounds,
                    such as plumbers and painters, are frequently affected by this form of disease.
                    Water, especially soft water or such as is contaminated with sewage, on being
                    passed through leaden pipes or stored in leaden cisterns may become contaminated
                    with lead to a dangerous extent. Acid liquids, such as cider, vinegar, &amp;c.,
                    may also contain lead as an impurity. Potmen, who drink beer which has rested
                    for some time in pewter vessels, are also the occasional victims of saturnine
                    poisoning. Water which contains lead in a soluble form to the extent of more
                    than one-tenth of a grain per gallon should not be used for drinking purposes.
                    If more than this quantity be present, the water when placed in a white
                    porcelain dish will become more or less dark in colour on the addition of a few
                    drops of a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>
                <p>The commonest manifestation of chronic lead poisoning is lead •colic,—a peculiar
                    twisting and agonizing sensation around the navel, attended with obstinate
                    constipation. This, like all forms of chronic lead poisoning, is almost
                    invariably attended with a peculiar blue line on the margin of the gums, and
                    when this is present the nature of the affection can scarcely be doubtful. The
                    treatment consists in the free use of purgatives, opiates, and the internal use
                    of potassium iodide, which favours the elimination of the metal through the
                    urine. “Wrist-drop” or lead paralysis is also a common result of the ingestion
                    of lead. It consists in a paralysis of the extensor muscles of the forearm,
                    accompanied by a wasting of that structure. A dropping of the wrist is the
                    result of this degeneration. Baths, the use of galvanism, and the administration
                    of potassium iodide and tonics usually afford relief. Should, however, the
                    patient in any form of lead poisoning be exposed for a lengthened period to the
                    effects of the metal, degenerations of the liver, kidneys, and brain supervene,
                    with fatal results.</p>
                <p>Inall cases of lead poisoning removal of the exciting cause is indispensable; the
                    worker in lead must suspend his occupation for a time; the use of contaminated
                    articles of food or drink must cease.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Copper. —</hi> The soluble salts of copper, such as blue
                    vitriol (the sulphate) and verdigris (subcarbonate and subacetate), are emetic
                    and irritant salts. Their emetic effects usually, but not invariably, secure
                    their prompt rejection by the stomach. Occasionally fatal effects have resulted
                    from their administration. Copper becomes accidentally mixed with articles of
                    dietary in a variety of modes. It is also used for improving the colour of
                    preserved fruits and vegetables. Its deleterious properties when thus used in
                    minute quantities have been both asserted and denied. There is, however, a large
                    body of evidence in favour of the at all events occasional poisonous effects of
                    minute quantities of copper.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Zine salts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">barium salts,</hi>
                    except the quite insoluble barium sulphate, are irritant poisons; and barium
                    compounds act also upon the central nervous system.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Chromates, e.g.,</hi> bichromate of potash, are violent
                    irritants. Chrome yellow, or lead chromate, has already been mentioned.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Phosphorus.—</hi> Of the two chief forms of the elements—the
                    yellow or ordinary and the red or amorphous—the former only is poisonous. Rarely
                    there is met with a chronic form of poisoning among workers in the material,
                    arising from the inhalation of phosphorus vapours. Its special characteristic is
                    a peculiar necrosis or death of the bony structure of the lower jaw. Acute
                    phosphorus poisoning ig more common. Phosphorus is used for tipping matches, and
                    is also the basis of several vermin destroyers. When swallowed, phosphorus
                    produces a variable amount of irritation and disturbance of the alimentary
                    canal. There may be a burning sensation felt in the mouth, throat, and stomach,
                    followed by vomiting. The vomited matters, and also the excreta, may be observed
                    to be luminous in the dark. These symptoms usually subside, and for three or
                    four days the person appears to have recovered his or her usual health. The
                    liver then enlarges, and this and other structures undergo fatty degeneration;
                    jaundice supervenes; and the patient dies in a few days in a semi-typhoid
                    condition. Rarely there is recovery. Oil of turpentine is thought to be the best
                    remedy. Most of the organs undergo fatty degeneration.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Vegetable Irritants.—</hi> These produce drastic purgative
                    effects. Frequently the nature of the illness may be ascertained by the
                    discovery of portions of the vegetable substance—recognizable by the
                    microscope—in the matters ejected by the patient.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Cantharides.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The administration
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">Cantharides</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.)</hi> is
                    followed by vomiting, purging, strangury, or even entire inability to pass the
                    urine. In the ejecta portions of the shining elytra or wing-cases of the fly may
                    often be recognized. There is often great excitement of the sexual proclivities.
                    The active principle of the fly, cantharidin, may be extracted from suspected
                    matters by means of chloroform, and the residue left after the evaporation of
                    this blisters the lip or any tender mucous surface to which it is applied.
                    Demulcent remedies, with opiate cnemata and injections, afford the best relief
                    by way of treatment.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Neurotics.</hi></p>
                <p>It is premature, for the present, to attempt a systematic division of this most
                    important class, which embraces poisons so widely different in their actions as
                    opium and strychnine. We at once proceed to details.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Prussic or Hydrocyanic Acid.—</hi> Hydrocyanic acid is one
                    of the best-known poisons, and a very deadly one. In the pure state it is said
                    to kill with lightning-like rapidity. It is met with in commerce only in a
                    dilute state. In Great Britain two kinds of acid are commonly sold—the
                    pharmaconceial acid, containing 2 per cent, of anhydrous prussic acid, and
                    Scheele’s acid, containing 4 or 5 per cent. Less than a teaspoonful of the 2 per
                    cent, acid has caused death. Given in fatal doses, the symptoms of prussic-acid
                    poisoning set in with great rapidity; and, in consequence of the readiness with
                    which the poison is absorbed from the stomach and diffused through the
                    circulation, the onset of symptoms is reckoned by seconds rather than by
                    minutes. Occasionally the victim may be able to perform a few voluntary actions
                    before alarming symptoms are developed. There is first a very brief stage of
                    difficult breathing, and slow action of the heart, with a tendency for the organ
                    to stop in the state of dilatation. With widely-dilated pupils of the eye, the
                    patient is then seized with violent irregular convulsive movements. The rhythm
                    of the respiratory movements is disturbed, and the countenance becomes of a
                    bluish cast. The patient now sinks to the ground with complete loss of muscular
                    power; and the third oι asphyxiai stage is reached, in which there are slow
                    gasping respirations, loss of pulse, and paralysis of motion. Death is
                    frequently preceded by muscular spasms. The <hi rend="italic">fozιdroyant</hi>
                    character of the illness, and the speedy death of the patient, coupled with the
                    peculiar odouι of the acid in the breath and atmosphere around the body, seldom
                    leave any doubt as to the nature of the case. The treatment consists in
                    inhalation of the fumes of strong ammonia, drinks of warm and cold water
                    alternately, friction of the limbs, and artificial respiration. The subcutaneous
                    injection of atropine, which acts aι a cardiac stimulant, may prove
                    serviceable.</p>
                <p>Other soluble cyanides, more especially cyanide of potassium, a salt largely used
                    in photography and in the arts, are equally poisonous with hydrocyanic acid. See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Prussic Acid.</hi></p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Opium.—</hi> In consequence of the extent to which <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Opium ⅛.v.),</hi> its preparations, and its active alkaloid
                    morphia are used for the reliei of pain, poisoning by opium is of frequent
                    occurrence. It is largely used by suicides; and children, being very susceptible
                    to its influence, frequently die from misadventure after administration of an
                    overdose of the drug. The ordinary preparations of opium are ths drag itself,
                    which is the inspissated juice of the Oriental poppy, and the tincture, commonly
                    known as laudanum. Opium contains a variety of more or less active principles,
                    the chief of which is the alkaloid morphia, which is present in good opium to
                    the extent ol about 10 per cent, in combination with meconic acid, which is
                    physiologically inactive. Opium is largely used by Eastern nations foi smoking,
                    and there is great discrepancy of opinion as to the extent tc which opium
                    smoking is deleterious. The preponderance of opinion is in favour of the view
                    that opium smoking is a demoralizing, degrading, and pernicious habit, and that
                    its victims are sufferers both in body and mind from its use.</p>
                <p>The first symptom of the administration of a poisonous dose ol opium is a state
                    of exaltation—which may not, however, be well-marked—soon passing into a second
                    stage, in which the symptoms are those of congestion of the brain. The
                    countenance is suffused and of a bluish cast, known as cyanosis, due to
                    imperfect aeration of the blood; the pupils of the eyes are minutely contracted,
                    the skin dry and warm, and the breathing slow, laboured, and becoming
                    stertorous. The patient is apparently unconscious, but may be roused by shaking,
                    or by shouting into the ear. When this has taken place, the breathing becomes
                    more natural, and the skin less cyanosed. If he be left alone there is a speedy
                    relapse into a state of insensibility. If effective treatment be not adopted, a
                    third stage of prostration supervenes, in which there is profound coma, and it
                    may be impossible to arouse the patient. The pupils of the eyes are now
                    contracted to the size of pin-points. Breathing is slow, shallow, and
                    intermittent. The countenance is at once pallid and cyanosed, the skin bathed in
                    perspiration. The pulse becomes more rapid with increased feebleness, and at
                    length all signs of it are lost, until death supervenes.</p>
                <p>The treatment consists in the use of the stomach-pump. Emetics <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n288/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0288-0279"/> are usually inoperative. After this the patient
                    must be kept awake by walkin» him about, applying cold and warm douches
                    alternately to the chest, shouting into the ears, flicking the hands and feet
                    with damp towels, and the application of the galvanic current. Circulation
                    should be promoted by friction of the limbs and trunk. Strong infusion of
                    coffee, ammonia, and alcoholic stimulants may be freely administered. As a last
                    resort when the breathing intermits, artificial respiration may be performed.
                    The hypodermic injection of full doses of atropine has proved of marked
                    benefit,— atropine and morphia being to a certain extent counter-poisons.</p>
                <p>Opium is a drug to which its victims may become habituated by the use of
                    gradually increasing doses; and the practice of opiumeating, as it is termed, is
                    a pernicious one. An atrophied condition of the body usually results. The only
                    remedy is abstinence from the drug.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Strychnine and Strychnine-yielding Plants.—</hi> The
                    alkaloids strychnine and brucine, as well as all the plants in which they are
                    found, all act in the same manner, being highly poisonous, and causing death
                    after spasms of a severe character. Strychnine was first extracted from the
                    seeds of <hi rend="italic">Strychnos Nux-Vomica</hi> in 1819, by Pelletier and
                    Caventou. It exists in larger quantity iu other species of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Strychnos,</hi> and notably in <hi rend="italic">Strychnos
                    Ignatii.</hi> From the bark of <hi rend="italic">Strychnos Nux-Vomica,</hi>
                    known as false Angostura bark, another alkaloid, <hi rend="italic">brucine,</hi>
                    is also extracted. This bark was at one time wrongly supposed to be the bark of
                    <hi rend="italic">Brucca anti-dysenterica</hi>; hence the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >brucia</hi> or brucine. Its effects are similar to those of strychnine, but its
                    physiological activity is not so great. Many vermin-killers contain strychnine
                    as their active ingredient.</p>
                <p>Strychnine, and all substances containing that alkaloid, produce their effects
                    within a very few minutes—usually within ten or fifteen minutes. The patient
                    complains of stiffness about the neck, and his aspect exhibits terror. There is
                    an impression of impending calamity or death. Very speedily the head is jerked
                    back, the limbs extended, the back arched (opisthotonos), so that the body may
                    rest on the head and heels only. The mouth is drawn; and the condition is one
                    known as tetanus. In a few moments these symptoms pass off, and there is
                    complete relaxation of the spasm. The spasmodic condition speedily returns, and
                    is brought about by the slightest touch or movement of the patient. Accessions
                    and remissions of the tetanic state ensue rapidly till the patient succumbs,
                    usually within half an hour of the administration of the poison. The best
                    treatment is to put, and keep, the patient under the influence of chloroform
                    till time is given for the excretion of the alkaloid, having previously given a
                    full dose of chloral hydrate.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Aconite Poisoning.—</hi> The ordinary blue rocket,
                    wolfsbane, or monkshood, <hi rend="italic">Aconitum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Napellus,</hi> and an alkaloid extracted from it, aconitine, are perhaps the
                    most deadly of known poisons. Onesixteenth of a grain of aconitine has proved
                    fatal to a man. All the preparations of aconite produce a peculiar burning,
                    tingling, and numbness of the parts to which they are applied. When given in
                    large doses they produce violent vomiting, as a rule, more or less paralysis of
                    motion and sensation, and great depression of the heart, usually ending in death
                    from syncope. Intelligence remains unaffected till almost the last. The
                    treatment consists in the hypodermic injection of tincture of foxglove <hi
                    rend="italic">(Digitalis)</hi> or its active principle digitalin, which is a
                    counter-poison in its action upon the heart. The root of aconite has been eaten
                    in mistake for that of horse-radish.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Belladonna.—</hi> The belladonna or deadly nightshade, <hi
                    rend="italic">Atropa</hi><hi rend="italic">Belladonna,</hi> contains an
                    alkaloid, atropine, which is largely used by oculists to procure dilatation of
                    the pupils of the eye. The bright scarlet berries of the plant have been eaten
                    by children, who are attracted by their tempting appearance. Belladonna produces
                    dilatation of the pupils, rapid pulse, hot dry flushed skin, with an eruption
                    not unlike that of scarlatina, soreness of the throat, with difficulty of
                    swallowing, intense thirst, and gay mirthful delirium. The treatment consists in
                    evacuation of the poison by means of the stomach-pump, and the hypodermic
                    injection of morphia as a counter-poison.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Gaseous Poisons.</hi></p>
                <p>The effects of these are varied,—some of them acting as irritants, while others
                    have a specific effect, apparently in consequence of their forming chemical
                    compounds with the red pigment of the blood, and thus destroying its capability
                    of acting as a carrier of oxygen.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Chlorine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bromine</hi> act as
                    powerful irritants. They provoke spasm of the glottis when inhaled, and
                    subsequently induce inflammation of the respiratory mucous membrane, which may
                    prove speedily fatal. Inhalation of diluted ammonia vapour is the best
                    remedy.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Hydrochloric</hi> or <hi rend="italic">muriatic acid
                    gas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hydrofluoric</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fluoric
                    acid gas are</hi> irritating and destructive to life. The former is more
                    destructive to vegetable life than even chlorine. They are emitted in many
                    processes of manufacture, and especially in the manufacture of carbonate of soda
                    from common salt by Le Blanc’s process, in the salt-glazing of earthenware, and
                    in the manufacture of artificial manures.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Sulphurous Add Gas.—</hi> The gas given off by burning
                    sulphur is most suffocating and irritating. Its inhalation, even in a highly
                    diluted state, may cause speedy death from spasmodic closure of the glottis.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Nitrous, vapoιιrs,</hi> or gaseous oxides of nitrogen
                    (except nitrous oxide), are given off from galvanic batteries excited by nitric
                    acid; also in the process of etching on copper. They produce, when diluted,
                    little immediate irritation, but are exceedingly dangerous, setting up extensive
                    and fatal inflammation of the lungs.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Ammonia gas</hi> is highly irritant, but does not often
                    prove fatal.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Carbonic acid gas</hi> is heavier than atmospheric air, is
                    totally irrespirable when pure, and is fatal when present in large quantities in
                    respired air. It is given off from burning fuel, accumulates in pits and wells
                    as choke-damp, and constitutes the deadly afterdamp of coal-mines. It is also
                    formed during alcoholic fermentation, and hence accumulates in partially filled
                    vats in which fermented liquors are stored. When it is breathed in a
                    concentrated state, death is almost instantaneous. Persons descending into wells
                    foul with this gas sink down powerless, and are usually dead before they can be
                    removed from the vitiated atmosphere. In these cases there is true asphyxia; but
                    carbonic acid is also a narcotic gas. Persons exposed to an atmosphere partially
                    composed of this gas, but not long enough to produce fatal results, are affected
                    with stertorous breathings, oppression, flushed face, prominent eyes, swollen
                    tongue, and feeble pulse. The proper treatment is removal from the foul
                    atmosphere, alternate cold and tepid douches to the chest, friction of the limbs
                    and trunk, and artificial respiration. When animation is restored the patient
                    should be put to bed and kept quiet, but should be carefully watched in case of
                    relapse.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Carbonic oxide gas</hi> is given off by burning charcoal and
                    other forms of fuel, mixed with carbonic acid. The poisonous effects of charcoal
                    fumes are perhaps due rather to the more poisonous carbonic oxide than to the
                    less poisonous carbonic acid. An atmosphere containing less than 1 per cent, of
                    carbonic oxide would doubtless be fatal if breathed for many minutes. Carbonic
                    oxide forms with haemoglobin, the red pigment of the blood, a bright scarlet
                    compound. The compound is very stable, and the oxide cannot be displaced by
                    atmospheric oxygen. Hence the blood after death from the inhalation of carbonic
                    oxide is of a bright arterial hue, which it retains on exposure to air.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Coal-gas</hi> acts as an asphyxiant and narcotic. The
                    appearances met with after death—more especially the fluid state of the
                    blood—are similar to those observed after death from carbonic oxide gas, which
                    is a constituent of coal-gas, and to which the chief /effect of coal-gas may be
                    due.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Sulphuretted hydrogen gas</hi> is highly poisonous by
                    whatever channel it gains access to the body. In a concentrated form it produces
                    almost instant death from asphyxia. Even in a diluted state it produces colic,
                    nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness. This may pass into insensibility with lividity
                    and feeble respiration. The skin is cold and clammy, or bathed in perspiration.
                    The red blood corpuscles are disintegrated. The treatment consists in removal
                    from the contaminated atmosphere, friction to the surface of the body, warmth,
                    and the administration of stimulants. The inhalation of chlorine gas has been
                    recommended on chemical grounds; but it must be remembered that chlorine is
                    itself poisonous.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Anaesthetics.—</hi> Nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, and the
                    gases or vapours of other anaesthetic substances, such as chloroform, produce
                    death by asphyxia, and perhaps otherwise. Obviously, as a rule, medical
                    assistance is at hand. The treatment consists in artificial respiration, and the
                    use of galvanic current.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Vapours of Hydrocarbons.—</hi> The volatile vapours of the
                    natural hydrocarbons known as benzoline, petroleum, &amp;c., are poisonous when
                    inhaled for lengthened periods. (T. S. *)</p>
