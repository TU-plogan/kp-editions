                    as wind, and observe the dynamical effects of this motion in the quiver of the
                    leaf or the momentum of the frigate under weigh. It offers resistance to the
                    passage of bodies through it, destroying their motion and transforming their
                    energy—as is betrayed to our hearing in the whiz of the rifle bullet, to our
                    sight in the flash of the meteor. In its general physical properties air has
                    much in common with other gases. It is advisable therefore first to establish
                    these general properties, and then consider the characteristic features of the
                    several gases.</p>
                <p>Matter is conveniently studied under the two great divisions of solids and
                    fluids. The practically obvious distinction between these may be stated in
                    dynamical language thus: —solids can sustain a longitudinal pressure without
                    being supported by a lateral pressure; fluids cannot. Hence any region of space
                    enclosed by a rigid boundary can be easily filled with a fluid, which then takes
                    the form of the bounding surface at every point of it. But here we distinguish
                    between fluids according as they are gases or liquids. The gas will always
                    completely fill the region, however small the quantity put in. Remove any
                    portion and the remainder will expand so as to fill the whole space again. On
                    the other hand it requires a definite quantity of liquid to fill the region.
                    Remove any portion and a part of the space will be left unoccupied by liquid.
                    Part of the liquid surface is then otherwise conditioned than by the form of the
                    wall or bounding surface of the region; and if the portion of the wall not in
                    contact with the liquid is removed the form and quantity of the liquid are in no
                    way affected. Hence a liquid can be kept in an open vessel; a gas cannot so
                    be.</p>
                <p>The mutual action between any two portions of matter is called the stress between
                    them. This stress has two aspects, according as its effect or tendency is
                    considered with reference to the one or the other body. Thus between the earth
                    and moon there is a stress which is an attraction. The one aspect is the force
                    which attracts the moon to the earth; the other is the force which attracts the
                    earth to the moon. According to Newton’s third law of motion these are equal and
                    opposite. Similarly the repulsive stress between the like poles of two magnets
                    has its two aspects, which are equal but oppositely directed forces. In the case
                    of a mass hanging by a cord, the stress is a tension at every point of the cord.
                    At any given point this tension has two equal and opposite aspects, one of which
                    is the weight of the mass and the portion of the cord below the given point.
                    Finally, the stress between any body and the horizontal table on which it rests
                    is a two-faced pressure, being downwards as regards the table, upwards as
                    regards the body. The total pressure upon the table over the whole surface of
                    contact is clearly the weight of the body. If the total pressure is supposed to
                    be uniformly distributed, the measure of the pressure on unit surface is the
                    quotient of this weight by the area of the surface. When we speak of pressure at
                    a point, it is this pressure on unit surface that is meant. When the pressure
                    varies from point to point over a surface, the pressure at any point is defined
                    to be the limit of the ratio of the total pressure over any small element of
                    surface around that point to the area of the element as the element is
                    diminished indefinitely.</p>
                <p>The stress which exists between the contiguous portions of a fluid is of the
                    nature of a pressure. The ideal or perfect fluid is a substance in which this
                    stress between contiguous portions is always perpendicular to the common
                    interface. In other words there is no stress tangential to the interface-at any
                    point. Hence if the contiguous portions are at relative rest, or have a relative
                    motion parallel to the interface, neither state can be affected by the mutual
                    stress. This condition is perfectly fulfilled in the case of any known fluid in
                    equilibrium; but for a fluid in motion it is not even approximately fulfilled.
                    For, any <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n250/mode/1up"

                    a fluid rapidly decays in virtue of viscosity, which even for the subtlest gases
                    is quite appreciable in its effects.</p>
                <p>In a fluid at rest, then, the pressure over any surface which we may imagine to
                    be drawn is perpendicular (or normal) to the surface at every point of it; and
                    from this it follows at once, as has been proved in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hydromechanics,</hi> vol. xii. p. 439, that <hi rend="italic">the pressure at
                    any point of a fluid at rest has the same value in all possible
                    directions.</hi></p>
                <p>The pressures at two contiguous points in a fluid may either differ or not. If
                    they differ, the change of pressure must be balanced by some extraneous force
                    acting on the fluid in the direction in which the pressure increases. Any
                    direction in which no such force acts must be a direction in which there is no
                    change of pressure; otherwise, equilibrium will be destroyed. Suppose now the
                    resultant force at every point in a fluid at rest to be given. In directions at
                    right angles to the force at any given point the pressure will not vary. Hence
                    we can pass to an infinite number of contiguous points at which the pressure is
                    the same as at the given point. By making each ol these in turn the
                    starting-point, we can pass on to another set of points, and so gradually trace
                    out within the fluid a surface at every point of which the pressure is the same.
                    Such a surface is called a surface of equal pressure, or briefly a level
                    surface; and we see from the mode of its construction that it is at every point
                    of it perpendicular to the resultant force at that point.</p>
                <p>Imagine any two contiguous level surfaces to be drawn, at every point of the one
                    of which the pressure is <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> at every point of the other
                    <hi rend="italic">p + δp.</hi> Consider the equilibrium of a small column of
                    average density <hi rend="italic">ρ,</hi> bounded at its ends by these surfaces.
                    Let A be the area of each end, and δr the length of the column or perpendicular
                    distance between the level surfaces. If R is the average resultant force per
                    unit mass acting on the column, then we have, for equilibrium of the column, <hi
                    rend="italic">ASp=ASr.</hi> pβ , or δ72 = Rpδr.</p>
                <p>or <hi rend="italic">the rate of increase of the pressure at any point per unit
                    of length at right angles to the level surface is equal to the resultant force
                    per unit of volume at that point.</hi></p>
                <p>If the applied forces belong to a conservative system, for which V is the
                    potential (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics),</hi> we may write the equation
                    in the form</p>
                <p>δp = — <hi rend="italic">pδV.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence over any equipotential surface, for which δV = 0, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    is constant, and is therefore a function of V. Consequently <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> also is a function of V. For a fluid in equilibrium, therefore, and
                    under the influence of a conservative system of forces, the pressure and density
                    are constant over every equipotential surface, that is, over every surface
                    cutting the lines of force at right angles.</p>
                <p>Now in the case of gases, to which our attention is at present confined, the
                    density (temperature remaining constant) varies with every change of pressure;
                    in mathematical language <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is a function of <hi
                    rend="italic">p.</hi> Thus, before we can solve the equation of equilibrium for
                    a gas, we must be able to express this function mathematically; in other words,
                    we must know the exact relation between the density of a gas and the pressure to
                    which it is subject. This problem, which can only be settled by experiment, was
                    solved for the case of air within a certain range of pressures by Robert Boyle
                    (1662). Before discussing his results and the later results of other
                    investigators, we shall first consider the general properties of our atmosphere
                    as recognized before Boyle’s day.</p>
                <p>It is evident that, for a fluid situated as our atmosphere is, the pressure must
                    diminish as we ascend. The equipotential surfaces and consequently the surfaces
                    of equal pressure and of equal density will be approximately spheres concentric
                    with the earth. At any point there will be a definite atmospheric pressure,
                    which is equal numerically to the weight of the superincumbent vertical column
                    of air of unit cross-section. The effect of this pressure, as exemplified in the
                    action of the common suction-pump, seems to have been first truly recognized by
                    Galileo, who showed that the maximum depth from which water can be pumped is
                    equal to the height of the water column which would exert at its base a pressure
                    equal to the atmospheric pressure. As an experimental verification, he suggested
                    filling with water a long pipe closed at the upper end, and immersing it with
                    its lower and open end in a reservoir of the same liquid. The liquid surface in
                    the pipe would, if the pipe were long enough, stand at a definite height, which
                    would be the same for all longer lengths of pipe. The practical difficulty of
                    constructing a long enough tube (33 feet at least) prevented the experiment
                    being really made till many years later.</p>
                <p>Torricelli, however, in 1642, by substituting mercury for water, produced the
                    experiment on a manageable scale. As mercury is denser than water in the ratio
                    of about 13.6:1, the mercury column necessary to balance by its weight the
                    atmospheric pressure will be less than the water column in the inverse ratio, or
                    a little under 30 inches. Torricelli’s experiment is exhibited in every
                    mercurial barometer (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Barometer</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Meteorology).</hi> By this experiment he not only gave the
                    complete experimental verification of Galileo’s views relating to atmospheric
                    pressure, but prα vided a ready means of measuring that pressure.</p>
                <p>The most obvious applications of the barometer are these :—(1) to measure the
                    variation in time of atmospheric pressure at any one locality on the earth’s
                    surface (the existence of this variation was discovered soon after the date of
                    Torricelli’s experiment by Pascal, Descartes, Boyle, and others); (2) to measure
                    the variation of atmospheric pressure with change of height above the earth’s
                    surface (Descartes mentions this application in the <hi rend="italic">Principia
                    Philosophiae,</hi> 1644; but to Pascal is the honour due of having first carried
                    the experiment into execution, 1647); and (3) to compare pressures at different
                    localities which are on the same level (if the pressures are equal, the air is
                    in equilibrium; if they are not, there must be flow of air from the place of
                    higher pressure to that of lower—in other words, there must be wind, whose
                    direction of motion depends on the relative position of the places, and whose
                    intensity depends on the distance between the places and the difference of
                    pressures). The first and last of these measurements are of the greatest
                    importance in meteorology. The second is a valuable method for measuring
                    attainable heights, and is intimately connected with the problem as to the
                    relation between the pressure and density of the air. Thus it would be possible,
                    by barometric observations at a series of points in the same vertical line, to
                    obtain a knowledge of this relation—more and more truly approximate the closer
                    and more numerous the points of observation taken. At best, however, such a
                    method could give the law connecting density with pressure for those pressures
                    only which are less than the normal atmospheric pressure. The problem is better
                    solved otherwise.</p>
                <p>Assuming Boyle’s law that <hi rend="italic">the density of air is directly as the
                    pressure,</hi> we can now integrate the equation of equilibrium <hi

                <p>For all attainable heights in our atmosphere we may assume the force of gravity

                    it bears to the height of the mercurial barometric column the same ratio which
                    the density of mercury bears to the density of the atmosphere at the sea-level.

                <p>In an appendix to the <hi rend="italic">New Experiments, Physico-Mechanical, Ac.,
                    touching the, Spring of Air</hi> (1660), Robert Boyle states that the density of
                    air is directly as the pressure. His apparatus and method of ^experiment are as
                    follows. A U-shaped tube is taken, one of whose limbs is considerably longer
                    than the other. The shorter limb is closed at the end; and the whole apparatus
                    is set vertically with the open end pointing upwards. A small quantity of
                    mercury fills the bend, so that at the beginning of the experiment the two
                    mercury surfaces are at the same level. Hence the air confined in the shorter
                    limb is subjected to a pressure along its lower surface equal to the atmospheric
                    pressure,, or one atmosphere as it is commonly called. As the height of the air
                    column in the closed tube is small, the pressure and density are practically the
                    same throughout. Now let mercury be poured into the longer limb. The free
                    mercury surface will be observed to rise in the shorter limb, so that the air
                    confined there becomes compressed into smaller bulk. Since the mass of air has
                    not altered, the density is obviously inversely as the bulk, and can therefore
                    be easily measured. Again, the pressure to which the confined air is now
                    subjected is equal to the pressure over that surface in the mercury in the open
                    limb which is at the same level as the free mercury surface in the closed limb.
                    But this pressure is clearly the sum of the atmospheric pressure and the
                    pressure due to the superincumbent column of mercury, which latter can be
                    readily expressed in atmospheres if the height of the barometer is known. In
                    other words, divide the vertical distance between the two mercury surfaces by
                    the height of the barometer column. The quotient added to unity gives the
                    required pressure in atmospheres.</p>

                    widely known on the Continent as Mariotte’s law. He supplemented Boyle’s
                    experiments by investigating the effect of pressures less than that of the
                    atmosphere, and proved that the same law held at these diminished pressures. His
                    method was essentially as follows. A barometer tube is filled in the ordinary
                    way with mercury and fixed up as in the Torricellian experiment. A little air is
                    then introduced at the lower end of the tube which is dipping in the reservoir
                    of mercury. This air travels up the tube and fills the Torricellian vacuum at
                    the top, thereby depressing to a slight extent the barometer column. The amount
                    of depression divided by the true height of the barometer gives the pressure in
                    atmospheres which acts upon the air in the tube. The tube, always kept truly
                    vertical, dips in a reservoir of mercury sufficiently deep to admit of its
                    complete immersion. For a certain position of the tube the free surfaces of
                    mercury in the tube and reservoir are at the same level. For that position the
                    confined air is at the atmospheric pressure; and for any higher position of the
                    tube the pressure in the confined mass of air is less than the atmospheric
                    pressure by the pressure due to the column of mercury between the free surfaces.
                    Recent experiments by Kraevitch and Petersen <hi rend="italic">(Journal of the
                    Russian Chemical Society,</hi> vol. xvi.) seem to show that very rarefied air is
                    very far from obeying Boyle’s law. At such low pressure, the condensation of the
                    gas upon solid surfaces is an important factor.</p>
                <p>For most ordinary purposes Boyle’s law—that, at constant temperature, the density
                    of a gas varies directly as the pressure—may be assumed to be true, at least for
                    moderate ranges of pressure; but the careful investigations of later
                    experimenters, such as Oersted, Despretz, Dulong, Régnault, Andrews, Cailletet,
                    and Amagat, have proved that the law is only approximate for every known gas,
                    and that the deviation from correspondence with the law is different for each
                    gas. The most recent investigations are those of Cailletet and Amagat, who have
                    carried the results to much higher pressures than former experimenters employed.
                    Both adopted in the first place a form of apparatus essentially the same as
                    Boyle’s, only much longer. The gas was subjected to the pressure of a mercury
                    column enclosed in a strong narrow steel tube; and, as oxygen acts vigorously
                    upon mercury at high pressures, nitrogen was used. In this way Cailletet<note

                    Physique,</hi> vol. viii., 1879.</p></note> attained to a pressure of 182 metres
                    of mercury, and Amagat<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie et</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Physique,</hi> vol. xix., 1880.</p></note> to a pressure of nearly 330.</p>
                <p>Having thus determined accurately the corresponding pressures and densities of
                    nitrogen, Amagat proceeded to determine the relation for other gases by
                    Pouillet’s differential method. That is, the pressure to which the new gas was
                    subjected was made to act simultaneously upon a given mass of nitrogen, whose
                    volume could be readily measured and pressure estimated. Oxygen, hydrogen,
                    carbonic oxide, dry air, olefiant gas, and marsh gas were investigated in this
                    way. The general results obtained by Amagat are exhibited in the subjoined chart
                    taken from his paper. For all gases except hydrogen the product <hi
                    rend="italic">pv</hi> (pressure into volume), instead of being constant, as
                    Boyle’s law would require, diminishes at first as the pressure is increased. At
                    a certain pressure, however, different for each gas, the diminution ceases, and
                    if the pressure is still further increased the product <hi rend="italic">pv</hi>
                    begins to increase also, and continues so to do to the greatest pressure used.
                    In tho case of hydrogen the product increases from the very beginning.</p>
                <p>On the diagram, absciss® represent pressures in metres of mercury, and the
                    ordinates represent the deviations from the Boylean law. It will be observed
                    that all the curves pass through the point on the pressure axis which represents
                    a pressure of 24 metres of mercury. If <hi rend="italic">π</hi> represents the
                    product <hi rend="italic">pv</hi> for any gas at this pressure, and √ the
                    corresponding product for any other pressure, then we may write</p>
                <p>τr∕ιr ’ = l + δ, where δ represents the deviation from Boyle’s law. All the
                    curves except that for hydrogen show a well-marked minimum, at and near the
                    pressure corresponding to which the particular gas obeys Boyle’s law. For the
                    several gases these positions occur at the pressures as given in the following
                    table :—</p>
                <p>Nitrogen 50 m. I Carbonic acid 50 m.</p>
                <p>Oxygen 100 m. Marsh gas 120 m.</p>
                <p>Air 65 m. ∣ Olefiant gas 65 m.</p>
                <p>For olefiant gas δ is so great, and varies so rapidly, that only portions of the
                    curve are represented. The value of δ for its minimum point is - 1 '3, while the
                    corresponding value for oxygen is -0Ό5. In these experiments the temperature of
                    the gases varied between 18° and 22° C.</p>
                <p>Amagat<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Annales de Chimie et de Physique,</hi> vol. xxii., 1881.</p></note> has
                    extended his researches to higher temperatures up <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n252/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0252-0243"/> to 100° C. The general characters of the curves
                    obtained for hydrogen, nitrogen, olefiant gas, and marsh gas remain the same as
                    at the ordinary temperature; that is, with the exception of hydrogen, the
                    product <hi rend="italic">pv</hi> decreases to a minimum and then increases
                    indefinitely.</p>
                <p>The position of the minimum changes with the temperature. Thus for olefiant gas
                    and carbonic acid gas (whose properties were also studied at these higher
                    temperatures), the pressure at which the minimum occurs increases with the
                    temperature, while in the case of nitrogen and marsh gas this critical pressure
                    decreases as the temperature rises. Probably at some temperature higher than
                    100° olefiant gas and carbonic acid gas would begin to behave like nitrogen, and
                    all would appear to tend more and more, as the temperature rises, to the
                    condition of which hydrogen is the type. That is, the deviation from the Boylean
                    law up to the minimum point would steadily decrease until finally the curve
                    would cease to have a marked minimum. For any one gas, the higher the
                    temperature the less the curvature at the minimum point; and the comparison of
                    different gases seems to indicate that the curvature is greater for the more
                    easily liquefiable gas. At sufficiently high temperatures the law of
                    compressibility for all gases approximates to the relation</p>
                <p>P( V - <hi rend="italic">a)</hi> = constant, where P is the pressure, V the
                    volume, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> a constant. Hydrogen follows this law very
                    closely at the ordinary temperature of the air, as the straightness of its
                    representative curve shows at a glance.</p>
                <p>Amagat has further discussed by means of his results the law of dilatation of
                    gases. This law is named Charles’s law, after the discoverer of it. Stated
                    simply, it is that <hi rend="italic">at constant pressure every gas expands by
                    the same fraction of itself</hi> for a given rise from a given temperature.
                    Charles did not publish his results; and it was not till fifteen years later,
                    when Dalton and Gay-Lussac, working independently, rediscovered it, that the law
                    became generally known.</p>
                <p>Their results were published in 1801<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    accidentally became acquainted with the fact, that the law is now named after
                    Charles. The careful measurements of Magnus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    that there is an appreciable difference in the coefficients of expansion for the
                    different gases. The difference is slight for the so-called permanent gases—air,
                    nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and marsh gas; but for the more easily liquefiable
                    gases it is quite marked. The mean coefficient of expansion for air between 0°
                    C. and 100° C. and at the ordinary atmospheric pressure is Ό03665 per degree,
                    and the value for any one of the gases just mentioned does not certainly differ
                    from this by one-half per cent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The first who really gave accurate values of these
                    quantities was Rudberg.</p></note> This may be expressed by the formula v=KT,
                    where K is a constant and T the temperature measured from absolute zero, which
                    is 274° C. below the freezing point of water (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Heat).</hi> When T is constant, we have by Boyle’s law the product <hi
                    rend="italic">pro</hi> also constant. Hence we may combine the two laws in the
                    form pι&gt;=RT, where R is a constant. We thus see that, Boyle’s law being
                    assumed to be true at all temperatures, Charles’s law, if true for any given
                    pressure, is true for every other pressure. Further, if <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                    is kept constant the rate of increase of log <hi rend="italic">p</hi> with
                    temperature will be expressed by the same number as the rate of increase of log
                    <hi rend="italic">v</hi> when <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is kept constant.
                    Experiment has fully verified this conclusion to as close an approximation as
                    Boyle’s and Charles’s laws themselves are fulfilled. The rate of increase of log
                    <hi rend="italic">v</hi> with temperature, or, what is the same thing, the ratio
                    of the rate of increase of the volume to the original volume, is given by the
                    formula <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ⅛ 1</p>
                <p>v(fΓ'T ’</p>
                <p>and this is the measure of the coefficient of expansion at temperature T. Hence
                    the coefficient of expansion diminishes as the temperature rises, a conclusion
                    also in accordance with experiment so long as we are dealing with gases which
                    nearly obey Boyle’s and Charles’s laws.</p>
                <p>We have seen, however, that even in the case of hydrogen the departure from
                    Boyle’s law is very marked at the higher pressures; and therefore we cannot
                    expect a closely numerical agreement between the results of experiment and the
                    results of calculation from the above formula. Thus, it is not surprising that
                    practically the coefficient of expansion should be affected by the pressure, as
                    Amagat’s experiments clearly show,—although in the equation deduced above the
                    pressure does not enter. In the following table given by Amagat, the second
                    column contains the mean coefficients of expansion of hydrogen between 17° and
                    60° C. at the pressures given in the first <pb break="no"

                <p>The temperature effect upon the coefficient of expansion, as shown by these
                    numbers, is approximately that indicated above, viz., that at constant pressure
                    the coefficient of expansion is inversely as the absolute temperature. A glance
                    down each column shows at once the marked effect of pressure. In this steady
                    decrease of the coefficient of expansion with increase of pressure, hydrogen
                    stands alone amongst the substances discussed by Amagat. His conclusions are
                    given in these words :—</p>
                <p>1. The coefficient of expansion of gases increases with the pressure to a
                    maximum, after which it decreases indefinitely.</p>
                <p>2. This maximum occurs at the pressure for which at constant temperature the
                    productiv is a minimum, that is, the pressure at which the gas follows for the
                    instant Boyle’s law.</p>
                <p>3. With increasing temperature this maximum becomes less and less sensible,
                    finally disappearing with the minimum characteristic of the compressibility
                    curve.</p>
                <p>Thus, as hydrogen does not show this minimum characteristic, its coefficient of
                    expansion has no maximum value. Possibly at lower temperatures hydrogen may,
                    however, possess these characteristics.</p>
                <p>It thus appears that the simple gaseous laws established by Boyle and Charles are
                    most nearly fulfilled by those gases which are difficult to liquefy, and are
                    better fulfilled by all the higher the temperature is. When a gas is near its
                    point of liquefaction the density increases more rapidly than the pressure, or
                    in other words the volume diminishes more quickly than Boyle’s law requires.
                    When the point of liquefaction is actually reached, the slightest increase of
                    pressure condenses the whole of the gas into a liquid; and in this state the
                    alteration of volume is very small even for a large increase of pressure.</p>
                <p>The transition from the gaseous to the liquid state is conveniently studied by
                    the help of isothermal lines, which may be generally defined as curves showing
                    the relation between two mutually dependent variables for given constant
                    temperatures. Such variables are the pressure and volume of a mass of gas. Let
                    the numbers representing the volumes be measured from a chosen origin along a
                    horizontal axis, and the numbers representing the pressures similarly along a
                    vertical axis passing through the same origin. If we consider a mass of gas at a
                    given temperature, for any volume that can be named there will be a definite
                    pressure corresponding, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Hence the point
                    whose coordinates arc the corresponding volume and pressure is completely
                    determined if either coordinate is given. The temperature always being kept
                    constant, let now the volume change continuously. The pressure will also alter
                    according to a definite law; and the point whose coordinates are at any instant
                    the corresponding volume and pressure will trace out a curve. This curve is an
                    isothermal curve, or simply an <hi rend="italic">isotherm.</hi> If Boyle’s law
                    were fulfilled, the equation to the isotherm for any given temperature would be
                    of the form <hi rend="italic">pv</hi><hi rend="italic">≈</hi> constant.</p>
                <p>The isotherm would be a rectangular hyperbola, whose asymptotes are the
                    coordinate axes. For any gas not near its point of liquefaction the isotherm
                    will not deviate greatly from the hyperbolic form.</p>
                <p>Let now the pressure be kept constant, and the gas raised somewhat in
                    temperature. The volume of course increases, and the corresponding point on the
                    diagram moves off the original isotherm. Through this point in its new position
                    we can draw a second isotherm corresponding to the new temperature. And thus the
                    whole field may be mapped out by a series of isotherms, each one of which
                    corresponds to a definite temperature. The higher the temperature the farther
                    does the isotherm lie from the origin. Such a mapped out diagram or chart shows
                    at a glance the relations between the volume, pressure, and temperature of a
                    given mass of gas, so that if any two of these are given the third can be found
                    at once.</p>
                <p>So long as the substance is in the gaseous form, the isotherm remains
                    approximately hyperbolic; but at the pressure at which liquefaction takes place
                    a marked change occurs in the form of the curve. For greater definiteness
                    consider the case of a gramme of steam at 100° C. and at a pressure somewhat
                    below one atmosphere. As the pressure is increased, the volume diminishes
                    appreciably faster than Boyle’s law requires, but still in such a way as to give
                    an approximately hyperbolic form to the isotherm. .When the pressure reaches one
                    atmosphere, however, any further increase is accompanied by the liquefaction of
                    the whole; that is, the volume suddenly diminishes from 1647‘5 cubic centimetres
                    to 1 cubic centimetre. Between these extremes of volume, the isotherm is a
                    straight line parallel to the horizontal axis. The pressure remains constant
                    until the whole of the gas is liquefied. In other words, <hi rend="italic">the
                    pressure of a gas in presence of its liquid does not alter provided the
                    temperature is kept constant.</hi> This is a partial statement of the more
                    general law that the temperature of the liquid surface alone determines the
                    maximum pressure which its vapour or gas in contact therewith can exert (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Heat).</hi> After the whole has been liquefied, any increase of
                    pressure is accompanied by a very minute diminution of volume. Hence the
                    isotherm rises abruptly from the point whose coordinates are 1 cubic centimetre
                    and 1 atmosphere, becoming nearly but not quite vertical. Thus, the isotherm for
                    water-substance at 100° consists of three parts :—an approximately hyperbolic
                    portion for pressures less than one atmosphere, the substance being then wholly
                    gaseous; a horizontal portion, corresponding to the state in which the substance
                    is partly liquid partly gaseous; and a nearly vertical portion for pressures
                    higher than one atmosphere, the substance being then wholly liquid. If we trace
                    out the isotherm for some higher temperature, say 150° C., we obtain the same
                    general characteristics. The straight line portion, however, is not so long, for
                    two reasons :—the steam must be reduced to a smaller volume before liquefaction
                    begins; and the volume of the liquid when condensed is greater. The pressure
                    corresponding to the transition state is in this case 4 ’ 7 atmospheres, and the
                    range of volumes is from 384 ’ 4 cubic centimetres in the gaseous state to 1Ό38
                    cubic centimetres in the liquid state. It thus appears that the positions of the
                    two points of abrupt change on an isotherm draw nearer the higher the
                    temperature, coming together finally when the temperature has reached a certain
                    critical value. In other words, at and above a certain temperature a liquid and
                    its vapour cannot co-exist. This temperature for water-substance is very high,
                    somewhere about the point of fusion of zinc, and is therefore difficult to
                    measure. Dr Andrews, however, in his classical researches on carbonic acid
                    gas,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1869.</p></note> to which we owe most of what is said above,
                    has discussed the whole subject in a very complete manner. This substance, at a
                    temperature Of 13 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> l C., begins to liquefy at a
                    pressure of 47 atmospheres. During the process of liquefaction there is a
                    perfectly visible <pb break="no"

                    states of the substance; and the isotherm has a corresponding straight line
                    portion. At a temperature of 21 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 5 C.
                    liquefaction occurs at a pressure of 60 atmospheres. The horizontal portion of
                    the isotherm, which marks the co-existence of the gaseous and liquid states, is
                    considerably shorter than at the former temperature. The isotherm for 31° *l C.,
                    however, has no such rectilinear characteristic; and at this and higher
                    temperatures the substance is never during the whole compression in two distinct
                    conditions at once. It is impossible to say when the dense gaseous condition
                    passes into the light liquid condition. The two states are absolutely
                    continuous. The critical temperature—that is, the temperature below which there
                    is a distinct separation between the liquid and the gas—is fixed by Dr Andrews
                    at 30 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 92 C. for carbonic acid gas. Above this
                    temperature it is impossible to obtain a free liquid surface in a closed vessel.
                    This conclusion had already been arrived at by Faraday in 1826, when he
                    considered himself entitled to state that above a certain temperature no amount
                    of pressure will produce the phenomenon known as condensation.</p>
                <p>Andrews’s results also give the true explanation of the observations made by
                    Cagniard-Latour<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Annales de Chimie,</hi> 2d ser., xxi., xxii.</p></note> in 1822
                    upon the effect of high temperature on liquids enclosed in glass tubes which
                    they nearly filled. He found that at a certain temperature the free liquid
                    surface disappeared, and the tube became filled with a substance of perfectly
                    uniform appearance throughout. He concluded that the whole had become gaseous.
                    In reality he had reached the critical temperature at which the liquid and
                    gaseous conditions pass continuously the one into the other. The following are
                    Cagniard-Latour’s estimated values for the temperature and pressure of various
                    substances at the critical point</p>

                    carbon tetrachloride. The substances, however, which can be so studied are
                    comparatively few, since the greater number of those which are liquid under

                    1877 Cailletet and Pictet, working independently, first successfully effected
                    their approximate liquefaction. The former compressed each of the gases oxygen,
                    nitrogen, and carbonic oxide to 300 atmospheres in a glass tube, which was
                    cooled to - 29° C.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    When the gas was allowed to escape, it did so in the form of a cloud, condensing
                    for the moment to the liquid state under the influence of the extreme cold
                    produced by the rapid expansion of the gas. Pictet in a similar way obtained an
                    issuing stream of liquid oxygen. Von Wroblewski and Olzewski<note

                    Under this extreme cold they observed these substances forming a well-defined

                <p>At slightly higher temperatures, the pressure necessary for the liquefaction
                    increased very rapidly. Nitrogen and carbonic oxide were not so easily reduced,
                    remaining still gaseous at - 136° C., and under a pressure of 150 atmospheres.

                <p>It will be observed that Von Wroblewski’s observed values for oxygen are in
                    remarkably close agreement with the calculated values given here. Apparently
                    oxygen is just at the limit fixed by Faraday.</p>
                <p>The behaviour of a gas under varying pressure is a phenomenon of great practical
                    importance, and gives a valuable method for measuring pressures (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Manometer).</hi></p>
                <p>A modification of the ordinary mercury manometer is used for measuring volumes,
                    and is especially valuable in estimating the densities of substances which
                    cannot be put into water, such for example as liquids or powders. The closed end
                    of the manometer tube, which by means of a stop-cock may be opened to the air at
                    will, is fitted to a flask with which it may be put into connexion when
                    required. Two fiducial marks are then made upon it— one at the position where
                    the mercury surfaces in the two limbs of the tube are co-level, and the other
                    somewhat higher at a convenient spot. Between the two marks the tube expands
                    into a bulb, thereby increasing the intervening volume and minimizing the effect
                    of any slight error in bringing the mercury surface to the higher mark. Let the
                    volume of the flask and tube down to the higher mark be <hi rend="italic"
                    >V,</hi> and the volume of the rest of the tube down to the lower mark V. At
                    first the volume of air in the flask and tube is V + <hi rend="italic">V,</hi>
                    at the atmospheric pressure P. Now pour mercury into the open end till the
                    liquid surface in the closed end reaches the higher mark. The air has been
                    compressed to volume <hi rend="italic">v</hi>; and the corresponding pressure,
                    as measured by the balanced mercury column, is jt&gt; + P. Hence</p>

                <p>In many experiments on the properties of gases it is necessary to have an
                    efficient and rapid means for altering the density. Instruments for this purpose
                    are called air-pumps, and their function may be either to rarefy or condense the
                    air—usually the former.</p>
                <p>Otto Von Guericke of Magdeburg constructed the first air-pump about the year
                    1652. It was simply a spherical glass vessel opening below by means of a
                    stop-cock and narrow nozzle into the cylinder of an “exhausting syringe,” which
                    inclined upwards from the extremity of the nozzle. The cylinder, in which a
                    well-fitting piston worked, was provided at its lower end with two valves. One
                    of these opened from the nozzle into the cylinder, the other from the cylinder
                    into the outside air. During the down-stroke of the piston the former was
                    pressed home, so that no air entered the nozzle and vessel, while the latter was
                    forced open by the air which so escaped from the cylinder. During the
                    return-stroke the latter was kept closed in virtue of the partial vacuum formed
                    within the cylinder, while at the same time the former was forced open by the
                    pressure of the denser air in the vessel and nozzle. Thus, at every complete
                    stroke of the piston, the air in the vessel or receiver was diminished by that
                    fraction of itself which is expressed by the ratio of the volume of the
                    available cylindrical space above the outward opening valve to the whole volume
                    of receiver, nozzle, and cylinder.</p>
                <p>Boyle, on hearing of Von Guericke’s success in applying the expansive properties
                    of air as a means to its rarefaction, constructed a machine essentially the same
                    as Von Guericke’s, of which no description had then been published. Boyle,
                    however, made the exhausting cylinder a continuation of the nozzle, which was
                    thus considerably reduced in size, and worked the piston by means of a wheel and
                    racket work. He also employed a transparent glass receiver with removable cover,
                    so that the operator could observe what was going on inside, and more easily
                    alter the contents. Other modifications and improvements followed rapidly; and
                    in the carrying out of these Boyle was greatly aided by Hooke, who conceived the
                    happy idea of using two syringes opening into the same duct from the receiver.
                    This improvement has recently been credited to Papin.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Gerlan&lt;l, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wiedemann s</hi><hi rend="italic">Annalen,</hi> 1377, 1883.</p></note> In this
                    form the pistons are worked by the same toothed wheel, and are so adjusted that
                    the one rises as the other falls. This arrangement not only doubles the rate of
                    exhaustion per stroke, but vastly increases the ease of working. In the
                    single-barrelled form the piston is drawn back against a pressure of air which
                    is greater the more complete the exhaustion is within; but in the
                    double-barrelled form the downward pressures upon the two pistons to a certain
                    extent counteract each other, producing opposite rotational effects on the
                    toothed wheel and driving handle. Boyle also early adopted the flat plate, on
                    which could be set receivers of various shapesand sizes. The junction of the
                    plate and receiver he made tolerably air-tight by covering the plate with wet
                    leather and having the receiver rim ground flat. According to Gerland, the
                    invention of the plate is due to Huygens, who constructed the first air-pump so
                    provided in 1661, shortly after a visit to London, where his interest in the
                    subject was awakened by Boyle. To Huygens, probably in conjunction with Papin,
                    is also due the applica tion of the mercury manometer to measure the pressure in
                    the receiver—an indispensable equipment in all serviceable air-pumps. The form
                    of the piston plugs and valves received the special attention of Papin, who by
                    his refined and detailed improvements did much to increase the efficiency of the
                    apparatus.</p>
                <p>The important characteristics of an efficient air-pump are as follows. The piston
                    must work smoothly and easily. The valves must act precisely, and be when closed
                    absolutely air-tight. The plate on which the receivers rest must be smooth and
                    plane, so that the ground edges of the receivers may be in close contact all
                    round. This perfect fitting is beyond the powers of the best workmanship, so
                    that it is necessary to press between the receiver and plate a thin layer of
                    lard, which renders the junction air-tight. Somewhere in the duct leading from
                    the receiver to the piston cylinders, a stop-cock must be fixed, so that it may
                    be possible to shut off the receiver completely from these. Then a second
                    stop-cock is required as a ready means for admitting air to the receiver,
                    whenever the need should arise. A combination three-way stop-cock is a very
                    usual form. And, finally, the apparatus should be provided with a pressure
                    gauge—a mercury manometer communicating by means of a duct with the main duct
                    and receiver.</p>
                <p>The double-barrelled form of reciprocating air-pump, as finally employed by
                    Boyle, is still much in use; but it is gradually being superseded by Bianchi’s,
                    which has but one cylinder and piston. The piston is, however, doubleacting, as
                    the cylinder communicates both above and below by suitable valves with the main
                    duct which leads to the receiver. Hence, during both the up and down strokes of
                    the piston, exhaustion is being effected, the gas which is in the <hi
                    rend="italic">diminishing</hi> chamber being driven out through a suitable valve
                    to the open air. The chief merit of Bianchi’s machine, however, as compared with
                    the older form, lies in the mechanism by which the piston is driven. The end of
                    the piston rod is attached by a crank to a rotating horizontal axle, which is in
                    gearing with the axle of a flywheel <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>. The piston
                    cylinder is capable of a reciprocating oscillatory motion about its lower end,
                    which pivots on a horizontal axis. Thus, as the crank rotates, the piston rises
                    and falls in the cylinder, and oscillates along with it from side to side. The
                    driving power is applied to a handle fixed to the fly-wheel. This substitution
                    of a continuous rotatory motion for a reciprocating motion greatly facilitates
                    rapid exhaustion.</p>
                <p>At every complete stroke of the piston the pressure of air in the receiyer is
                    reduced by a definite fraction of itself, which depends upon the relative
                    volumes of the receiver and piston cylinder. Hence the absolute change of
                    pressure per stroke is smaller as the pressure is smaller; and the rate of
                    exhaustion at very low pressures becomes practically inappreciable. There is, in
                    fact, a practical limit to exhaustion, the particular value of which depends
                    upon the special characteristics of the instrument. The best air-pumps of the
                    type described above cannot reduce the pressure to less than what would balance
                    one or two millimetres of mercury—that is, to what is technically called a
                    pressure of one or two millimetres. To obtain a lower pressure or a <hi
                    rend="italic">higher vacuum,</hi> as it is commonly termed, requires the use of
                    a different principle.</p>
                <p>In a well-constructed barometer the region above the mercury contains no air. It
                    is not an absolute vacuum, but is filled with vapour of mercury at a very low
                    pressure —according tp Régnault, Ό372 mm. at 20° C., and Ό2 mm. at 0° C. The way
                    in which the Torricellian vacuum has been applied to give a practical air-pump
                    has been described in <hi rend="smallcaps">Mercurial Air-Pump. So</hi> long as
                    mercury vapour is permitted to pass freely through the exhausting tubes, it is
                    impossible to obtain by the mercurial air-pump <pb break="no"

                    millimetre. If, however, there is placed somewhere in the duct leading from the
                    mercury pump to the receiver a non-volatile substance which absorbs mercury
                    vapour, the mercury vapour will be arrested. With similar precautions for the
                    absorption of water vapour or other vapour which may be present, it is possible
                    to obtain very low pressures indeed. Thus Crookes<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See his Bakerian Lecture, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1878, clxix. 300.</p></note> in his radiometer experiments
                    obtained pressures as low as Ό0015 mm. or the ’ 2 millionth of an atmosphere.
                    The form of pump used was of Geissler’s type. The water vapour was absorbed by
                    phosphoric anhydride. Sulphur was used to absorb the mercury vapour; and on the
                    further side metallic copper was placed to absorb any sulphur vapour which might
                    tend to pass.</p>
                <p>The best test of a good vacuum is the electrical test. Disruptive discharge
                    through a long tube filled with gas is possible only when the gas is very rare,
                    but there is a point in the rarefaction of a gas at which the discharge passes
                    most easily. In other words, the dielectric strength of a gas reaches a minimum
                    as its pressure is diminished, and it is possible to obtain such a high vacuum
                    that electric discharge will not take place through any considerable length of
                    the exhausted space (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity).</hi> In this
                    connexion we may notice a simple but instructive experiment of Dewar’s. He
                    carefully exhausted a vacuum tube, in which he had previously inserted a piece
                    of carbon. In· the last stages of the exhaustion the carbon was strongly heated
                    so as to drive off most of the gas which is always condensed on its surface.
                    After the completion of the exhaustion, the tube was sealed up and the carbon
                    allowed to cool. As it cooled, it condensed over its surface the greater portion
                    of the small quantity of gas left in the vacuum tube. The vacuum was thus vastly
                    improved, so that it was impossible to pass an electric spark between two
                    platinum electrodes which had been previously fused into the glass. A gentle
                    heat applied to the carbon, however, was sufficient to drive off from its
                    surface enough of the occluded gas to raise the pressure to the point necessary
                    for the passage of the electricity. As the carbon cooled again, the high vacuum
                    was restored and the discharge ceased.</p>
                <p>It is hardly necessary to do more than mention the other class of air-pumps. Let
                    the essential valves in an exhausting pump have their actions reversed, and the
                    apparatus will become a condensing pump. The condensing syringe is the usual
                    form of such a pump; but, compared to the exhausting instrument, it has very
                    limited applications. For the mere obtaining of high pressures hydraulic means
                    are preferable, being at once more manageable and less dangerous. Besides, even
                    moderately slow compression of a gas is accompanied by considerable rise of
                    temperature, just as rarefaction of a gas is accompanied by appreciable lowering
                    of temperature. In the former case work is done in compressing the gas against
                    its own pressure, and this energy appears as heat which raises the temperature
                    of the gas. In the latter case the gas in expanding draws upon its own energy
                    and so cools.</p>

                <p>The cooling of a gas by its own expansion may be observed in one of its effects
                    during exhaustion in an ordinary receiver. Frequently a cloud of minute drops of
                    water—a veritable fog—forms in the exhausted air. The reason simply is that the
                    air has become cooled below its dew-point, or the temperature corresponding to
                    the pressure of water vapour present. If the receiver is first filled with dry
                    air and then exhausted, no cloud forms. Also if the air is carefully filtered
                    through cotton wool, no cloud forms, even though the air be thoroughly saturated
                    with water vapour. This latter fact was established by Mr Aitken in his
                    beautiful series of experiments on dust, fogs, and clouds.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Trans. Roy. Soc.
                    Edin.,</hi> 1880-81.</p></note> It thus appears that the formation of fog and
                    cloud depends not only upon the humidity of the air but also upon the amount of
                    dust in the air. The little particles of dust are necessary as nuclei upon which
                    the vapour can begin to condense. The more numerous the dust particles the finer
                    are the drops which form on them. As these coalesce into larger drops and fall,
                    they bring down the dust nuclei with them; and hence the tendency of rain is to
                    clear the atmosphere, and make conditions less favourable for the formation of
                    more cloud and rain. Thus rain, fog, and dew all require for their formation a
                    free solid surface, colder than the temperature of saturation, on which to
                    condense. In a dustless atmosphere no cloud can ever form.</p>
                <p>It has been already pointed out that when a fluid is in motion it can no longer
                    be regarded as even approximately possessing the properties of the ideal perfect
                    fluid. The postulate that the stress between contiguous portions is
                    perpendicular to the common interface cannot be for a moment admitted. A few
                    examples will make this clear. Thus, if a vessel filled with a liquid be set in
                    rotation, the liquid will soon be found to be rotating with the vessel; and if
                    the motion of the vessel be stopped, the motion of the liquid inside will
                    gradually subside. These phenomena show the existence of a stress tangential to
                    the fluid elements, whereby the relative motion of the different parts of the
                    system is gradually destroyed, until the vessel and its contents behave as one
                    solid body. Again, a fluid stream flowing along a tube or canal moves fastest in
                    the middle, slowest at the bounding walls, and with all possible intermediate
                    speeds at intermediate places. This retardation, due in the first instance to
                    the action of the walls upon the fluid in direct contact therewith, and then to
                    the <hi rend="italic">friction</hi> between the successive contiguous sheets of
                    fluid, plainly implies the existence of tangential stress. The action of the
                    wind in causing waves on the smooth surface of a sheet of water is a further
                    illustration.</p>
                <p>In the discussion of fluid motion, however, it is customary to consider first the
                    properties of the ideal fluid in this respect. Under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hydromechanics,</hi> and especially under <hi rend="smallcaps">Atom,</hi> will
                    be found the mathematical theory treated in full so far as the motion of a
                    non-viscous fluid is concerned.</p>
                <p>The possibility of setting up vortex-motion in a fluid depends upon its
                    imperfection, upon the property of viscosity or fluid friction which is
                    possessed by all known fluids. Some of the more obvious effects of this property
                    have been already noticed. Its effects indeed are conspicuous wherever there is
                    relative motion of the contiguous parts of a fluid. A current of air moving
                    through a mass of air at rest soon loses its momentum; a solid body moving
                    through still air likewise has its motion retarded. The loss of energy which a
                    meteoric stone so suffers as it speeds through the atmosphere appears in the
                    form of heat, which is sufficient to make the stone glow to incandescence or to
                    the temperature of rapid combustion. The waves of rarefaction and condensation,
                    which constitute sound physically, gradually decay in virtue of viscosity. It
                    appears that the rate of this decay is quickest for the shortest waves; so that
                    a sound after travelling through a long distance may lose its shriller
                    constituents and so be modified and mellowed. It is viscosity also which
                    supports the minute dust particles and cloud-forming drops of water in our
                    atmosphere. These are bulk for bulk heavier than the atmosphere, and in tranquil
                    air are slowly sinking. The slowness of their downward motion is directly due to
                    the effect of fluid-friction.</p>
                <p>The term fluid-friction is applied because of the similarity of its effects to
                    the effects of friction between solid masses. Otherwise there need be no further
                    resemblance. The true nature of friction between solid surfaces is not known;
                    possibly, as suggested by Sir W. Thomson, it may be in great measure electrical.
                    In the case of gases, however, the origin of friction is more apparent. Its laws
                    can be deduced from the kinetic theory, and depend directly upon the principle
                    of diffusion. According to the kinetic theory of gases, the molecules of a gas
                    are in constant motion amongst themselves. Compared to their own dimensions,
                    they are by no means closely packed, so that any individual molecule travels a
                    comparatively large space between its encounters with other molecules. Any two
                    contiguous regions are continually interchanging molecules. This diffusion of a
                    gas into itself we have no means of measuring experimentally, as we cannot deal
                    with the individual molecules. Suppose, however, that we have two contiguous
                    layers of a gas flowing in parallel directions with different speeds. The
                    general drift of molecules in the one layer is faster <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n257/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0257-0248"/> than in the other. But this difference will not
                    prevent the individual molecules diffusing across the interface between the
                    layers. Diffusion will go on freely. The result will be that the slower moving
                    layer will on the whole gain momentum in the direction of its motion and the
                    faster moving layer lose momentum. Thus, diffusion tends to the equalization of
                    momentum between two contiguous regions, and the rate at which this takes place
                    across unit area is the measure of the viscosity. Maxwell has proved<note

                    the viscosity so measured is independent of the density of the gas when the
                    temperature is constant; whereas the relation between the viscosity and
                    temperature depends upon the particular mode of action between the molecules
                    when they approach each other.</p>
                <p>The above definition of viscosity is not one which can be used in experimental
                    determinations, since we cannot take account of the individual molecules of a
                    gas. The coefficient of viscosity must be defined in terms of directly
                    measurable quantities.</p>
                <p>Maxwell has defined viscosity in these words :—the viscosity of a substance is
                    measured by the tangential force on unit of area of either of two horizontal
                    planes at the unit of distance apart, one of which is fixed, while the other
                    moves with unit of velocity, the space between being filled with the viscous
                    substance. This is the dynamical definition. When the effects of viscosity on
                    the internal motions of a fluid itself are being considered it is often more
                    convenient to use the kinematical definition. It is. given in terms of <hi
                    rend="italic">μ,</hi> the coefficient of viscosity, by the equation</p>
                <p>M = pv, where <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the density of the substance, and <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> the kinematic viscosity.</p>
                <p>The viscosity of fluids has been determined experimentally in three distinct
                    ways—by flow of the fluid through tubes, by motion in the fluid of pendulums or
                    vibrating disks, and by the oscillations of spheres filled with the fluid. The
                    last was employed by Helmholtz and Von Piotrowski in their investigation of

                    There is, however, a little uncertainty as to the effect of the capillary
                    tube,—so that, for measuring absolutely the viscosity for any one gas, the
                    method is not so trustworthy as the second method. Here we may use either
                    pendulums swinging through small arcs or disks oscillating in their own plane
                    under the action of torsion. In both the measurement depends upon the rate at

                    Maxwell and Meyer were so far similar that each used an arrangement of three
                    horizontal circular disks, fixed centrally to the same vertical axis, and
                    suspended by a torsion wire inside a receiver. The pressure and temperature of
                    the air or gas inside could be adjusted to any desired values within certain
                    limits. In Maxwell’s apparatus, which Meyer adopted in his later researches, the
                    moving disks vibrated between parallel fixed disks, which were perforated in the
                    centre so as to allow the vertical suspended axis to pass freely through them.
                    Each disk thus oscillated in its own plane between two parallel fixed surfaces.
                    After the disks were set in position, and the air in the receiver brought to the
                    desired temperature and pressure, the suspended disks were set in oscillation.
                    This was effected magnetically, a small magnet fixed to the end of the suspended
                    axis being acted upon by an external magnet suitably adjusted. Each disk, in its
                    oscillations, dragged after it the layer of air in immediate contact with it;
                    and in virtue of viscosity this oscillation was trans mitted with diminishing
                    amplitude from layer to layer until the fixed disks were reached. In thus
                    setting and sustaining in motion a mass of gas, the disk was doing work; and, if
                    left to itself and to the action of the torsion suspension, it oscillated with
                    gradually diminishing range until it came to rest. The viscosity of the air was
                    not the only retarding influence. The torsion wire had also a coefficient of
                    viscosity; aud then there was a possible resistance due to the slipping of the
                    fluid at the surfaces of the disks. These various effects were discriminated by
                    suitable modifications. Thus by placing the oscillating disks in contact with
                    each other, and setting two of the fixed disks at measured distances above and
                    below, Maxwell reduced the number of surfaces in contact with the fluid, and so
                    increased the relative importance of the effect due to the wire’s viscosity.
                    Again, by diminishing the distances between the fixed and oscillating disks, he
                    made the conditions more favourable to the effect (if any) due to the slipping.
                    This latter effect was found to be so small as to be almost within the errors of
                    observation; consequently Maxwell felt himself warranted in calculating the
                    coefficient of viscosity on the assumption that there was no slipping.</p>
                <p>Maxwell’s final result in metric (G. G. S.) units for the coefficient of
                    viscosity of dry air is <hi rend="italic">μ≈</hi> ’ 0001878(l + ΌΟ3650), where
                    <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> is the temperature in degrees Centigrade. Meyer’s
                    result is <hi rend="italic">μ —</hi> ∙000190(l + · 00250).</p>
                <p>Maxwell found the effect of pressure to be inappreciable down to a pressure of 12
                    mm., and thus verified the deduction from theory.</p>
                <p>Kundt and Warburg, in their experiments, used only one disk, which oscillated
                    under the influence of a bifilar suspension between two fixed disks. They earned
                    the pressure down to as low as 0 ’ 6 mm. At 20 mm. pressure the viscosity was
                    the same as at the atmospheric pressure; but at lower pressures a slight
                    diminution began to show itself. According to Crookes’s later researches, this
                    diminution becomes more and more marked at the higher exhaustions. The manner in
                    which the viscosity then diminishes coincides remarkably with the manner in
                    which the free path increases. It could not be expected that in such modified
                    circumstances Maxwell’s law would continue to apply. When the gas becomes so far
                    rarefied that the mean free path of a molecule is not small compared to the
                    space in which the gas is confined, the motion of the molecules cannot be
                    treated statistically. Hence the deductions from a theory based upon the
                    statistic method will no longer hold good.</p>
                <p>Maxwell, Kundt and Warburg, and Crookes investigated by the disk method the
                    viscosities of other gases, the values for which are compared below with the
                    transpiration times of the same gases through capillary tubes. Maxwell also
                    found that damp air, at 100 mm. pressure, and over water at about 20° C., was
                    one-sixtieth less viscous than dry air at the same temperature. Kundt and
                    Warburg found for water vapour, at 21° C. and 16 mm. pressure, the value</p>
                <p>μ=O000975, a little more than half that of air.</p>
                <p>The results obtained by Meyer and Springmühl and by Puluj from their
                    transpiration experiments agree well with those already given. In such
                    experiments, however, the slipping of the gas over the solid surface has in
                    certain circumstances a measurable effect. This slipping is measured by a
                    certain coefficient, called the <hi rend="italic">Gleitungs∙Coeffi,cient</hi> by
                    Helmholtz and Von Piotrowski. When this coefficient becomes appreciable, the gas
                    in contact with the solid surface, instead of being at rest relatively to that
                    surface, will be gliding over it with a finite velocity <hi rend="italic"
                    >v.</hi> The circumstances of the motion will be very nearly the same if we
                    remove a layer of the solid surface and replace it by fluid, the new surface of
                    fluid in contact with the new solid surface being at rest. The thickness which
                    must be so removed is the measure of the coefficient of slipping. Kundt and
                    Warburg,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Poggendorff's Ann.,</hi> 1876.</p></note> in their experiments
                    with glass tubes, found this coefficient for dry air at about 20° C. to be</p>
                <p>8/p centimetres, where <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the pressure in dynes per
                    square centimetre, which is nearly the same as in millionths of an atmosphere.
                    The value for hydrogen on glass is 15∕p. Hence at ordinary pressures and
                    moderate exhaustions this coefficient is very small, becoming appreciable only
                    at low pressures.</p>
                <p>The relation between viscosity and temperature is indicated at once by Maxwell’s
                    and Meyer’s formulae given above. According to Maxwell, the viscosity is
                    proportional to the absolute temperature. If in the kinetic theory the forces
                    between the molecules are disregarded, that is, if the molecules are assumed to
                    rebound after collision like elastic spheres, the relation deduced is that the
                    viscosity varies as the square root of the absolute temperature. Hence the
                    mutual molecular forces must be taken into account. Maxwell’s experimental law
                    would require any two molecules to repel each other with a force varying
                    inversely as the fifth power of the distance. According to Meyer, however, the

                <p>We do not here enter into the question of the thermodynamics of gases; enough to
                    say that the relations between viscosity, diffusion, and thermal conductivity
                    deduced by Maxwell from the kinetic theory have received remarkable
                    corroboration from the experiments of Loschmicht, Stefan, Kundt and Warburg, and
                    others. A discussion of the dynamical properties of gases would not. however,
                    appear complete without mention of Crookes’s so-called radiometer, even though
                    these phenomena of high vacua are ultimately thermodynamic.</p>
                <p>The typical form of the radiometer is a glass bulb, in which is hung a delicately
                    poised arrangement of vanes. These, usually four in number, are fixed at the
                    extremities of two light horizontal cross-rods, which are supported so as to be
                    capable of easy rotation about a central vertical axis. The vanes or disks are
                    set in vertical planes passing through the axis; and each has its one side
                    bright, and the other blackened. For any rotation the motion of each vane is
                    exactly alike; that is, either the bright faces all move first, or the dark
                    faces do so. If the pressure of the gas inside the bulb is reduced to a very low
                    exhaustion, the vanes under the action of light or heat will begin to rotate.
                    The mere bringing the radiometer out of a dark region into daylight is enough to
                    set up this rotation. In ordinary circumstances the dark faces are apparently
                    repelled, and the vanes move round with their bright faces in advance.</p>
                <p>The phenomenon is really a thermal one, as was demonstrated experimentally by
                    Tait and Dewar.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin.,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi>
                    1875.</p></note> Further, although it is most evident in high vacua (provided
                    they are not too high), it can be produced in very moderate exhaustions by a
                    suitable arrangement, as was long ago pointed out by Fresnel. Thus, if under the
                    receiver of an ordinary air-pump a light disk be delicately poised near a
                    parallel fixed surface, it will be apparently strongly repelled by this surface
                    if the opposing surfaces are brought to different temperatures. This may be
                    effectively done by means of a ray of sunlight. In this experiment, the
                    essential condition is (as shown by Tait and Dewar) that the surfaces be at a
                    distance comparable to the mean free path of the gaseous molecules. In Crookes’s
                    radiometer the free path is very long, and hence there is apparent repulsion
                    between the blackened surfaces and the walls of the bulb. The reason simply is
                    that, under the action of the radiant energy directed in upon the vanes, the
                    dark faces, absorbing more energy, become warmer than the bright faces. Hence an
                    inequality of temperature is produced in the highly rarefied gas, and this
                    brings into existence a stress which displaces the vanes.</p>
                <p>Liquid in the spheroidal state illustrates the same principle. That a drop of
                    water may be supported over a hot surface without touching it requires an upward
                    pressure. In other words, the vertical stress in the vapour and gas which
                    separate the drop from the surface must be greater than the ordinary gaseous
                    pressure all round the drop. This stress exists because of the difference of
                    temperature between the drop and the surface, so that the pressure in the thin
                    layer of vapour and gas is slightly greater in the vertical than in any
                    horizontal direction.</p>
                <p>A general notion of the manner in which this stress is sustained may be obtained
                    from the following consideration. According to the kinetic theory of gases, the
                    mean speed of the molecules is a function of the temperature—the higher the
                    temperature the greater the speed. Hence molecules, impinging upon a surface at
                    a higher temperature, and in a direction more nearly perpendicular to it, will
                    rebound from that surface with increased momentum. The simultaneous motion of
                    the surface, as if repelled, is then somewhat analogous to the recoil of a
                    cannon when fired. The whole investigation of the question is, however, by no
                    means simple. Maxwell has discussed it with characteristic lucidity in his
                    latest contribution<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1879.</p></note> to the dynamical theory of
                    gases. He finds that, when inequalities of temperature exist at a given point in
                    a gas, the pressure is not the same in all directions. Its value in any given
                    direction, in so far as it depends upon the temperature inequality, is
                    proportional to the space-rate of change of the space-variation of the
                    temperature in that direction—that is, to the second differential coefficient of
                    the temperature with respect to the given direction. Hence the pressure will be
                    greatest along the line for which this differential coefficient is a maximum. It
                    appears that the pressure so called into existence by a possible temperature
                    inequality is very minute at ordinary hydrostatic pressures, but becomes
                    considerable when the pressure of the gas is made very small. If the inequality
                    of temperature throughout the gas is due to the presence of small bodies, whose
                    temperatures differ from the temperature of the gas at a distance from them,
                    then the small bodies will be acted upon by the stresses set up, provided they
                    are of the same order of smallness as the mean free path of the molecules. In
                    the case of two such small bodies, there will be apparent repulsion between them
                    if the bodies are warmer than the air at a distance from them, and attraction if
                    they are colder. If one is warmer and the other colder, the action may be either
                    attractive or repulsive, according to the relative sizes of the bodies and their
                    exact temperatures. These results are obtained by considering only the stresses
                    normal to the solid surfaces. When the tangential stresses are taken into
                    account, then it appears that inequality of temperature, when the flow of heat
                    becomes steady, cannot produce other than equilibrium in the material system
                    immersed in the gas. Hence Maxwell believes that the explanation of Crookes’s
                    phenomenon must depend ultimately upon the slipping of the gas over the solid
                    surface. If such slipping be permitted, its effect will be to diminish the
                    tangential stresses acting on the solid surface without affecting the normal
                    stresses; and hence the equilibrium will be destroyed. In attempting to express
                    the conditions to be satisfied by the gas at the solid surface. Maxwell is led
                    to the consideration of the phenomenon discovered by Osborne Reynolds<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy.
                    Soc.,</hi> 1879.</p></note> and named thermal transpiration. This phenomenon
                    consists of a sliding of the gas over the surface of an unequally heated solid
                    from the colder to the hotter parts. Maxwell considers the particular case of
                    the slow steady flow of gas along a capillary tube of circular section, the
                    temperature of which varies steadily from point to point. The amount of gas
                    which passes through any section depends both upon the rate of change of
                    pressure and the rate of change of temperature in passing along the axis of the
                    tube. If the pressure is uniform there will be a flow of gas from the colder to
                    the hotter end. If there is no flow of gas, the pressure will increase from the
                    colder to the hotter end. The case of uniform temperature is the ordinary case
                    of transpiration through capillary tubes, as discussed experimentally by Graham,
                    Meyer, Puluj, and Kundt and Warburg. The experimental investigation of the first
                    two cases seems at present hopeless, on account of the minuteness of the
                    quantities to be measured. Reynolds experimented, not on capillary tubes, but on
                    the passage of the gas through a porous plate, the temperatures being different
                    on the two sides. (C. G. K.)</p>
