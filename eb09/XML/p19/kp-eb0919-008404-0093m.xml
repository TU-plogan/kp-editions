                    l’Épinoy</hi> (1753-1835), the chief fiction writer of the first empire, and the
                    most popular light novelist of France before Paul de Kock, was born at Calais
                    (he is said to have traced his pedigree on the mother’s side to Eustache de St
                    Pierre) on April 8, 1753. His youth was decidedly stormy. He twice carried off
                    young ladies of some position, and was in consequence twice imprisoned by <hi
                    rend="italic">lettre</hi><hi rend="italic">de cachet.</hi> His first love, a
                    Miss Crawford, the daughter of an English merchant whose office Pigault had
                    entered, died almost immediately after her elopement; the second, Mademoiselle
                    de Salens, he married. Besides his commercial and criminal experiences, he was a
                    soldier in the queen’s guards, an actor, and a teacher of French. At the
                    breaking out of the great war he re-enlisted and fought at Valmy. It should be
                    said, however, that the romantic incidents of his life are differently related
                    by different authorities, and are open to not a little suspicion. Although he
                    had tried dramatic writing, he does not seem to have attempted prose fiction
                    till he was forty, but from that time he was a fertile writer of novels for
                    nearly thirty years. In his old age he took to graver work, and executed an
                    abridgment of French history in eight volumes, besides some other work. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Oeuvres Complètes</hi> were published in twenty volumes between
                    1822 and 1824. He died on July 24, 1835. Pigault’s numerous novels, though still
                    occasionally reprinted, are not much read; and none of them is much better or
                    worse than any other. Their style is insignificant, and their morality very far
                    from severe. But Pigault deserves the credit, such as it is, of being almost the
                    first writer of numerous light novels calculated to hit, and which succeeded in
                    hitting, the taste of his day. Nor was he by any means without wit. As almost
                    the father of a kind of literature which has since developed itself enormously,
                    and which, whatever may be its intrinsic merits, has maintained and increased
                    its popularity for a century, Pigault-Lebrun deserves a certain place in
                    literary history.</p>
