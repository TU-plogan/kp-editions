                    plea.</p>
                <p>All systems of law agree in making it necessary to bring the grounds of a claim
                    or defence before the court in a more or less technical form. In Roman law the
                    action passed through three stages (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Action),</hi> and
                    the manner of pleading changed with the action. In the earliest historical
                    period, that of the <hi rend="italic">leyis</hi><hi rend="italic">actiones,</hi>
                    the pleadings were verbal, and made in court by the parties themselves, the
                    proceedings imitating as far as possible the natural conduct of persons who had
                    been disputing, but who suffered their quarrel to be appeased (Maine, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ancient Law,</hi> ch. x.). Though pleadings were probably not
                    couched in technical language originally, this soon became a necessity, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n227/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0227-0218"/> and was regarded as so important that, as Gaius
                    tells us, the party who made even the most trifling mistake would lose his suit.
                    This excessive reverence for formality is a universal characteristic of archaic
                    law. Its probable explanation is to be found in the weakness of the executive.
                    In the second period, that of the procedure by <hi rend="italic">formulae,</hi>
                    the issue which the <hi rend="italic">judex</hi> decided was made up by the <hi
                    rend="italic">p&gt;raetor</hi> in writing from the statements of the parties
                    before him. The <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> was a short summary of the facts
                    in dispute in technical language, with instructions to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >judex.</hi> The part of the <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> which contained the
                    plaintiff’s claim was called the <hi rend="italic">intentio.</hi> Any equitable
                    defence in the <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> was set up by means of an <hi
                    rend="italic">exceptio,</hi> which was either peremptory, denying the right of
                    the plaintiff to recover at all, or dilatory, denying only that the action could
                    be brought at the time or by the particular plaintiff. The plaintiff might meet
                    the <hi rend="italic">exceptio</hi> with a <hi rend="italic">replicatio,</hi>
                    the defendant on his side might set up a <hi rend="italic">duplicalio,</hi> and
                    the plaintiff might traverse the <hi rend="italic">duplicatio</hi> by a <hi
                    rend="italic">triplicatio.</hi> The parties might proceed even further, but
                    beyond this point the pleadings had no special names. Actions <hi rend="italic"
                    >bonae</hi><hi rend="italic">fidei</hi> implied every <hi rend="italic"
                    >exceptio</hi> that could be set up; in other actions the <hi rend="italic"
                    >exceptio</hi> must be specially pleaded. From the <hi rend="italic"
                    >formula</hi> the <hi rend="italic">judex</hi> derived his whole authority, and
                    he was liable to an action for exceeding it. He could not amend the <hi
                    rend="italic">formula·,</hi> that could only be done by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >praetor.</hi> In the third period the <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> did not
                    exist, the plaintiff’s claim appeared in the summons <hi rend="italic">(libellus
                    conventionis'),</hi> and the defendant might take any defence that he pleased,
                    all actions being placed on the footing of actions <hi rend="italic"
                    >bonae</hi><hi rend="italic">fidei.</hi> The issue to be tried was determined by
                    the judge from the oral statements of the parties. In criminal procedure the
                    indictment <hi rend="italic">(inscriptio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">libellus
                    accusationis)</hi> was usually in writing, and contained a formal statement of
                    the offence. In some cases oral accusations were allowed. The pleading of the
                    accused seems to have been informal.</p>
                <p>The development of the system of pleading in Roman and English law proceeded upon
                    very similar lines. It is possible that the English system was directly based
                    upon the Roman. Bracton <hi rend="italic">(temp.</hi> Henry III.) uses many of
                    the Roman technical terms. Pleading was oral as late as the reign of Henry
                    VIII., but in the reign of Edward III. pleadings began to be drawn up in
                    writing, perhaps at first more for the purpose of entry on the court records
                    than of the instruction of the court (see 2 Reeves, <hi rend="italic">History of
                    English Law,</hi> 398). The French language was used up to 36 Edw. III. st. 1,
                    c. 15, after which English was used for oral pleading, but Latin for enrolment.
                    Latin was the language of written pleadings at common law until 4 Geo. II. c.
                    26.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tn Chancery the

                    of the oral period. It is no doubt from the circumstance of pleading having been
                    originally oral that the word in the popular though not in the legal sense is
                    used for the oral conduct of the case by an advocate.<note anchored="true"

                    type="authorial"><p>The original writ was so called to distinguish it from the
                    judicial writ, which was a part of the process of the court. The judicial writs
                    still exist, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> writs of <hi rend="italic"
                    >certiorari</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fieri facias.</hi></p></note> The writ was
                    at first a formal commission from the crown to a judicial officer to do justice
                    between the parties, the claim being made by means of a count. The issue of the
                    writ was part of the prerogative of the crown, unlimited until the Provisions of
                    Oxford (1258) forbade the issue of fresh writs (except writs <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">cursu)</hi> without the consent of the council.
                    Gradually the writ came to absorb the count and included the plaintiff’s claim
                    and sometimes the nature of his evidence. The defendant pleaded to the writ. The
                    writ became the universal form of instituting proceedings in the king’s court,
                    irrespective of the method of trial which followed, and probably grew fixed in
                    form about the reign of Henry II. (see Bigelow, <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Procedure,</hi> ch. iv.). At a later date the writ again tended to approach its
                    earlier form and to split into two parts, the writ of summons and the
                    declaration or plaintiff’s claim. The writ of summons was addressed to the
                    defendant, and not, as the original writ, to a judicial officer. The pleadings
                    became the act of the party, differing in this from Roman law, in which they
                    were a judicial act. The writs became precedents for the forms of action, which,
                    like the writs, were limited in number. The plaintiff’s claim was a substantial
                    repetition of the writ. Modern legislation, in the case of the specially
                    indorsed writ of summons (see below), practically returns to this ancient stage
                    of law. In the writ, as in the <hi rend="italic">formula,</hi> the slightest
                    failure in form was as a rule fatal. “The assigning of a writ of a particular
                    frame and scope to each particular cause of action, the appropriating process of
                    one kind to one action and of a different kind to another, these and the like
                    distinctions rendered proceedings very nice and complex, and made the conduct of
                    an action a matter of considerable difficulty” (1 Reeves, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist, of English Law,</hi> 147). Fines were levied for mistakes in pleading,
                    non-liability to which was sometimes granted by charter as a special privilege
                    to favoured towns. In both Roman and English law fictions, equity, and
                    legislation came to mitigate the rigour of the law. In England this result was
                    largely attained by the framing of the action of trespass on the case under the
                    powers of the Statute of Westminster the Second (13 Edw. I. stat. 1, c. 24), and
                    by the extension of the action of <hi rend="italic">assumpsit</hi> to
                    non-feasance. To a less extent the same difficulties were found in the period of
                    special pleading<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    ingenuity of the pleader chiefly showing itself in framing special as opposed to
                    general pleas, the term special pleading grew to be used for the whole
                    proceedings of which it was the most important part.</p></note> which followed
                    the writ period, owing to the particularity with which the claim had to be set
                    out and the narrow powers of amendment possessed by the courts. The practical
                    questions at issue were thrown into the shade by questions of the proper way of
                    stating them. Substantive law could only be arrived at through the medium of
                    adjective law. Special pleading became an art of the utmost nicety, depending on
                    numerous rules, some of them highly technical (see Coke upon Littleton, 303).
                    Those who made it their business to frame pleadings were called special
                    pleaders. They were not necessarily members of the bar, but might be licensed to
                    practise under the bar. Pleaders under the bar still exist, but recent
                    legislation has much diminished their numbers and importance. Changes were
                    gradually introduced by a long series of statutes of which the most important
                    have been the Statutes of Jeofails, beginning as early as 14 Edw. HL, c. 6, the
                    Statutes of Set-off, the Common Law Procedure Acts, and the Judicature Acts. The
                    advance has always been, as in Roman law, in the direction of less formality. Up
                    to 1875 the system of pleading varied in the different courts which now compose
                    the High Court of Justice. In the Common Law Courts the action was commenced by
                    a <hi rend="italic">declaration</hi> (containing either <hi rend="italic"
                    >special</hi> or <hi rend="italic">common counts,</hi> or both combined), to
                    which the defendant put in a <hi rend="italic">plea</hi> or pleas. The plea was
                    either of the general issue, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a bare denial (as
                    “Never Indebted” to an action of debt), or special, setting out the facts with
                    greater particularity. Pleas were also peremptory or dilatory, names taken from
                    the Roman law.</p>

                <p>By the Common I jaw Procedure Act, 1854, equitable pleas might be pleaded. To the
                    defendant’s plea the plaintiff pleaded a <hi rend="italic">replication;</hi> the
                    defendant might follow with a <hi rend="italic">rejoinder,</hi> the plaintiff
                    with a <hi rend="italic">surrejoinder,</hi> the defendant with a <hi

                    >surrebutter.</hi> Beyond that point, which was seldom reached, the pleadings
                    had no special names. The pleadings concluded with <hi rend="italic">Ά</hi><hi

                    judge and of the officer entering the judgment under the Rules of the Supreme
                    Court, 1883 (Ord. xxxvi. r. 30; Ord. xli. r. 1). Either party might demur at any
                    stage of the pleadings (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Demurrer).</hi> In certain
                    cases the replication of the plaintiff proceeded by way of <hi rend="italic">new
                    assignment; e.g.,</hi> in an action of trespass to which justification was
                    pleaded, the plaintiff might complain of acts in excess of those covered by the
                    justification. In this case he was said to new assign, and the defendant pleaded
                    to the new assignment. In the Court of Chancery the plaintiff’s claim was
                    contained in a <hi rend="italic">bill</hi> (in certain matters of a public
                    nature an <hi rend="italic">information),</hi> to which the defendant filed an

                <p>The Judicature Act, 1873, introduced a uniform system of pleading in the High
                    Court of Justice. The practice is now regulated by the Rules of the Supreme
                    Court, 1883. By Ord. xix. r. 4, “every pleading shall contain, and contain only,
                    a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading
                    relies for his claim .or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by
                    which they are to be proved, and shall, when necessary, be divided into
                    paragraphs, numbered consecutively. Dates, sums, and numbers shall be expressed
                    in figures and not in words. Signature of counsel shall not be necessary; but
                    where pleadings have been settled by counsel or a special pleader they shall be
                    signed by him, and if not so settled they shall be signed by the solicitor or by
                    the party if he sues or defends in person.” The term “pleading” in the
                    Judicature Acts includes a petition or summons, 36 &lt;fc 37 Vict. c. 66, § 100.
                    From 1875 to 1883 the plaintiff had in almost every case to deliver a <hi

                    any point of law. Forms of pleadings are given in Appendices C, D, and E to the
                    Rules of 1883. In actions for damages by collision between ships, a document
                    called a <hi rend="italic">preliminary act</hi> (before the Judicature Act
                    peculiar to the Court of Admiralty) must be filed, containing details as to the
                    time and place of collision, the speed, tide, lights, &amp;c. The case may be
                    tried on the preliminary act without pleadings. In all actions such ground of
                    defence or reply as if not raised would be likely to take the opposite party by
                    surprise, or would raise issues of fact not arising out of the preceding
                    pleadings, must be specially pleaded. Such are compulsory pilotage, fraud, the
                    Statute of Limitations, the Statute of Frauds. The pleadings in <hi
                    rend="italic">replevin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">petition of right</hi> are
                    governed by special rules. To courts other than the High Court of Justice the
                    Judicature Acts do not apply. In some courts, however, such as the Chancery of
                    the County Palatine of Lancaster and the Court of Passage of the City of
                    Liverpool, the rules of pleading used in the High Court have been adopted with
                    the necessary modifications. In the Mayor’s Court of London the common law
                    pleading, as it existed before the Judicature Acts, is still in use. In the
                    ecclesiastical courts the statements of the parties are called generally <hi
                    rend="italic">pleas.</hi> The statement of the plaintiff in civil suits is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">libel,</hi> of the promoter in criminal suits <hi
                    rend="italic">articles.</hi> Every subsequent plea is called an <hi
                    rend="italic">allegation.</hi> To the responsive allegation of the defendant the
                    promoter may plead a counter-allegation. The cause is concluded when the parties
                    renounce any further allegation. In the Divorce Court the pleadings are named
                    <hi rend="italic">petition, answer, replication.</hi> In that court and in the
                    ecclesiastical courts there exists in addition a more short and summary mode of
                    pleading called an <hi rend="italic">act on petition.</hi> In the county courts
                    proceedings are commenced by a <hi rend="italic">plaint,</hi> followed by an <hi
                    rend="italic">ordinary</hi> or <hi rend="italic">default summons.</hi> No
                    further pleadings are necessary, but the defendant cannot set up certain special
                    defences, such as set-off or infancy, without the consent of the plaintiff,
                    unless after notice in writing of his intention to set up the special
                    defence.</p>
                <p>The pleading in English criminal law has been less affected by legislation than
                    the pleading in actions. The pleading is more formal, and oral pleading is still
                    retained. Cases in which the crown was a party early became known as pleas of
                    the crown <hi rend="italic">(placita</hi><hi rend="italic">coronae),</hi> as
                    distinguished from common pleas <hi rend="italic">(communia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">placita),</hi> or pleas between subject and subject, that is to
                    say, ordinary civil actions. Pleas of the crown originally included all matters
                    in which the crown was concerned, such as exchequer cases, franchises, and
                    liberties, but gradually became confined to criminal matters, strictly to the
                    greater crimes triable only in the king’s courts. In criminal pleading the crown
                    states the case in an <hi rend="italic">indictment</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >information.</hi> The answer of the accused is a <hi rend="italic">plea,</hi>
                    which must in almost all cases be pleaded by the accused in person. The. plea,
                    according to Blackstone, is either to the jurisdiction, a demurrer, in
                    abatement, special in bar, or the general issue. The latter is the only plea
                    that often occurs in practice; it consists in the oral answer of “Guilty” or
                    “Not Guilty” to the charge. A demurrer is strictly not a plea at all, but an
                    objection on legal grounds. Pleas to the jurisdiction or in abatement do not go
                    to the merits of the case, but allege that the court has no jurisdiction to <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n229/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0229-0220"/> try the particular offence, or that there is a
                    misnomer or some other technical ground for stay of proceedings. The power of
                    amendment and the procedure by motion in arrest of judgment have rendered these
                    pleas of little practical importance. The special pleas in bar are <hi
                    rend="italic">autrefois convict or autrefois acquit</hi> (alleging a previous
                    conviction or acquittal for the same crime), <hi rend="italic">autrefois
                    attaint</hi> (practically obsolete since the Felony Act, 1870, has abolished
                    attainder for treason or felony), and pardon (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pardon).</hi> There are also special pleas in indictments for libel under the
                    provisions of Lord Campbell’s Act, 6 &amp; 7 Vict. c. 96 (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Libel),</hi> and to indictments for non-repair of highways and
                    bridges, where the accused may plead that the liability to repair falls upon
                    another person. These special pleas are usually, and in some cases must be, in
                    writing. Where there is a special plea in writing, the crown puts in a <hi
                    rend="italic">replication</hi> in writing. (For the history of criminal pleading
                    see Stephen, <hi rend="italic">History of the Criminal Law,</hi> vol. i. ch.
                    ix.)</p>
                <p>In Scotland an action in the Court of Session begins by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >summons</hi> on the part of the pursuer to which is annexed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >condescendence,</hi> containing the allegations in fact on which the action is
                    founded. The <hi rend="italic">pleas in Imo,</hi> or statement of the legal rule
                    or rules relied upon (introduced by 6 Geo. IV. c. 120, § 9), are subjoined to
                    the condescendence. The term <hi rend="italic">libel</hi> is also used (as in
                    Roman Ia∖vj as a general term to express the claim of the pursuer or the
                    accusation of the prosecutor. The statement of the defender, including his pleas
                    in law, is called his <hi rend="italic">defences.</hi> They are either dilatory
                    or peremptory. There is no formal joinder of issue, as in England, but the same
                    end is attained by adjustment of the pleadings and the closing of the record.
                    Large powers of amendment and révisai are given by the Court of Session Act,
                    1868. In the Sheriff Court pleadings are very similar to those in the Court of
                    Session. They are commenced by a <hi rend="italic">petition,</hi> which includes
                    a condescendence and a note of the pursuer’s pleas in law. The defender may upon
                    notice lodge defences. The procedure is now governed by 39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 70.
                    The term “pleas of the crown” is confined in Scotland to four offences—murder,
                    rape, robbery, and fire-raising. A prosecution is commenced either by <hi
                    rend="italic">indictment or criminal letters,</hi> the former being the
                    privilege of the lord advocate. In the Supreme Court the indictment or criminal
                    letters run in the name of the lord advocate; in the Sheriff Court the criminal
                    letters (indictments not being used in that court) run in the name of the judge.
                    The Scotch indictment differs from the English, and is in the form of a
                    syllogism, the major proposition stating the nature of the crime, the minor the
                    actual offence committed and that it constitutes the crime named in the major,
                    the conclusion that on conviction of the panel he ought to suffer punishment.
                    The panel usually pleads “Guilty” or “Not Guilty” as in England, but he may
                    Slead in bar want of jurisdiction or <hi rend="italic">res judicata,</hi> or
                    make special efences (such as <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi> or insanity), which
                    must be lodged with the clerk of the court in writing signed by him or his
                    counsel. The special defence is read to the jury immediately after they have
                    been sworn. (See Macdonald, <hi rend="italic">Criminal Law of Scotland.
                    )</hi></p>
                <p>In the United States two systems of pleading in civil procedure exist side by
                    side. Up to 1848 the pleading did not materially differ from that in use in
                    England at the same date. But in 1848 the New York legislature made a radical
                    change in the system, and the example of New York has been followed by more than
                    twenty States. The New York Civil Code of 1848 established a uniform procedure
                    called the civil action, applicable indifferently to common law and equity. The
                    pleadings are called <hi rend="italic">complaint, answer</hi> (which includes
                    <hi rend="italic">counterclaim),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">reply.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">demurrer</hi> also is still used. In some States which follow the
                    new procedure the complaint bears the name of <hi rend="italic">petition.</hi>
                    In the inferior courts, such as courts of justices of the peace, the pleadings
                    are more simple, and in many cases oral. In States which do not adopt the
                    amended procedure, the pleading is much the same as it was in the days of
                    Blackstone, and the old double jurisdiction of common law and equity still
                    remains. Criminal pleading differs little from that in use in England. (See
                    Bishop, <hi rend="italic">Law of Criminal Procedure.)</hi> (J. Wt. )</p>
