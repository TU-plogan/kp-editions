                <p><label type="entry">PRAeTORIANS</label><hi rend="italic">(praetoriani)</hi> was
                    the name borne by the body-guards of the Roman emperors. The name was derived
                    from the praetorian cohort, a picked body of troops who in the time of the
                    republic formed the guard of a general in command of an army, the old Latin name
                    for a general being <hi rend="italic">praetor</hi> and his quarters in the camp
                    being known as the <hi rend="italic">praetorium.</hi> As the emperor was
                    commanderin-chief the headquarters <hi rend="italic">(praetorium)</hi> were
                    established at Rome, and one of the earliest measures of Augustus was the new
                    organization of the guard. The command of the praetorians rested legally with
                    the emperor, but after 2 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it was practically
                    exercised by one or more colonels chosen by the emperor with the title of
                    “praetorian praefects” <hi rend="italic">(praefecti</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >praetorio,</hi> see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pr.efect).</hi> The praetorians
                    were divided into cohorts of 1000 men each, horse and foot, and hence they are
                    often referred to as the praetorian cohorts.</p>
                <p>Augustus raised nine corps, of which he quartered three in different parts of
                    Rome and the rest in neighbouring cities. One cohort kept guard in the palace.
                    Under Tiberius the crafty and energetic praetorian praefect Sejanus collected
                    the praetorians into a permanent fortified camp outside the Viminalian Gate of
                    Rome. Thus united they acquired and exercised the power of making and unmaking
                    emperors. The number of the cohorts was raised temporarily by Vitellius to
                    sixteen; from 112 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> to the end of the 3d century,
                    and probably to the time of Constantine, the number was ten. At first they were
                    recruited exclusively from Italy, but afterwards from the Romanized provinces
                    also of Spain, Noricum, and Macedonia. Their pay was nominally double, but
                    really more than double, that of the legionaries;<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The legionaries received 10 asses daily,
                            or 3600 asses ( = 225 denarii) annually; the praetorians received twenty
                            asses daily, or 7200 asses annually. But, whereas in paying the
                            legionaries the as was reckoned at its current value of 16 to the
                            denarius, in paying the praetorians it was reckoned at its old and
                            higher value of 10 to the denarius, and hence the 7200 asses of a
                            praetorian were equal to 11,520 asses at the current rate, or 720
                            denarii. This is Mommsen’s highly ingenious and probable explanation of
                            the apparent discrepancy between the statements of Dio Cassius (liii.
                            11, 55) and Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Ann.,</hi> i. 17). See
                            Marquardt’s <hi rend="italic">Römische</hi><hi rend="italic"
                                >Staatsveτvmltung,</hi> ii. p. 480. Pliny <hi rend="italic">(N.
                                H.,</hi> xxxiii. 45) states that after the value of the as was
                            lowered it continued to be reckoned at its old value in the payment of
                            soldiers. But by combining the statements of Suetonius <hi rend="italic"
                                >(Ctes.,</hi> 26, and <hi rend="italic">Dom.it.,</hi> 7) we see that
                            Julius Caesar, while he nominally and really raised the pay of the
                            soldiers, paid it in asses of the current value, and hence after his
                            time it was only the praetorians who retained the privilege of having
                            their pay reckoned in asses of the old value (see Marquardt, <hi
                                rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 95).</p></note> their period of
                    service was shorter, being sixteen years instead of at least twenty; and from
                    the time of Claudius it was the custom of the emperors on their succession to
                    the throne to purchase the favour of their powerful guards by a liberal
                    donative. But the sense of their own power, to which these special privileges
                    bore λvitness, fostered the pride, while the luxurious life of the capital
                    relaxed the discipline, of the praetorians. Their insolence culminated when they
                    murdered the virtuous Pertinax, put the empire up to auction, and knocked it
                    down to the highest bidder (193). In the same year they were disgraced and
                    disbanded by Severus, only, however, to be replaced by a still more numerous
                        corps,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to
                            Herodian (iii. 13, 4) Severus increased the troops in Rome
                        fourfold.</p></note> which was now recruited indifferently from all parts of
                    the empire. Diocletian reduced their numbers, and they were finally suppressed
                    by Constantine in 312.</p>
