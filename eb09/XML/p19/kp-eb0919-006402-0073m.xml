                    among which the pianoforte is latest in order of time, has been invented and
                    step by step developed with the modern art of music, which is based upon the
                    simultaneous emυlovment of different musical sounds. In the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0074-0065"/> 10th century the “organum” arose, an elementary
                    system of accompaniment to the voice, consisting 01 fourths and octaves below
                    the melody and moving with it; and the organ, the earliest keyed instrument,
                    was, in the first instance, the rude embodiment of this idea and convenient
                    means for its expression. 'There was as yet no keyboard of balanced key levers;
                    batons were drawn out like modern draw-stops, to admit the compressed air
                    necessary to make the pipes sound. About the same time arose a large stringed
                    instrument, the organistrum, the parent of the now vulgar hurdy-gurdy; as the
                    organ needed a blower as well as an organist, so the player of the organistrum
                    required a handle-turner, by whose aid the three strings of the instrument were
                    made to sound simultaneously upon a wheel, and, according to the well-known
                    sculptured relief of St George de Boscherville, one string was manipulated by
                    means of a row of stoppers or tangents pressed inwards to produce the notes. The
                    other strings were drones, analogous to the drones of the bagpipes, and
                    differing in effect from the changing “organum” of the organ. In the 11th
                    century, the epoch of Guido d’Arezzo, to whom the beginning of musical notation
                    is attributed, the Pythagorean monochord, with its shifting bridge, was used in
                    the singing schools to teach the intervals of the plain-song of the church. The
                    practical necessity, not merely to demonstrate the proportionate relations of
                    the intervals, but also to initiate pupils into the different gradations of the
                    church tones, had soon after Guido’s time brought into use quadruplex-fashioned
                    monochords, which were constructed with scales, analogous to the modern practice
                    with thermometers which are made to show both Réaumur and Centigrade, so that
                    four lines indicated as many authentic and as many plagal tones. This
                    arrangement found great acceptance, for Aribo, writing about fifty years after
                    Guido, says that few monochords were to be found without it. Had the clavichord
                    then been known, this make-shift contrivance would not have been used. Aribo
                    strenuously endeavoured to improve it, and “by the grace cf God” invented a
                    monochord measure which, on account of the rapidity of the leaps he could make
                    with it, he named a wild-goat <hi rend="italic">(caprea).</hi> Jean de Muris <hi
                    rend="italic">(Musica Speculativa,</hi> 1323) teaches how true relations may be
                    found by a singlestring monochord, but recommends a four-stringed one, properly
                    a tetrachord, to gain a knowledge of unfamiliar intervals. He describes the
                    musical instruments known in his time, but does not mention the clavichord or
                    monochord with keys, which could not have been then invented. Perhaps one of the
                    earliest forms of such an instrument, in which stoppers or tan gents had been
                    adopted from the organistrum, is shown in fig. 1, from a wood carving of a vicar
                    choral or organist, preserved in St Mary’s Church, Shrewsbury. The latest date
                    to which this interesting figure may be attributed is 1460, but the conventional
                    representation shows that the instrument was then already of a past fashion,
                    although perhaps still retained in use and familiar to the carver.</p>
                <p>A keyboard of balanced keys may have been first introduced in the little portable
                    organ known as the regal so often represented in old carvings, paintings, and
                    stained windows. It derived its name regal from the rule <hi rend="italic"
                    >(regula)</hi> or graduated scale of keys, and its use was to give the singers
                    in religious processions the note or pitch. The only instrument of this kind
                    known to exist in the United Kingdom is at Blair Athole, and it bears the very
                    late date of 1630. The Brussels regal may be as modern. These are instances of
                    how long a some-time admired musical instrument may remain in use after its
                    first intention is forgotten. We attribute the adaptation of the narrow regal
                    keyboard to what was still called the monochord, but was now a complex of
                    monochords over one resonance board, to the latter half of the 14th century; it
                    was accomplished by the substitution of tangents fixed in the further ends of
                    the balanced keys for the movable bridges of the monochord or such stoppers as
                    are shown in the Shrewsbury carving. Thus the monochordium or “payre of
                    monochordis” became the clavichordium or “payre of clavichordis ”—pair being
                    applied, in the old sense of a “pair of steps,” to a series of degrees. This use
                    of the word to imply gradation was common in England to all keyed instruments;
                    thus we read, in the Tudor period and later, of a pair of régals, organs, of
                    virginals.</p>
                <p>The earliest known record of the clavichord occurs in some rules of the
                    minnesingers, dated 1404, preserved at Vienna. The monochord is named with it,
                    showing a differentiation of these instruments, and of them from the
                    clavicymbalum, the keyed cymbal, cembalo (Italian), or psaltery. From this we
                    learn that a keyboard had been thus early adapted to that favourite mediaeval
                    stringed instrument, the “cembalo” of Boccaccio, the “sautrie” of Chaucer. There
                    were two forms of the psaltery:—(l)the trapeze, one of the oldest
                    representations of which is to be found in Orcagna’s famous Trionfo della Morte
                    in the Campo Santo at Pisa, and another by the same painter in the National
                    Gallery, London; and (2) the contemporary “testa di porco,” the pig’s head,
                    which was of triangular shape as the name suggests. The trapeze psaltery was
                    strung horizontally, the “istromento di porco” either horizontally or
                    vertically,—the notes, as in the common dulcimer, being in groups of three or
                    four unisons. In these differences of form and stringing we see the cause of the
                    ultimate differentiation of the spinet and harpsichord. The compass of the
                    psalteries was nearly that of Guido’s scale; but, according to Mersenne, the
                    lowest interval was a fourth, G to C, which is worthy of notice as anticipating
                    the later “short measure” of the spinet and organ.</p>
                <p>The simplicity of the clavichord inclines us to place it, in order of time,
                    before the clavicymbalum or clavicembalo: but we do not know how the sounds of
                    the latter were at first excited. There is an indication as to its early fcrm to
                    be seen in the church of the Certosa near Pavia, which compares in probable date
                    with the Shrewsbury example. We quote the reference to it from Dr Ambros’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Music.</hi> He says a carving represents King David as
                    holding an “istromento di porco” which has eight strings and as many keys lying
                    parallel to them; he touches the keys with the right hand and damps the strings
                    with the left. The attribution of archaism applies with equal force to this
                    carving as to the Shrewsbury one, for when the monastery of Certosa was built
                    chromatic keyboards, which imply a considerable advance, were already in use.
                    There is an authentic representation of a chromatic keyboard, painted not later
                    than 1426, in the St Cecilia panel (now at Berlin) of the famous Adoration of
                    the Lamb by the Van Eycks. The instrument depicted is a positive organ, and it
                    is interesting to notice in this realistic painting that the keys are evidently
                    boxwood as in the Italian spinets of later date, and that the angel plays a
                    common chord—A with the right hand, F and C with the left. But diatonic organs
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n75/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0075-0066"/> with eight steps or keys in the octave, which
                    included the B flat and the B natural, as in Guido’s scale, were long preserved,
                    for Praetorius speaks of them as still existing nearly two hundred years later.
                    This diatonic keyboard, we learn from Sebastian Virdung <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Musica</hi><hi rend="italic">geputscht und</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >auszgezogen,</hi> Basel, 1511), was the keyboard of the early clavichord. We
                    reproduce his diagram as the only authority we have for the disposition of the
                    one short key.</p>
                <p>The extent of this scale is exactly Guido’s. Virdung’s diagram of the chromatic
                    is the same as our own familiar keyboard, and comprises three octaves and a
                    note, from F below the bass stave to G above the treble. But Virdung tells us
                    that even then clavichords were made longer than four octaves by repetition of
                    the same order of keys. The introduction of the chromatic order he attributes to
                    the study of Boetius, and the consequent endeavour to restore the three musical
                    <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> of the Greeks-—the diatonic, chromatic, and
                    enharmonic. But the last-named had not been attained. Virdung gives woodcuts of
                    the clavicordium, the virginal, the clavicimbalum, and the claviciterium. We
                    reproduce three of them (figs. 3, 6, and 12), omitting the virginal as obviously
                    incorrect. All these drawings have been continually repeated by writers on
                    musical instruments up to the present day, but without discerning that in the
                    printing they are reversed, which puts the keyboards entirely wrong, and that in
                    Luscinius’s Latin translation of Virdung <hi rend="italic">ÇMusurgia,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sive Praxis</hi><hi rend="italic">Musicae,</hi> Strasburg, 1536),
                    which has been hitherto chiefly followed, two of the engravings, the
                    clavicimbalum and the claviciterium, are transposed, another cause of error.
                    Martin Agricola <hi rend="italic">(Musica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Instrumentalis,</hi> Wittenberg, 1529) has copied Virdung’s illustrations with
                    some differences of perspective, and the addition, here and there, of errors of
                    his own.</p>
                <p>Still vulgarly known as monochord, Virdung’s clavichord was really a box of
                    monochords, all the strings being of the same length. He derives the clavichord
                    from Guido’s monochord as he does the virginal from the psaltery, but, at the
                    same time, confesses he does not know when, or by whom, either instrument was
                    invented. We observe in this drawing the short sound-board, which always
                    remained a clavichord peculiarity, and the straight soundboard
                    bridge—necessarily so when all the strings were of one length. To gain an angle
                    of striking place for the tangents against the strings the keys were made
                    crooked, an expedient further rendered necessary by the “fretting,”— three
                    tangents, according to Virdung, being directed to stop as many notes from each
                    single group of three strings tuned in unison; each tangent thus made a
                    different vibrating length of string. In the drawing the strings are merely
                    indicated. The German for fret is <hi rend="italic">Bund,</hi> and such a
                    clavichord, in that language, is known as a “gebunden” one, both fret (to rub)
                    and <hi rend="italic">Bund</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">binden,</hi> to bind)
                    having been taken over from the lute or viol. The French and Italians employ
                    “touche” and “tasto,” touch. Praetorius, who wrote a hundred years later than
                    Virdung, says two, three, and four tangents were thus employed in stopping. The
                    oldest clavichords extant have no more than two tangents to a note formed by a
                    pair of strings, no longer three. Thus seven pairs of strings suffice for an
                    octave of twelve keys, the open notes being F, G, A, B flat, C, D, E flat, and
                    by an unexplained peculiarity, perhaps derived from some special estimation of
                    the notes which was connected with the church modes, A and D are left throughout
                    free from a second tangent. A corresponding value of these notes is shown by
                    their independence of chromatic alteration in tuning the double Irish harp, as
                    explained by Galilei in his treatise on music, published in 1581. Adlung, who
                    died in 1762, speaks of another fretting, but we think it must have been an
                    adaptation to the modern major scale, the “free” notes being E and B.
                    Clavichords were made with double fretting up to about the year 1700,—that is to
                    say, to the epoch of J. S. Bach, who, taking advantage of its abolition and the
                    consequent use of independent pairs of strings for each note, was enabled to
                    tune in all keys equally, which had been impossible so long as the fretting was
                    maintained. The modern scales having become established, Bach was now able to
                    produce, in 1722, <hi rend="italic">Das wohltemperirte Clavier,</hi> the first
                    collection of preludes and fugues in all the twenty-four major .and minor scales
                    for a clavichord which was tuned, as to concordance and dissonance, fairly
                    equal.</p>
                <p>The oldest clavichord, here called manicordo (as French, <hi rend="italic"
                    >manicorde,</hi> from monochord), known to exist is that shown in fig. 4. It
                    will be observed that the lowest octave is here already “bundfrei” or fret-free.
                    The strings are no longer of equal length, and there are three bridges,
                    divisions of the one bridge, in different positions on the sound-board.
                    Mersenne’s “manicorde” <hi rend="italic">(Harmonie Universelle,</hi> 1636),
                    shown in an engraving in that work, has the strings still nearly of equal
                    length, but divides the sound-board bridge into five. The fretted clavichords
                    made in Germany in the last years of the 17th century have the curved
                    sound-board bridge, like a spinet. In the clavichord the tangents always form
                    the second bridge, indispensable for the vibration, as well as act as the sound
                    exciters (fig. 5). The common damper to all the strings is a list of cloth,
                    interwoven behind the tangents. As the tangents quitted the strings the cloth
                    immediately <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n76/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0076-0067"/> stopped vibration. Too much cloth would diminish
                    the tone of this already feeble instrument, which gained the name of “dumb
                    spinet” from its use. The cloth is accurately painted in the clavichord Rubens’s
                    St Cecilia (Dresden Gallery) plays upon,—interesting as perhaps representing
                    that painter’s own instrument. The number of keys there shown is three octaves
                    and a third, F to A, —the same extent as in Handel’s clavichord now in the
                    museum at Maidstone (an Italian instrument dated 1726, and not fretted), but
                    with a combined chromatic and short octave peculiarity in the lowest notes we
                    shall have to refer to when we arrive at the spinet; we pass it by as the only
                    instance in the clavichord we have met with. The clavichord must have gone out
                    of favour in Great Britain and the Netherlands early in the 16th century, before
                    its expressive power, which is of the most tender and intimate quality, could
                    have been, from the nature of the music played, observed,—the more brilliant and
                    elegant spinet being preferred to it. Like the other keyboard instruments it had
                    no German name, and can hardly have been of German origin. Holbein, in his
                    drawing of the family of Sir Thomas More, 1528, now at Basel, indicates the
                    place for “Klavikordi und ander Seytinspill.” But it remained longest in use in
                    Germany—until even the beginning of the present century. It was the favourite
                    “Klavier” of the Bachs. Besides that of Handel already noticed, there are in
                    existence clavichords the former possession of which is attributed to Mozart and
                    Beethoven. The clavichord was obedient to a peculiarity of touch possible on no
                    other keyboard instrument. This is described by C. P. Emmanuel Bach in his
                    famous essay on playing and accompaniment, entitled <hi rend="italic">Versuch
                    über</hi><hi rend="italic">die</hi><hi rend="italic">wahre</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    to play Keyboard Instruments). It is the “Bebung” (trembling), a vibration in a

                    employed by violin players to heighten the expressive effect; it was gained by a
                    repeated movement of the fleshy end of the finger while the key was still held
                    down. The “Bebung” was indicated in the notation by dots over the note to be
                    affected by it, perhaps showing how many times the note should be repeated.
                    According to the practice of the Bachs, as handed down to us in the above
                    mentioned essay, great smoothness of touch was required to play the clavichord
                    in tune. As with the monochord, the means taken to produce the sound disturbed
                    the accuracy of the string measurement by increasing tension, so that a key
                    touched too firmly in the clavichord, by unduly raising the string, sharpened
                    the pitch, an error in playing deprecated by C. P. Emmanuel Bach. This answers
                    the assertion which has been made that J. S. Bach could not have been nice about
                    tuning when he played from preference on an instrument of uncertain
                    intonation.</p>
                <p>The next instrument described by Virdung is the virginal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(virginalis,</hi> proper for a girl), a parallelogram in shape, with a
                    projecting keyboard and compass of keys the same as the clavichordium. Here we
                    can trace derivation from the psaltery in the sound-board covering the entire
                    inner surface of the instrument and in the triangular disposition of the
                    strings. The latter in Virdung’s drawing has an impossible position with
                    reference to the keyboard, which renders its reproduction as an illustration
                    useless. But in the next drawing, the clavicimbalum, this is rectified, and the
                    drawing, reversed on account of the key-board, can be accepted as roughly
                    representing the instrument so called (fig. 6).</p>
                <p>There would be no difference between it and the virginal were it not for a
                    peculiarity of keyboard compass, which emphatically refers itself to the Italian
                    “spinetta,” a name unnoticed by Virdung or by his countryman</p>
                <p>Arnold Schlick, who, in the same year 1511, published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spiegel</hi><hi rend="italic">der Orgelmacher</hi><hi rend="italic">(“</hi>
                    Organ-builders’ Mirror”), and named the clavichordium and clavicimbalum as
                    familiar instruments. In the first place, the keyboard, beginning apparently
                    with B natural, instead of F, makes the clavicimbalum smaller than the virginal,
                    the strings in this arrangement being shorter; in the next place it is almost
                    certain that the Italian spinet compass, beginning apparently upon a semitone,
                    is identical with a “short measure” or “short octave” organ compass, a very old
                    keyboard arrangement, by which the lowest note, representing B, really sounded
                    G, and C sharp in like manner A. The origin of this may be deduced from the
                    psaltery and many representations of the regal, and its object appears to have
                    been to obtain dominant basses for cadences,—harmonious closes haying early been
                    sought for as giving pleasure to the ear. We have found a hitherto unnoticed
                    authority for this practice in Mersenne, who, in 1636, expressly describes it as
                    occurring in his own spinet <hi rend="italic">(espinette).</hi> He says the
                    keyboards of the spinet and organ are the same. Now, in his Latin edition of the
                    same work he renders espinette by clavicimbalum. We read <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Harmonie Universelle,</hi> Paris, 1636, liv. 3, p. 107)—“Its longest string
                    [his spinet’s] is little more than a foot in length between the two bridges. It
                    has only thirty-one steps [“<hi rend="italic">marches</hi> ”] in its keyboard,
                    and as many strings over its sound-board [he now refers to the illustration], so
                    that there are five keys hidden on account of the perspective,—that is to say,
                    three naturals and two sharps <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic

                    forming two keys); but these sharps serve to go down to the third and fourth
                    below the first step, C <hi rend="italic">sol</hi> [tenor clef C], in order to
                    go as far as the third octave, for the eighteen principal steps make but an
                    eighteenth, that is to say, a fourth more than two octaves.” The note we call F
                    he, on his engraving, letters as C, indicating the pitch of a spinet of the
                    second size, which the one described is not. The third and fourth, reached by
                    his cut sharp, are consequently the lower E and D; or, to complete, as he says,
                    the third octave, the lowest note might be F, but for that he would want the
                    diatonic semitone B, which his spinet, according to his description, did not
                    possess.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Λir A. J. Ellis
                    <hi rend="italic">(History of Musical Pitch,</hi> p. 318) sees the B in
                    Mersenne’s outline diagram.</p></note> Mersenne’s statement sufficiently proves,
                    first, the use in spinets as well as in organs of what we now call “short
                    measure,” and, secondly, the intention of cut sharps at the lower end of the
                    keyboard to gain lower notes. He speaks of one string only to each note; unlike
                    the double and triple strung clavichord, those instruments, clavicimbalum,
                    spinet, or virginal, derived from the psaltery, could only present one string to
                    the mechanical plectrum which twanged it. As regards the kind of plectra
                    earliest used we have no evidence. The little crow-quill points, Scaliger, who
                    was born in 1484, ex-ρressly<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n77/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0077-0068"/> says were introduced when he was a boy. They
                    project from centred tongues in uprights of wood known as “jacks” (fig. 7),
                    which also carry the dampers. The quills, rising by the depression of the keys
                    in front, set the strings vibrating as they pass them, —springs at first of
                    steel, later of bristle, giving energy to the twang and governing their return.
                    Scaliger remembered the “harpichordum” and “clavicimbalum” being without those
                    quillpoints <hi rend="italic">(mucrones),</hi> and attributes the introduction
                    of the name “spinetta” to them (from <hi rend="italic">spina,</hi> a thorn). We
                    will leave harpichordum for the present, but the early identity of clavicimbalum
                    and spinetta is certainly proved. Scaliger’s etymology has remained unquestioned
                    until quite recently; it is due to Signor Ponsicchi of Florence to have
                    discovered another derivation. He has found in a rare book entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Conclusione</hi><hi rend="italic">nel suono dell</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">organo,</hi><hi rend="italic">di D. Adiano Banchieri</hi>
                    (Bologna, 1608), the following passage, which translated reads :—“Spinetta was
                    thus named from the inventor of that oblong form, who was one Maestro Giovanni
                    Spinetti, a Venetian; and I have seen one of those instruments, in the
                    possession of Francesco Stivori, organist of the magnificent community of
                    Montagnana, within which was this inscription— <hi rend="italic">Joannes
                    Spinetvs Venetvs fecit,</hi> A.D. 1503.” Scaliger’s and Banchieri’s statements
                    may be combined, as there is no discrepancy of dates, or we may rely upon
                    whichever seems to us to have the greater authority, always bearing in mind that
                    neither invalidates the other. The introduction of crow-quill points, and
                    adaptation to an oblong case of an instrument previously in a trapeze form, are
                    synchronous; but we must accept 1503 as a late date for one of Spinetti’s
                    instruments, seeing that the altered form had already become common, as shown by
                    Virdung, in another country as early as 1511. After this date there are frequent
                    references to spinets in public records and other documents, and we have
                    fortunately the instruments themselves to put in evidence, preserved in public
                    museums and in private collections. The oldest spinet we can point out is in the
                    Conservatoire, Paris. It is a pentagonal instrument made by Francesco di
                    Portalupis at Verona, 1523. The Milanese Rossi were famous spinet-makers, and
                    have been accredited <hi rend="italic">(La</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nobilita</hi><hi rend="italic">di Milano,</hi> 1595) with an improvement in the
                    form which we believe was the recessing of the keyboard, a feature which had
                    previously entirely projected; by the recessing a greater width was obtained for
                    the sound-board. The spinets by Annibalo Rosso at South Kensington, dated
                    respectively 1555 (fig. 8) and 1577, show this alteration, and may be compared
                    with the older and purer form of one, dated 1568, by Marco Jadra (also known as
                    Marco “dalle spinette,” or “dai cembali”). Besides the pentagonal spinet, there
                    was an heptagonal variety; they had neither covers nor stands, and were often
                    withdrawn from decorated cases when required for performance. In other
                    instances, as in the 1577 Rosso spinet, the case of the instrument itself was
                    richly adorned.</p>
                <p>The apparent compass of the keyboard in Italy generally exceeded four octaves by
                    a semitone, E to F; but we may regard the lowest natural key as usually C, and
                    the lowest sharp key as usually D, in these instruments, according to “short
                    measure.”</p>
                <p>The rectangular spinet, Virdung’s “virginal,” early assumed in Italy the fashion
                    of the large “casone” or wedding chests. The oldest we know of in this style,
                    and dated, is the fine specimen belonging to Μ. Terme which figures in <hi
                    rend="italic">L</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">A rt</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Décoratif</hi> (fig. 9). Virginal is not an Italian name; the rectangular
                    instrument in Italy is “spinetta ta vola.” In England, from Henry VII. to
                    Charles II., all quilled instruments <hi rend="italic">(stromenti di
                    penna),</hi> without distinction as to form, were known as virginals. It was a
                    common name, equivalent to the contemporary Italian <hi rend="italic"
                    >clavicordo</hi> and Flemish <hi rend="italic">clavisingel.</hi> From the
                    latter, by apocope, we arrive at the French <hi rend="italic">clavecin,—</hi>
                    the French <hi rend="italic">clavier,</hi> a keyboard, being in its turn adopted
                    by the Germans to denote any keyboard stringed instrument.</p>
                <p>Mersenne gives three sizes for spinets,—one 2£ feet wide, tuned to the octave of
                    the “ton de chapelle” (in his day a whole tone above the present English medium
                    pitch), one of 3 J feet, tuned to the fourth below, and one of 5 feet, tuned to
                    the octave below the first,—the last being therefore tuned in unison to the
                    chapel pitch. He says his own spinet was one of the smallest it was customary to
                    make, but from the lettering of the keys in hia drawing it would have been of
                    the second size, or the spinet tuned to the fourth. The octave spinet, of
                    trapeze form, was known in Italy as “ottavina” or “spinetta di serenata.” It had
                    a less compass of keys than the larger instrument, being apparently three and
                    two-third octaves, E to C,—which by the “short measure” would be four octaves, C
                    to C. We learn from Praetorius that these little spinets were placed upon the
                    larger ones in performance; their use was to heighten the brilliant effect. In
                    the· double rectangular clavisingel of the Netherlands, in which there was a
                    movable octave instrument, we recognize a similar intention. There is a
                    fine-spinet of this kind at Nuremberg. Praetorius, illustrates the Italian
                    spinet by a form known as the “spinetta traversa,” an approach towards the long
                    clavicembalo or harpsichord,—the tuning pins, being immediately over the
                    keyboard. This transposed spinet, more powerful than the old trapeze one, became
                    fashionable in England after the Restoration,—Haward, Keene, Slade, Player,
                    Baudin, the Hitchcocks, Mahoon, Haxby, the Harris family, and others having made
                    such “spinnets” during a period for which we have dates from 1668 to 1784.

                <p>The spinets of Keene and Player, made about 1700, have frequently two cut sharps
                    at the bass end of the keyboard<pb break="no"

                    realization at that time of the independence of each key in the chromatic scale,
                    may be taken when combined to explain.</p>
                <p>Hitherto such cut sharps have been assumed to be quarter tones, but enharmonic
                    intervals in the extreme bass can have no justification. From the tuning of
                    Handel’s Italian clavichord already mentioned, which has this peculiarity, we
                    are led to infer that the nearer halves of the two cut sharps were the chromatic
                    semitones, and the farther halves the lower thirds or fourths below what they
                    appeared to be. Thomas Hitchcock (for whom we have a date 1703 upon a spinet
                    jack in an instrument of older model with two cut sharps by Edward Blunt) and
                    his son John made a great advance in constructing spinets, giving them the wide
                    compass of five octaves, from G to G, with very fine keyboards in which the
                    sharps were inlaid with a slip of the ivory or ebony, as the case might be, of
                    the naturals. Their instruments, always numbered, and not dated as has been
                    sometimes supposed, became models for the contemporary and subsequent English
                    makers.</p>
                <p>We have now to ask what was the difference between Scaliger’s harpichordum and
                    his clavicymbal. Galilei, the father of the astronomer of that name <hi
                    rend="italic">{Dialogo</hi><hi rend="italic">della</hi><hi rend="italic">Musica
                    Antica e Moderna,</hi> Florence, 1581), says that the harpichord was so named
                    from having resembled an “arpa giacente,” a prostrate or “couched” harp,—proving
                    that the clavicymbal was at first the trapezeshaped spinet; and we should
                    therefore differentiate harpichord and clavicymbal as, in form, suggested by or
                    derived from the harp and psaltery, or from a “testa di porco” and an ordinary
                    trapeze psaltery. We are inclined to prefer the latter. The Latin name
                    “clavicymbalum,” having early been replaced by spinet and virginal, was in Italy
                    and France bestowed upon the long harpichord, and was continued as clavicembalo
                    (gravecembalo, or familiarly cembalo only) and clavecin. Much later, after the
                    restoration of the Stuarts, the first name was accepted and naturalized in
                    England as harpsichord, which we will define as the long quill instrument shaped
                    like a modern grand piano, and resembling a wing, from which it has gained the
                    German appellation “Flügel.” We can point out no long instrument of this kind so
                    old as the Roman cembalo at South Kensington (fig. 11). It was made by Geronimo
                    of Bologna in 1521, two years before the Paris Portalupis spinet. The outer case
                    is of finely tooled leather. It has a spinet compass of keyboard of nearly four
                    octaves, E to D. The natural keys are of boxwood, gracefully arcaded in front.
                    The keyboards of the Italian cembalo were afterwards carried out to the normal
                    four octaves. There is an existing example dating as early as 1526, with the
                    bass keys carried out in long measure. It is surprising to see with what steady
                    persistence the Italians adhered in making the instrument to their original
                    model. As late as the epoch of Cristofori, and in his 1722 cembalo at Florence,
                    we still find the independent outer case, the single keyboard, the two unisons,
                    neither of which could be dispensed with by using stops. The Italians have been
                    as conservative with their forms of spinet, and are to this day with their
                    organs. The startling “piano e forte” of 1598, brought to light from the records
                    of the house of D’Este, by Count Valdrighi of Modena, after much consideration
                    and a desire to find in it an anticipation of Cristofori’s subsequent invention
                    of the pianoforte, we are disposed to regard as an ordinary cembalo with power
                    to shift, by a stop, from two unisons (forte) to one string (piano), at that
                    time a Flemish practice, and most likely brought to Italy by one of the Flemish
                    musicians who founded the Italian school of composition. About the year 1600,
                    when accompaniment was invented for monody, large cembalos were made for the
                    orchestras to bring out the bass part—the performer standing to play. Such an
                    instrument was called “archicembalo,” a name also applied to a large cembalo,
                    made by Vito Trasuntino, a Venetian, in 1606, intended by thirty-one keys in
                    each of its four octaves—one hundred and twenty-five in all—to restore the three
                    genera of the ancient Greeks. How many attempts have been made before and since
                    Trasuntino to purify intonation in keyboard instruments by multiplying keys in
                    the octave? Simultaneously with Father Smith’s well-known experiment in the
                    Temple organ, London, there were divided keys in an Italian harpsichord to gain
                    a separate G sharp and A flat, and a separate D sharp and E flat.</p>
                <p>Double keyboards and stops in the long cembalo or harpsichord came into use in
                    the Netherlands early in the 16th century. We find them imported into England.

                <p>Now the second instrument may be explained, virginals meaning any quilled
                    instrument, as a double spinet, like that at Nuremberg by Martin Van der Beest,
                    the octave division being movable; but the first cannot be so explained; the
                    four stops can only belong to a harpsichord, and the two pair instrument to a
                    double-keyed one, one keyboard being over, and not by the side of the other.
                    Again from the inventory after the king’s death—</p>
                <p>“Two fair pair of new long Virginalis made harp-fashion of Cipres, with keys of
                    ivory, having the King’s Arms crowned and supported by his Grace’s beastes
                    within a garter gilt, standing over the keys.”</p>
                <p>Rimbault saw in this an upright instrument, and such a one was not then
                    impossible, Virdung’s claviciterium (fig. 12) being no more than a horizontal
                    harpsichord turned up upon its broad end, which a slight modification of the
                    action rendered facile, but if upright, the two fair pair of new long virginalis
                    would not have been “long ”—but high. We explain “harp-fashion” according to
                    Galilei’s “arpa giacente,” and are disposed to believe that we have here another
                    double keyboard harpsichord. We read in an inventory of the furniture of Warwick
                    Castle, 1584, “a faire paire of double virginalis,” and in the Hengrave
                    inventory, 1603, “one great payre of double virginalis.” Hans Ruckers, the great
                    clavisingel maker of Antwerp, lived then too late to have invented the double
                    keyboard and stops, evident adaptations from the organ, but we may not withhold
                    from him the credit of introducing the octave string, so long attributed to him,
                    which incorporated the octave spinet with the large instrument, to be henceforth
                    playable without the co-operation of another performer. It had been attached to
                    the bent or angle side of harpsichords, as shown in a modern instrument which
                    forms part of the famous Plantin Museum at Antwerp, and also in one by Hans
                    Ruckers himself, dated 1594, preserved in the Kunst und Gewerbe Museum, Berlin.
                    The double harpsichord by that maker at the Conservatoire, Paris, dated 1590,
                    which is four years earlier than the above, has the octave string. From that
                    date until the last harpsichord was made by Joseph Kirkman in 1798, scarcely an
                    instrument of the kind was made, except in Italy, without the octaves. Hans
                    Ruckers had two sons, Hans the younger, and Andries the elder, who followed and
                    rivalled him in skill and reputation. Another Andries, the son of the former,
                    appears to have done but little, at least for himself; but a nephew, Jan
                    Couchet, a grandson of old Hans Ruckers, continued the prestige of this
                    distinguished family, Huygens being a witness to the rare ability of Couchet.
                    All these men, and, in fact, all the clavisingel makers of Antwerp, belonged to
                    the artist’s guild of St Luke, the affiliation being recognized from the close
                    alliance at that time of the arts, the painter having often as much to do with
                    the musical instrument as the maker himself. The Ruckers harpsichords in the 18
                    th century were fetching such prices as Bologna lutes did in the 17 th or
                    Cremona violins do now. There are still many specimens existing in Belgium,
                    France, and England Handel had a Ruckers harpsichord, which may be the one long
                    sought for and lately discovered by Mr Julian Marshall in Windsor Castle; it
                    completes the number of sixty-three existing Ruckers instruments catalogued in
                    Grove’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> o∕ <hi rend="italic">Music and
                    Musicians.</hi></p>
                <p>After the Antwerp make declined, London became preeminent for harpsichords,—the
                    representative makers being Jacob Kirckmann and Burckhard Tschudi, pupils of a
                    Flemish master, one Tabel, who had settled in London, and whose business
                    Kirckmann continued through marriage with Tabel’s widow. Tschudi was of a noble
                    Swiss family belonging to the canton of Glarus. According to the custom with
                    foreign names obtaining at that time, by which Haendel became Handel, and
                    Schmidt Smith, Kirckmann dropped his final <hi rend="italic">n</hi> and Tschudi
                    became Shudi, but he resumed the full spelling in the facies of the splendid
                    harpsichords he made in 1766 for Frederick the Great, which are still preserved
                    in the New Palace, Potsdam. By these great makers the harpsichord became a
                    larger, heavier-strung, and more powerful instrument, and fancy stops were added
                    to vary the tone effects. To the three shifting registers of jacks of the octave
                    and first and second unisons were added the “lute,” the charm of which was due
                    to the favouring of high harmonics by plucking the strings close to the bridge,
                    and the “harp,” a surding or muting effect produced by impeding the vibration of
                    the strings by contact of small pieces of buff leather. Two-pedals were also
                    used, the left-hand one a combination of a unison and lute, rendered practicable
                    by first moving the “machine,” a sixth stop, with the left hand of the player;
                    the right-hand pedal was to raise a hinged portion of the top or cover and thus
                    gain some power of “swell” or crescendo, an invention of Roger Plenius, to whom
                    also the harp stop may be rightly attributed. This ingenious harpsichord maker
                    had been stimulated to gain these effects by the nascent pianoforte which, as we
                    shall find, he was the first to make in England. The first idea of pedals for
                    the harpsichord to act as stops appears to have been John Hayward’s (? Haward)
                    as early as 1676, as we learn from Mace’s <hi rend="italic">Musick’s
                    Monument.</hi> The French makers preferred a kind of knee-pedal arrangement
                    known as the “genouillère,” and sometimes a more complete muting by one long
                    strip of buff leather, the “sourdine.” As an improvement upon Plenius’s clumsy
                    swell, Shudi in 1769 patented the Venetian swell, a framing of louvres, like a
                    Venetian blind, which opened by the movement of the pedal, and, becoming in
                    England a favourite addition to harpsichords, was early transferred to the
                    organ, in which it replaced the rude “nag’s-head” swell. A French harpsichord
                    maker, Marius, whose name is remembered from a futile attempt to design a
                    pianoforte action, invented a folding harpsichord, the “clâvecin brisé,” by
                    which the instrument could be disposed of in a smaller space. One, which is
                    preserved at Berlin, probably formed part of the camp baggage of Frederick the
                    Great.</p>
                <p>It was formerly a custom with kings, princes, and nobles who were well-disposed
                    towards music to keep large collections of musical instruments,—not as now for
                    beauty of decoration, form, and colour, or historical associations, but for
                    actual playing purposes in the domestic and festive music of their courts. There
                    are records of their inventories, and it was to keep such a collection in
                    playing order that Prince Ferdinand dei Medici engaged a Paduan harpsichord
                    maker, Bartolommeo Cristofori, the man of genius who invented and produced the
                    pianoforte. We fortunately possess the record of this invention in a literary
                    form from a well-known writer, the Marchese Scipione Maffei; his. description
                    appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Giomale dei letterati dΙtalia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> y</hi><pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0080-0071"/> a publication conducted by Apostolo Zeno. The
                    date of Maffei’s paper was 1711. Rimbault reproduced it, with a technically
                    imperfect translation, in his <hi rend="italic">History of the Pianoforte.</hi>
                    We learn from it that in 1709 Cristofori had completed four “gravecembali col
                    piano e forte”—keyed-psalteries with soft and loud—three of them being of the
                    long or usual harpsichord form. A synonym in Italian for the original cembalo
                    (or psaltery) is “salterio,” and if it were struck with hammers it became a
                    “salterio tedesco” (the German <hi rend="italic">hackbrett,</hi> or chopping
                    board), the latter being the common dulcimer. Now the first notion of a
                    pianoforte is a dulcimer with keys, and we may perhaps not be wrong in supposing
                    that there had been many attempts and failures to put a keyboard to a dulcimer
                    or hammers to a harpsichord before Cristofori successfully solved the problem.
                    The sketch of his action in Maffei’s essay shows an incomplete stage in the
                    invention, although the kernel of it, the principle of escapement or the
                    controlled rebound of the hammer, is already there. He obtains it by a centred
                    lever <hi rend="italic">(linguetta mobile)</hi> or hopper, working, when the key
                    is depressed by the touch, in a small projection from the centred hammer butt.
                    The return, governed by a spring, must have been uncertain and incapable of
                    further regulating than could be obtained by modifying the strength of the
                    spring. Moreover, the hammer had each time to be raised the entire distance of
                    its fall. There are, however, two pianofortes by Cristofori in Florence, dated
                    respectively 1720 and 1726, which show a much improved, we may even say a
                    perfected, construction, for the whole of an essential piano movement is there.
                    The earlier instrument has undergone some restoration, but the 1726 one, which
                    is in the Kraus Museum, retains the original leather hammerheads. Both
                    instruments possess alike a contrivance for determining the radius of the
                    hopper, and both have been unexpectedly found to have the “check” (Ital. <hi
                    rend="italic">ρaramartello)</hi> which regulates the fall of the hammer
                    according to the strength of the blow which has impelled it to the strings.
                    After this discovery of the actual instruments of Cristofori, there can be no
                    longer doubt as to the attribution of the invention to him, in its initiation
                    and its practical completion with escapement and check. To Cristofori we are
                    indebted not only for the power of playing <hi rend="italic">piano</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">forte,</hi> but for the infinite variations of tone, or <hi
                    rend="italic">nuances,</hi> which render the instrument so delightful.</p>
                <p>But his problem was not solved by the devising of a working action; there was
                    much more to be done to instal the pianoforte as a new musical instrument. The
                    resonance, that most subtle and yet all-embracing factor, had been
                    experimentally developed to a certain perfection by many generations of spinet
                    and harpsichord makers, but the resistance structure had to be thought out
                    again. Thicker stringing, rendered indispensable to withstand even Cristofori’s
                    light hammers, demanded, in its turn, a stronger framing than the harpsichord
                    had needed. To make his structure firm, he considerably increased the strength
                    of the block which holds the tuning-pins, and, as he could not do so without
                    materially adding to its thickness, he adopted the bold expedient of inverting
                    it, driving his wrest-pins, harp-fashion, through it, so that tuning was
                    effected at their upper, while the wires were attached to their lower ends.</p>
                <p>Then to guarantee the security of the case he ran an independent string-block
                    round it of stouter wood than had been used in harpsichords, in which block the
                    hitch-pins were driven to hold the farther ends of the strings, which were
                    spaced at equal distances (unlike the harpsichord), the dampers lying between
                    the pairs of unisons.</p>
                <p>Cristofori died in 1731. He had pupils, but did not found a school of Italian
                    pianoforte making, perhaps from the peculiar Italian conservatism in musical
                    instruments we have already remarked upon.</p>

                    seen in Dresden one of Cristofori’s pianofortes, Silbermann appears to have
                    taken up the new instrument, and in 1726 to have manufactured two, which J. S.
                    Bach, according to his pupil Agricola, pronounced failures. The trebles were too
                    weak; the touch was too heavy. There has long been another version to this
                    story, viz., that Silbermann borrowed the idea of his action from a very simple
                    model contrived by a young musician named Schroeter, who had left it at the
                    electoral court in 1721, and, quitting Saxony to travel, had not afterwards
                    claimed it. It may be so; but Schroeter’s letter, printed in Mitzler’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliothek,</hi> dated 1738, is not supported by any other
                    evidence than the recent discovery of an altered German harpsichord, the hammer
                    action of which, in its simplicity, may have been taken from Schroeter’s
                    diagram, and would sufficiently account for the condemnation of Silbermann’s
                    earliest pianofortes if he had made use of it. In either case it is easy to
                    distinguish between the lines of Schroeter’s interesting communications (to
                    Mitzler and later to Marpurg) the bitter disappointment he felt in being left
                    out of the practical development of so important an instrument.</p>
                <p>But, whatever Silbermann’s first experiments were based upon, it has been made
                    certain by the personal investigations of the present writer that he, when
                    successful, adopted Cristofori’s pianoforte without further alteration than the
                    compass and colour of the keys, and the style of joinery of the case. In the
                    Silbermann grand pianofortes, in the three palaces at Potsdam, known to have
                    been Frederick the Great’s, and to have been acquired by that monarch prior to
                    J. S. Bach’s visit to him in 1747, we find the Cristofori framing, stringing,
                    inverted wrest-plank, and action complete. Fig. 15 represents the instrument on
                    which J. S. Bach palyed in the Town Palace, Potsdam.</p>

                <p>Mahillon of Brussels has acquired a Frederici “upright grand” piano, dated 1745,
                    and contributes a diagram of the simple action (fig. 16). In Frederici’s upright
                    grand action we have not to do with the ideas of either Cristofori or Schroeter;
                    the movement is practically identical with the hammer action of a German clock,
                    and has its counterpart in a piano at Nuremberg, a fact which needs further
                    elucidation. We note here the earliest example of the leather hinge afterwards
                    so common in piano actions, and only now going out of use. Where are we to look
                    for Schroeter’s copyist, if not found in Silbermann, Frederici, or, as we shall
                    presently see, perhaps Wagner? It might be in the harpsichord we have mentioned,
                    which, made in 1712 by one Brock for the elector of Hanover (afterwards George
                    I. of England), was by him presented to the Protestant pastor of Schulenberg
                    near Hanover, and has since been rudely altered into a pianoforte (fig. 17).
                    There is an altered harpsichord in the museum at Basel which appears to have
                    been no more successful. But an attempted combination of harpsichord and
                    pianoforte appears as a very early intention. The English poet Mason, the friend
                    of Gray, bought such an instrument at Hamburg in 1755, with “the cleverest
                    inechan ism imaginable.”</p>
                <p>It was only under date of 1763 that Schroeter published for the first time a
                    diagram of his proposed invention, designed more than forty years before. It
                    appeared in Marpurg ’ s <hi rend="italic">Kritische Briefe</hi> (Berlin, 1764).
                    Now, immediately after, Johann Zumpe, a German in London who had been one of
                    Shudi’s workmen, invented or introduced (for there is some tradition that Mason
                    had to do with the invention of it<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Mason really invented the “celestina,” as we know from the
                    correspondence of Mary Granville. Under date of the 11th January 1775 she
                    describes this invention or improvement of the poet as a short harpsichord in
                    form, 2 feet long, but played with the right hand only. The left hand controlled
                    a kind of violin-bow, which produced a charming <hi rend="italic"
                    >sostinente,</hi> in character of tone between the violin tone and that of
                    musical glasses. Mason played upon it with great expression.</p></note>) a
                    square piano, which was to become the most popular domestic instrument. Burney
                    tells us all about Zumpe; and his instruments, still existing, fix the date of
                    the first at about 1765. In his simple “old man’s head” action, we have the
                    nearest approach to a realization of Schroeter’s simple idea. It will be
                    observed that Schroeter’s damper would stop all vibration at once. This defect
                    is overcome by Zumpe’s “mopstick” damper.</p>
                <p>Another piano action had, however, come into use about that time or even earlier
                    in Germany. The discovery of it in the simplest form is to be attributed to Μ.
                    Mahillon, who has found it in a square piano belonging to Μ. Henri Gosselin,
                    painter, of Brussels. The principle of this action is that which was later
                    perfected by the addition of a good escapement by Stein of Augsburg, and was
                    again later experimented upon by Sebastian Erard. Its origin is perhaps due to
                    the contrivance of a piano action that should suit the shallow clavichord and
                    permit of its transformation into a square piano; a transformation, Schroeter
                    tells us, had been going on when he wrote his complaint. It will be observed
                    that the hammer is, as compared with other actions, reversed, and the axis rises
                    with the key, necessitating a fixed means for raising the hammer, in this action
                    effected by a rail against which the hammer is jerked up. It was Stein’s merit
                    to graft the hopper principle upon this simple action; and Mozart’s <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n82/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0082-0073"/> approbation of the invention, when he met with it
                    at Augsburg in 1777, is expressed in a well-known letter addressed to his
                    mother. No more “blocking” of the hammer, •destroying all vibration, was
                    henceforth to vex his mind.</p>
                <p>He had found the instrument that for the rest of his short life replaced the
                    harpsichord. Μ. Mahillon has secured for his museum the only Johann Andreas
                    Stein piano which is known to remain. It is from Augsburg, dated 17 80, and has
                    Stein’s escapement action, two unisons, and the knee pedal, then and later
                    common in Germany.</p>
                <p>Mozart’s own grand piano, preserved at Salzburg, and the two grand pianos (the
                    latest dated 1790) by Huhn of Berlin, preserved at Berlin and Charlottenburg,
                    because they had belonged to the Prussian Queen Louise, follow •Stein in all
                    particulars. These instruments have three •unisons upwards, and the muting
                    movement known as <hi rend="italic">•celeste,</hi> which no doubt Stein had
                    also. The wrest-plank is not inverted; nor is there any imitation of Cristofori.
                    We may regard Stein, coming after the Seven Years’ War which had devastated
                    Saxony, as the German reinventor •of the grand piano. Stein’s instrument was
                    accepted as a model, as we have seen, in Berlin as well as Vienna, to which
                    •city his business was transferred in 1794 by his daughter Nanette, known as an
                    accomplished pianist and friend of Beethoven, who at that time used Stein’s
                    pianos. She had her brother in the business with her, and had already, in 1793,
                    married J. A. Streicher, a pianist from Stuttgart, and •distinguished as a
                    personal friend of Schiller. In 1802, the brother and sister dissolving
                    partnership, Streicher began himself to take his full share of the work, and on
                    Stein’s lines improved the Viennese instrument, so popular for many years and
                    famous for its lightness of touch, which contributed to the special character of
                    the Viennese school •of pianoforte playing. The firm of Streicher still exists
                    in Vienna; but since 1862, when Steinway’s example caused a complete revolution
                    in German and Austrian pianomaking, the old wooden cheap grand piano has died
                    out. We will quit the early German piano with an illustration (fig. 22) of an
                    early square piano action in an instrument made by Johann Gottlob Wagner of
                    Dresden in 1783. This interesting discovery of Μ. Mahillon’s introduces us to a
                    rude imitation (in the principle) of Cristofori, and it appears to have no
                    relation whatever to the clock hammer notion seen in Frederici’s.</p>
                <p>Burney, who lived through the period of the displacement of the harpsichord by
                    the pianoforte, is the only authority we can refer to as to the introduction of
                    the latter instrument into England. He tells us,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Rees’s <hi rend="italic">New
                    Cyclopaedia,</hi> article “Harpsichord.”</p></note> in his gossiping way, that
                    the first hammer harpsichord that came to England was made by an English monk at
                    Rome, a</p>
                <p>Father Wood, for an English gentleman, Samuel Crisp of Chesington; the tone of
                    this instrument was superior to that produced by quills, with the added power of
                    the shades of <hi rend="italic">piano</hi> and <hi rend="italic">forte,</hi> so
                    that, although the touch and mechanism were so imperfect that nothing quick
                    could be executed upon it, yet in a slow movement like the Dead March in Saul it
                    excited wonder and delight. Fulke Greville afterwards bought this instrument for
                    100 guineas, and it remained unique in England for several years, until Plenius,
                    the inventor of the lyrichord, mâde a pianoforte in imitation of it. In this
                    instrument the touch was better, but the tone was inferior. We have no date for
                    Father Wood. Plenius produced his lyrichord, a <hi rend="italic">sostinente</hi>
                    harpsichord, in 1745. When Mason imported a pianoforte in 1755, Fulke Greville’s
                    could have been no longer unique. The Italian origin of Father Wood’s piano
                    points to a copy of Cristofori, but the description of its capabilities in no
                    way supports this supposition, unless we adopt the very possible theory that the
                    instrument had arrived out of order and there was no one in London who could put
                    it right, or would perhaps divine that it was wrong. Burney further tells us
                    that the arrival in London of J. C. Bach in 1759 was the motive for several of
                    the second-rate harpsichord makers trying to make pianofortes, but with no
                    particular success. Of these Americus Backers, said to be a Dutchman, appears to
                    have gained the first place. He was afterwards the inventor of the so-called
                    English action, and, as this action is based upon Cristofori’s, we may suppose
                    he at first followed Silbermann in copying the original inventor. There is an
                    old play-bill of Covent Garden in Messrs Broadwood’s possession, dated the 16th
                    May 1767, which has the following announcement :—</p>
                <p>“End of Act 1. Miss <hi rend="smallcaps">Brickler</hi> will sing a favourite song
                    from <hi rend="smallcaps">Judith,</hi> accompanied by Mr <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Dibdin,</hi> on a new instrument call’d <hi rend="smallcaps">Piano
                    Forte.’’</hi></p>
                <p>The mind at once reverts to Backers as the probable maker of this novelty. Be
                    that as it may, between 1772 and 1776, the year of his death, he produced the
                    action continued in the direct principle to this day by the firm of Broadwood,
                    or with a reversed lever and hammer-butt introduced by the firm of Collard in
                    1835.</p>
                <p>The escapement lever is suggested by Cristofori’s first action, to which Backers
                    has added a contrivance for regulating it by means of a button and screw. The
                    check is from Cristofori’s second action. No more durable action has been
                    constructed, and it has always been found equal, whether made in England or
                    abroad, to the demands of the most advanced virtuosi. John Broad wood and Robert
                    Stodart were friends, Stodart having been Broadwood’s pupil; and they were the
                    assistants of Backers in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n83/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0083-0074"/> installation of his invention. On his death-bed
                    he com mended it to Broadwood’s care, but Stodart appears to have been the first
                    to advance it,—Broadwood being probably held back by his partnership with his
                    brother-in-law, the son of Shudi, in the harpsichord business. (The elder Shudi
                    had died in 1773.) Stodart soon made a considerable reputation with his “grand”
                    pianofortes, a designation he was the first to give them. In Stodart’s grand
                    piano we first find an adaptation from the lyrichord of Plenius, of steel arches
                    between the wrest-plank and bellyrail, bridging the gap up which the hammers
                    rise, in itself an important cause of weakness. These are not found in any
                    contemporary German instruments, but may have been part of Backers’s. Imitation
                    of the harpsichord by “octaving” was at this time an object with piano makers.
                    Zumpe’s small square piano had met with great success; he was soon enabled to
                    retire, and his imitators, who were legion, continued his model with its hand
                    stops for the dampers and sourdine, with little change but that which
                    straightened the keys from the divergences inherited from the clavichord. John
                    Broadwood took this domestic instrument first in hand to improve it, and in the
                    year 1780 succeeded in entirely reconstructing it. He transferred the
                    wrest-plank and pins from the right-hand side, as in the clavichord, to the back
                    of the case, an improvement universally adopted after his patent, taken out in
                    1783, expired. In this patent we first find the damper and piano pedals, since
                    universally accepted, but at first in the grand pianofortes only. Zumpe’s action
                    remaining with an altered damper, another inventor, John Geib, about this time
                    patented the hopper with two separate escapements, one of which soon became
                    adopted in the grasshopper of the square piano, it is believed by Geib himself;
                    and Petzold, a Paris maker, appears to have taken later to the escapement
                    effected upon the key. We may mention here that the square piano was developed
                    and continued in England until about the year 1860, when it went out of
                    fashion.</p>
                <p>To return to John Broad wood,—having launched his reconstructed square piano, he
                    next turned his attention to the grand piano to continue the improvement of it
                    from, the point where Packers had left it. The grand piano was in framing and
                    resonance entirely on the harpsichord principle, the sound-board bridge being
                    still continued in one undivided length. The strings, which were of brass wire
                    in the bass, descended in notes of three unisons to the lowest note of the
                    scale. Tension was left to chance, and a reasonable striking line or place for
                    the hammers was not thought of. Theory requires that the notes of octaves should
                    be multiples in the ratio of 1 to 2, by which, taking the treble clef C at one
                    foot, the lowest F of the five-octave scale would require a vibrating length
                    between the bridges of 12 feet. As only half this length could be conveniently
                    afforded, we see at once a reason for the above-mentioned deficiencies. Only the
                    three octaves of the treble, which had lengths practically ideal, could be
                    tolerably adjusted. Then the striking-line, which should be at an eighth or not
                    less than a ninth or tenth of the vibrating length, and had never been cared for
                    in the harpsichord, was in the lowest two octaves out of all proportion, with
                    corresponding disadvantage to the tone. John Broadwood did not venture alone
                    upon the path towards rectifying these faults. He called in the aid of professed
                    men of science—Cavallo, who in 1788 published his calculations of the tension,
                    and Dr Gray, of the British Museum. The problem was solved by dividing the
                    sound-board bridge, the lower half of which was advanced to carry the bass
                    strings, which were still of brass. The first attempts to equalize the tension
                    and improve the striking-place were here set forth, to the great advantage of
                    the instrument, which in its wooden construction might now be considered
                    complete. The greatest pianists of that epoch, except Mozart and Beethoven, were
                    assembled in London,—Clementi, who first gave the pianoforte its own character,
                    raising it from being a mere variety of the harpsichord, his pupils Cramer and
                    for a time Hummel, later on John Field, and also the brilliant virtuosi Dussek
                    and Steibelt. To please Dussek, Broadwood in 1791 carried his five-octave, F to
                    F, keyboard, by adding keys upwards, to five and a half octaves, F to C. In 1794
                    the additional bass half octave to C, which Shudi had first introduced in his
                    double harpsichords, was given to the piano. Steibelt, while in England,
                    instituted the familiar signs for the employment of the pedals, which owes its
                    charm to excitement of the imagination instigated by power over an acoustical
                    phenomenon, the sympathetic vibration of the strings. In 1799 Clementi founded a
                    pianoforte manufactory, to be subsequently developed and carried on by Messrs
                    Collard.</p>
                <p>The first square piano made in France is said to have been constructed in 1776 by
                    Sebastian Erard, a young Alsatian. In 1786 he came to England, and founded the
                    London manufactory of harps and pianofortes bearing his name. That eminent
                    mechanician and inventor is said to have at first adopted for his pianos the
                    English models. However, in 1794 and 1801, as is shown by his patents, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n84/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0084-0075"/> he was certainly engaged upon the elementary
                    action described as appertaining to Μ. Gosselin’s piano, of probably German
                    origin. In his long-continued labour of inventing and constructing a double
                    escapement action, Erard appears to have sought to combine the English power of
                    gradation of tone with the German lightness of touch. He took out his first
                    patent for a “repetition” action in 1808, claiming for it “the power of giving
                    repeated strokes without missing or failure, by very small angular motions of
                    the key itself.” He did not, however, succeed in producing his famous
                    repetition, or double escapement action until 1821; it was then patented by his
                    nephew Pierre Erard, who, when the patent expired in England in 1835, proved a
                    loss from the difficulties of carrying out the invention, which induced the
                    House of Lords to grant an extension of the patent.</p>
                <p>Although some great pianists have been opposed to double escapement, notably
                    Kalkbrenner, Chopin, and Dr Hans von Bülow, Erard’s action, in its complete or a
                    . shortened form as introduced by Herz, is now more extensively used than at any
                    former period. Erard invented in</p>
                <p>1808 an upward bearing to the wrest-plank bridge, by means of agraffes or studs
                    of metal through holes in which the strings are made to pass, bearing against
                    the upper side. The wooden bridge with down-bearing strings is clearly not in
                    relation with upward-striking hammers, the tendency of which must be to raise
                    the strings from the bridge, to the detriment of the tone. A long brass bridge
                    on this principle was introduced by William Stodart in 1822. A pressure-bar
                    bearing of later introduction is claimed for the French maker, Μ. Bord, and is
                    very frequently employed, by German makers especially. The first to see the
                    importance of iron sharing with wood (ultimately almost supplanting it) in
                    pianoforte framing was a native of England and a civil engineer by profession,
                    John Isaac Hawkins, who has been best known as the inventor of the ever-pointed
                    pencil. He was living at Philadelphia, U.S., when he invented and first produced
                    the familiar cottage pianoforte—“portable grand” as he then called it. He
                    patented it in America, nis father, Isaac Hawkins, taking out the patent for him
                    in England in the same year, 1800. It will be observed that the illustration
                    here given (fig. 28) represents a wreck; but a draughtsman’s restoration might
                    be open to question.</p>
                <p>There had been upright grand pianos as well as upright harpsichords, the
                    horizontal instrument being turned up upon its wider end and a keyboard and
                    action adapted to it. William Southwell, an Irish pianomaker, had, in 1798,
                    tried a similar experiment with a square piano, to be repeated in later years by
                    W. F. Collard of London; but Hawkins was the first to make a piano, or pianino,
                    with the strings descending to the floor, the keyboard being raised, and this,
                    although at the moment the chief, was not his only merit. He anticipated nearly
                    every discovery that has since been introduced as novel. His instrument is in a
                    complete iron frame, independent of the case; and in this frame, strengthened by
                    a system of iron resistance rods combined with an iron upper bridge, his
                    sound-board is entirely suspended. An apparatus for tuning by mechanical screws
                    regulates the tension of the strings, which are of equal length throughout. The
                    action, in metal supports, anticipates Wornum’s in the checking, and still later
                    ideas in a contrivance for repetition. This remarkable bundle of inventions was
                    brought to London and exhibited by Hawkins himself, but the instrument being
                    poor in the tone failed to bring him pecuniary reward or the credit he deserved.
                    Southwell appears to have been one of the first to profit by Hawkins’s ideas by
                    bringing out the high cabinet pianoforte, with hinged sticker action, in 1807.
                    All that he could, however, patent in it was the simple damper action, turning
                    on a pivot to relieve the dampers from the strings, which is still frequently
                    used with such actions. The next steps for producing the lower or cottage
                    upright piano were taken by Robert Wornum, who in 1811 produced a diagonally and
                    in 1813 a vertically strung one. Wornum’s perfected crank action was not
                    complete until 1826, when it was patented for a cabinet piano; but it was not
                    really introduced until three years later, when Wornum applied it to his little
                    “piccolo.” The principle of this centred lever check action was introduced into
                    Paris by Pleyel<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pleyel

                    to Germany and America. In England it has now nearly superseded the once
                    favourite leather-hinged action.</p>
                <p>It was not, however, from Hawkins’s invention that iron became introduced as
                    essential to the structure of a pianoforte. This was due to William Allen, a
                    young Scotsman in the employ of the Stodarts. He devised a metal system of
                    framing intended primarily for compensation, but soon to become, in other hands,
                    a framing for resistance. His idea was to meet the divergence in tuning caused
                    in brass and iron strings by <pb break="no"

                    plates of the same metals, guaranteeing their stability by a cross batoning of
                    stout wooden bars and a metal bar across the wrest-plank. Allen, being simply a
                    tuner, had not the full practical knowledge for carrying out the idea. He had to
                    ally himself with Stodarts’ foreman, Thom; and Allen and Thom patented the
                    invention in January 1820. The firm of Stodart at once acquired the patent. We
                    have now arrived at an important epoch in pianoforte construction,— the
                    abolition, at least in England and France, of the wooden construction in favour
                    of a combined construction of iron and wood, the former material gradually
                    asserting preeminence. Allen’s design is shown in fig. 30. The long bars shown
                    in the diagram are really tubes fixed at one end only: those of iron lie over
                    the iron or steel wire, while those of brass lie over the brass wire, the metal
                    plates to which they are attached being in the same correspondence. At once a
                    great advance was made in the possibility of using heavier strings than could be
                    stretched before, without danger to the durability of the case and frame. The
                    next step was in 1821 to a fixed iron string-plate, the invention of one of
                    Broadwoods’ workmen, Samuel Hervé, which was in the first instance applied to
                    one of the square pianos of that firm. The great advantage in the fixed, plate
                    was a more even solid counterpoise to the drawing or tension of the strings and
                    the abolition of their undue length behind the bridge, a reduction which Isaac

                    unsuccessfully, to accomplish with a plate of wood. So generally was attention
                    now given to improved methods of resistance that it has not been found possible
                    to determine who first practically introduced those long iron or steel
                    resistance bars which are so familiar a feature in modern grand pianos. They
                    were experimented on as substitutes for the wooden bracing by Joseph Smith in
                    1798; but to James Broadwood belongs the credit of trying them first above the
                    sound-board in the treble part of the scale as long ago as 1808, and again in
                    1818; he did not succeed, however, in fixing them properly. The introduction of
                    fixed resistance bars is really due to observation of Allen’s compensating
                    tubes, which were, at the same time, resisting. Sebastian and Pierre Erard seem
                    to have been first in the field in 1823 with a complete system of nine
                    resistance bars from treble to bass, with a simple mode of fastening them
                    through the sound-board to the wooden beams beneath, but, although these bars
                    appear in their patent of 1824, which chiefly concerned their repetition action,
                    the Erards did not either in France or England claim them as of original
                    invention, nor is there any string-plate combined with them in their patent.
                    James Broad wood, by his patent of 1827, claimed the combination of string-plate
                    and resistance bars, which was clearly the completion of the wood and metal
                    instrument, differing from Allen’s in the nature of the resistance being fixed.
                    Broadwood, however, left the bass bars out, but added a fourth bar in the middle
                    to the three in the treble he had previously used. It must be borne in mind that
                    it was the trebles that gave way in the old wooden construction before the tenor
                    and bass of the instrument. But the weight of the stringing was always
                    increasing, and a heavy close overspinning of the bass strings had become
                    general. The resistance bars were increased to five, six, seven, eight, and, as
                    we have seen, even nine, according to the ideas of the different English and
                    French makers who used them in their pursuit of stability.</p>
                <p>The next important addition to the grand piano in order of time was the harmonic
                    bar of Pieιre Erard, introduced in 1838. This was a gun-metal bar of alternate
                    pressing and drawing power by means of screws which were tapped into the
                    wrest-plank immediately above the treble bearings; making that part of the
                    instrument nearly immovable, this favoured the production of higher harmonics to
                    the treble notes, recognized in what we commonly call “ring.” A similar bar,
                    subsequently extended by Broadwood across the entire wrest-plank, was to prevent
                    any tendency in the wrest-plank to rise, from the combined upward drawing of the
                    strings. A method of fastening the strings on the string-plate depending upon
                    friction, and thus dispensing with “eyes,” was a contribution of the Collards,
                    who had retained James Stewart, who had been in America with Chickering, and was
                    a man of considerable inventive power. This invention was introduced in 1827.
                    Between 1847 and 1849 Mr Henry Fowler Broad wood, son of James, and grandson of
                    John Broadwood, and also great grandson of Shudi (Tschudi), invented a grand
                    pianoforte to depend practically upon iron, in which, to avoid the conspicuous
                    inequalities caused by the breaking of the scale with resistance bars, there
                    should be no bar parallel to the strings except a bass bar, while another
                    flanged resistance bar, as an entirely novel feature, crossed over the strings
                    from the bass corner of the wrest-plank to a point upon the string-plate where
                    the greatest accumulation of tension strain was found.</p>
                <p>Mr Broadwood has not continued, without some compromise, this extreme
                    renunciation of ordinary resistance means. Since the Great Exhibition of 1851 he
                    has employed an ordinary straight bar in the middle of his concert grand scale,
                    his smaller grands having frequently two such as well as the long bass bar. From
                    1862 he has covered his wrest-plank with a thick plate of iron into <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n86/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0086-0077"/> which the tuning pins screw as well as into the
                    wood beneath, thus avoiding the crushing of the wood by the constant pressure of
                    the pin across the pull of the string, an ultimate source of danger to
                    durability.</p>
                <p>The introduction of iron into pianoforte structure has been differently and
                    independently effected in America, the fundamental idea there being a single
                    casting for the metal plate and bars, instead of forging or casting them in
                    separate pieces. Alphaeus Babcock was the pioneer to this kind of metal
                    construction. He also was bitten with the compensation notion, and had cast an
                    iron ring for a square piano in 1825, which is not said to have succeeded, but
                    gave the clew to a single casting resistance framing, which was successfully
                    accomplished by Conrad Meyer, in Philadelphia, in 1833, in a square piano which
                    still exists, and was shown in the Paris Exhibition of 1878. Meyer’s idea was
                    taken up and improved upon by Jonas Chickering of Boston, who applied it to the
                    grand piano as well as to the square, and brought the principle up to a high
                    degree of perfection,—establishing by it the independent construction of the
                    American pianoforte.</p>
                <p>We have now to do with over-or cross-stringing, by which the bass division of the
                    strings is made to cross over the tenor part of the scale in a single, double,
                    or treble disposition at diverging angles,—the object being in the first
                    instance to get longer bass strings than are attainable in a parallel scale, and
                    in the next to open out the scale and extend the area of bridge pressure on the
                    soundboard. In the 18th century clavichords were sometimes overstrung in the
                    lowest octave to get a clearer tone in that very indistinct part of the
                    instrument (strings tuned an octave higher being employed). The first suggestion
                    for the overstringing in the piano was made by the celebrated flute-player and
                    inventor Theobald Boehm, who carried it beyond theory in London, in 1831, by
                    employing a small firm located in Cheapside, Gerock &amp; Wolf, to make some
                    overstrung pianos for him. Boehm expected to gain in tone; Pape, an ingenious
                    mechanician in Paris, tried a like experiment to gain economy in dimensions, his
                    notion being to supply the best piano possible with the least outlay of means.
                    Tomkinson in London continued Pape’s model, but neither Boehm’s nor Pape’s took
                    permanent root. The Great Exhibition of 1851 contained a grand piano, made by
                    Lichtenthal of St Petersburg, overstrung in order to gain symmetry by two angle
                    sides to the case. It was regarded as a curiosity only. A few years later, in
                    1855, Henry Engelhard Steinway (originally Steinweg), who had emigrated from
                    Brunswick to New York in 1849, and had established the firm of Steinway à Sons
                    in 1853 in that city, effected the combination of an overstrung scale with the
                    American iron frame, which, exhibited in grand and square instruments shown in
                    London in the International Exhibition of 1862, excited the attention of
                    European pianoforte makers, leading ultimately to important results. The
                    Chickering firm claim to have anticipated the Steinways in this invention. They
                    assert that Jonas Chickering had begun a square piano on this combined system in
                    1853, but, he dying before it was completed, it was brought out later. It is
                    often difficult to adjudicate upon the claims of inventors, so rarely is an
                    invention the product of one man’s mind alone. However, the principle has been
                    taken up and generally adopted in America and Germany, and has found followers
                    elsewhere, not only in grand but in upright pianos, to the manufacture of which
                    it has given, and particularly in Germany, a powerful impetus. But, in spite of
                    this general recognition, the, overstringing, as at present effected, is
                    attended with grave disadvantages, in disturbing the balance of tone by
                    introducing thick, heavy basses, which, like . the modern pedal organs, bear no
                    just relation to that part of the keyboard where the part-writing lies. The
                    great increase also of tension which is held up as a gain, acts prejudicially
                    upon the durability of the instrument, as no artificial screwing up of the
                    sound-board can always preserve the ' elasticity of the fibres of the fir tree
                    <hi rend="italic">(Abies excels·</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi> in Europe, <hi
                    rend="italic">Abies alba</hi> in America) of which it is made. The remarkable
                    improvements in the drawing of the cast steel wire produced in Birmingham,
                    Vienna, and Nuremberg (this last initiated by Boehm) have rendered very high
                    tensions practicable. We believe they have been overstated in figures; it is
                    certain, however, that Broadwood’s seven-octave concert grands have a tension of
                    not less than sixteen tons when at the English orchestral pitch,—the notes of
                    the ideal lengths each drawing 450 tt&gt;. We have no such accurate statement to
                    offer of the American and German concert grands, but we regard Steinway’s as of
                    not less than twenty-two tons tension.</p>
                <p>Whatever of importance has been introduced in the structure of the pianoforte we
                    believe we have attributed to its legitimate inventor or to the manufacturer who
                    has placed it in the light of day. It would be impossible within reasonable
                    limits to chronicle the variations which have taken place in the barrings of
                    sound-boards on which their resonant structure depends, the disposition of
                    wooden beams or metal bars, the adaptation of mechanical action, or any of those
                    countless modifications upon which finally depends the individual character of
                    an instrument worthy to be presented and upheld as a work of art. There are many
                    names of first-rate pianoforte makers whose place has not been in this record,
                    simply because they have not ranked with the initiators or perfecters of
                    inventions that have been accepted as of paramount importance.</p>
                <p>The earliest keyboard instrument makers were to be found in monasteries or
                    collegiate foundations, and such lay help as may have been employed was at best
                    of the roughest kind. In the next epoch the artists’ guilds in cities absorbed
                    lay musical instrument makers, notably on account of the then universal practice
                    of making such instruments beautiful; and, indeed, we are indebted to this for
                    the preservation of many spinets and harpsichords in museums and private
                    collections. The full members of the craft-guilds<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n87/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0087-0078"/> were all masters who had terminated their
                    apprenticeships by producing complete instruments as “master-pieces,” made
                    according to the rules and to the satisfaction of the wardens or deacons of the
                    guilds. A trial of this kind lasted long in many crafts—for instance, in the
                    case of Scottish cabinetmakers’ indentures, an apprentice’s freedom was only
                    gained after the test production of an “essay” piece of work, duly authenticated
                    and admitted. Spinets and harpsichords were bound to bear the inscription of the
                    maker’s name, or to show his trade mark as a guarantee for honest workmanship.
                    The master’s sons and apprentices .were, in the master's workshops,
                    prol&gt;ationers of the guild and protected by it. Even in the 17th century we
                    hear little about journeymen, who, as the name implies, would be paid by the
                    day. But the extension of musical instrument workshops about the beginning of
                    the 18th century was one of the signs of the weakened power of the
                    guilds—particularly in Great Britain. In France it needed the Revolution to
                    entirely abolish them.</p>
                <p>Throughout the 18th century journeywork and apprenticeship were general. Wages,
                    compared with the cost of living, were meagre, and the day’s work, not
                    unfrequently extended by overtime, was a long one. The result was a slow
                    production. The English cabinetmakers, however, owing to disputes which at last
                    called for judicial interference, in the year 1788 brought out their book of
                    prices which was the foundation of the present piece-work system. Pianoforte
                    makers in course of time adopted this new departure with the result of quicker
                    work and higher wages, benefiting alike the master and man. The next industrial
                    revolution was inaugurated somewhere about 1815, by the introduction of
                    machinery to save manual labour, the division of which had already been
                    instituted, and by the use of steam. Machinery has, as yet, been extended to its
                    furthest limit in America, where labour-saving is relied upon as a powerful ally
                    against strikes, which are more frequently victorious in the New than in the Old
                    World. Simultaneously a dislike has arisen to apprenticeships; and even in
                    Germany, the traditional land of the apprentice, this mode of acquirement has
                    weakened.</p>
                <p>Turning to the commercial importance of the pianoforte, we find that we have to
                    face great difficulties in order to obtain anything like trustworthy
                    information. It is true official blue-books give yearly statements of exports
                    and imports, but as they do not separate the pianoforte from other musical
                    instruments an analysis is impossible. Personal inquiry again among pianoforte
                    makers brings but scattered information, partly from the natural inclination to
                    enhance business returns, and partly from an equally natural disinclination to
                    impart that which, if spoken of at all, should be confidential. From this dil
                    ∙nιma we fall back upon gleanings of intelligence either of our own gathering or
                    as afforded by the leading pianoforte trade organs in England and Germany—the
                    London <hi rend="italic">Music Trades Review</hi> and the Leipsic <hi
                    rend="italic">Zeitschrift für Instrumentenbau</hi><hi rend="italic">i</hi></p>
                <p>The chief centres of the pianoforte trade are London, Paris, Berlin, Leipsic,
                    Dresden, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Vienna, St Petersburg, Brussels, New York, Boston,
                    and Baltimore. The greatest centralizations are found in London and Paris,—very
                    few pianofortes being made in the United Kingdom or France, excepting perhaps at
                    Marseilles, out of those cities. But in Germany and the United States there are
                    pianoforte makers in many towns besides those we have named. Pianofortes are
                    made in Italy at Turin, Milan, Florence, Naples, and Palermo, and in Spain at
                    Barcelona (principally), Madrid, and Saragossa. The large export trade belonged
                    formerly to England and France, but it has been weakened of late years by the
                    commercial activity of the Germans, who have besides copied successfully and
                    with the advantage of much lower wages recent American models. German
                    pianofortes are now much found in Great Britain, where free trade has favoured
                    their introduction, and in the Australian colonies; they have also outrivailed
                    the French in Holland; but we believe France still keeps the trade of southern
                    Europe, as the United States mainly supply Canada. English exports of good
                    makers will be found all over the world; but some important markets have been
                    lost through the inferior instruments consigned or sold because they were cheap,
                    and were supposed to be good enough.</p>
                <p>The United States and Germany appear to employ the greatest number of workmen in
                    the pianoforte handicraft, Germany producing the largest numbers of instruments.
                    In adopting, however, the statistics given, we must not forget to take into
                    account that custom of advertising which leavens nearly every statement. There
                    are said to be upwards of 8000 workmen employed in pianomaking in America. The
                    Messrs Steinway claim for America an annual production of about 25,000
                    pianofortes of all kinds. We hardly feel disposed to allow Germany 73,000, with
                    a less number of workmen, viz., 7834; but such is the statement put forward, it
                    is said, by a semi-official source, the <hi rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Consulats-</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeitung.</hi> It must be borne in
                    mind that machinery adds its power indefinitely to the number of men employed,
                    but this occurs more in America than in Germany. A recent strike in Paris
                    represented the pianoforte trade society as consisting of 5000 members; and we
                    shall not be far out in crediting that city with a production of 20,000
                    instnιments yearly. The number made in London annually may be taken as reaching
                    at least 35,000.</p>
