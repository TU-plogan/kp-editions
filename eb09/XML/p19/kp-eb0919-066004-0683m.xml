                <p><label type="entry">PRECEDENCE</label>. This word in the sense in which it is
                    here employed means priority of place, or superiority of rank, in the
                    conventional system of arrangement under which the more eminent and dignified
                    orders of the community are classified on occasions of public ceremony and in
                    the intercourse of private life. In the United Kingdom there is no complete and
                    comprehensive code whereby the scheme of social gradation has been defined and
                    settled, once and for all, on a sure and lasting foundation. The principles and
                    rules at present controlling it have been formulated at different periods and
                    have been derived from various sources. The crown is the fountain of honour, and
                    it is its undoubted prerogative to confer on any of its subjects, in any part of
                    its dominions, such titles and distinctions and such rank and place as to it may
                    seem meet and convenient. Its discretion in this respect is altogether unbounded
                    at common law, and is limited in those cases only wherein it has been submitted
                    to restraint by Act of parliament. In the old time all questions of precedence
                    came in the ordinary course of things within the jurisdiction of the Court of
                    Chivalry, in which the lord high constable and earl marshal presided as judges,
                    and of which the kings of arms, heralds, and pursuivants were the assessors and
                    executive officers. When, however, points of unusual moment and magnitude
                    happened to be brought into controversy, they were occasionally considered and
                    decided by the sovereign in person, or by a special commission, or by the privy
                    council, or even by the parliament itself. But it was not until towards the
                    middle of the 16th century that precedence was made the subject of any
                    legislation in the proper meaning of the term.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In 1539 an Act “for the placing of the Lords in Parliament” (31 Hen. VIII. c. 10)
                    was passed at the instance of the king, and by it the relative rank of the
                    members of the royal family, of the great officers of state and the household,
                    and of the hierarchy and the peerage was definitely and definitively
                    ascertained.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir Bernard
                    Burke, Ulster king of arms, in his <hi rend="italic">Book of Precedence,</hi>
                    cites 1 Edw. VI. c. 7, an Act “for the Continuance of Actions after the death of
                    any king of this Realm,” as a statute bearing on precedence, since, he says, “it
                    enumerates the then names of dignity.” But, as the late Sir Charles Young,
                    Garter king of arms, has pointed out in one of his privately printed tracts, the
                    object of the Act was simply to prevent the abatement of suits under certain
                    circumstances, and the names of dignity therein enumerated are enumerated in
                    their wrong order. If the statute of Edward VI. had any effect on precedence,
                    dukes would precede the archbishops, barons the bishops, and knights the judges,
                    which they have never done, and which parliament could never have intended that
                    they should do.</p></note> In 1563 an Act “for declaring the authority of the
                    Lord Keeper of the Great Seal and the Lord Chancellor to be the same” (5 Eliz.
                    c. 18) also declared their precedence to be the same. In 1689 an <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0684-0661"/> Act “for enabling Lords Commissioners of the
                    Great Seal to execute the office of Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper” ( 1 Will,
                    and Mary c. 21) gave to the commissioners not being peers of the realm place
                    next to the speaker of the House of Commons and to the speaker place next to the
                    peers of the realm. In 1707 the Act of Union with Scotland (6 Anne c. 11)
                    provided that all peers of Scotland should be peers of Great Britain<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the parliamentary rights
                    of Scottish peers, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Peerage,</hi> vol. xviii. p.

                    degrees in England at the time of the Union and before all peers of Great
                    Britain of the like degrees created after the Union. In 1800 the Act of Union
                    with Ireland (39 and 40 Geo. III. c. 67) provided that the lords spiritual of
                    Ireland should have rank immediately after the lords spiritual of the same
                    degree in Great Britain, and that the lords temporal of Ireland should have rank
                    immediately after the lords temporal of the same degree in Great Britain at the
                    time of the Union, and further that “peerages of Ireland created after the Union
                    should have precedence with peerages of the United Kingdom created after the
                    Union according to the dates of their creation.” At different times too during
                    the current century several statutes have been passed for the reform and
                    extension of the judicial organization which have very materially affected the
                    precedence of the judges, more especially the Judicature Act of 1873 (36 and 37
                    Viet, c. 66), under which the lords justices of appeal and the justices of the
                    High Court now receive their appointments. But the statute of Henry VIII. “for
                    the placing of the Lords” still remains the only legislative measure in which it
                    has been attempted to deal directly and systematically with any large and
                    important section of the scale of general precedence; and the law, so far as it
                    relates to the ranking of the sovereign’s immediate kindred whether lineal or
                    collateral, the principal ministers of the crown and court, and both the
                    spiritual and temporal members of the House of Lords, is to all practical
                    intents and purposes what it was made by that statute nearly 350 years ago.
                    Where no Act of parliament applies, precedence is determined either by the will
                    and pleasure of the sovereign or by what is accepted as “ancient usage and
                    established custom.” Of the sovereign’s will and pleasure the appropriate method
                    of announcement is by warrant under the sign-manual, or letters patent under the
                    great seal. But, although the crown has at all periods very frequently conceded
                    special privileges of rank and place to particular persons, its interference
                    with the scale of general precedence has been rare and exceptional. In 1540 it
                    was provided by warrant from Henry VIII. that certain officers of the household
                    therein named should precede the secretaries of state when and if they were
                    under the degree of barons.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    letters patent, not without long and elaborate argument in the Star Chamber,
                    that baronets, then newly created, should be ranked after the younger sons of
                    viscounts and barons, and that a number of political and judicial functionaries
                    should be ranked between knights of the Garter and such knights bannerets as
                    should be made by the sovereign in person “under his Standard displayed in an
                    Army Royal in open war.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    commonly stated that the bannerets here referred to could be made by the prince
                    of Wales as well as by the king. But the privilege was conferred by James I. on
                    Henry, the then prince of Wales, only (Selden, <hi rend="italic">Titles of

                    later he further directed, also by letters patent, that the sons of baronets and
                    their wives and the daughters of baronets should be placed before the sons of
                    knights and their wives and the daughters of knights “of what degree or order

                    1620 the same king commanded by warrant “after solemn argument before his
                    Majesty” that the younger sons of earls should precede knights of the privy
                    council and knights of the Garter not being “barons or of a higher degree.”<note

                    (London, 1851).</p></note> If we add to these ordinances the provisions relating
                    to precedence contained in the statutes of several of the orders of knighthood
                    which since then have been instituted or reconstructed, we shall nearly, if not
                    quite, exhaust the catalogue of the interpositions of the sovereign with regard
                    to the rank and place of classes as distinguished from individuals. Of “ancient
                    usage and established custom” the records of the College of Arms furnish the
                    fullest and most trustworthy evidence. Among them in particular there is a
                    collection of early tables of precedence which were published by authority at
                    intervals from the end of the 14th to the end of the 15th century, and to which
                    peculiar weight has been attached by many successive generations of heralds. On
                    them, indeed, as illustrative of and supplementary to the action of parliament
                    and the crown, all subsequent tables of precedence have been in great measure
                    founded. The oldest is the “Order of All Estates of Nobles and Gentry,” prepared
                    apparently for the coronation of Henry IV. in 1399, under the supervision of
                    Ralph Nevill, earl of Westmoreland and earl marshal; and the next is the “Order
                    of All States of Worship and Gentry,” prepared, as announced in the heading, for
                    the coronation of Henry VI. in 1429, under the supervision of the lord protector
                    Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, and the earl marshal, John Mowbray, duke of
                    Norfolk. Two more are of the reign of Edward IV., and were severally issued by
                    John Tiptoft, earl of Worcester and lord high constable, in 1467, and by Anthony
                    Widvile, Earl Rivers and lord high constable, in 1479. The latest is commonly
                    and shortly known as the “Series Ordinum,” and was drawn up by a special
                    commission presided over by Jasper Tudor, duke of Bedford, it is presumed for
                    observance at the marriage of Henry VII. and Elizabeth of York in 1486. To these
                    may be added the “Order for the Placing of Lords and Ladies,” taken at a grand
                    entertainment given by command of Henry VIII. at the king’s manor-house of
                    Richmond in 1520 by Charles Somerset, earl of Worcester, lord chamberlain of the
                    household, to the French ambassador, Olivier de la Vernade, seigneur de la
                    Bâtie; the “Precedency of All Estates,” arranged in 1594 by the commissioners
                    for executing the office of earl marshal; and the “Roll of the King’s Majesty’s
                    most Royal Proceeding through London” from the Tower to Whitehall on the eve of
                    the coronation of James I., also arranged by the commissioners for executing the
                    office of earl marshal. On many isolated points, too, of more or less importance
                    special declaratory decisions have been from time to time propounded by the
                    earls marshal, their substitutes and deputies; for example, in 1594, when the
                    younger sons of dukes were placed before viscounts; in 1625, when the rank of
                    knights of the Bath and their wives was fixed; and in 1615 and 1677, when the
                    eldest sons of the younger sons of peers were placed before the eldest sons of
                    knights and of baronets. It is from these miscellaneous sources that the
                    precedence among others of all peeresses, the eldest sons and their wives and
                    the daughters of all peers, and the younger sons and their wives of all dukes,
                    marquesses, and earls is ascertained and established. And further, for the
                    purpose of proving continuity of practice and disposing of minor questions not
                    otherwise and more conclusively set at rest, the official programmes and

                    VIII. c. 10 that no person, “except only the King’s children,” shall have place
                    “at the side of the Cloth of Estate in the Parliament Chamber,” and that “the

                    Sister’s Sons” shall have place before all prelates, great officers of state,
                    and peers. Lord Chief Justice Coke was of opinion that the king’s nephew meant
                    the king’s grandson or <hi rend="italic">nepos</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{Institutes</hi> iv., cap. 77). But, as Mr Justice Blackstone says, “under the

                    having recourse to Sir Edward Coke’s interpretation of nephew” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Commentaries,</hi> i. ch. 4). Besides, if grandson is to be understood by
                    nephew, the king’s grandson would be placed after the king’s brother. The prince
                    of Wales is not specifically mentioned in the statute “for the placing of the
                    Lords”; but, as he is always, whether the son or the grandson of the sovereign,
                    the heir-apparent to the crown, he is ranked next to the sovereign or the
                    queen-consort. With the exception of the prince of Wales, all the male relations
                    of the sovereign are ranked first in the order of their degrees of consanguinity
                    with him or her, and secondly, in the order of their proximity to the succession
                    to the crown; thus the members of the several groups into which the royal family
                    is divided take precedence according to their own seniority and the seniority of

                    held by Thomas, Lord Cromwell, afterwards earl of Essex, together with that of
                    lord privy seal, and it was never conferred on any other person. By the Act of
                    Union with Ireland the archbishops of Ireland had place next to the archbishops
                    of England, and if consecrated before and not after the disestablishment of the
                    church in Ireland they retain this position under the Irish Church Act of 1869.
                    At the coronation of William IV. the lord chancellor of Ireland walked next
                    after the lord chancellor of Great Britain and before the lord president of the
                    council and lord privy seal. In Ireland, if he is a peer he has precedence
                    between the archbishops of Armagh and Dublin, and if he is not a peer after the
                    archbishop of Dublin. But, except in the House of Lords, the precedence of the
                    lord chancellor of Great Britain or the lord keeper of the great seal is the
                    same whether he is a peer or a commoner. The lord keeper has the same precedence
                    as the lord chancellor under 5 Eiiz. c. 18. But the last appointment to the lord
                    keepership was that of Sir Robert Henley, afterwards Lord Henley, lord
                    chancellor, and earl of Northington, in 1757, and the office is not likely to be
                    revived.</p></note> (10) lord high treasurer of Great Britain;<note

                    The lord high steward of England is not mentioned in the Act for the placing of
                    the Lords, “because it was intended,” Lord Chief Justice Coke says, “that when
                    the use of him should be necessary he should not endure longer than <hi
                    rend="italic">hacvice” {Inst,</hi> iv., 77). But it may be noted that, when his
                    office is called out of abeyance for coronations or trials by the House of
                    Lords, the lord high steward is the greatest of all the great officers of state
                    in England. The office of lord great chamberlain of England is hereditary, and
                    is held jointly during alternate reigns by the heads of the houses of Willoughby
                    de Eresby and Cholmondeley as representing co-heiresses of the Berties, dukes of
                    Ancaster, who derived it from an heiress of the De Veres, earls of Oxford, in
                    whose line it had descended from the reign of Henry I. By a private Act, 1 Geo.
                    I. c. 3, passed previous to the advancement of Robert Bertie, marquess of
                    Lindsey, to the dukedom of Ancaster in 1715, it was provided that the tenure of
                    the great chamberlainship should not give him and his heirs precedence of all
                    other dukes except when in the immediate discharge of the functions of the
                    office; and Sir Bernard Burke still restricts the precedence of the lord great
                    chamberlain to him “when in actual performance of official duty” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Book of Precedence,</hi> p. 10). But, as Sir Charles Young justly
                    contends, “the limitations of this statute (1 Geo. I. c. 3) failed on the death
                    of the last Duke of Ancaster in 1809 [he should have said “the last duke of
                    Ancaster, who held the great chamberlainship in 1779”], when the precedence of
                    the office of Great Chamberlain fell under the operation of the 31st of Henry
                    VIII.” <hi rend="italic">{Order of Precedence,</hi> p. 20). The office of lord
                    high constable of England is called out of abeyance for and pending coronations
                    only. The office of earl marshal is hereditary in the Howards, dukes of Norfolk,
                    premier dukes and, as earls of Arundel, premier earls of England, under a grant
                    in special tail male from Charles II. in 1672. The office of lord high admiral,
                    like the office of lord high treasurer, is practically extinct as a dignity.
                    Since the reign of Queen Anne there has been only one lord high admiral, namely,
                    William, duke of Clarence, afterwards William IV., for a few months in the
                    Canning administration of 1827. The office is executed by commission, the lords
                    of the admiralty being as destitute of any official precedence as the lords of
                    the treasury, although the first lord of the admiralty is invariably a leading
                    cabinet minister. The lord steward and the lord chamberlain of the household are
                    always peers, and have seldom been under the degree of earls. We may here remark
                    that both the Scottish and Irish Acts of Union make no reference to the
                    precedence of the great officers of state of Scotland and Ireland. Not to
                    mention the prince of Wales, who is by birth steward of Scotland, the earl of
                    Shrewsbury is hereditary great seneschal of Ireland, and the earl of Errol is
                    hereditary lord high constable of Scotland; but what places they are entitled to
                    in the scale of general precedence is altogether doubtful and uncertain. In
                    Ireland the great seneschal ranks after the lord chancellor if he is a commoner,
                    and after the archbishop of Dublin if the lord chancellor is a peer, and in both
                    cases before dukes (“Order of Precedence,” <hi rend="italic">Dublin
                    Gazette,</hi> 3d June 1843). Again, on George IV.’s visit to Edinburgh in 1821
                    the lord high constable had place as the first subject in Scotland immediately
                    after the members of the royal family. At every coronation from that of George
                    III. to that of Queen Victoria, the lord high constable of Scotland has been
                    placed next to the earl marshal of England, and, although no rank has been
                    assigned on these occasions to the hereditary great seneschal of Ireland, the
                    lord high constable of Ireland appointed for the ceremony has been at all or
                    most of them placed next to the lord high constable of Scotland. It is worthy of
                    notice, however, that Sir George Mackenzie, writing when lord advocate of
                    Scotland in the reign of Charles II., says that “the Constable and Marischal
                    take not place as Officers of the Crown but according to their creation as
                    Earls,” and he moreover expresses the opinion that “it seems very strange that
                    these who ride upon the King’s right and left hand when he returns from his
                    Parliaments and who guard the Parliament itself, and the Honours, should have no
                    precedency by their offices” <hi rend="italic">{Observations,</hi> &amp;c., p.

                    marquesses, and their younger sons before marquesses’ eldest sons. In the
                    “Ancient Tables of Precedence,” which we have already cited, dukes of the blood
                    royal are always ranked before other dukes, and in most of them their eldest
                    sons and in some of them their younger sons are placed in a corresponding order
                    of precedence. But in this connexion the words of the Act for the placing of the
                    Lords are perfectly plain and unambiguous: “All Dukes not aforementioned,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> all except only such <pb corresp="kp-eb0919-0686-0663"

                    king’s uncle, the king’s nephew, or the king’s brother’s or sister’s son,
                    “Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, and Barons, not having any of the offices
                    aforesaid, shall sit and be placed after their ancienty as it hath been
                    accustomed.” As Lord Chief Justice Coke and Mr Justice Blackstone observe, the
                    degrees of consanguinity with the sovereign to which precedence is given by 31
                    Hen. VIII. c. 10 are the same as those within which it was made high treason by
                    28 Hen. VIII. c. 18 for any man to contract marriage without the consent of the
                    king. Queen Victoria, by letters patent under the great seal in 1865, ordained
                    that, “besides the children of Sovereigns of these realms, the children of the
                    sons of any of the Sovereigns of Great Britain and Ireland shall have and at all
                    times hold and enjoy the style or attribute of ‘ Royal Highness ’ with their
                    titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their respective Christian
                    names, or with their other titles of honour.” But, notwithstanding this, their
                    rank and place are still governed by the Act for the placing of the Lords. Thus
                    the duke of Cambridge, although he is, as the son of a son of George HI.,
                    properly designated “Royal Highness” under the letters patent of 1865, has no
                    precedence as the first cousin of the sovereign under the statute of 1539. In
                    the same way the duke of Cumberland has no precedence as the first cousin once
                    removed of Queen Victoria, and being the grandson only of a son of George III.
                    would not be a “Royal Highness” at all if his father had not been, like his
                    grandfather, king of Hanover. In <hi rend="italic">Garter s Roll of the Lords
                    Spiritual and Temporal,</hi> the official list of the House of Lords, the duke
                    of Cambridge is entered before the archbishop of Canterbury, instead of in the
                    precedence of his dukedom after the duke of Leinster, while the duke of
                    Cumberland is entered in the precedence of his dukedom after the duke of
                    Northumberland. By the etiquette of society, however, both of them are regarded
                    and treated as royal dukes, and even in parliament they are always alluded to
                    not as “noble” but as “illustrious.” Under the combinedoperation of the Act for
                    the placing of the Lords and the Acts of Union with Scotland (art. 23) and with
                    Ireland (art. 4), peers of the same degrees, as dukes, marquesses, earls,
                    viscounts, and barons, severally, have precedence according to priority in the
                    creation of their respective peerages. But peerages of England created before
                    1707 precede peerages of Scotland created before 1707, peerages.of Great Britain
                    created between 1707 and 1801 precede peerages of Ireland created before 1801,
                    and peerages of Ireland created before 1801 precede peerages of the United
                    Kingdom and of Ireland created after 1801, which take precedence in common. The
                    relative precedence of the members of the House of Lords, including the
                    representative peers of Scotland and Ireland, is officially set forth in <hi

                    Parliament, convention, and all public meetings, and continued to be called
                    uninterruptedly with such alterations upon it as judgments of the Court of

                    necessary, with the omission of such dignities as became extinct and with the
                    addition from time to time of newly created peerages—down to the last sitting of

                    Common Pleas and the lord chief baron of the Exchequer (divisions of the High
                    Court of Justice). But under existing arrangements these offices have fallen
                    into abeyance, although they have not been formally abolished. The
                    vice-chancellors used to follow the lords justices of appeal; but, in spite of
                    the fact that there is still one vice-chancellor remaining, the office of
                    vice-chancellor is practically extinct and will altogether disappear on his
                    decease. In Ireland all these offices are in existence; but they have no
                    precedence allotted to them in England; as the judges holding them are
                    invariably privy councillors, however, they are ranked accordingly. And it is
                    the same with regard to the lord justicegeneral and the lord justice-clerk in

                    Baronets are not referred to in either the Scottish or the Irish Act of Union;
                    and Sir Bernard Burke contends that, since the Acts of Union are silent with

                    conferred on them. He therefore places the whole body of the baronets together

                    to them, are placed in the precedence of their fathers. Eldest sons of the
                    younger sons of peers were ranked before the eldest sons of knights by order of
                    the earl marshal, 18th March 1615, and before the eldest sons of baronets by
                    order of the earl marshal, 6th April 1677. But no precedence has been given to
                    the younger sons of the younger sons of peers, although precedence is given to
                    the younger as well as the eldest sons of baronets and knights by James I.’s
                    decree of 1616. Moreover, no precedence has been given to either the eldest or
                    the younger sons of the eldest sons of peers. But in practice this omission is
                    generally disregarded, and the children of the eldest sons of dukes, marquesses,
                    and earls, at all events, are accorded the same rank and titles which they would
                    have if their fathers were actual instead of <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> peers
                    of the degree next under that of their grandfathers. .Sir Charles Young says
                    that “by decision (Chap. Coll. Arms of 1680) if the eldest son of an Earl died
                    in his father’s lifetime leaving a son and heir, such son and heir during the
                    life of the Earl his grandfather is entitled to the same place and precedence as
                    was due to his father: so had the father been summoned to Parliament as the
                    eldest son of a peer the grandson would succeed to the dignity even during the
                    grandfather’s lifetime” <hi rend="italic">{Order of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Precedence,</hi> p. 27). And, of course, what applies to the grandson and heir
                    of an earl applies equally to the grandsons and heirs of dukes and marquesses.
                    But the grandsons and heirs of viscounts and barons are differently situated,
                    and have neither honorary additions to their names nor any ascertained place and
                    precedence even by the etiquette of society.</p></note> (61) companions of the

                    third class of the first three orders and the only members of the fourth order,
                    except the sovereign and the grand master. Sir Charles Young and Sir Bernard
                    Burke concur in placing the companions of these orders before the eldest sons of
                    the younger s&lt;Tns of peers, on the ground that under their statutes they are
                    entitled to precede “all Esquires of the Realm.” But the sons of peers
                    themselves—the eldest as Avell as the younger —are merely esquires, and are
                    ranked before, and not among, other esquires because they have a particular
                    precedence of their own assigned to them. Similarly the eldest sons of the
                    younger sons of peers and the eldest sons of baronets and of knights who are
                    also esquires, and likewise the younger sons of baronets and of knights who are
                    not esquires, have a particular precedence of their own assigned to them. All of
                    them are placed before esquires as a specific grade in the scale of general
                    precedence, and it seems clear enough that it is before esquires considered as a
                    specific grade that the companions of the orders ought to be placed and not
                    before any other persons who, whether they are or are not esquires, have a
                    definite and settled rank which is superior to that specific grade in the scale
                    of general precedence.</p></note> (62) esquires;<note anchored="true"

                    the following persons are esquires and ought to be so described in all legal
                    documents and processes; first, the eldest sons of peers in the lifetime of
                    their fathers, and the younger sons of peers both in and after the lifetime of
                    their fathers; secondly, the eldest sons of the younger sons of peers and their
                    eldest sons in perpetual succession, and the eldest sons of baronets and
                    knights; thirdly, esquires created with or without the grant of armorial
                    bearings by the sovereign; fourthly, justices of the peace, barristers at law,
                    and mayors of corporations; and fifthly, those who are styled esquires in
                    patents, commissions, or appointments to offices under the crown in the state,
                    the household, the army or navy, and elsewhere. Sir Bernard Burke accords
                    precedence to serjeants at law and masters in lunacy, not only before esquires
                    as such but also before the companions of the orders of knighthood. It is,
                    however, enough to observe with regard to the first, since no more of them are
                    to be created, that, in spite of the extravagant pretensions which have been
                    frequently urged, by them and on their behalf, “they have not in the general
                    scale, as Sir Charles Young says, “any precedence, and when under the degree of
                    a Knight rank only as Esquires,” and with regard to the second that the statute
                    8 and 9 Vict. c. 100, on which the Ulster king of arms bases their claims,
                    simply provides that they “shall take the same rank and precedence as the
                    masters in ordinary of the High Court of Chancery,” who are now extinct,
                    “apparently,” to recur to Sir Charles Young, “assuming the rank of the masters
                    without defining it.” “The masters, however,” he adds, “as such have not a
                    settled place in the order of general precedency emanating irom any authority by
                    statute or otherwise” <hi rend="italic">{Order of Precedence,</hi> p.1). Sir
                    William Blackstone says that before esquires “the Heralds rank all Colonels,

                <p>Attention to the foregoing tables will show that general precedence is of
                    different kinds as well as of several degrees. It is first either personal or
                    official, and secondly either substantive or derivative. Personal precedence
                    belongs to the royal family, the peerage, and certain specified classes of the
                    commonalty. Official precedence belongs to such of the dignitaries of the church
                    and such of the ministers of state and the household as have had rank and place
                    accorded to them by parliament or the crown, to the speaker of the House of
                    Commons, and to the members of the privy council and the judicature. Substantive
                    precedence, which may be either personal or official, belongs to all those whose
                    rank and place are enjoyed by them independently of their connexion with anybody
                    else, as by the archbishop of Canterbury, the lord high chancellor or the lord
                    great chamberlain, peers and peeresses, baronets, knights, and some esquires.
                    Derivative precedence, which can only be personal, belongs to all those whose
                    rank and place are determined by their consanguinity with or affinity to
                    somebody else, as the lineal and collateral relations of the sovereign, the
                    sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law of peers and peeresses in their own right,
                    and the wives, sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law of baronets, knights, and
                    some esquires. It is to be observed, however, that the precedence of the
                    sovereign is at once official and personal, and that the precedence of peeresses
                    by marriage is at once derivative and substantive. In the case of the sovereign
                    it is his or her actual tenure of the office of king or queen which regulates
                    the rank and place of the various members of the royal family, and in the case
                    of peeresses by marriage, although their rank and place are derivative in
                    origin, yet they are substantive in continuance, since during coverture and
                    widowhood peeresses by marriage are as much peeresses as peeresses in their own
                    right, and theii’ legal and political status is precisely the same as if they
                    had acquired it by creation or inheritance.</p>
                <p>Bearing the above definitions and explanations in mind, the following canons or
                    rules may be found practically useful.</p>
                <p>1. Anybody who is entitled to both personal and official precedence is to be
                    placed according to that which implies the higher rank. If, for example, a baron
                    and a baronet are both privy councillors, the precedence of the first is that of
                    a baron and the precedence of the second is that of a privy councillor. And
                    similarly, except as hereafter stated, with respect to the holders of two or
                    more personal or two or more official dignities.</p>
                <p>2. Save in the case of the sovereign, official rank can never supply the
                    foundation for derivative rank. Hence the official precedence of a husband or
                    father affords no indication of the personal precedence of his wife or children.
                    The wives aud children, for example, of the archbishop of Canterbury, the lord
                    high chancellor, or the speaker of the House of Commons do not participate in
                    their official rank but only in their personal rank whatever it may be.</p>
                <p>3. Among subjects men alone can convey derivative rank, except in the case of the
                    daughters and sisters of the sovereign, or of peeresses in their own right. But
                    no man can acquire any rank or place by maιτiage. The sons-in-law or
                    brothers-in-law of the sovereign and the husbands of peeresses in their own
                    right have as such no precedence whatever. And the daughter and heiress of the
                    premier duke of England, unless she happens to be also a peeress in her own
                    right, does not transmit any rank or place to her children.</p>
                <p>4. Within the limits of the peerage derivative rank is as a rule always merged in
                    personal, as distinguished from official, substantive rank. If, for example, the
                    younger son of a duke is created a baron or inherits a barony, his precedence
                    ceases to be that of a duke’s younger son and becomes that of a baron. But,
                    where the eldest son of a duke, a marquess, or an earl is summoned to the House
                    of Lords in a barony of his father’s, or succeeds as or is created a baron, he
                    is still, as before, “commonly called” by some superior title of peerage, as
                    marquess, earl, or viscount, and retains his derivative precedence on all
                    occasions, except in parliament or at ceremonies which he attends in his
                    character as a peer. The younger sons of all peers, however, who are created or
                    who inherit peerages—which they often do under special limitations—are
                    everywhere placed according to their substantive rank, no matter how inferior it
                    may be to thβir derivative rank. But if the son of a duke or a marquess, whether
                    eldest or younger, or the eldest son of an earl is consecrated a bishop his
                    derivative rank is not merged in his substantive rank, because it is official,
                    and his derivative and personal rank implies the higher precedence. Again, the
                    daughters of dukes, marquesses, and earls who become peeresses by marriage or
                    creation, or λvho inherit as peeresses, are placed according to their
                    substantive and not according to their derivative rank, although they may
                    thereby be assigned a far lower precedence than that to which their birth
                    entitles them.</p>
                <p>5. The widows of peers and baronets have precedence immediately before the wives
                    or widows of the next successors in their husbands’ dignities. But the sons and
                    daughters of peers and baronets have precedence immediately before the sons and
                    daughters of the holders of the dignities to whom their fathers succeeded. The
                    reason of this is that the first are senior in the dignities and the second are
                    nearer in the line of succession to them.</p>
                <p>6. The widows of peers who marry again either share the precedence of their
                    second husbands or resume the precedence belonging to them independently of
                    their marriage with their first husbands. Thus, if the daughter of a duke or an
                    esquire marries first an earl and secondly a baron, although she remains a
                    peeress, she is placed as a baroness instead of a countess. But if either of
                    them should marry a commoner as her second husband, whatever may be his rank or
                    degree, she ceases to be a peeress. While, however, the duke’s daughter, if her
                    second husband were not the eldest son of a duke, would resume her precedence as
                    the daughter of a duke, the esquire’s daughter would share the precedence of her
                    second husband, whether he were a peer’s son, a baronet, a knight, or an
                    esquire. By the etiquette of society, however, the widows of peers who marry
                    again do not forfeit the titles and precedence acquired by their marriage with
                    their first husbands unless they choose to lay them aside, or unless their own
                    rank or the rank of their second husbands is equal or superior to that of their
                    first husbands.</p>
                <p>7. The widows of the eldest and younger sons of dukes and marquesses and of the
                    eldest sons of earls, and also the widows of baronets and knights who marry
                    again, are permitted by the etiquette of society to keep the titles and rank
                    acquired by their first marriage if their second marriage is with a commoner
                    whose precedence is considerably lower. But the widows of the younger sons of
                    earls and of the eldest and younger sons of viscounts and barons, although their
                    precedence is higher than that of the widows of baronets and knights, are not
                    allowed to’retain it, under any circumstances, after a second marriage.</p>
                <p>8. Marriage does not affect the precedence of peeresses in their own right unless
                    their husbands are peers whose peerages are of a higher degree, or, being of the
                    same degree, are of more ancient creation than their own. If, for example, a
                    baroness in her own right marries a viscount she is placed and described as a
                    viscountess, or if she marries a baron whose barony is older than hers she is
                    placed in his precedence and described by his title. But if she marries a baron
                    whose barony is junior to hers she keeps her own precedence and title.</p>
                <p>9. The daughters of peers, of sons of peers, baronets, and knights retain after
                    marriage the precedence they derive from their fathers, unless they marry peers
                    of any rank or commoners of higher rank than their own. Hence, for example, the
                    daughter of a duke who marries the eldest son of a marquess is placed as a
                    duke’s daughter, not as the wife of a marquess’s eldest son, and the daughter of
                    a baronet who marries the younger son of a knight is placed as a baronet’s
                    daughter and not as the wife of a knight’s younger son.</p>
                <p>10. What are termed “titles of courtesy” are borne by all the sons and daughters
                    of peers and peeresses in their own right, who in this connexion stand on
                    exactly the same footing. The eldest sons of dukes, marquesses, and earls are
                    designated by the names of one or other of the inferior peerages of their
                    fathers, usually a mar-quessate or an earldom in the first, an earldom or a
                    viscounty in the second, and a viscounty or barony in the third case. But,
                    whatever it may be, it is altogether without effect on the rank and place of the
                    bearer, which are those belonging to him as the eldest son of his father. The
                    younger sons of dukes and marquesses are styled “lords” followed by both their
                    Christian names and surnames. The younger sons of earls and both the eldest and
                    the younger sons of viscounts and barons are described as “honourable” before
                    both their Christian names and surnames. The daughters of dukes, marquesses, and
                    earls are styled “ladies” before both their Christian names and surnames. The
                    daughters of viscounts and barons are described as “honourable” before both
                    their Christian names and surnames. If the eldest son of a marquess or an earl
                    marries a woman of rank equal or inferior to his own, she takes his title and
                    precedence; but if she is of superior rank she retains, with her own precedence,
                    the prefix “lady” before her Christian name followed by the name of her
                    husband’s title of courtesy. Again, if the younger son of a duke or a marquess
                    marries a woman of rank equal or inferior to his own, she is called “lady,” with
                    his Christian and surname following, and is placed in his precedence; but, if
                    she is of superior rank, she retains, with her own precedence, the prefix ‘ ‘
                    lady” before her Christian name and his surname. If the daughter of a duke, a
                    marquess, or an earl <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0689-0666"/> marries the younger son of an earl, the eldest or
                    younger son of a viscount or baron, a baronet, a knight, or an esquire, &amp;c.,
                    she retains, with her own precedence, the prefix “lady” before her Christian
                    name and her husband’s surname. If the daughter of a viscount marries the
                    younger son of an earl or anybody of inferior rank to him, or the daughter of a
                    baron marries the younger son of a viscount or anybody of inferior rank to him,
                    she retains her own precedence with the prefix “honourable” before the addition
                    “Mrs” and his surname or Christian name and surname. But, if her husband is a
                    baronet or a knight, she is called the Honourable Lady Smith or the Honourable
                    Lady Jones, as the case may be. The wives of the younger sons of earls and of
                    the eldest and younger sons of viscounts and barons, if they are of inferior
                    rank to their husbands, take their precedence and are described as the
                    Honourable Mι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> s, with the surnames or Christian
                    names and surnames of their husbands following. It was because the judges were
                    placed by James I. before the younger sons of viscounts and barons that they
                    were accorded the title of “honourable,” and that they are designated as the
                    Honourable Mr Justice Hawkins or the Honourable Mr Justice Stephen, instead of
                    as Sir Henry Hawkins or Sir James Stephen, which would connote their inferior
                    personal dignity of knighthood. But in this addition their wives do not
                    participate, since it is merely an official distinction.</p>
                <p>It is manifest on even a cursory examination of the tables we have given that,
                    although they embody the only scheme of general precedence, whether for men or
                    for women, which is authoritatively sanctioned or recognized, they are in many
                    respects very imperfectly fitted to meet the circumstances and requirements of
                    the present day. In both of them the limits prescribed to the royal family are
                    pedantically and inconveniently narrow, and stand out in striking contrast to
                    the wide and ample bounds through which the operation of the Royal Marriage Act
                    (12 Geo. III. c. 11) extends the disabilities but not the privileges of the
                    sovereign’s kindred. Otherwise the scale of general precedence for women
                    compares favourably enough with the scale of general precedence for men. If,
                    indeed, it includes the queen’s maids of honour and the wives of the companions
                    of the knightly orders, there certainly does not seem to be any good reason why
                    it should omit the mistress of the robes and the ladies of the bedchamber, or
                    the ladies of the royal order of Victoria and Albert and the imperial order of
                    the Crown of India. But these are trifling matters in themselves, and concern
                    only an extremely minute fraction of the community. The scale of general
                    precedence for men is now in substantially the same condition as that in which
                    it has been for between two and three centuries, and the political, to say
                    nothing of the social, arrangements to which it was framed to apply have in the
                    interval undergone an almost complete transformation. The consequence is that a
                    good deal of it has come down to us in the shape of a survival, and has ceased
                    to be of any practical use for the purpose it was originally designed to effect.
                    While it comprises several official and personal dignities which are virtually
                    obsolete and extinguished, it entirely omits the great majority of the members
                    of Government in its existing form, and whole sections of society on a less
                    exalted level, to whom it is universally felt that some rank and place at all
                    events are both in public and in private justly due.</p>
                <p>As we have already said, it accords no precedence whatever to the prime minister,
                    whether as premier or as first lord of the treasury. In the same way it ignores
                    not only the first lord of the admiralty but also the presidents of the Board of
                    Trade and the Local Government Board, the postmaster-general, the vice-president
                    of the council, and all the law officers of the crown.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“There are no doubt certain public
                    ceremonials of State, such as Coronations, Royal Public Funerals, and
                    Processions of the Sovereign to Parliament, &amp;c., wherein various public
                    functionaries walk and have for the occasion certain places assigned to them,
                    but which they may not at all times find the same, as it by no means follows
                    that they are always entitled to the same place for having been there once:
                    there is to a certain extent a precedent furnished thereby, and in some cases
                    the uniformity of precedence in regard to one class over another has in such
                    cases become established. This applies, for instance, to the places of the
                    Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber, Law Officers of the Crown, and Masters and Six
                    Clerks in Chancery, who have no definite or fixed place in the tables of

                    State ceremonials they have certain places assigned in the order of procession
                    in right of their offices, which, however, give them no general rank. Upon such
                    occasions, nevertheless, the legal rank and precedence which they hold in the
                    Courts of Law is observed, and so far establishes among themselves, and in
                    respect to their several classes, their precedency” (Sir Charles Young, <hi

                    when it does confess the presence of any of the sovereign’s principal ministers,
                    it commonly places them in positions which are out of all keeping with their
                    actual eminence and importance. It ranks the lord president of the council and
                    the lord privy seal before dukes, while it places the chancellor of the
                    exchequer after the younger sons of earls and the eldest sons of barons, and the
                    secretaries of state after the master of the horse and the vice-chamberlain of
                    the household. The lord chancellor still has precedence as the first of the
                    great officers of state, which was allotted to him not as what he is, the head
                    of the judicature·, but as what he once was, the prime minister of the
                    sovereign; and the lord chief justice, who is next to him in regular judicial
                    rank, as presiding over the Common Law Courts, as he presides over the Courts of
                    Equity, is placed after the chancellors of the exchequer and of the duchy of
                    Lancaster, who still have the precedence which was allotted to them not as
                    ministers, which they are, but as judges, which they are no longer. Neither the
                    lord lieutenant of Ireland, the viceroy of India, nor the governor-general of
                    Canada has any rank or place at St James’s, where, as well as at Westminster,
                    the lord steward or the lord chamberlain of the household is a much greater and
                    more splendid personage. Again, in the scale of general precedence there are no
                    clergymen except bishops, no lawyers except judges, and no officers of either
                    the army or the navy from field-marshals and admirals of the fleet downwards.
                    Nor, of course, are any colonial governors or lieutenant-governors entered on
                    it. It contains no mention of under-secretaries of state, chairmen or
                    commissioners of administrative boards, comptrollers or secretaries of
                    Government departments, lord lieutenants or sheriffs of counties, deputy
                    lieutenants or justices of the peace, members of the House of Commons, or
                    graduates of the universities. It is true that among some of these classes
                    definite systems of subordination are established by either authority or usage,
                    which are carefully observed and enforced in the particular areas and spheres to
                    which they have reference. But we have seldom any means of determining the
                    relative value of a given term in one series as compared with a given term in
                    another series, or of connecting the different steps in the scales of local,
                    professional, or academical precedence with the different steps in the scale of
                    general precedence, to which such scales of special precedence ought to be
                    contributory and supplementary. We know, for example, that major-generals and
                    rear-admirals are of equal rank, that with them are placed commissaries-general
                    and inspectors-general of hospitals and fleets, that in India along with
                    civilians of thirty-one years’ standing they immediately follow the
                    vice-chancellors of the Indian universities, and that in relation to the
                    consular service they immediately precede agents-general and consuls-general.
                    But there is nothing to aid us in determining whether in England they should be
                    ranked with, before, or after deans, queen’s counsel, or doctors in divinity,
                    who are as destitute as they are themselves of any recognized general
                    precedence, and who, as matters now stand, would certainly have to give place to
                    the younger sons of baronets and knights and the companions of the knightly
                    orders.</p>
