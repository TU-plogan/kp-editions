                <p><label type="entry">PITT, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label> (1759-1806),
                    the second son of William Pitt, earl of Chatham, and of Lady Hester Grenville,
                    daughter of Hester, Countess Temple, was born on the 28th of May 1759. The child
                    inherited a name which, at the time of his birth, was the most illustrious in
                    the civilized world, and was pronounced by every Englishman with pride, and by
                    every enemy of England with mingled admiration and terror. During the first year
                    of his life every month had its illuminations and bonfires, and every wind
                    brought some messenger charged with joyful tidings and hostile standards. In
                    Westphalia the English infantry won a great battle which arrested the armies of
                    Louis XV. in the midst of a career of conquest; Boscawen defeated one French
                    fleet on the coast of Portugal; Hawke put to flight another in the Bay of
                    Biscay; Johnson took Niagara; Amherst took Ticonderoga; Wolfe died by the most
                    enviable of deaths under the walls of Quebec; Clive destroyed a Dutch armament
                    in the Hooghly, and established the English supremacy in Bengal; Coote routed
                    Lally at Wandewash, and established the English supremacy in the Carnatic. The
                    nation, while loudly applauding the successful warriors, considered them all, on
                    sea and on land, in Europe, in America, and in Asia, merely as instruments which
                    received their direction from one superior mind. It was the great William Pitt,
                    the great commoner, who had vanquished the French marshals in Germany and French
                    admirals on the Atlantic,—who had conquered for his country one great empire on
                    the frozen shores of Ontario and another under the tropical sun near the mouths
                    of the Ganges. It was not in the nature of things that popularity such as he at
                    this time enjoyed should be permanent. That popularity had lost its gloss before
                    his children were old enough to understand that their father was a great man. He
                    was at length placed in situations in which neither his talents for
                    administration nor his talents for debate appeared to the best advantage. The
                    energy and decision which had eminently fitted him for the direction of war were
                    not needed in time of peace. The lofty and spirit-stirring eloquence which had
                    made him supreme in the House of Commons often fell dead on the House of Lords.
                    A cruel malady racked his joints, and left his joints only to fall on his nerves
                    and on his brain. During the closing years of his life he was odious to the
                    court, and yet was not on cordial terms with the great body of the Opposition.
                    Chatham was only the ruin of Pitt, but an awful and majestic ruin, not to be
                    contemplated by any man of sense and feeling without emotions resembling those
                    which are excited by the remains of the Parthenon and of the Colosseum. In one
                    respect the old statesman was eminently happy. Whatever might be the
                    vicissitudes of his public life, he never failed to find peace and love by his
                    own hearth. He loved all his children, and was loved by them; and of all his
                    children the one of whom he was fondest and proudest was his second son.</p>
                <p>The child’s genius and ambition displayed themselves with a rare and almost
                    unnatural precocity. At seven the interest which he took in grave subjects, the
                    ardour with which he pursued his studies, and the sense and vivacity of his
                    remarks on books and on events amazed his parents and instructors. One of his
                    sayings of this date was reported to his mother by his tutor. In August 1766,
                    when the world was agitated by the news that Mr Pitt had become earl of Chatham,
                    little William exclaimed, “I am glad that I am not the eldest son. I want to
                    speak in the House of Commons like papa.” A letter is extant in which Lady
                    Chatham, a woman of considerable abilities, remarked to her lord that their
                    younger son at twelve had left far behind him his elder brother, who was
                    fifteen. “The fineness,” she wrote, “of William’s mind makes him enjoy with the
                    greatest pleasure what would be above the reach of any other creature of his
                    small age.” At fourteen the lad was in intellect a man. Hayley, who met him at
                    Lyme in the summer of 1773, was astonished, delighted, and somewhat overawed, by
                    hearing wit and wisdom from so young a mouth. The poet, indeed, was afterwards
                    sorry that his shyness had prevented him from submitting the plan of an
                    extensive literary work, which he was then meditating, to the judgment of this
                    extraordinary boy. The boy, indeed, had already written a tragedy, bad, of
                    course, but not worse than the tragedies of his friend. This piece is still
                    preserved at Chevening, and is in some respects highly curious. There is no
                    love. The whole plot is political; and it is remarkable that the interest, such
                    as it is, turns on a contest about a regency. On one side is a faithful servant
                    of the crown, on the other an ambitious and unprincipled conspirator. At length
                    the king, who had been missing, reappears, resumes his power, and rewards the
                    faithful defender of his rights. A reader who should judge only by internal
                    evidence would have no hesitation in pronouncing that the play was written by
                    some Pittite poetaster at the time of the rejoicings for the recovery of George
                    III. in 1789.</p>
                <p>The pleasure with which William’s parents observed the rapid development of his
                    intellectual powers was alloyed by apprehensions about his health. He shot up
                    alarmingly fast; he was often ill, and always weak; and it was feared that it
                    would be impossible to rear a stripling so tall, so slender, and so feeble. Port
                    wine was prescribed by his medical advisers; and it is said that he was, at
                    fourteen, accustomed to take this agreeable physic in quantities which would, in
                    our abstemious age, be thought much more than sufficient for any full-grown man.
                    This regimen, though it would probably have killed ninety-nine boys out of a
                    hundred, seems to have been well suited to the peculiarities of William’s
                    constitution; for at fifteen he ceased to be molested by disease, and, though
                    never a strong man, continued, during many years of labour and anxiety, of
                    nights passed in debate and of summers passed in London, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0144-0135"/> to be a tolerably healthy one. It was probably on
                    account of the delicacy of his frame that he was not educated like other boys of
                    the same rank. Almost all the eminent English statesmen and orators to whom he
                    was afterwards opposed or allied—North, Fox, Shelburne, Windham, Grey,
                    Wellesley, Grenville, Sheridan, Canning—went through the training of great
                    public schools. Lord Chatham had himself been a distinguished Etonian; and it is
                    seldom that a distinguished Etonian forgets his obligations to Eton. But
                    William’s infirmities required a vigilance and tenderness such as could be found
                    only at home. He was therefore bred under the paternal roof. His studies were
                    superintended by a clergyman named Wilson; and those studies, though often
                    interrupted by illness, were prosecuted with extraordinary success. Before the
                    lad had completed his fifteenth year his knowledge both of the ancient languages
                    and of mathematics was such as very few men of eighteen then carried up to
                    college. He was therefore sent, towards the close of the year 1773, to Pembroke
                    Hall, in the university of Cambridge. So young a student required much more than
                    the ordinary care which a college tutor bestows on undergraduates. The governor
                    to whom the direction of William’s academical life was confided was a bachelor
                    of arts named Pretyman,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>George Pretyman (1750-1827) was senior wrangler in 1772. In 1803, on falling
                    heir to a large estate, he assumed the name of Tomline. From Lincoln, to which
                    see he had been elevated in 1787, he was translated to Winchester in 1820.
                    Tomline, to whom Pitt when dying had bequeathed his papers, published his <hi

                    1792) in 1821 (3 vols. 8vo).]</p></note> who had been senior wrangler in the
                    preceding year, and who, though not a man of prepossessing appearance or
                    brilliant parts, was eminently acute and laborious, a sound scholar, and an
                    excellent geometrician. At Cambridge Pretyman was, during more than two years,
                    the inseparable companion, and indeed almost the only companion, of his pupil. A
                    close and lasting friendship sprang up between the pair. The disciple was able,
                    before he completed his twenty-eighth year, to make his preceptor bishop of
                    Lincoln and dean of St Paul’s; and the preceptor showed his gratitude by writing
                    a life of the disciple, which enjoys the distinction of being the worst
                    biographical work of its size in the world.</p>
                <p>Pitt, till he graduated, had scarcely one acquaintance, attended chapel regularly
                    morning and evening, dined every day in hall, and never went to a single evening
                    party. At seventeen he was admitted, after the bad fashion of ' those times, by
                    right of birth, without any examination, to the degree of master of arts. But he
                    continued during some years to reside at college, and to apply himself
                    vigorously, under Pretyman’s direction, to the studies of the place, while
                    mixing freely in the best academic society.</p>
                <p>The stock of learning which Pitt laid in during this part of his life was
                    certainly very extraordinary. In fact, it was all that he ever possessed; for he
                    very early became too busy to have any spare time for books. The work in which
                    he took the greatest delight was Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Principia.</hi> His
                    liking for mathematics, indeed, amounted to a passion, which, in the opinion of
                    his instructors, themselves distinguished mathematicians, required to be checked
                    rather than encouraged. The acuteness and readiness with which he solved
                    problems was pronounced by one of the ablest of the moderators, who in those
                    days presided over the disputations in the schools and conducted the
                    examinations of the senate-house, to be unrivalled in the university. Nor was
                    the youth’s proficiency in classical learning less remarkable. In one respect,
                    indeed, he appeared tp αisadvantage when compared with even second-rate and
                    third-rate men from public schools. He had never, while under Wilson’s care,
                    been in the habit of composing in the ancient languages; and he therefore never
                    acquired that knack of versification which is sometimes possessed by clever boys
                    whose knowledge of the language and literature of Greece and Rome is very
                    superficial. It would have been utterly out of his power to produce such
                    charming elegiac lines as those in which Wellesley bade farewell to Eton, or
                    such Virgilian hexameters as those in which Canning described the pilgrimage to
                    Mecca. But it may be doubted whether any scholar has ever, at twenty, had a more
                    solid and profound knowledge of the two great tongues of the old civilized
                    world. The facility with which he penetrated the meaning of the most intricate
                    sentences in the Attic writers astonished veteran critics. He had set his heart
                    on being intimately acquainted with all the extant poetry of Greece, and was not
                    satisfied till he had mastered Lycophron’s <hi rend="italic">Cassandra,</hi> the
                    most obscure work in the whole range of ancient literature. This strange
                    rhapsody, the difficulties of which have perplexed and repelled many excellent
                    scholars, “he read,” says his preceptor, “with an ease at first sight which, if
                    I had not witnessed it, I should have thought beyond the compass of human
                    intellect.”</p>
                <p>To modern literature Pitt paid comparatively little attention. He knew no living
                    language except French; and French he knew very imperfectly. With a few of the
                    best English writers he was intimate, particularly with Shakspeare and Milton.
                    The debate in Pandemonium was, as it well deserved to be, one of his favourite
                    passages; and his early friends used to talk, long after his death, of the just
                    emphasis and the melodious cadence with which they had heard him recite the
                    incomparable speech of Belial. He had indeed been carefully trained from infancy
                    in the art of managing his voice, a voice naturally clear and deep-toned. His
                    father, whose oratory owed no small part of its effect to that art, had been a
                    most skilful and judicious instructor. At a later period the wits of Brookes’s,
                    irritated by observing, night after night, how powerfully Pitt’s sonorous
                    elocution fascinated the rows of country gentlemen, reproached him with having
                    been “taught by his dad on a stool.”</p>
                <p>His education, indeed, was well adapted to form a great parliamentary speaker.
                    One argument often urged against those classical studies which occupy so large a
                    part of the early life of every gentleman bred in the south of our island is,
                    that they prevent him from acquiring a command of his mother tongue, and that it
                    is not unusual to meet with a youth of excellent parts, who writes Ciceronian
                    Latin prose and Horatian Latin alcaics, but who would find it impossible to
                    express his thoughts in pure, perspicuous, and forcible English. There may
                    perhaps be some truth in this observation. But the classical studies of Pitt
                    were carried on in a peculiar manner, and had the effect of enriching his
                    English vocabulary, and of making him wonderfully expert in the art of
                    constructing correct English sentences. His practice was to look over a page or
                    two of a Greek or Latin author, to make himself master of the meaning, and then
                    to read the passage straight forward into his own language. This practice, begun
                    under his first teacher Wilson, was continued under Pretyman. It is not strange
                    that a young man of great abilities, who had been exercised daily in this way
                    during ten years, should have acquired an almost unrivalled power of putting his
                    thoughts, without premeditation, into words well selected and well arranged.</p>
                <p>Of all the remains of antiquity, the orations were those on which he bestowed the
                    most minute examination. His favourite employment was to compare harangues on
                    opposite sides of the same question, to analyse them, and to observe which of
                    the arguments of the first speaker were refuted by the second, which were
                    evaded, and which were left untouched. Nor was it only in books that he at this
                    time studied the art of parliamentary fencing. When he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n145/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0145-0136"/> was at home, he had frequent opportunities of
                    hearing important debates at Westminster; and he heard them, not only with
                    interest and enjoyment, but with a close scientific attention resembling that
                    with which a diligent pupil at Guy’s Hospital watches every turn of the hand of
                    a great surgeon through a difficult operation. On one of these occasions Pitt, a
                    youth whose abilities were as yet known only to his own family and to a small
                    knot of college friends, was introduced on the steps of the throne in the House
                    of Lords to Fox, who was his senior by eleven years, and who was already the
                    greatest debater, and one of the greatest orators, that had appeared in England.
                    Fox used afterwards to relate that, as the discussion proceeded, Pitt repeatedly
                    turned to him, and said, “But surely, Mr Fox, that might be met thus or “Yes;
                    but he lays himself open to this retort.” What the particular criticisms were
                    Fox had forgotten; but he said that he was much struck at the time by the
                    precocity of a lad who, through the whole sitting, seemed to be thinking only
                    how all the speeches on both sides could be answered.</p>
                <p>One of the young man’s visits to the House of Lords was a sad and memorable era
                    in his life. He had not quite completed his nineteenth year when, on the 7th of
                    April 1778, he attended his father to Westminster. A great debate was expected.
                    It was known that France had recognized the independence of the United States.
                    The duke of Richmond was about to declare his opinion that all thought of
                    subjugating those states ought to be relinquished. Chatham had always maintained
                    that the resistance of the colonies to the mother country was justifiable. But
                    he conceived, very erroneously, that on the day on which their independence
                    should be acknowledged the greatness of England would be at an end. Though
                    sinking under the weight of years and infirmities, he determined, in spite of
                    the entreaties of his family, to be in his place. His son supported him to a
                    seat. The excitement and exertion were too much for the old man. In the very act
                    of addressing the peers, he fell back in convulsions. A few weeks later his
                    corpse was borne, with gloomy pomp, from the Painted Chamber to the Abbey. The
                    favourite child and namesake of the deceased statesman followed the coffin as
                    chief mourner, and saw it deposited in the transept where his own was destined
                    to lie.</p>
                <p>His elder brother, now earl of Chatham, had means sufficient, and barely
                    sufficient, to support the dignity of the peerage. The other members of the
                    family were poorly provided for. William had little more than three hundred a
                    year. It was necessary for him to follow a profession. He had already begun to
                    eat his terms. In the spring of 1780 he came of age. He then quitted Cambridge,
                    was called to the bar, took chambers in Lincoln’s Inn, and joined the western
                    circuit. In the autumn of that year a general election took place; and he
                    offered himself as a candidate for the university; but he was at the bottom of
                    the poll. It is said that the grave doctors who then sat, robed in scarlet, on
                    the benches of Golgotha thought it great presumption in so young a man to
                    solicit so high a distinction. He was, however, at the request of a hereditary
                    friend, the duke of Rutland, brought into parliament by Sir James Lowther for
                    the borough of Appleby.</p>
                <p>The dangers of the country were at that time such as might well have disturbed
                    even a constant mind. Army after army had been sent in vain against the
                    rebellious colonists of North America. On pitched fields of battle the advantage
                    had been with the disciplined troops of the mother country. But it was not on
                    pitched fields of battle that the event of such a contest could be decided. An
                    armed nation, with hunger and the Atlantic for auxiliaries, was not to be
                    subjugated. Meanwhile the house of Bourbon, humbled to the dust a few years
                    before by the genius and vigour of Chatham, had seized the opportunity of
                    revenge. France and Spain had united against us, and had recently been joined by
                    Holland. The command of the Mediterranean had been for a time lost. The British
                    flag had been scarcely able to maintain itself in the British Channel. The
                    northern powers professed neutrality; but their neutrality had a menacing
                    aspect. In the East, Hyder had descended on the Carnatic, had destroyed the
                    little army of Baillie, and had spread terror even to the ramparts of Fort St
                    George. The discontents of Ireland threatened nothing less than civil war. In
                    England the authority of the Government had sunk to the lowest point. The king
                    and the House of Commons were alike unpopular. The cry for parliamentary reform
                    was scarcely less loud and vehement than in the autumn of 1830. Formidable
                    associations, headed, not by ordinary demagogues, but by men of high rank,
                    stainless character, and distinguished ability, demanded a revision of the
                    representative system. The populace, emboldened by the impotence and
                    irresolution of the Government, had recently broken loose from all restraint,
                    besieged the chambers of the legislature, hustled peers, hunted bishops,
                    attacked the residences of ambassadors, opened prisons, burned and pulled down
                    houses. London had presented during some days the aspect of a city taken by
                    storm; and it had been necessary to form a camp among the trees of St James’s
                    Park.</p>
                <p>In spite of dangers and difficulties abroad and at home, George III., with a
                    firmness which had little affinity with virtue or with wisdom, persisted in his
                    determination to put down the American rebels by force of arms; and his
                    ministers submitted their judgment to his. Some of them were probably actuated
                    merely by selfish cupidity; but their chief, Lord North, a man of high honour,
                    amiable temper, winning manners, lively wit, and excellent talents both for
                    business and for debate, must be acquitted of all sordid motives. He remained at
                    a post from which he had long wished and had repeatedly tried to escape, only
                    because he had not sufficient fortitude to resist the entreaties and reproaches
                    of the king, who silenced all arguments by passionately asking whether any
                    gentleman, any man of spirit, could have the heart to desert a kind master in
                    the hour of extremity.</p>
                <p>The Opposition consisted of two parties which had once been hostile to each
                    other, and which had been very slowly and, as it soon appeared, very imperfectly
                    reconciled, but which at this conjuncture seemed to act together with
                    cordiality. The larger of these parties consisted of the great body of the Whig
                    aristocracy. Its head was Charles, marquis of Rockingham, a man of sense and
                    virtue, and in wealth and parliamentary interest equalled by very few of the
                    English nobles, but afflicted with a nervous timidity which prevented him from
                    taking a prominent part in debate. In the House of Commons the adherents of
                    Rockingham were led by Fox, whose dissipated habits and ruined fortunes were the
                    talk of the whole town, but whose commanding genius, and whose sweet, generous,
                    and affectionate disposition, extorted the admiration and love of those who most
                    lamented the errors of his private life. Burke, superior to Fox in largeness of
                    comprehension, in extent of knowledge, and in splendour of imagination, but less
                    skilled in that kind of logic and in that kind of rhetoric which convince and
                    persuade great assemblies, was willing to be the lieutenant of a young chief who
                    might have been his son.</p>
                <p>A smaller section of the Opposition was composed of the old followers of Chatham.
                    At their head was William, earl of Shelburne, distinguished both as a statesman
                    and <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n146/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0146-0137"/> as a lover of science and letters. With him were
                    leagued Lord Camden, who had formerly held the great seal, and whose integrity,
                    ability, and constitutional knowledge commanded the public respect; Barré, an
                    eloquent and acrimonious declaimer; and Dunning, who had long held the first
                    place at the English bar. It was to this party that Pitt was naturally
                    attracted.</p>
                <p>On the 26th of February 1781 he made his first speech in favour of Burke’s plan
                    of economical reform. Fox stood up at the same moment, but instantly gave way.
                    The lofty yet animated deportment of the young member, his perfect
                    self-possession, the readiness with which he replied to the orators who had
                    preceded him, the silver tones of his voice, the perfect structure of his
                    unpremeditated sentences, astonished and delighted his hearers. Burke, moved
                    even to tears, exclaimed, “It is not a chip of the old block; it is the old
                    block itself.” “Pitt will be one of the first men in parliament,” said a member
                    of the opposition to Fox. “He is so already,” answered Fox, in whose nature envy
                    had no place. It is a curious fact, well remembered by some who were very
                    recently living,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[It is
                    to be noted that this and some other allusions in the present article refer to
                    the date of its original appearance, 1859.1</p></note> that soon after this
                    debate Pitt’s name was put up by Fox at Brookes’s.</p>
                <p>On two subsequent occasions during that session Pitt addressed the House, and on
                    both fully sustained the reputation which he had acquired on his first
                    appearance. In the summer, after the prorogation, he again went the western
                    circuit, held several briefs, and acquitted himself in such a manner that he was
                    highly complimented by Buller from the bench, and by Dunning at the bar.</p>
                <p>On the 27th of November the parliament reassembled. Only forty-eight hours before
                    had arrived tidings of the surrender of Cornwallis and his army; and it had
                    consequently been necessary to rewrite the royal speech. Every man in the
                    kingdom, except the king, was now convinced that it was mere madness to think of
                    conquering the United States. In the debate on the report of the address, Pitt
                    spoke with even more energy and brilliancy than on any former occasion. He was
                    warmly applauded by his allies; but it was remarked that no person on his own
                    side of the house was so loud in eulogy as Henry Dundas, the lord advocate of
                    Scotland, who spoke from the ministerial ranks. That able and versatile
                    politician distinctly foresaw the approaching downfall of the Government with
                    which he was connected, and was preparing to make his own escape from the ruin.
                    From that night dates his connexion with Pitt, a connexion which soon became a
                    close intimacy, and which lasted till it was dissolved by death.</p>
                <p>About a fortnight later Pitt spoke in the committee of supply on the army
                    estimates. Symptoms of dissension had begun to appear on the treasury bench.
                    Lord George Germaine, the secretary of state who was especially charged with the
                    direction of the war in America, had held language not easily to be reconciled
                    with declarations made by the first lord of the treasury. Pitt noticed the
                    discrepancy with much force and keenness. Lord George and Lord North began to
                    whisper together; and Welbore Ellis, an ancient placeman who had been drawing
                    salary almost every quarter since the days of Hennr ’ Pelham, bent down between
                    them to put in a word. Such interruptions sometimes discompose veteran speakers.
                    Pitt stopped, and, looking at the group, said, with admirable readiness, “I
                    shall wait till Nestor has composed the dispute between Agamemnon and
                    Achilles.”</p>
                <p>After several defeats, or victories hardly to be distinguished from defeats, the
                    ministry resigned. The king, reluctantly and ungraciously, consented to accept
                    Rock ingham as first minister. Fox and Shelburne became secretaries of state.
                    Lord John Cavendish, one of the most upright and honourable of men, was made
                    chancellor of the exchequer. Thurlow, whose abilities and force of character had
                    made him the dictator of the House of Lords, continued to hold the great
                    seal.</p>
                <p>To Pitt was offered, through Shelburne, the vice-treasurership of Ireland, one of
                    the easiest and most highly paid places in the gift of the crown; but the offer
                    was without hesitation declined. The young statesman had resolved to accept no
                    post which did not entitle him to a seat in the cabinet; and a few days later he
                    announced that resolution in the House of Commons, It must be remembered that
                    the cabinet was then a much smaller and more select body than at present. We
                    have seen cabinets of sixteen. In the time of our grandfathers a cabinet of ten
                    or eleven was thought inconveniently large. Seven was a usual number. Even
                    Burke, who had taken the lucrative office of paymaster, was not in the cabinet.
                    Many therefore thought Pitt’s declaration indecent. He himself was sorry that he
                    had made it. The words, he said in private, had escaped him in the heat of
                    speaking; and he had no sooner uttered them than he would have given the world
                    to recall them. They, however, did him no harm with the public. The second
                    William Pitt, it was said, had shown that he had inherited the spirit as well as
                    the genius of the first. In the son, as in the father, there might perhaps be
                    too much pride; but there was nothing low or sordid. It might be called
                    arrogance in a young barrister, living in chambers on three hundred a year, to
                    refuse a salary of five thousand a year, merely because he did not choose to
                    bind himself to speak or vote for plans which he had no share in framing; but
                    surely such arrogance was not very far removed from virtue.</p>
                <p>Pitt gave a general support to the administration of Rockingham, but omitted, in
                    the meantime, no opportunity of courting that ultra-Whig party which the
                    persecution of Wilkes and the Middlesex election had called into existence, and
                    which the disastrous events of the war, and the triumph of republican principles
                    in America, had made formidable both in numbers and in temper. He supported a
                    motion for shortening the duration of parliaments. He made a motion for a
                    committee to examine into the state of the representation, and, in the speech by
                    which that motion was introduced, avowed himself the enemy of the close
                    boroughs, the strongholds of that corruption to which he attributed all the
                    calamities of the nation, and which, as he phrased it in one of those exact and
                    sonorous sentences of which he had a boundless command, had grown with the
                    growth of England and strengthened with her strength, but had not diminished
                    with her diminution or decayed with her decay. On this occasion he was supported
                    by Fox. The motion was lost by only twenty votes in a house of more than three
                    hundred members. The reformers never again had so good a division till the year
                    1831.</p>
                <p>The new administration was strong in abilities, and was more popular than any
                    administration which had held office since the first year of George III., but
                    was hated by the king, hesitatingly supported by the Parliament, and torn by
                    internal dissensions. The chancellor was disliked and distrusted by almost all
                    his colleagues. The two secretaries of state regarded each other with no
                    friendly feeling. The line between their departments had not been traced with
                    precision; and there were consequently jealousies, encroachments, and
                    complaints. It was all that Rockingham could do to keep the peace in his
                    cabinet; and before the cabinet had existed three months Rockingham died.</p>
                <p>In an instant all was confusion. The adherents of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n147/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0147-0138"/> deceased statesman looked on the duke of Portland
                    as their chief. The king placed Shelburne at the head of the treasury. Fox, Lord
                    John Cavendish, and Burke immediately resigned their offices; and the new prime
                    minister was left to constitute a Government out of very defective materials.
                    His own parliamentary talents were great; but he could not be in the place where
                    parliamentary talents were most needed. It was necessary to find some member of
                    the House of Commons who could confront the great orators of the Opposition; and
                    Pitt alone had the eloquence and the courage which were required. He was offered
                    the great place of chancellor of the exchequer, and he accepted it. He had
                    scarcely completed his twenty-third year.</p>
                <p>The parliament was speedily prorogued. During the recess a negotiation for peace
                    which had been commenced under Rockingham was brought to a successful
                    termination. England acknowledged the independence of her revolted colonies; and
                    she ceded to her European enemies some places in the Mediterranean and in the
                    Gulf of Mexico. But the terms which she obtained were quite as advantageous and
                    honourable as the events of the war entitled her to expect, or as she was likely
                    to obtain by persevering in a contest against immense odds. All her vital parts,
                    all the real sources of her power, remained uninjured. She preserved even her
                    dignity; for she ceded to the house of Bourbon only part of what she had won
                    from that house in previous wars. She retained her Indian empire undiminished;
                    and, in spite of the mightiest efforts of two great monarchies, her flag still
                    waved on the rock of Gibraltar. There is not the slightest reason to believe
                    that Fox, if he had remained in office, would have hesitated one moment about
                    concluding a treaty on such conditions. Unhappily that great and most amiable
                    man was, at this crisis, hurried by his passions into an error which made his
                    genius and his virtues, during a long course of years, almost useless to his
                    country.</p>
                <p>He saw that the great body of the House of Commons was divided into three
                    parties—his own, that of North, and that of Shelburne; that none of those three
                    parties was large enough to stand alone; that, therefore, unless two of them
                    united there must be a miserably feeble administration, or, more probably, a
                    rapid succession of miserably feeble administrations, and this at a time when a
                    strong Government was essential to the prosperity and respectability of the
                    nation. It was then necessary and right that there should be a coalition. To
                    every possible coalition there were objections. But of all possible coalitions
                    that to which there were the fewest objections was undoubtedly a coalition
                    between Shelburne and Fox. It would have been generally applauded by the
                    followers of both. It might have been made without any sacrifice of public
                    principle on the part of either. Unhappily, recent bickerings had left in the
                    mind of Fox a profound dislike and distrust of Shelburne. Pitt attempted to
                    mediate, and was authorized to invite Fox to return to the service of the crown.
                    “Is Lord Shelburne,” said Fox, “to remain prime minister ?” Pitt answered in the
                    affirmative. “It is impossible that I can act under him,” said Fox. “Then
                    negotiation is at an end,” said Pitt; “for I cannot betray him.” Thus the two
                    statesmen parted. They were never again in a private room together.</p>
                <p>As Fox and his friends would not treat with Shelburne, nothing remained to them
                    but to treat with North. That fatal coalition which is emphatically called “The
                    Coalition” was formed. Not three quarters of a year had elapsed since Fox and
                    Burke had threatened North with impeachment, and had described him night after
                    night as the most arbitrary, the most corrupt, and the most incapable of
                    ministers. They now allied themselves with him for the purpose of driving from
                    office a statesman with whom they cannot be said to have differed as to any
                    important question. Nor had they even the prudence and the patience to wait for
                    some occasion on which they might, without inconsistency, have combined with
                    their old enemies in opposition to the Government. That nothing might be wanting
                    to the scandal the great orators who had, during seven years, thundered against
                    the, war determined to join with the authors of that war in passing a vote of
                    censure on the peace.</p>
                <p>The parliament met before Christmas 1782. But it was not till January 1783 that
                    the preliminary treaties were signed. On the 17th of February they were taken
                    into consideration by the House of Commons. There had been, during some days,
                    floating rumours that Fox and North had coalesced; and the debate indicated but
                    too clearly that those rumours were not unfounded. Pitt was suffering from
                    indisposition; he did not rise till his own strength and that of his hearers
                    were exhausted; and he was consequently less successful than on any former
                    occasion. His admirers owned that his speech was feeble and petulant. He so far
                    forgot himself as to advise Sheridan to confine himself to amusing theatrical
                    audiences. This ignoble sarcasm gave Sheridan an opportunity of retorting with
                    great felicity. “After what I have seen and heard to-night,” he said, “I really
                    feel strongly' tempted to venture on a competition with so great an artist as
                    Ben Jonson, and to bring on the stage a second Angry Boy.” On a division, the
                    address proposed by the supporters of the Government was rejected by a majority
                    of sixteen.</p>
                <p>But Pitt was not a man to be disheartened by a single failure, or to be put down
                    by the most lively repartee. When, a few days later, the Opposition proposed a
                    resolution directly censuring the treaties, he spoke with an eloquence, energy,
                    and dignity which raised his fame and popularity higher than ever. To the
                    coalition of Fox and North he alluded in language which drew forth tumultuous
                    applause from his followers. “If,” he said, “this ill-omened and unnatural
                    marriage be not yet consummated, I know of a just and lawful impediment; and, in
                    the name of the public weal, I forbid the banns.”</p>
                <p>The ministers were again left in a minority, and Shelburne consequently tendered
                    his resignation. It was accepted; but the king struggled long and hard before he
                    submitted to the terms dictated by Fox, whose faults he detested, and whose high
                    spirit and powerful intellect he detested still more. The first place at the
                    board of treasury was repeatedly offered to Pitt; but the offer, though
                    tempting, was steadfastly declined. The young man, whose judgment was as
                    precocious as his eloquence, saw that his time was coming, but was not come, and
                    was deaf to royal importunities and reproaches. His Majesty, bitterly
                    complaining of Pitt’s faintheartedness, tried to break the coalition. Every art
                    of seduction was practised on North, but in vain. During several weeks the
                    country remained without a Government. It was not till all devices had failed,
                    and till the aspect of the House of Commons became threatening, that the king
                    gave way. The duke of Portland was declared first lord of the treasury. Thurlow
                    was dismissed. Fox and North became secretaries of state, with power ostensibly
                    equal. But Fox was the real prime minister.</p>
                <p>The year was far advanced before the new arrangements were completed; and nothing
                    very important was done ’ during the remainder of the session. Pitt, now seated
                    on the Opposition bench, brought the question of parliamentary reform a second
                    time under the consideration of the: Commons. He proposed to add to the House at
                    once a <hi rend="subscript">:</hi> hundred county members and several members
                    for metropolitan districts, and to enact that every borough of which <pb

                    majority of voters appeared to be corrupt should lose the franchise. The motion
                    was rejected by 293 votes to 149.</p>
                <p>After the prorogation, Pitt visited the Continent for the first and last time.
                    His travelling companion was one of his most intimate friends, a young man of
                    his own age who had already distinguished himself in parliament by an engaging
                    natural eloquence, set off by the sweetest and most exquisitely modulated of
                    human voices, and whose affectionate heart, caressing manners, and brilliant wit
                    made him the most delightful of companions, William Wilberforce. That was the
                    time of Anglomania in France; and at Paris the son of the great Chatham was
                    absolutely hunted by men of letters and women of fashion, and forced, much
                    against his will, into political disputation. One remarkable saying which
                    dropped from him during this tour has been preserved. A French gentleman
                    expressed some surprise at the immense influence which Fox, a man of pleasure,
                    ruined by the dice-box and the turf, exercised over the English nation, “You
                    have not,” said Pitt, “been under the wand of the magician.”</p>
                <p>In November 1783 the parliament met again. The Government had irresistible
                    strength in the House of Commons, and seemed to be scarcely less strong in the
                    House of Lords, but was, in truth, ’ surrounded on every side by dangers. The
                    king was impatiently waiting for the moment at which he could emancipate himself
                    from a yoke which galled him so severely that he had more than once seriously
                    thought of retiring to Hanover; and the king was scarcely more eager for a
                    change than the nation. Fox and North had committed a fatal error. They ought to
                    have known that coalitions between parties which have long been hostile can
                    succeed only when the wish for coalition pervades the lower ranks of both. If
                    the leaders unite before there is any disposition to union among the followers,
                    the probability is that there will be a mutiny in both camps, and that the two
                    revolted armies will make a truce with each other in order to be revenged on
                    those by whom they think that they have been betrayed. Thus it was in 1783. At
                    the beginning of that eventful year North had been the recognized head of the
                    old Tory party, which, though for a moment prostrated by the disastrous issue of
                    the American war, was still a great power in the state. To him the clergy, the
                    universities, and that large body of country gentlemen whose rallying cry was
                    “Church and King” had long looked up with respect and confidence. Fox had, on
                    the other hand, been the idol of the Whigs, and of the whole body of Protestant
                    dissenters. The coalition at once alienated the most zealous Tories from North
                    and the most zealous Whigs from Fox. The university of Oxford, which had marked
                    its approbation of North’s orthodoxy by electing him chancellor, the city of
                    London, which had been during two and twenty years at war with the court, were
                    equally disgusted. Squires and rectors who had inherited the principles of the
                    cavaliers of the preceding century could not forgive their old leader for
                    combining with disloyal subjects in order to put a force on the sovereign. The
                    members of the Bill of Rights Society and of the reform associations were
                    enraged by learning that their favourite orator nθ∖v called the great champion
                    of tyranny and corruption his noble friend. Two great multitudes were at once
                    left without any head, and both at once turned their eyes on Pitt. One party saw
                    in him the only man who could rescue the king; the other saw in him the only man
                    who could purify the parliament. He was supported on one side by Archbishop
                    Markham, the preacher of divine right, and by Jenkinson, the captain of the
                    praetorian band of the king’s friends; on the other side by Jebb and Priestley,
                    Sawbridge and Cartwright, Jack Wilkes and Horne Tooke. On the benches of the
                    House of Commons, however, the ranks of the ministerial majority were unbroken;
                    and that any statesman would venture to brave such a majority was thought
                    impossible. No prince of the Hanoverian line had ever, under any provocation,
                    ventured to appeal from the representative body to the constituent body. The
                    ministers, therefore, notwithstanding the sullen looks and muttered words of
                    displeasure with which their suggestions were received in the closet,
                    notwithstanding the roar of obloquy which was rising louder and louder every day
                    from every corner of the island, thought themselves secure.</p>
                <p>Such was their confidence in their strength that, as soon as the parliament had
                    met, they brought forward a singularly bold and original plan for the government
                    of the British territories in India. What was proposed was that the whole
                    authority which till that time had been exercised over those territories by the
                    East India Company should be transferred to seven commissioners, who were to be
                    named by parliament, and were not to be removable at the pleasure of the crown.
                    Earl Fitzwilliam, the most intimate personal friend of Fox, was to be chairman
                    of this board, and the eldest son of North was to be one of the members.</p>
                <p>As soon as the outlines of the scheme were known all the hatred which the
                    coalition had excited burst forth with an astounding explosion. The question
                    which ought undoubtedly to have been considered as paramount to every other was
                    whether the proposed change was likely to be beneficial or injurious to the
                    thirty millions of people who were subject to the company. But that question
                    cannot be said to have been even seriously discussed. Burke, who, whether right
                    or wrong in the conclusions to which he came, had at least the merit of looking
                    at the subject in the right point of view, vainly reminded his hearers of that
                    mighty population whose daily rice might depend on a vote of the British
                    parliament. He spoke with even more than his wonted power of thought and
                    language, about the desolation of Rohilcund, about the spoliation of Benares,
                    about the evil policy which had suffered the tanks of the Carnatic to go to
                    rain; but he could scarcely obtain a hearing. The contending parties, to their
                    shame it must be said, would listen to none but English topics. Out of doors the
                    cry against the ministry was almost universal. Town and country were united.
                    Corporations exclaimed against the violation of the charter of the greatest
                    corporation in the realm. Tories and democrats joined in pronouncing the
                    proposed board an unconstitutional body. It was to consist of Fox’s nominees.
                    The effect of his bill was to give, not to the crown, but to him personally,
                    whether in office or in opposition, an enormous power, a patronage sufficient to
                    counterbalance the patronage of the treasury and of the admiralty, and to decide
                    the elections for fifty boroughs. He knew, it was said, that he was hateful
                    alike to king and people; and he had devised a plan which would make him
                    independent of both. Some nicknamed him Cromwell, and some Carlo Khan.
                    Wilberforce, with his usual felicity of expression, and with very unusual
                    bitterness of feeling, described the scheme as the genuine offspring of the
                    coalition, as marked with the features of both its parents, the corruption of
                    one and the violence of the other. In spite of all opposition, however, the bill
                    was supported in every stage by great majorities, was rapidly passed, and was
                    sent up to the Lords. To the general astonishment, when the second reading was
                    moved in the Upper House, the Opposition proposed an adjournment, and carried it
                    by eighty-seven votes to seventy-nine. The cause of this strange turn of fortune
                    was soon known. Pitt’s cousin, Earl Temple, had been in the royal closet, and
                    had there <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n149/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0149-0140"/> been authorized to let it be known that His
                    Majesty would consider all who voted for the bill as his enemies. The
                    ignominious commission was performed, and instantly a troop of lords of the
                    bedchamber, of bishops who wished to be translated, and of Scotch peers who
                    wished to be reelected made haste to change sides. On a later day the Lords
                    rejected the bill. Fox and North were immediately directed to send their seals
                    to the palace by their under secretaries; and Pitt was appointed first lord of
                    the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer.</p>
                <p>The general opinion was that there would be an immediate dissolution. But Pitt
                    wisely determined to give the public feeling time to gather strength. On this
                    point he differed from his kinsman Temple. The consequence was that Temple, who
                    had been appointed one of the secretaries of state, resigned his office
                    forty-eight hours after he had accepted it, and thus relieved the new Government
                    from a great load of unpopularity <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> all men of sense
                    and honour, however strong might be their dislike of the India Bill, disapproved
                    of the manner in which that bill had been thrown out. Temple carried away with
                    him the scandal which the best friends of the new Government could not but
                    lament. The fame of the young prime minister preserved its whiteness. He could
                    declare with perfect truth that, if unconstitutional machinations had been
                    employed, he had been no party to them.</p>
                <p>He was, however, surrounded by difficulties and dangers. In the House of Lords,
                    indeed, he had a majority; nor could any orator of the opposition in that
                    assembly be considered as a match for Thurlow, who was now again chancellor, or
                    for Camden, who cordially supported the son of his old friend Chatham. But in
                    the other House there was not a single eminent speaker among the official men
                    who sat round Pitt. His most useful assistant was Dundas, who, though he had not
                    eloquence, had sense, knowledge, readiness, and boldness. On the opposite
                    benches was a powerful majority, led by Fox, who was supported by Burke, North,
                    and Sheridan. The heart of the young minister, stout as it was, almost died
                    within him. He could not once close his eyes on the night which followed
                    Temple’s resignation. But, whatever his internal emotions might be, his language
                    and deportment indicated nothing but unconquerable firmness and haughty
                    confidence in his own powers. His contest against the House of Commons lasted
                    from the 17th of December 1783 to the 8th of March 1784. In sixteen divisions
                    the Opposition triumphed. Again and again the king was requested to dismiss his
                    ministers; but he was determined to go to Germany rather than yield. Pitt’s
                    resolution never wavered. The cry of the nation in his favour became vehement
                    and almost furious. Addresses assuring him of public support came up daily from
                    every part of the kingdom. The freedom of the city of London was presented to
                    him in a gold box. He went in state to receive this mark of distinction. He was
                    sumptuously feasted in Grocers’ Hall; and the shopkeepers of the Strand and
                    Fleet Street illuminated their houses in his honour. These things could not but
                    produce an effect within the walls of parliament. The ranks of the majority
                    began to waver; a few passed over to the enemy; some skulked away; many were for
                    capitulating while it was still possible to capitulate with the honours of war.
                    Negotiations were opened with the view of forming an administration on a wide
                    basis, but they had scarcely been opened when they were closed. The Opposition
                    demanded, as a preliminary article of the treaty, that Pitt should resign the
                    treasury; and with this demand Pitt steadfastly refused to comply. While the
                    contest was raging, the clerkship of the Pells, a sinecure place for life, worth
                    three thousand a year, and tenable with a seat in the House of Commons, became
                    vacant. The appointment was with the chancellor of the exchequer; nobody doubted
                    that he would appoint himself, and nobody could have blamed him if he had done
                    so; for such sinecure offices had always been defended on the ground that they
                    enabled a few men of eminent abilities and small incomes to live without any
                    profession, and to devote themselves to the service of the state. Pitt, in spite
                    of the remonstrances of his friends, gave the Pells to his father’s old
                    adherent, Colonel Barré, a man distinguished by talent and eloquence, but poor
                    and afflicted with blindness. By this arrangement a pension which the Rockingham
                    administration had granted to Barré was saved to the public. Never was there a
                    happier stroke of policy. About treaties, wars, expeditions, tariffs, budgets,
                    there will always be room for dispute. The policy which is applauded by half the
                    nation may be condemned by the other half. But pecuniary disinterestedness
                    everybody comprehends. It is a great thing for a man who has only three hundred
                    a year to be able to show that he considers three thousand a year as mere dirt
                    beneath his feet, when compared with the public interest and the public esteem.
                    Pitt had his reward. No minister was ever more rancorously libelled; but even
                    when he was known to be overwhelmed with debt, when millions were passing
                    through his hands, when the wealthiest ιħagnates of the realm were soliciting
                    him for marquisates and garters, his bitterest enemies did not dare to accuse
                    him of touching unlawful gain.</p>
                <p>At length the hard-fought fight ended. A final remonstrance, drawn up by Burke
                    with admirable skill, was carried on the 8th of March by a single vote in a full
                    house. Had the experiment been repeated, the supporters of the coalition would
                    probably have been in a minority. But the supplies had been voted; the Mutiny
                    Bill had been passed; and the parliament was dissolved.</p>
                <p>The popular constituent bodies all over the country were in general enthusiastic
                    on the side of the new Government. A hundred and sixty of the supporters of the
                    coalition lost their seats. The first lord of the treasury himself came in at
                    the head of the poll for the university of Cambridge. His young friend,
                    Wilberforce, was elected knight of the great shire of York, in opposition to the
                    whole influence of the Fitzwilliams, Cavendishes, Dundases, and Saviles. In the
                    midst of such triumphs Pitt completed his twenty-fifth year. He was now the
                    greatest subject that England had seen during many generations. He domineered
                    absolutely over the cabinet, and was the favourite at once of the sovereign, of
                    the parliament, and of the nation. His father had never been so powerful, nor
                    Walpole, nor Marlborough.</p>
                <p>This narrative has now reached a point beyond which a full history of the life of
                    Pitt would be a history of England, or rather of the whole civilized world; and
                    for such a history this is not the proper place. Here a very slight sketch must
                    suffice; and in that sketch prominence will be given to such points as may
                    enable a reader who is already acquainted with the general course of events to
                    form a just notion of the character of the man on whom so much depended.</p>
                <p>If we wish to arrive at a correct judgment of Pitt’s merits and defects, we must
                    never forget that he belonged to a peculiar class of statesmen, and that he must
                    be tried by a peculiar standard. It is not easy to compare him fairly with such
                    men as Ximenes and Sully, Richelieu and Oxcnstiern, John de Witt and Warren
                    Hastings. The means by which those politicians governed great communities were
                    of quite a different kind from those which Pitt was under the necessity of
                    employing. Some talents, which they never had any opportunity of showing that
                    they possessed, were developed in him to an extraordinary degree. In some
                    qualities, on the other hand, to which they owe a large part of their fame, he
                    was decidedly their inferior. They transacted business in their closets, or at
                    boards where a few confidential councillors sat. It was his lot to be born in an
                    age and in a country in which parliamentary government was completely
                    established; his whole training from infancy was such as fitted him to bear a
                    part in parliamentary government; and, from the prime of his manhood to his
                    death, all the powers of his vigorous mind were almost constantly exerted in <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0150-0141"/> the work of parliamentary government. He
                    accordingly became the greatest master of the whole art of parliamentary
                    government that has ever existed, a greater than Montague or Walpole, a greater
                    than his father Chatham or his rival Fox, a greater than either of his
                    illustrious successors Canning and Peel.</p>
                <p>Parliamentary government, like every other contrivance of man, has its advantages
                    and its disadvantages. On the advantages there is no need to dilate. The history
                    of England during the hundred and seventy years which have elapsed since the
                    House of Commons became the most powerful body in the state, her immense and
                    still growing prosperity, her freedom, her tranquillity, her greatness in arts,
                    in sciences, and in arms, her maritime ascendency, the marvels of her public
                    credit, her American, her African, her Australian, her Asiatic empires,
                    sufficiently prove the excellence of her institutions. But those institutions,
                    though excellent, are assuredly not perfect. Parliamentary government is
                    government by speaking. In such a government, the power of speaking is the most
                    highly prized of all the qualities which a politician can possess; and that
                    power may exist, in the highest degree, without judgment, without fortitude,
                    without skill in reading the characters of men or the signs of the times,
                    without any knowledge of the principles of legislation or of political economy,
                    and without any skill in diplomacy or in the administration of war. Nay, it may
                    well happen that those very intellectual qualities which give a peculiar charm
                    to the speeches of a public man may be incompatible with the qualities which
                    would fit him to meet a pressing emergency with promptitude and firmness. It was
                    thus with Charles Townshend. It was thus with Windham. It was a privilege to
                    listen to those accomplished; and ingenious orators. But in a perilous crisis
                    they would have been found far inferior in all the qualities of rulers to such a
                    man as Oliver Cromwell, who talked nonsense, or as William the Silent, who did
                    not talk at all. When parliamentary government is established, a Charles
                    Townshend or a Windham will almost always exercise much greater influence than
                    such men as the great Protector of England, or as the founder of the Batavian
                    commonwealth. In such a government, parliamentary talent, though quite distinct
                    from the talents of a good executive or judicial officer, will be a chief
                    qualification for executive and judicial office. From the Book of Dignities a
                    curious list might be made out of chancellors ignorant of the principles of
                    equity, and first lords of the admiralty ignorant of the principles of
                    navigation, of colonial ministers who could not repeat the names of the
                    colonies, of lords of the treasury who did not know the difference between
                    funded and unfunded debt, and of secretaries of the India board who did not know
                    whether the Mahrattas were Mohammedans or Hindus. On these grounds, some
                    persons, incapable of seeing more than one side of a question, have pronounced
                    parliamentary government a positive evil, and have maintained that the
                    administration would be ^greatly improved if the power, now exercised by a large
                    assembly, were transferred to a single person. Men of sense will probably think
                    the remedy very much worse than the disease, and will be of opinion that there
                    would be small gain in exchanging Charles Townshend and Windham for the Prince
                    of the Peace, or the poor slave and dog Steenie.</p>
                <p>Pitt was emphatically the man of parliamentary government, the type of his class,
                    the minion, the child, the spoiled child, of the House of Commons. For the House
                    of Commons he had a hereditary, an infantine love. Through his whole boyhood the
                    House of Commons was never out of his thoughts, or out of the thoughts of his
                    instructors. Reciting at his father’s knee, reading Thucydides and Cicero into
                    English, analysing the great Attic speeches on the Embassy and on the Crown, he
                    was constantly in training for the conflicts of the House of Commons. He was a
                    distinguished member of the House of Commons at twenty-one. The ability which he
                    had displayed in the House of Commons made him the most powerful subject in
                    Europe before he was twenty-five. It would have been happy for himself and for
                    his country if his elevation had been deferred. Eight or ten years, during which
                    he would have had leisure and opportunity for reading and reflexion, for foreign
                    travel, for social intercourse and free exchange of thought on equal terms with
                    a great variety of companions, would have supplied what, without any fault on
                    his part, was wanting to his powerful intellect. He had all the knowledge that
                    he could be expected to have—that is to say, all the knowledge that a man can
                    acquire while he is a student at Cambridge, a"nd all the knowledge that a man
                    can acquire when he is first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the
                    exchequer. But the stock of general information which he brought from college,
                    extraordinary for a boy, was far inferior to what Fox possessed, and beggarly
                    when compared with the massy, the splendid, the various treasures laid up in the
                    large mind of Burke. After Pitt became minister, he had no leisure to learn more
                    than was necessary for the purposes of the day which was passing over him. What
                    was necessary for those purposes such a man could learn with little difficulty.
                    He was surrounded by experienced and able public servants. He could at any
                    moment command their best assistance. From the stores which they produced his
                    vigorous mind rapidly collected the materials for a good parliamentary case; and
                    that was enough. Legislation and administration were with him secondary matters.
                    To the work of framing statutes, of negotiating treaties, of organizing fleets
                    and armies, of sending forth expeditions, he gave only the leavings of his time
                    and the dregs of his fine intellect. The strength and sap of his mind were all
                    drawn in a different direction. It was when the House of Commons was to be
                    convinced and persuaded that he put forth all his powers.</p>
                <p>Of those powers we must form our estimate chiefly from tradition; for, of all the
                    eminent speakers of the last age, Pitt has suffered most from the reporters.
                    Even while he was still living, critics remarked that his eloquence could not be
                    preserved, that he must be heard to be appreciated. They more than once applied
                    to him the sentence in which Tacitus describes the fate of a senator whose
                    rhetoric was admired in the Augustan age: “Haterii canorum illud et profluens
                    cum ipso simul exstinctum est.” There is, however, abundant evidence that nature
                    had bestowed on Pitt the talents or a great orator; and those talents had been
                    developed in a very peculiar manner, first by his education, and secondly by the
                    high official position to which he rose early, and in which he passed the
                    greater part of his public life.</p>
                <p>At his first appearance in parliament he showed himself superior to all his
                    contemporaries in command of language. He could pour forth a long succession of
                    round and stately periods, without premeditation, without ever pausing for a
                    word, without ever Repeating a word, in a voice of silver clearness, and with a
                    pronunciation so articulate that not a letter was slurred over. He had less
                    amplitude of mind and less richness of imagination than Burke, less ingenuity
                    than Windham, less wit than Sheridan, less perfect mastery of dialectical fence
                    and less of that highest sort of eloquence which consists of reason and passion
                    fused together than Fox. Yet the almost unanimous judgment of those who were in
                    the habit of listening to that remarkable race of men placed Pitt, as a speaker,
                    above Burke, above Windham, above Sheridan, and not below Fox. His declamation
                    was copious, polished, and splendid. In power of sarcasm he was probably not
                    surpassed by any speaker, ancient or modern; and of this formidable weapon he
                    made merciless use. In two parts of the oratorical art which are of the highest
                    value to a minister of state he was singularly expert. No man knew better how to
                    be luminous or how to be obscure. When he wished to be understood, he never
                    failed to make himself understood. He could with ease present to his audience,
                    not perhaps an exact or profound, but a clear, popular, and plausible view of
                    the most extensive and complicated subject. Nothing was out of place; nothing
                    was forgotten; minute details, dates, sums of money, were all faithfully
                    preserved in his memory. Even intricate questions of finance, when explained by
                    him, seemed clear to the plainest man among his hearers. On the other hand, when
                    he did not wish to be explicit,— and no man who is at the head of affairs always
                    wishes to be explicit,—he had a marvellous power of saying nothing in language
                    which left on his audience the impression that he had said a great deal. He was
                    at once the only man who could open a budget without notes, and the only man
                    who, as Windham said, could speak that most elaborately evasive and unmeaning of
                    human compositions, a king’s speech, without premeditation.</p>
                <p>The effect of oratory will always to a great extent depend on the character of
                    the orator. There perhaps never were two speakers whose eloquence had more of
                    what may be called the race, more of the flavour imparted by moral qualities,
                    than Fox and Pitt. The speeches of Fox owe a great part of their charm to that
                    warmth and softness of heart, that sympathy with human suffering, that
                    admiration for everything great and beautiful, and that hatred of cruelty and
                    injustice, which interest and delight us even in the most defective reports. No
                    person, on the other hand, could hear Pitt without perceiving him to be a man of
                    high, intrepid, and commanding spirit, proudly conscious of his own rectitude
                    and of his own intellectual superiority, incapable of the low vices of fear and
                    envy, but too prone to feel and to show disdain. Pride, indeed, pervaded the
                    whole man, was written in the harsh, rigid lines of his face, was marked by the
                    way in which he walked, in which he sat, in which he stood, and, above all, in
                    which he bowed. Such pride, of course, inflicted many wounds. It may confidently
                    be affirmed that there cannot be found, in all the ten thousand invectives
                    written against Fox, a word indicating that his demeanour had ever made a single
                    personal enemy. On the other hand, several men of note who had been partial to
                    Pitt, and who to the last continued to approve his public conduct and to support
                    his administration—Cumberland, for example, Boswell, and Matthias—were so much
                    irritated by the contempt with which he treated them, that they complained in
                    print of their wrongs. But his pride, though it made him bitterly disliked by
                    individuals, inspired the great body of his followers in parliament and
                    throughout the country with respect and confidence. They took him at his own
                    valuation. They saw that his self-esteem was not that of an upstart who was
                    drunk with good luck and with applause, and who, if fortune turned, would sink
                    from arrogance into abject humility. It was that of the magnanimous man so
                    finely described by Aristotle in <pb break="no"

                    thinks himself worthy of great things, being in truth worthy. It sprang from a
                    consciousness of great powers and great virtues, and was never so conspicuously
                    displayed as in the midst of difficulties and dangers which would have unnerved
                    and bowed down any ordinary mind. It was closely connected, too, with an
                    ambition which had no mixture of low cupidity. There was something noble in the
                    cynical disdain with which the mighty minister scattered riches and titles to
                    right and left among those who valued them, while he spurned them out of his
                    way. Poor himself, he was surrounded by friends on whom he had bestowed three
                    thousand, six thousand, ten thousand a year. Plain Mister himself, he had made
                    more lords than any three ministers that had preceded him. The garter, for which
                    the first dukes in the kingdom were contending, was repeatedly offered to him,
                    and offered in vain.</p>
                <p>The correctness of his private life added much to the dignity of his public
                    character. In the relations of son, brother, uncle, master, friend, his conduct
                    was exemplary. In the small circle of his intimate associates he was amiable,
                    affectionate, even playful. They loved him sincerely; they regretted him long;
                    and they would hardly admit that he who was so kind and gentle with them could
                    be stern and haughty with others. He indulged, indeed, somewhat too freely in
                    wine, which he had early been directed to take as a medicine, and which use had
                    made a necessary of life to him. But it was very seldom that any indication of
                    undue excess could be detected in his tones or gestures; and, in truth, two
                    bottles of port were little more to him than two dishes of tea. He had, when he
                    was first introduced into the clubs of St James’s Street, shown a strong taste
                    for play; but he had the prudence and the resolution to stop before this taste
                    had acquired the strength of habit. From the passion which generally exercises
                    the most tyrannical dominion over the young he possessed an immunity, which is
                    probably to be ascribed partly to his temperament and partly to his situation.
                    His constitution was feeble; he was very shy; and he was very busy. The
                    strictness of his morals furnished such buffoons as Peter Pindar and Captain
                    Morris with an inexhaustible theme for merriment of no very delicate kind. But
                    the great body of the middle class of Englishmen could not see the joke. They
                    warmly praised the young statesman for commanding his passions, and for covering
                    his frailties, if he had frailties, with decorous obscurity, and would have been
                    very far indeed from thinking better of him if he had vindicated himself from
                    the taunts of his enemies by taking under his protection a Nancy Parsons or a
                    Marianne Clark.</p>
                <p>No part of the immense popularity which Pitt long enjoyed is to be attributed to
                    the eulogies of wits and poets. It might have been naturally expected that a man
                    of genius, of learning, of taste, an orator whose diction was often compared to
                    that of Tully, the representative, too, of a great university, would have taken
                    a peculiar pleasure in befriending eminent writers to whatever political party
                    they might have belonged. The love of literature had induced Augustus to heap
                    benefits on Pompeians, Somers to be the protector of nonjurors, Harley to make
                    the fortunes of Whigs. But it could not move Pitt to show any favour even to
                    Pittites. He was doubtless right in thinking that, in general, poetry, history,
                    and philosophy ought to be suffered, like calico and cutlery, to find their
                    proper price in the market, and that to teach men of letters to look habitually
                    to the state for their recompense is bad for the state and bad for letters.
                    Assuredly nothing can be more absurd or mischievous than to waste the public
                    money in bounties for the purpose of inducing people who ought to be weighing
                    out grocery or measuring out drapery to write bad or middling books. But, though
                    the sound rule is that authors should be left to be remunerated by their
                    readers, there will, in every generation, be a few exceptions to this rule. To
                    distinguish these special cases from the mass is an employment well worthy of
                    the faculties of a great and accomplished ruler; and Pitt would assuredly have
                    had little difficulty in finding such cases. While he was in power, the greatest
                    philologist of the age, his own contemporary at Cambridge, was reduced to earn a
                    livelihood by the lowest literary drudgery, and to spend in writing squibs for
                    the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> years to which we might have owed
                    an all but perfect text of the whole tragic and comic drama of Athens. The
                    greatest historian of the age, forced by poverty to leave his country, completed
                    his immortal work on the shores of Lake Leman. The political heterodoxy of
                    Porson and the religious heterodoxy of Gibbon may perhaps be pleaded in defence
                    of the minister by whom those eminent men were neglected. But there were other
                    cases in which no such excuse could be set up. Scarcely had Pitt obtained
                    possession of unbounded power when an aged writer of the highest eminence, who
                    had made very little by his writings, and who was sinking into the grave under a
                    load of infirmities and sorrows, wanted five or six hundred pounds to enable
                    him, during the winter or two which might still remain to him, to draw his
                    breath more easily in the soft climate of Italy. Not a farthing was to be
                    obtained; and before Christmas the author of the <hi rend="italic">English
                    Dictionary</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Poets</hi> had gasped
                    his last in the river fog and coal smoke of Fleet Street. A few months after the
                    death of Johnson appeared the <hi rend="italic">Task,</hi> incomparably the best
                    poem that any Englishman then living had produced—a poem, too, which could
                    hardly fail to excite in a well-constituted mind a feeling of esteem and
                    compassion for the poet, a man of genius and virtue, whose means were scanty,
                    and whom the most cruel of all the calamities incident to humanity had made
                    incapable of supporting himself by vigorous and sustained exertion. Nowhere had
                    Chatham been praised with more enthusiasm, or in verse more worthy of the
                    subject, than in the <hi rend="italic">Task.</hi> The son of Chatham, however,
                    contented himself with reading and admiring the book, and left the author to
                    starve. The pension which long after enabled poor Cowper to close his melancholy
                    life unmolested by duns and bailiffs was obtained for him by the strenuous
                    kindness of Lord Spencer. What a contrast between the way in which Pitt acted
                    towards Johnson and the way in which Lord Grey acted towards his political enemy
                    Scott, when Scott, worn out by misfortune and disease, was advised to try the
                    effect of the Italian air! What a contrast between the way in which Pitt acted
                    towards Cowper and the way in which Burke, a poor man and out of place, acted
                    towards Crabbe! Even Dundas, who made no pretensions to literary taste, and was
                    content to be considered as a hard-headed and somewhat coarse man of business,
                    was, when compared with his eloquent and classically educated friend, a Maecenas
                    or a Leo. Dundas made Burns an exciseman, with seventy pounds a year; and this
                    was more than Pitt, during his long tenure of power, did for the encouragement
                    of letters. Even those who may think that it is, in general, no part of the duty
                    of a Government to reward literary merit, will hardly deny that a Government
                    which has much lucrative church preferment in its gift is bound, in distributing
                    that preferment, not to overlook divines whose writings have rendered great
                    service to the cause of religion. But it seems never to have occurred to Pitt
                    that he lay under any such obligation. All the theological works of all the
                    numerous bishops whom he made and translated are not, when put together, worth
                    fifty pages of the <hi rend="italic">Horae Paulinae,</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Natural Theology,</hi> or of the <hi rend="italic">View of the
                    Evidences of Christianity.</hi> But on Paley the all-powerful minister never
                    bestowed the smallest benefice. Artists Pitt treated as contemptuously as
                    writers. For painting he did simply nothing. Sculptors who had been selected to
                    execute monuments voted by parliament had to haunt the ante-chambers of the
                    treasury during many years before they could obtain a farthing from him. One of
                    them, after vainly soliciting the minister for payment during fourteen years,
                    had the courage to present a memorial to the king, and thus obtained tardy and
                    ungracious justice. Architects it was absolutely necessary to employ; and the
                    worst that could be found seem to have been employed. Not a single fine public
                    building of any kind or in any style was erected during his long administration.
                    It may be confidently affirmed that no ruler whose abilities and attainments
                    would bear any comparison with his has ever shown such cold disdain for what is
                    excellent in arts and letters.</p>
                <p>His first administration lasted seventeen years. That long period is divided by a
                    strongly marked line into two almost exactly equal parts. The first part ended
                    and the second began in the autumn of 1792. Throughout both parts Pitt displayed
                    in the highest degree the talents of a parliamentary leader. During the first
                    part he was a fortunate and in many respects a skilful administrator. With the
                    difficulties which he had to encounter during the second part he was altogether
                    incapable of contending; but his eloquence and his perfect mastery of the
                    tactics of the House of Commons concealed his incapacity from the multitude.</p>
                <p>The eight years which followed the general election of 1784 were as tranquil and
                    prosperous as any eight years in the whole history of England. Neighbouring
                    nations which had lately been in arms against her, and which had flattered
                    themselves that, in losing her American colonies, she had lost a chief source of
                    her wealth and of her power, saw, with -wonder and vexation, that she ¼ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> as more wealthy and more powerful than ever. Her
                    trade increased. Her manufactures flourished. Her exchequer was full to
                    overflowing. Very idle apprehensions were generally entertained that the public
                    debt, though much less than a third of the debt which we now bear with ease,
                    would be found too heavy for the strength of the nation. Those apprehensions
                    might not perhaps have been easily quieted by reason. But Pitt quieted them by a
                    juggle. He succeeded in pursuading first himself and then the whole nation, his
                    opponents included, that a new sinking fund, which, so far as it differed from
                    former sinking funds, differed for the worse, would, by virtue of some
                    mysterious power of propagation belonging to money, put into the pocket of the
                    public creditor great sums not taken out of the pocket of the tax-payer. The
                    country, terrified by a danger which was no danger, hailed with delight and
                    boundless confidence a remedy which was no remedy. The minister was almost
                    universally extolled as the greatest of financiers. Meanwhile both the branches
                    of the house of Bourbon found that England was as formidable an antagonist as
                    she had ever been. France had formed a plan for reducing Holland to vassalage.
                    But England interposed, and France receded. Spain interrupted by <pb break="no"

                    regions near the Oregon. But England armed, and Spain receded. Within the island
                    there was profound tranquillity. The king was, for the first time, popular.
                    During the twenty-three years which had followed his accession he had not been
                    loved by his subjects. His domestic virtues were acknowledged. But it was
                    generally thought that the good qualities by which he was distinguished in
                    private life were wanting to his political character. As a sovereign he was
                    resentful, unforgiving, stubborn, cunning. Under his rule the country had
                    sustained cruel disgraces and disasters; and every one of those disgraces and
                    disasters was imputed to his strong antipathies, and to his perverse obstinacy
                    in the wrong. One statesman after another complained that he had been induced by
                    royal caresses, entreaties, and promises to undertake the direction of affairs
                    at a difficult conjuncture, and that as soon as he had, not without sullying his
                    fame and alienating his best friends, served the turn for which he was wanted,
                    his ungrateful master began to intrigue against him and to canvass against him.
                    Grenville, Rockingham, Chatham—men of widely different characters, but all three
                    upright and high-spirited—agreed in thinking that the prince under whom they had
                    successively held the highest place in the Government was one of the most
                    insincere of mankind. His confidence was reposed, they said, notin those known
                    and responsible counsellors to whom he had delivered the seals of office, but in
                    secret advisers who stole up the back stairs into his closet. In parliament his
                    ministers, while defending themselves against the attacks of the opposition in
                    front, were perpetually, at his instigation, assailed on the flank or in the
                    rear by a vile band of mercenaries who called themselves his friends. These men
                    constantly, while in possession of lucrative places in his service, spoke and
                    voted against bills which he had authorized the first lord of the treasury or
                    the secretary of state to bring in. But from the day on which Pitt was placed at
                    the head of affairs there was an end of secret influence. His haughty and
                    aspiring spirit was not to be satisfied with the mere show of power. Any attempt
                    to undermine him at court, any mutinous movement among his followers in the
                    House of Commons, was certain to be at once put down. He had only to tender his
                    resignation and he could dictate his own terms. For he, and he alone, stood
                    between the king and the coalition. He was therefore little less than mayor of
                    the palace. The nation loudly applauded the king for having the wisdom to repose
                    entire confidence in so excellent a minister. His Majesty’s private virtues now
                    began to produce their full effect. He was generally regarded as the model of a
                    respectable country gentleman, honest, goodnatured, sober, religious. He rose
                    early, he dined temperately, he was strictly faithful to his wife, he never
                    missed church, and at church he never missed a response. His people heartily
                    prayed that he might long reign over them; and they prayed the more heartily
                    because his virtues were set off to the best advantage by the vices and follies
                    of the prince of Wales, who lived in close intimacy with the chiefs of the
                    Opposition.</p>
                <p>How strong this feeling was in the public mind appeared signally on one great
                    occasion. In the autumn of 1788 the king became insane. The Opposition, eager
                    for office, committed the great indiscretion of asserting that the heir apparent
                    had, by the fundamental laws of England, a right to be regent with the full
                    powers of royalty. Pitt, on the other hand, maintained it to be the
                    constitutional doctrine that when a sovereign is, by reason of infancy, disease,
                    or absence, incapable of exercising the regal functions, it belongs to the
                    estates of the realm to determine who shall be the vicegerent, and with what
                    portion of the executive authority such vicegerent shall be entrusted. A long
                    and violent contest followed, in which Pitt was supported by the great body of
                    the people with as much enthusiasm as during the first months of his
                    administration. Tories with one voice applauded him for defending the sickbed of
                    a virtuous and unhappy sovereign against a disloyal faction and an undutiful
                    son. Not a few Whigs applauded him for asserting the authority of parliaments,
                    and the principles of the Revolution, in opposition to a doctrine which seemed
                    to have too much affinity with the servile theory of indefeasible hereditary
                    right. The middle class, always zealous on the side of decency and the domestic
                    virtues, looked forward with dismay to a reign resembling that of Charles II.
                    The palace, which had now been, during thirty years, the pattern of an English
                    home, would be a public nuisance, a school of profligacy. To the good king’s
                    repast of mutton and lemonade, despatched at three o’clock, would succeed
                    midnight banquets, from which the guests would be carried home speechless. To
                    the backgammon board at which the good king played for a little silver with his
                    equerries would succeed faro tables from which young patricians λvho had sat
                    down rich would rise up beggars. The drawing-room, from which the frown of the
                    queen had repelled a whole generation of frail beauties, would now be again what
                    it had been in the days of Barbara Palmer and Louisa de Querouaille. Nay,
                    severely as the public reprobated the prince’s many illicit attachments, his one
                    virtuous attachment was reprobated more severely still. Even in grave and pious
                    circles his Protestant mistresses gave less scandal than his Popish wife. That
                    he must be regent nobody ventured to deny. But he and his friends were so
                    unpopular that Pitt could, with general approbation, propose to limit the powers
                    of the regent by restrictions to which it would have been impossible to subject
                    a prince beloved and trusted by the country. Some interested men, fully
                    expecting a change of administration, went over to the Opposition. But the
                    majority, purified by these desertions, closed its ranks, and presented a more
                    firm array than ever to the enemy. In every division Pitt was victorious. When
                    at length, after a stormy interregnum of three months, it was announced, on the
                    very eve of the inauguration of the regent, that the king was himself again, the
                    nation was wild with delight. On the evening of the day on which His Majesty
                    resumed his functions a spontaneous illumination, the most general that had ever
                    been seen in England, brightened the whole vast space from Highgate to Tooting,
                    and from Hammersmith to Greenwich. On the day on which he returned thanks in the
                    cathedral of his capital all the horses and carriages within a hundred miles of
                    Loudon were too few for the multitudes which flocked to see him pass through the
                    streets. A second illumination followed, which was even superior to the first in
                    magnificence. Pitt with difficulty escaped from the tumultuous kindness of an
                    innumerable multitude which insisted on drawing his coach from St Paul’s
                    Churchyard to Downing Street. This was the moment at which his fame and fortune
                    may be said to have reached the zenith. His influence in the closet was as great
                    as that of Carr or Villiers had been. His dominion over the parliament was more
                    absolute than that of Walpole or Pelham had been. He was at the same time as
                    high in the favour of the populace as ever Wilkes or Sacheverell had been.
                    Nothing did more to raise his character than his noble poverty. It was well
                    known that, if he had been dismissed from office after more than five years of
                    boundless power, he would hardly have carried out with him a sum sufficient to
                    furnish the set of chambers in which, as he cheerfully declared, he meant to
                    resume the practice of the law. His admirers, however, were by no means disposed
                    to suffer him to depend on daily toil for his daily bread. The voluntary
                    contributions which were awaiting his acceptance in the city of London alone
                    would have sufficed to make him a rich man. But it may be doubted whether his
                    haughty spirit would haye stooped to accept a provision so honourably earned and
                    so honourably bestowed.</p>
                <p>To such a height of power and glory had this extraordinary man risen at
                    twenty-nine years of age. And now the tide was on the turn. Only ten days after
                    the triumphant procession to St Paul’s, the states-general of France, after an
                    interval of a hundred and seventy-four years, met at Versailles.</p>
                <p>The nature of the great Revolution which followed was long very imperfectly
                    understood in this country. Burke saw much further than any of his
                    contemporaries; but whatever his sagacity descried was refracted and discoloured
                    by his passions and his imagination. More than three years elapsed before the
                    principles of the English administration underwent any material change. Nothing
                    could as yet be milder or more strictly constitutional than the minister’s
                    domestic policy. Not a single act indicating an arbitrary temper or a jealousy
                    of the people could be imputed to him. He had never applied to parliament for
                    any extraordinary powers. He had never used with harshness the ordinary powers
                    entrusted by the constitution to the executive Government. Not a single state
                    prosecution which would even now be called oppressive had been instituted by
                    him. Indeed, the only oppressive state prosecution instituted during the first
                    eight years of his administration was that of Stockdale, which is to be
                    attributed, not to the Government, but to the chiefs of the Opposition. In
                    office, Pitt had redeemed the pledges which he had, at his entrance into public
                    life, given to the supporters of parliamentary reform. He had, in 1785, brought
                    forward a judicious plan for the improvement of the representative system, and
                    had prevailed on the king, not only to refrain from talking against that plan,
                    but to recommend it to the Houses in a speech from the throne.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The speech with which the
                    king opened the session of 1785 concluded with an assurance that His Majesty
                    would heartily concur in every measure which could tend to secure the true
                    principles of the constitution. These words were at the time understood to refer
                    to Pitt’s Reform Bill.</p></note> This attempt failed; but there can be little
                    doubt that, if the French Revolution had not produced a violent reaction of
                    public feeling, Pitt would have performed, with little difficulty and no danger,
                    that great work which, at a later period, Lord Grey could accomplish only by
                    means which for a time loosened the very foundations of the commonwealth. When
                    the atrocities of the slave trade were first brought under the consideration of
                    parliament, no abolitionist was more zealous than Pitt. When sickness prevented
                    Wilberforce from appearing in public, his place was most efficiently supplied by
                    his friend the minister. A humane bill, which mitigated the horrors of the
                    middle passage, was, in 1788, carried by the eloquence and determined spirit of
                    Pitt, in spite of the opposition of some of his own colleagues; and it ought
                    always to be remembered to his honour that, in order to carry that bill, he kept
                    the Houses sitting, in spite of many murmurs, long after the business of the
                    Government had been done <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0153-0144"/> and the Appropriation Act passed. In 1791 he
                    cordially concurred with Fox in maintaining the sound constitutional doctrine
                    that an impeachment is not terminated by a dissolution. In the course of the
                    same year the two great rivals contended side by side in a far more important
                    cause. They are fairly entitled to divide the high honour of having added to our
                    statute-book the inestimable law which places the liberty of the press under the
                    protection of juries. On one occasion, and one alone, Pitt, during the first
                    half of his long administration, acted in a manner unworthy of an enlightened
                    Whig. In the debate on the Test Act, he stooped to gratify the master whom he
                    served, the university which he represented, and the great body of clergymen and
                    country gentlemen on whose support he rested, by talking, with little heartiness
                    indeed, and with no asperity, the language of a Tory. With this single
                    exception, his conduct from the end of 1783 to the middle of 1792 was that of an
                    honest friend of civil and religious liberty.</p>
                <p>Nor did anything, during that period, indicate that he loved war, or harboured
                    any malevolent feeling against any neighbouring nation. Those French writers who
                    have represented him as a Hannibal sworn in childhood by his father to bear
                    eternal hatred to France, as having, by mysterious intrigues and lavish bribes,
                    instigated the leading Jacobins to commit those excesses which dishonoured the
                    Revolution, as having been the real author of the first coalition, know nothing
                    of his character or of his history. So far was he from being a deadly enemy to
                    France that his laudable attempts to bring about a closer connexion with that
                    country by means of a wise and liberal treaty of commerce brought on him the
                    severe censure of the Opposition. He was told in the House of Commons that he
                    was a degenerate son, and that his partiality for the hereditary foes of our
                    island was enough to make his great father’s bones stir under the pavement of
                    the Abbey.</p>
                <p>And this man, whose name, if he had been so fortunate as to die in 1792, would
                    now have been associated with peace, with freedom, with philanthropy, with
                    temperate reform, with mild and constitutional administration, lived to
                    associate his name with arbitrary government, with harsh laws harshly executed,
                    with alien bills, with gagging bills, with suspensions of the Habeas Corpus Act,
                    with cruel punishments inflicted on some political agitators, with unjustifiable
                    prosecutions instituted against others, and with the most costly and most
                    sanguinary wars of modern times. He lived to be held up to obloquy as the stern
                    oppressor of England, and the indefatigable disturber of Europe. Poets,
                    contrasting his earlier with his later years, likened him sometimes to the
                    apostle who kissed in order to betray, and sometimes to the evil angels who kept
                    not their first estate. A satirist of great genius introduced the fiends of
                    famine, slaughter, and fire, proclaiming that they had received their commission
                    from one whose name was formed of four letters, and promising to give their
                    employer ample proofs of gratitude. Famine would gnaw the multitude till they
                    should rise up against him in madness. The demon of slaughter would impel them
                    to tear him from limb to limb. But fire boasted that she alone could reward him
                    as he deserved, and that she would cling round him to all eternity. By the
                    French press and the French tribune every crime that disgraced and every
                    calamity that afflicted France was ascribed to the monster Pitt and his guineas.
                    While the Jacobins were dominant it was he who had corrupted the Gironde, who
                    had raised Lyons and Bordeaux against the Convention, who had suborned Paris to
                    assassinate Lepelletier, and Cecilia Régnault to assassinate Robespierre. When
                    the Thermidorian reaction came, all the atrocities of the Reign of Terror were
                    imputed to him. Collot D’Herbois and Fouquier Tinville had been his pensioners.
                    It was he who had hired the murderers of September, who had dictated the
                    pamphlets of Marat and the carmagnoles of Barere, who had paid Lebon to deluge
                    Arras with blood and Carrier to choke the Loire with corpses.</p>
                <p>The truth is that he liked neither war nor arbitrary government. He was a lover
                    of peace and freedom, driven, by a stress against which it was hardly possible
                    for any will or any intellect to struggle, out of the course to which his
                    inclinations pointed, and for which his abilities and acquirements fitted him,
                    and forced into a policy repugnant to his feelings and unsuited to his
                    talents.</p>
                <p>The charge of apostasy is grossly unjust. A man ought no more to be called an
                    apostate because his opinions alter with the opinions of the great body of his
                    contemporaries than he ought to be called an Oriental traveller because he is
                    always going round from west to east with the globe and everything that is upon
                    it. Between the spring of 1789 and the close of 1792 the public mind of England
                    underwent a great change. If the change of Pitt’s sentiments attracted peculiar
                    notice, it was not because he changed more than his neighbours, for in fact he
                    changed less than most of them, but because his position was far more
                    conspicuous than theirs, 'because he was, till Bonaparte appeared, the
                    individual who filled the greatest space in the eyes of the inhabitants of the
                    civilized world. During a short time the nation, and Pitt as one of the nation,
                    looked with interest and approbation on the French Revolution. But soon vast
                    confiscations, the violent sweeping away of ancient institutions, the domination
                    of clubs, the barbarities of mobs maddened by famine and hatred, produced a
                    reaction here. The court, the nobility, the gentry, the clergy, the
                    manufacturers, the merchants, in short nineteen-twentieths of those who had good
                    roofs over their heads and good coats on their backs, became eager intolerant
                    Antijacobins. This feeling was at least as strong among the minister’s
                    adversaries as among nis supporters. Fox in vain attempted to restrain his
                    followers. All his genius, all his vast personal influence, could not prevent
                    them from rising up against him in general mutiny. Burke set the example of
                    revolt; and Burke was in no long time joined by Portland, Spencer, Fitzwilliam,
                    Loughborough, Carlisle, Malmesbury, Windham, Elliot. In the House of Commons the
                    followers of the great Whig statesman and orator diminished from about a hundred
                    and sixty to fifty. In the House of Lords he had but ten or twelve adherents
                    left. There can be no doubt that there would have been a similar mutiny on the
                    ministerial benches, if Pitt had obstinately resisted the general wish. Pressed
                    at once by his master and by his colleagues, by old friends and by old
                    opponents, he abandoned, slowly and reluctantly, the policy which was dear to
                    his heart. He laboured hard to avert the European war. When the European war
                    broke out, he still flattered himself that it would not be necessary for this
                    country to take either side. In the spring of 1792 he congratulated the
                    parliament on the prospect of long and profound peace, and proved his sincerity
                    by proposing large remissions of taxation. Down to the end of that year he
                    continued to cherish the hope that England might be able to preserve neutrality.
                    But the passions which raged on both sides of the Channel were not to be
                    restrained. The republicans who ruled France were inflamed by a fanaticism
                    resembling that of the Mussulmans, who, with the Koran in one hand and the sword
                    in the other, went forth conquering and converting, eastward to the Bay of
                    Bengal, and westward to the Pillars of Hercules. The higher and middle classes
                    of England were animated by zeal not less fiery than that of the crusaders who
                    raised the cry of <hi rend="italic">Deus vult</hi> at Clermont. The impulse
                    which drove the two nations to a collision was not to be arrested by the
                    abilities or by the authority of any single man. As Pitt was in front of his
                    fellows, and towered high above them, he seemed to lead them. But in fact he was
                    violently pushed on by them, and, had he held back but a little more than he
                    did, would have been thrust out of their way or trampled under their feet.</p>
                <p>He yielded to the current; and from that day his misfortunes began. The truth is
                    that there were only two consistent courses before him. Since he did not choose
                    to oppose himself, side by side with Fox, to the public feeling, he should have
                    taken the advice of Burke, and should have availed himself of that feeling to
                    the full extent. If it was impossible to preserve peace, he should have adopted
                    the only policy which could lead to victory. He should have proclaimed a holy
                    war for religion, morality, property, order, public law, and should have thus
                    opposed to the Jacobins an energy equal to their own. Unhappily he tried to find
                    a middle path; and he found one which united all that was worst in both
                    extremes. He went to war; but he would not understand the peculiar character of
                    that war. He was obstinately blind to the plain fact that he was contending
                    against a state which was also a sect, and that the new quarrel between England
                    and France was of quite a different kind from the old quarrels about colonies in
                    America and fortresses in the Netherlands. He had to combat frantic enthusiasm,
                    boundless ambition, restless activity, the wildest and most audacious spirit of
                    innovation; and he acted as if he had had to deal with the harlots and fops of
                    the old court of Versailles, with Madame de Pompadour and the Abbé de Bemis. It
                    was pitiable to hear him, year after year, proving to an admiring audience that
                    the wicked republic λvas exhausted, that she could not hold out, that her credit
                    was gone, that her assignats were not worth more than the paper of which they
                    were made,—as if credit was necessary to a government of which the principle was
                    rapine, as if Alboin could not turn Italy into a desert till he had negotiated a
                    loan at five per cent., as if the exchequer bills of Attila had been at par. It
                    was impossible that a man who so completely mistook the nature of a contest
                    could carry on that contest successfully. Great as Pitt’s abilities were, his
                    military administration was that of a driveller. He was at the head of a nation
                    engaged in a struggle for life and death, of a nation eminently distinguished by
                    all the physical and all the moral qualities which make excellent soldiers. The
                    resources at his command were unlimited. The parliament was even more ready to
                    grant him men and money than he was to ask for them. In such an emergency, and
                    with such means, such a statesman as Richelieu, as Louvois, as Chatham, as
                    Wellesley, would have created in a few months one of the finest armies in the
                    world, and would soon have discovered and brought forward generals worthy to
                    command such an army. Germany might have been saved by another Blenheim;
                    Flanders recovered by another Ramillies; another Poitiers might have delivered
                    the Royalist and Catholic provinces of France from a yoke which they abhorred,
                    and might have spread terror even to the barriers of Paris. But the fact is
                    that, after eight years of war, after a vast destruction of life, after an
                    expenditure of wealth <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n154/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0154-0145"/> far exceeding the expenditure of the American
                    War, of the Seven Years’ War, of the War of the Austrian Succession, and of the
                    War of the Spanish Succession united, the English army under Pitt was the
                    laughing-stock of all Europe. It could not boast of one single brilliant
                    exploit. It had never shown itself on the Continent but to be beaten, chased,
                    forced to re-embark, or forced to capitulate. To take some sugar island in the
                    West Indies, to scatter some mob of half-naked Irish peasants—such were the most
                    splendid victories won by the British troops under Pitt’s auspices.</p>
                <p>The English navy no mismanagement could ruin. But during a long period whatever
                    mismanagement could do was done. The earl of Chatham, without a single
                    qualification for high public trust, was made, by fraternal partiality, first
                    lord of the admiralty, and was kept in that great post during two years of a war
                    in which the very existence of the state depended on the efficiency of the
                    fleet. He continued to doze away and trifle away the time which ought to have
                    been devoted to the public service, till the whole mercantile body, though
                    generally disposed to support the Government, com-Ïlained bitterly that our flag
                    gave no protection to our trade.</p>
                <p>'ortunately he was succeeded by George, Earl Spencer, one of those chiefs of the
                    Whig party who, in the great schism caused by the French Revolution, had
                    followed Burke. Lord Spencer, though inferior to many of his colleagues as an
                    orator, was decidedly the best administrator among them. To him it was owing
                    that a long and gloomy succession of days of fasting, and most emphatically of
                    humiliation, was interrupted, twice in the short space of eleven months, by days
                    of thanksgiving for great victories.</p>
                <p>It may seem paradoxical to say that the incapacity which Pitt showed in all that
                    related to the conduct of the war is, in some sense, the most decisive proof
                    that he was a man of very extraordinary abilities. Yet this is the simple truth.
                    For assuredly one-tenth part of his errors and disasters λvould have been fatal
                    to the power and influence of any minister who had not possessed, in the highest
                    degree, the talents of a parliamentary leader. While his schemes were
                    confounded, while his predictions were falsified, while the coalitions which he
                    had laboured to form were falling to pieces, while the expeditions which he had
                    sent forth at enormous cost were ending in rout and disgrace, while the enemy
                    against whom he was feebly contending was subjugating Flanders and Brabant, the
                    electorate of Mainz and the electorate of Treves, Holland, Piedmont, Liguria,
                    Lombardy, his authority over the House of Commons was constantly becoming more
                    and more absolute. There was his empire. There were his victories—his Lodi and
                    his Arcola, his Rivoli and his Marengo. If some great misfortune, a pitched
                    battle lost by the allies, the annexation of a new department to the French
                    republic, a sanguinary insurrection in Ireland, a mutiny in the fleet, a panic
                    in the city, a run on the bank, had spread dismay through the ranks of his
                    majority, that dismay lasted only till he rose from the treasury bench, drew up
                    his haughty head, stretched his arm with commanding gesture, and poured forth,
                    in deep and sonorous tones, the lofty language of inextinguishable hope and
                    inflexible resolution. Thus, through a long and calamitous period, every
                    disaster that happened without the walls of parliament was regularly followed by
                    a triumph within them. At length he had no longer an Opposition to encounter. Of
                    the great party which had contended against him during the first eight years of
                    his administration more than one-half now marched under his standard, with his
                    old competitor the duke of Portland at their head; and the rest had, after many
                    vain struggles, quitted the field in despair. Fox had retired to the shades of
                    St Anne’s Hill, and had there found, in the society of friends whom no
                    vicissitude could estrange from him, of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> woman whom he
                    tenderly loved, and of the illustrious dead of Athens, of Rome, and of Florence,
                    ample compensation for all the misfortunes of his public life. Session followed
                    session with scarcely a single division. In the eventful year 1799 the largest
                    minority that could be mustered against the Government was twenty-five.</p>
                <p>In Pitt’s domestic policy there was at this time assuredly no want of vigour.
                    While he offered to French Jacobinism a resistance so feeble that it only
                    encouraged the evil which he wished to suppress, he put down English Jacobinism
                    with a strong hand. The Habeas Corpus Act was repeatedly suspended. Public
                    meetings were placed under severe restraints. The Government obtained from
                    parliament power to send out of the country aliens who were suspected of evil
                    designs; and that power was not suffered to be idle. Writers who propounded
                    doctrines adverse to monarchy and aristocracy were proscribed and punished
                    λvithout mercy. It was hardly safe for a republican to avow his political creed
                    over his beefsteak and his bottle of port at a chop-house. The old laws of
                    Scotland against sedition, laws which were considered by Englishmen as
                    barbarous, and which a succession of Governments had suffered to rust, were now
                    furbished up and sharpened anew. Men of cultivated minds and polished manners
                    were, for offences which at Westminster would have been treated as mere
                    misdemeanours, sent to herd with felons at Botany Bay. Some reformers, whose
                    opinions were extravagant, and whose language was intemperate, but who had never
                    dreamed of subverting the government by physical force, were indicted for high
                    treason, and were saved from the gallows only by the righteous verdicts of
                    juries. This severity was at the time loudly applauded by alarmists whom fear
                    had made cruel, but will be seen in a very different light by posterity. The
                    truth is that the Englishmen who wished for a revolution were, even in number,
                    not formidable, and in everything but number a faction utterly contemptible,
                    without arms, or funds, or plans, or organization, or leader. There can be no
                    doubt that Pitt, strong as he was in the support of the great body of the
                    nation, might easily have repressed the turbulence of the discontented minority
                    by firmly yet temperately enforcing the ordinary law. Whatever vigour he showed
                    during this unfortunate part of his life was vigour out of place and season. He
                    was all feebleness and languor in his conflict with the foreign enemy who was
                    really to be dreaded, and reserved all his energy and resolution for the
                    domestic enemy who might safely have been despised.</p>
                <p>One part only of Pitt’s conduct during the last eight years of the 18th century
                    deserves high praise. He was the first English minister who formed great designs
                    for the benefit of Ireland. The manner in which the Roman Catholic population of
                    that unfortunate country had been kept down during many generations seemed to
                    him unjust and cruel; and it was scarcely possible for a man of his abilities
                    not to perceive that, in a contest against the Jacobins, the Roman Catholics
                    were his natural allies. Had he been able to do all that he wished, it is
                    probable that a wise and liberal policy would have averted the rebellion of
                    1798. But the difficulties which he encountered were great, perhaps
                    insurmountable; and the Roman Catholics were, rather by his misfortune than by
                    his fault, thrown into the hands of Jacobins. There was a third great rising of
                    the Irishry against the Englishry, a rising not less formidable than the risings
                    of 1641 and 1689. The Englishry remained victorious; and it was necessary for
                    Pitt, as it had been necessary for Oliver Cromwell and William of Orange before
                    him, to consider how the victory should be used. It is only just to his memory
                    to say that he formed a scheme of policy so grand and so simple, so righteous
                    and so humane, that it would alone entitle him to a high place among statesmen.
                    He determined to make Ireland one kingdom with England, and, at the same time,
                    to relieve the Roman Catholic laity from civil disabilities, and to grant a
                    public maintenance to the Roman Catholic clergy. Had he been able to carry these
                    noble designs into effect, the Union would have been a union indeed. It would
                    have been inseparably associated in the minds of the great majority of Irishmen
                    with civil and religious freedom; and the old parliament in College Green would
                    have been regretted only by a small knot of discarded jobbers and oppressors,
                    and would have been remembered by the body of the nation with the loathing and
                    contempt due to the most tyrannical and the most corrupt assembly that had ever
                    sat in Europe. But Pitt could execute only one half of what he had projected. He
                    succeeded in obtaining the consent of the parliaments of both kingdoms to the
                    Union; but that reconciliation of races and sects without which the Union could
                    exist only in name was not accomplished. He was well aware that he was likely to
                    find difficulties in the closet. But he flattered himself that, by cautious and
                    dexterous management, those difficulties might be overcome. Unhappily, there
                    were traitors and sycophanta in high place who did not suffer him to take his
                    own time and his own way, but prematurely disclosed his scheme to the king, and
                    disclosed it in the manner most likely to irritate and alarm a weak and diseased
                    mind. His Majesty absurdly imagined that his coronation oath bound him to refuse
                    his assent to any bill for relieving Roman Catholics from civil disabilities. To
                    argue with him was impossible. Dundas tried to explain the matter, but was told
                    to keep his Scotch metaphysics to himself. Pitt and Pitt’s ablest colleagues
                    resigned their offices. It was necessary that the king should make a new
                    arrangement. But by this time his anger and distress had brought back the malady
                    which had, many years before, incapacitated him for the discharge of his
                    functions. He actually assembled his family, read the coronation oath to them,
                    and told them that, if he broke it, the crown would immediately pass to the
                    house of Savoy. It was not until after an interregnum of several weeks that he
                    regained the full use of his small faculties, and that a ministry after his own
                    heart was at length formed.</p>
                <p>The materials out of which he had to construct a Government were neither solid
                    nor splendid. To that party, weak in numbers, but strong in every kind of
                    talent, which was hostile to the domestic and foreign policy of his late
                    advisers, he could not have recourse. For that party, while it differed from his
                    late advisers on every point on which they had been honoured with his
                    approbation, cordially agreed with them as to the single matter which had
                    brought on them his displeasure. All that was left to him was to call up the
                    rear ranks of the old ministry to form the front rank of a new ministry. In an
                    age pre-eminently fruitful of parliamentary talents, a cabinet was formed
                    containing hardly a single man who in parliamentary talents could be considered
                    as even of the second rate. The most important offices in the state were
                    bestowed on decorous and laborious mediocrity. Henry Addington was at the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n155/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0155-0146"/> head of the treasury. He had been an early,
                    indeed a hereditary, friend of Pitt, and had by Pitt’s influence been placed,
                    while still a young man, in the chair of the House of Commons. He was
                    universally admitted to have been the best Speaker that had sat in that chair
                    since the retirement of Onslow. But nature had not bestowed on him very vigorous
                    faculties; and the highly respectable situation which he long occupied with
                    honour had rather unfitted than fitted him for the discharge of his new duties.
                    His business had been to bear himself evenly between contending factions. He had
                    taken no part in the war of words; and he had always been addressed with marked
                    deference by the great orators who thundered against each other from his right
                    and from his left. It was not strange that when, for the first time, he had to
                    encounter keen and vigorous antagonists, who dealt hard blows without the
                    smallest ceremony, he should have been awkward and unready, or that the air of
                    dignity and authority which he had acquired in his former post, and of which he
                    had not divested himself, should have made his helplessness laughable and
                    pitiable. Nevertheless, during many months, his power seemed to stand firm. He
                    was a favourite with the king, whom he resembled in narrowness of mind, and to
                    whom he was more obsequious than Pitt had ever been. The nation was put into
                    high good humour by a peace with France. The enthusiasm with which the upper and
                    middle classes had rushed into the war had spent itself. Jacobinism was no
                    longer formidable. Everywhere there was a strong reaction against what was
                    called the atheistical and anarchical philosophy of the 18th century. Bonaparte,
                    now first consul, was busied in constructing out of the ruins of old
                    institutions a new ecclesiastical establishment and a new order of knighthood.
                    That nothing less than the dominion of the whole civilized world would satisfy
                    his selfish ambition was not yet suspected; nor did even wise men see any reason
                    to doubt that he might be as safe a neighbour as any prince of the house of
                    Bourbon had been. The treaty of Amiens was therefore hailed by the great body of
                    the English people with extravagant joy. The popularity of the minister was for
                    the moment immense. His want of parliamentary ability was, as yet, of little
                    consequence; for he had scarcely any adversary to encounter. The old Opposition,
                    delighted by the peace, regarded him with favour. A new Opposition had indeed
                    been formed by some of the late ministers, and was led by Grenville in the House
                    of Lords and by Windham in the House of Commons. But the new Opposition could
                    scarcely muster ten votes, and was regarded with no favour by the country. On
                    Pitt the ministers relied as on their firmest support. He had not, like some of
                    his colleagues, retired in anger. He had expressed the greatest respect for the
                    conscientious scruple which had taken possession of the royal mind; and he had
                    promised his successors all the help in his power. In private his advice was at
                    their service. In parliament he took his seat on the bench behind them, and in
                    more than one debate defended them with powers far superior to their own. The
                    king perfectly understood the value of such assistance. On one occasion, at the
                    palace, he took the old minister and the new minister aside. “If we three,” he
                    said, “keep together, all will go well.”</p>
                <p>But it was hardly possible, human nature being what it is, and more especially
                    Pitt and Addington being what they were, that this union should be durable.
                    Pitt, conscious of superior powers, imagined that the place which he had quitted
                    was now occupied by a mere puppet which he had set up, which he was to govern
                    while he suffered it to remain, and which he was to fling aside as soon as he
                    wished to resume his old position. Nor was it long before he began to pine for
                    the power which he had relinquished. He had been so early raised to supreme
                    authority in the state, and had enjoyed that authority so long, that it had
                    become necessary to him. In retirement his days passed heavily. He could not,
                    like Fox, forget the pleasures and cares of ambition in the company of Euripides
                    or Herodotus. Pride restrained him from intimating, even to his dearest friends,
                    that he wished to be again minister. But he thought it strange, almost
                    ungrateful, that his wish had not been divined, that it had not been anticipated
                    by one whom he regarded as his deputy.</p>
                <p>Addington, on the other hand, was by no means inclined to descend from his high
                    position. He was, indeed, under a delusion much resembling that of Abou Hassan
                    in the Arabian tale. His brain was turned by his short and unreal caliphate. He
                    took his elevation quite seriously, attributed it to his own merit, and
                    considered himself as one of the great triumvirate of English statesmen, as
                    worthy to make a third with Pitt and Fox.</p>
                <p>Such being the feelings of the late minister and of the present minister, a
                    rupture was inevitable; and there was no want of persons bent on making that
                    rupture speedy and violent. Some of these persons wounded Addington’s pride by
                    representing him as a lacquey, sent to keep a place on the treasury bench till
                    his master should find it convenient to come. Others took every opportunity of
                    praising him at Pitt’s expense. Pitt had waged a long, a bloody, a costly, an
                    unsuccessful war. Addington had made peace. Pitt had suspended the
                    constitutional liberties of Englishmen. Under Addington those liberties were
                    again enjoyed. Pitt had wasted the public resources. Addington was carefully
                    nursing them. It was sometimes but too evident that these compliments were not
                    unpleasing to Addington. Pitt became cold and reserved. During many months he
                    remained at a distance from London. Meanwhile his most intimate friends, in
                    spite of his declarations that he made no complaint, and that he had no wish for
                    office, exerted themselves to effect a change of ministry. His favourite
                    disciple, George Canning, young, ardent, ambitious, with great powers and great
                    virtues, but with a temper too restless and a wit too satirical for his own
                    happiness, was indefatigable. He spoke; he wrote; he intrigued; he tried to
                    induce a large number of the supporters of the Government to sign a round robin
                    desiring a change; he made game of Addington and of Addington’s relations in a
                    succession of lively pasquinades. The minister s partisans retorted with equal
                    acrimony, if not with equal vivacity. Pitt could keep out of the affray only by
                    keeping out of politics altogether; and this it soon became impossible for him
                    to do. Had Napoleon, content with the first place among the sovereigns of the
                    Continent, and with a military reputation surpassing that of Marlborough or of
                    Turenne, devoted himself to the noble task of making France happy by mild
                    administration and wise legislation, our country might have long continued to
                    tolerate a Government of fair intentions and feeble abilities. Unhappily, the
                    treaty of Amiens had scarcely been signed when the restless ambition and the
                    insupportable insolence of the first consul convinced the great body of the
                    English people that the peace so eagerly welcomed was only a precarious
                    armistice. As it became clearer and clearer that a war for the dignity, the
                    independence, the very existence of the nation was at hand, men looked with
                    increasing uneasiness on the weak and languid cabinet which would have to
                    contend against an enemy who united more than the power of Louis the Great to
                    more than the genius of Frederick the Great. It is true that Addington might
                    easily have made a better war minister than Pitt, and could not possibly have
                    been a worse. But Pitt had cast a spell on the public mind. The eloquence, the
                    judgment, the calm and disdainful firmness which he had during many years
                    displayed in parliament deluded the world into the belief that he must be
                    eminently qualified to superintend every department of politics; and they
                    imagined, even after the miserable failures of Dunkirk, of Quiberon, and of the
                    Helder, that he was the only statesman who could cope with Bonaparte. This
                    feeling was nowhere stronger than among Addington’s own colleagues. The pressure
                    put on him was so strong that he could not help yielding to it; yet, even in
                    yielding, he showed how far he was from knowing his own place. His first
                    proposition was that some insignificant nobleman should be first lord of the
                    treasury and nominal head of the administration, and that the real power should
                    be divided between Pitt and himself, who were to be secretaries of state. Pitt,
                    as might have been expected, refused even to discuss such a scheme, and talked
                    of it with bitter mirth. “Which secretaryship was offered to you?” his friend
                    Wilberforce asked. “Really,” said Pitt, “I had not the curiosity to inquire.”
                    Addington was frightened into bidding higher. He offered to resign the treasury
                    to Pitt, on condition that there should be no extensive change in the
                    Government. But Pitt would listen to no such terms. Then came a dispute such as
                    often arises after negotiations orally conducted, even when the negotiators are
                    men of strict honour. Pitt gave one account of what had passed; Addington gave
                    another; and, though the discrepancies were not such as necessarily implied any
                    intentional violation of truth on either side, both were greatly
                    exasperated.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the quarrel with the first consul had come to a crisis. On the 16th of
                    May 1803 the king sent a message calling on the House of Commons to support him
                    in withstanding the ambitious and encroaching policy of France; and on the 22d
                    the House took the message into consideration.</p>
                <p>Pitt had now been living many months in retirement. There had been a general
                    election since he had spoken in parliament, and there were two hundred members
                    who had never heard him. It was known that on this occasion he would be in his
                    place, and curiosity was wound up to the highest point. Unfortunately, the
                    shorthand writers were, in consequence of some mistake, shut out on that day
                    from the gallery, so that the newspapers contained only a very meagre report of
                    the proceedings. But several accounts of what passed are extant; and of those
                    accounts the most interesting is contained in an unpublished letter written by a
                    very young member, John William Ward, afterwards earl of Dudley. When Pitt rose,
                    he was received with loud cheering. At every pause in his speech there was a
                    burst of applause. Tlιe peroration is said to have been one of the most animated
                    and magnificent ever heard in parliament. “Pitt’s speech,” Fox wrote a few days
                    later, “was admired very much, and very justly. I think it was the best he ever
                    made in that style.” The debate was adjourned; and on the second night Fox
                    replied to it in an oration which, as the most zealous Pittites were forced to
                    acknowledge, left the palm of eloquence doubtful. Addington macle a pitiable
                    appearance between the two great rivals; and it was observed that Pitt, while
                    exhorting the Commons to stand resolutely by the executive Government <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n156/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0156-0147"/> against France, said not a word indicating esteem
                    or friendship for the prime minister.</p>
                <p>War was speedily declared. The first consul threatened to invade England at the
                    head of the conquerors of Belgium and Italy, and formed a great camp near the
                    Straits of Dover. On the other side of those straits the whole population of our
                    island was ready to rise up as one man in defence of the soil. At this
                    conjuncture, as at some other great conjunctures in our history—the conjuncture
                    of 1660, for example, and the conjuncture of 1688—there was a general
                    disposition among honest and patriotic men to forget old quarrels, and to regard
                    as a friend every person who was ready, in the existing emergency, to do his
                    part towards the saving of the state. A coalition of all the first men in the
                    country would, at that moment, have been as popular as the coalition of 1783 had
                    been unpopular. Alone in the kingdom the king looked with perfect complacency on
                    a cabinet in which no man superior to himself in genius was to be found, and was
                    so far from being willing to admit all his ablest subjects to office that he was
                    bent on excluding them all.</p>
                <p>A few months passed before the different parties which agreed in regarding the
                    Government with dislike and. contempt came to an understanding with each other.
                    But in the spring of 1804 it became evident that the weakest of ministries would
                    have to defend itself against the strongest of Oppositions, an Opposition made
                    up of three Oppositions, each of which would, separately, have been formidable
                    from ability, and which, when united, were also formidable from number. The
                    party which had opposed the peace, headed by Grenville and Windham, and the
                    party which had opposed the renewal of the war, headed by Fox, concurred in
                    thinking that the men now in power were incapable of either making a good peace
                    or waging a vigorous war. Pitt had in 1802 spoken for peace against the party of
                    Grenville, and had in 1803 spoken for war against the party of Fox. But of the
                    capacity of the cabinet, and especially of its chief, for the conduct of great
                    affairs, he thought as meanly as either Fox or Grenville. Questions were easily
                    found on which all the enemies of the Government could act cordially together.
                    The unfortunate first lord of the treasury, who had, during the earlier months
                    of his administration, been supported by Pitt on one side and by Fox on the
                    other, now had to answer Pitt and to be answered by Fox. Two sharp debates,
                    followed by close divisions, made him weary of his post. It was known, too, that
                    the Upper House was ever more hostile to him than the Lower, that the Scotch
                    representative peers wavered, that there were signs of mutiny among the bishops.
                    In the cabinet itself there was discord, and, worse than discord, treachery. It
                    was necessary to give way; the ministry was dissolved, and the task of forming a
                    Government was entrusted to Pitt.</p>
                <p>Pitt was of opinion that there was now an opportunity, such as had never before
                    offered itself, and such as might never offer itself again, of uniting in the
                    public service, on honourable terms, all the eminent talents of the kingdom. The
                    passions to which the French Revolution had given birth were extinct. The
                    madness of the innovator and the madness of the alarmist had alike had their
                    day. Jacobinism and Antijacobinism had gone out of fashion together. The most
                    liberal statesman did not think that season propitious for schemes of
                    parliamentary reform; and the most conservative statesman could not pretend that
                    there was any occasion for gagging bills and suspensions of the Habeas Corpus
                    Act. The great struggle for independence and national honour occupied all minds;
                    and those who were agreed as to the duty of maintaining that struggle with
                    vigour might well postpone to a more convenient time all disputes about matters
                    comparatively unimportant. Strongly impressed by these considerations, Pitt
                    wished to form a ministry including all the first men in the country. The
                    treasury he reserved for himself; and to Fox he proposed to assign a share of
                    power little inferior to his own.</p>
                <p>The plan was excellent; but the king would not hear of it. Dull, obstinate,
                    unforgiving, and at that time half mad, he positively refused to admit Fox into
                    his service. Anybody else, even men who had gone as far as Fox, or further than
                    Fox, in what His Majesty considered as Jacobinism—Sheridan, Grey, Erskine—
                    should be graciously received, but Fox never. During several hours Pitt laboured
                    in vain to reason down this senseless antipathy. That he was perfectly sincere
                    there can be no doubt; but it was not enough to be sincere—he should have been
                    resolute. Had he declared himself determined not to take office without Fox, the
                    royal obstinacy would have given way, as it gave way, a few months later, when
                    opposed to the immutable resolution of Lord Grenville. In an evil hour Pitt
                    yielded. He flattered himself with the hope that, though he consented to forego
                    the aid of his illustrious rival, there would still remain ample materials for
                    the formation of an efficient ministry. That hope was cruelly disappointed. Fox
                    entreated his friends to leave personal considerations out of the question, and
                    declared that he would support, with the utmost cordiality, an efficient and
                    patriotic ministry from which he should be himself excluded. Not only his
                    friends, however, but Grenville and Grenville’s adherents answered with one
                    voice that the question was not personal, that a great constitutional principle
                    was at stake, and that they would not take office while a man eminently
                    qualified to render service to the commonwealth was placed under a ban merely
                    because he was disliked at court. All that was left to Pitt was to construct a
                    Government out of the wreck of Addington’s feeble administration. The small
                    circle of his personal retainers furnished him with a very few useful
                    assistants, particularly Dundas (who had been created Viscount Melville), Lord
                    Harrowby, and Canning.</p>
                <p>Such was the inauspicious manner in which Pitt entered on his second
                    administration. The whole history of that administration was of a piece with the
                    commencement. Almost every month brought some new disaster or disgrace. To the
                    war with France was soon added a war with Spain. The opponents of the ministry
                    were numerous, able, and active. His most useful coadjutors he soon lost.
                    Sickness deprived him of the help of Lord Harrowby. It was discovered that Lord
                    Melville had been guilty of highly culpable laxity in transactions relating to
                    public money. He was censured by the House of Commons, driven from office,
                    ejected from the Privy Council, and impeached of high crimes and misdemeanours.
                    The blow fell heavy on Pitt. It gave him, he said in parliament, a deep pang;
                    and, as he uttered the word pang his lip quivered, his voice shook, he paused,
                    and his hearers thought that he was about to burst into tears. Such tears shed
                    by Eldon would have moved nothing but laughter. Shed by the warmhearted and
                    open-hearted Fox, they would have moved sympathy, but would have caused no
                    surprise. But a tear from Pitt would, have been something portentous. He
                    suppressed his emotion, however, and proceeded with his usual majestic
                    self-possession.</p>
                <p>His difficulties compelled him to resort to various expedients. At one time
                    Addington was persuaded to accept office with a peerage; but he brought no
                    additional strength to the Government. Though he went through the form of
                    reconciliation, it was impossible for him to forget the past. While he remained
                    in place he was jealous and punctilious; and he soon retired again. At another
                    time Pitt renewed his efforts to overcome his master’s aversion to Fox; and it
                    was rumoured that the king’s obstinacy was gradually giving way. But, meanwhile,
                    it was impossible for the minister to conceal from the public eye the decay of
                    his health and the constant anxiety which gnawed at his heart. His sleep was
                    broken. His food ceased to nourish him. All who passed him in the park, all who
                    had interviews with him in Downing Street, saw misery written in his face. The
                    peculiar look which he wore during the last months of his life was often
                    pathetically described by Wilberforce, who used to call it the Austerlitz
                    look.</p>
                <p>Still the vigour of Pitt’s intellectual faculties and the intrepid haughtiness of
                    his spirit remained unaltered. He had staked everything on a great venture. He
                    had succeeded in forming another mighty coalition against the French ascendency.
                    The united forces of Austria, Russia, and England might, he hoped, oppose an
                    insurmountable barrier to the ambition of the common enemy. But the genius and
                    energy of Napoleon prevailed. While the English troops were preparing to embark
                    for Germany, while the Russian troops were slowly coming up from Poland, he,
                    with rapidity unprecedented in modern war, moved a hundred thousand men from the
                    shores of the ocean to the Black Forest, and compelled a great Austrian army to
                    surrender at Ulm. To the first faint rumours of this calamity Pitt would give no
                    credit. He was irritated by the alarms of those around him. “Do not believe a
                    word of it,” he said; “it is all a fiction.” The next day he received a Dutch
                    newspaper containing the capitulation. He knew no Dutch. It was Sunday, and the
                    public offices were shut. He carried the paper to Lord Malmesbury, who had been
                    minister in Holland; and Lord Malmesbury translated it. Pitt tried to bear up,
                    but the shock was too great; arid he went away with death in his face.</p>
                <p>The news of the battle of Trafalgar arrived four days later, and seemed for a
                    moment to revive him. Forty-eight hours after that most glorious and most
                    mournful of victories had been announced to the country came the Lord Mayor’s
                    Day; and Pitt dined at Guildhall. His popularity had declined. But on this
                    occasion the multitude, greatly excited by the recent tidings, welcomed him
                    enthusiastically, took off his horses in Cheapside, and drew his carriage up
                    King Street. When his health was drunk, he returned thanks in two or three of
                    those stately sentences of which he had a boundless command. Several of those
                    who heard him laid up his words in their hearts; for they were the last words
                    that he ever uttered in public: “Let us hope that England, having saved herself
                    by her energy, may save Europe by her example.”</p>
                <p>This was but a momentary rally. Austerlitz soon completed what Ulm had begun.
                    Early in December Pitt had retired to Bath, in the hope that he might there
                    gather strength for the approaching session. While he was languishing there on
                    his sofa arrived the news that a decisive battle had been fought and lost in
                    Moravia, that the coalition was dissolved, that the Continent was at the feet of
                    France. He sank down under the blow. Ten days later he was so emaciated that his
                    most intimate friends hardly knew him. He came up from Bath by slow journeys,
                    and on the 11th of January 1806 reached his villa at Putney. Parliament<pb

                    the parliamentary dinner at the house of the first lord of the treasury in
                    Downing Street; and the cards were already issued. But the days of the great
                    minister were numbered. The only chance for his life, and that a very slight
                    chance, was that he should resign his office, and pass some months in profound
                    repose. His colleagues paid him very short visits, and carefully avoided
                    political conversation. But his spirit, long accustomed to dominion, could not,
                    even in that extremity, relinquish hopes which everybody but himself perceived
                    to be vain. On the day on which he was carried into his bedroom at Putney the
                    Marquis Wellesley, whom he had long loved, whom he had sent to govern India, and
                    whose administration had been eminently able, energetic, and successful, arrived
                    in London after an absence of eight years. The friends saw each other once more.
                    There was an affectionate meeting and a last parting. That it was a last parting
                    Pitt did not seem to be aware. He fancied himself to be recovering, talked on
                    various subjects cheerfully and with an unclouded mind, and pronounced a warm
                    and discerning eulogium on the marquis’s brother Arthur. “I never,” he said,
                    “met with any military man with whom it was so satisfactory to converse.” The
                    excitement and exertion of this interview were too much for the sick man. He
                    fainted away; and Lord Wellesley left the house convinced that the close was
                    fast approaching.</p>
                <p>And now members of parliament were fast coming up to London. The chiefs of the
                    Opposition met for the purpose of considering the course to be taken on the
                    first day of the session. It was easy to guess what would be the language of
                    the&gt;lking ’ s speech, and of the address which would be moved in answer to
                    that speech. An amendment condemning the policy of the Government had been
                    prepared, and was to have been proposed in the House of Comm,ons by Lord Henry
                    Petty, a young nobleman who had already won for himself that place in the esteem
                    of his country which, after the lapse of more than half a century, he still
                    retains.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(Henry Petty
                    Fitztnaurice, third marquis of Lansdowne, was born in London, July 2, 1780, and
                    died at Bowood, January 31, 1863. He entered parliament in 1801, and succeeded
                    to the peerage in 1809. For a brief period in 1828 he was secretary of state for
                    the home department, and again, in 1828-29, secretary for foreign affairs. From
                    1831 to 1841, and from 1846 to 1852, he was lord president of the
                    council.]</p></note> He was unwilling, however, to come forward as the accuser
                    of one who was incapable of defending himself. Lord Grenville, who had been
                    informed of Pitt’s state by Lord Wellesley, and had been deeply affected by it,
                    earnestly recommended forbearance; and Fox, with characteristic generosity and
                    good nature, gave his voice against attacking his now helpless rival. "Sunt
                    lacrymae rerum,” he said, “et mentem mortalia tangunt.” On the first day,
                    therefore, there was no debate. It was rumoured that evening that Pitt was
                    better. But on the following morning his physicians pronounced that there were
                    no hopes. The commanding faculties of which he had been too proud were beginning
                    to fail. His old tutor and friend, the bishop of Lincoln, informed him of his
                    danger, and gave such religious advice and consolation as a confused and
                    obscured mind could receive: Stories were told of devout sentiments fervently
                    uttered by the dying man. But these stories found no credit with anybody who
                    knew him. Wilberforce pronounced it impossible that they could be true; “Pitt,”
                    he added, “was a man who always said less than he thought on such topics.” It
                    was asserted in many after-dinner speeches, Grub Street elegies, and academic
                    prize poems and prize declamations that the great minister died exclaiming, “Oh
                    my country!” This is a fable, but it is true that the last words which he
                    uttered, while he knew what he said, were broken exclamations about the alarming
                    state of public affairs. He ceased to breathe on the morning of the 23rd of
                    January 1806, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the day on which he first took his
                    seat in parliament. He was in his forty-seventh year, and had been during near
                    nineteen years first lord of the treasury, and undisputed chief of the
                    administration. Since parliamentary government was established in England, no
                    English statesman has held supreme power so long. Walpole, it is true, was first
                    lord of the treasury during more than twenty years, but it was not till Walpole
                    had been some time first lord of the treasury that he could be properly called
                    prime minister.</p>
                <p>It was moved in the House of Commons that Pitt should be honoured with a public
                    funeral and a monument. The motion was opposed by Fox in a speech which deserves
                    to be studied as a model of good taste and good feeling. The task was the most
                    invidious that ever an orator undertook; but it was performed with a humanity
                    and delicacy which were warmly acknowledged by the mourning friends of him who
                    was gone. The motion was carried by 288 votes to 89.</p>
                <p>The 22d of February was fixed for the funeral. The corpse having lain in state
                    during two days in the Painted Chamber, was borne with great pomp to the
                    northern transept of the Abbey. A splendid train of princes, nobles, bishops,
                    and privy councillors followed. The grave of Pitt had been made near to the spot
                    where his great father lay, near also to the spot where his great rival was soon
                    to lie. The sadness of the assistants was beyond that of ordinary mourners. For
                    he whom thev were committine to the dust had died of sorrows and anxieties of
                    which none of the survivors could be altogether without a share. Wilberforce,
                    who carried the banner before the hearse, described the awful ceremony with deep
                    feeling. As the coffin descended into the earth, he said, the eagle face of
                    Chatham from above seemed to look down with consternation into the dark house
                    which was receiving all that remained of so much power and glory.</p>
                <p>All parties in the House of Commons readily concurred in voting forty thousand
                    pounds to satisfy the demands of Pitt’s creditors. Some of his admirers seemed
                    to consider the magnitude of his embarrassments as a circumstance highly
                    honourable to him; but men of sense will probably be of a different opinion. It
                    is far better, no doubt, that a great minister should carry his contempt of
                    money to excess than that he should contaminate his hands with unlawful gain.
                    But it is neither right nor becoming in a man to whom the public has given an
                    income more than sufficient for his comfort and dignity to bequeath to that
                    public a great debt, the effect of mere negligence and profusion. As first lord
                    of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer Pitt never had less than six
                    thousand a year, besides an excellent house. In 1792 he was forced by his royal
                    master’s friendly importunity to accept for life the office of warden of the
                    Cinque Ports, with near four thousand a year more. He had neither wife nor
                    child; he had no needy relations; he had no expensive tastes; he had no long
                    election bills. Had he given but a quarter of an hour a week to the regulation
                    of his household, he would have kept his expenditure within bounds. Or, if he
                    could not spare even a quarter of an hour a week for that purpose, he had
                    numerous friends, excellent men of business, who would have been proud to act as
                    his stewards. One of those friends, the chief of a great commercial house in the
                    city, made an attempt to put the establishment in Downing Street to rights, but
                    in vain. He found that the waste of the servants’ hall was almost fabulous. The
                    quantity of butcher’s meat charged in the bills was nine hundredweight a week.
                    The consumption of poultry, of fish, of tea, was in proportion. The character of
                    Pitt would have stood higher if with the disinterestedness of Pericles and of De
                    Witt he had united their dignified frugality.</p>
                <p>The memory of Pitt has been assailed, times innumerable, often justly, often
                    unjustly; but it has suffered much less from his assailants than from his
                    eulogists. For, during many years, his name was the rallying cry of a class of
                    men with whom, at one of those terrible conjunctures which confound all ordinary
                    distinctions, he was accidentally and temporarily connected, but to whom, on
                    almost all great questions of principle, he was diametrically opposed. The
                    haters of parliamentary reform called themselves Pittites, not choosing to
                    remember that Pitt made three motions for parliamentary reform, and that, though
                    he thought that such a reform could not safely be made while the passions
                    excited by the French Revolution were raging, he never uttered a word indicating
                    that he should not be prepared at a more convenient season to bring the question
                    forward a fourth time. The toast of Protestant ascendency was drunk on Pitt’s
                    birthday by a set of Pittites who could not but be aware that Pitt had resigned
                    his office because he could not carry Catholic emancipation. The defenders of
                    the Test Act called themselves Pittites, though they could not be ignorant that
                    Pitt had laid before George III. unanswerable reasons for abolishing the Test
                    Act. The enemies of free trade called themselves Pittites, though Pitt was far
                    more deeply imbued with the doctrines of Adam Smith than either Fox or Grey. The
                    very negro-drivers invoked the name of Pitt, whose eloquence was never more
                    conspicuously displayed than when he spoke of the wrongs of the negro. This
                    mythical Pitt, who resembles the genuine Pitt as little as the Charlemagne of
                    Ariosto resembles the Charlemagne of Eginhard, has had his day. History will
                    vindicate the real man from calumny disguised under the semblance of adulation,
                    and will exhibit him as what he was—a minister of great talents, honest
                    intentions, and liberal opinions, pre-eminently qualified, intellectually and
                    morally, for the part of a parliamentary leader, and capable of administering
                    with prudence and moderation the government of a prosperous and tranquil
                    country, but unequal to surprising and terrible emergencies, and liable in such
                    emergencies to err grievously, both on the side of weakness and on the side of
                    violence. (Μ.)</p>
