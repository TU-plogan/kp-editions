                    Carthusian monastery at Sheen, and at Magdalen College, Oxford. He was admitted
                    to deacon’s orders at the age of sixteen, and at once received high preferment,
                    holding, among other <pb break="no"

                    his studies at the university of Padua, where he made acquaintance with Erasmus
                    and other prominent men, and, after a visit to Rome in 1525, returned to
                    England. Henry VIII. was eager to keep him at court, but Pole appears to have
                    held aloof from politics until the question of the king’s divorce drew him from
                    his retirement. He was probably from the first opposed to Henry’s policy, but we
                    find him, nevertheless, in 1530, at Paris, charged with the duty of obtaining
                    the decision of the Sorbonne on the question at issue. That decision given, he
                    returned to England, but refused to approve the king’s divorce, or the other
                    measures connected with it. The king, anxious to gain his adhesion, offered him
                    the archbishopric of York, vacant by the death of Wolsey in 1531. After some
                    hesitation, he refused the offer and left the country.</p>
                <p>This was the turning-point in his career, and concludes the first of the three
                    periods into which his life may be divided. During the second period, for
                    upwards of twenty years, he lived abroad, the declared and active enemy of the
                    Protestant movement in his own country. After passing a year at Avignon, he took
                    up his residence a second time at Padua. As he had not yet declared himself
                    publicly against Henry, the latter continued favourably disposed towards him,
                    allowing him the revenues of his deanery, and exempting him from the oath of
                    allegiance to Queen Anne’s children. In 1535, however, there came a change. The
                    king sent to ask his formal opinion on the divorce and the ecclesiastical
                    supremacy. Pole’s answer, afterwards published, with considerable additions,
                    under the title <hi rend="italic">Pro</hi><hi rend="italic">Unitate</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ecclesiae,</hi> was sent to England early in the next year. It
                    contained a vigorous attack upon Henry’s policy and menaced the king with
                    condign punishment at the hands of the emperor and the king of France if he did
                    not return to his allegiance to Rome. Summoned to England to explain himself, he
                    refused to come. Late in 1536 he was made cardinal, and early next year he was
                    sent as papal legate with the object of uniting Charles V. and Francis I. in an
                    attack upon England, which was to coincide with a rising of the Romanists in
                    that country. The terms of peace between England and France making it impossible
                    for him to remain in the latter country (for he was now attainted of high
                    treason), he passed into Flanders, and soon afterwards (August 1537) returned to
                    Rome. A year later (November 1538) he published his book, together with an
                    apology for his own conduct, addressed to Charles V. In 1539, after the bull of
                    excommunication had been issued against Henry VIII., Pole went to Spain in order
                    to urge Charles to attack England. An invasion was threatened but given up, and
                    Pole retired to Carpentras. From 1539 to 1542 he acted as papal legate at
                    Viterbo. In 1543 he was contemplating an expedition to Scotland with an armed
                    force to aid the anti-English party, and in 1545 he was corresponding with the
                    same party and with Charles V. for a joint attack on England. In the same year
                    he went to Trent in disguise, to avoid the danger of seizure on the way, and
                    presided at some of the preliminary meetings of the council. On the death of
                    Henry VIII. he made an attempt to reconcile himself with the English Government,
                    but in vain. In 1549 he was a candidate for the papacy on the death of Paul
                    III., and at one moment was on the point of being elected, but in the end was
                    unsuccessful, and retired to Maguzzano, on the Lake of Garda. When Edward VI.
                    died Polo was engaged in editing his book <hi rend="italic">Pro</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Unitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiae,</hi> with an intended
                    dedication to that king.</p>
                <p>The accession of Mary opens the third period of his life. The pope at once
                    appointed him legate, and entered into negotiations with the queen. A marriage
                    between her and Pole was at one moment contemplated, but the state of public
                    feeling in England rendered his return impossible, and he was kept waiting for a
                    year in Flanders and Germany. The reaction at length produced a parliament
                    favourable to Rome, and enabled him to return (November 1554). As legate he
                    received the national submission, and pronounced the absolution, accepting at
                    the same time, on behalf of the pope, the demands of parliament with respect to
                    ecclesiastical lands, &amp;c. Next year he was on two occasions a candidate for
                    the papacy, but was twice disappointed. After Philip’s departure, and the death
                    of Gardiner (October 1555), Pole became Mary’s chief adviser, and, with her,
                    must bear the blame of the persecution which followed on the reunion with Rome.
                    On Cranmer’s death (March 1556) he became archbishop of Canterbury, but soon
                    afterwards (May 1557) fell into disgrace with the pope, Paul IV., who was his
                    personal enemy. On the outbreak of war with France, Paul, the political ally of
                    that country, cancelled Pole’s legatine powers and even charged him with heresy.
                    No remonstrances on the part of Mary and Pole himself could induce the pope to
                    retract this sentence, and Pole died (November 18, 1558) at enmity with the
                    power in whose support he had spent his life.</p>
