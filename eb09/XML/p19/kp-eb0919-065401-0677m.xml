                    a very ancient city of Latium, lies 22 miles east of Rome on a spur of the
                    Apennines facing the Alban Hills. To the natural strength of the place and its
                    commanding situation Praeneste owed in large measure its historical importance.
                    The local tradition (adopted by Virgil) named Caeculus, son of Vulcan, as
                    founder. From the remains of Cyclopean masonry and other indications the
                    foundation of the city has been referred to the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> and objects in metal and ivory discovered in the earliest graves
                    prove that as early as this or the following century Praeneste had reached a
                    considerable degree of civilization and stood in commercial relations not only
                    with Etruria but with the East. At this time the city was probably under the
                    hegemony of Alba Longa, then the head of the Latin League. In 499, according to
                    Livy, Praeneste withdrew from the Latin League and formed an alliance with Rome,
                    but this statement seems irreconcilable with a passage in Dionysius
                    Halicarnensis <hi rend="italic">{Ant. Rom.,</hi> v. 61). After Rome had been
                    weakened by the Gallic invasion (390), Praeneste joined its foes in a long
                    struggle with Rome. The struggle culminated in the great Latin War (340-338), in
                    which the Romans were victorious, and Praeneste was punished for its share in
                    the war by the loss of part of its territory. It was not, however, like the
                    other Latin cities, embodied in the Roman state, but continued in the position
                    of a city in alliance with Rome down to the Social War, when it, like the rest
                    of Italy, received the Roman franchise (90 or 89). As an allied city it
                    furnished contingents to the Roman army and possessed the right of exile <hi
                    rend="italic">{jus</hi><hi rend="italic">exilii),</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> persons banished from Rome were allowed to reside at Praeneste. To
                    judge from the works of art and inscriptions of this period (338 to 90 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> it must have been for the place a time of
                    prosperity and even luxury. The nuts of Praeneste were famous and its roses were
                    amongst the finest in Italy. The Latin spoken at Praeneste was somewhat
                    peculiar.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus the

                <p>Marius was blockaded in the town by the Sullans (82 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>); and on its capture Marius slew himself, the male inhabitants were
                    massacred in cold blood, and a military colony was settled on part of its
                    territory. It was probably about this time that the city was extended from the
                    hill to the plain and that the temple of Fortune was enlarged so as to include
                    much of the space occupied by the ancient city. Under the empire Praeneste, from
                    its elevated situation and cool salubrious air, became a favourite summer resort
                    of the wealthy Romans, whose villas studded the neighbourhood. Horace ranked it
                    with Tibur and Baiae, the Bath and Brighton of Rome. Augustus resorted thither;
                    here Tiberius recovered from a dangerous illness, and here Hadrian built himself
                    a villa. Antoninus erected a palace to the east of the town. Amongst private
                    persons who owned villas at Praeneste were Pliny the younger and Symmachus.</p>
                <p>But Praeneste was chiefly famed for its great temple of Fortune and for its
                    oracle, in connexion with the temple, known as the “Praenestine lots” <hi
                    rend="italic">{sortes Praenestinae).</hi> As extended by Sulla the sanctuary of
                    Fortune occupied a series of six vast terraces, which, resting on gigantic
                    substructions of masonry and connected with each other by grand staircases, rose
                    one above the other on the hill in the form of the side of a pyramid, crowned on
                    the highest terrace by the round temple of Fortune proper. This immense edifice,
                    probably by far the largest sanctuary in Italy, must have presented a most
                    imposing aspect, visible as it was from a great part of Latium, from Rome, and
                    even from the sea. The goddess Fortuna here went by the name of Primigenia
                    (First-Born, but perhaps in an active sense First-Bearer); she was represented
                    suckling two babes, said to be Jupiter and Juno, and she was especially
                    worshipped by matrons.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Hence Fernique <hi rend="italic">{Étude sur Préneste')</hi> ingeniously
                    conjectures that Fortuna was originally a goddess of maternity, and that the
                    view of her functions as a goddess of chance was later, being due to the
                    influence of Greek mythology, in which Chance (Tι'χ^) was a goddess. Fortuna
                    contains the same root <hi rend="italic">us ferre,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi>
                    to bear.” Fernique observes that the worship of Fortuna was often associated
                    with that of Feronia. Statuettes in terra-cotta representing a woman with a
                    child at her breast have been found at Praeneste. These are supposed by Fernique
                    to be votive offerings, representing not the goddess but the mothers who offered
                    them at the shrine in fulfilment of vows. Fortuna was sometimes represented in
                    the form of two (or possibly more) females, so at Antium (Macrobius, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sat.,</hi> i. 23, 13; Sueton., <hi rend="italic">Cal.,</hi> 57),
                    and perhaps at Praeneste (Statius, <hi rend="italic">Sylυ.,</hi> i. 3, 80); in
                    one of the Roman temples of Fortuna there was a mysterious veiled figure.
                    Analogous to Fortuna in her double capacity as prophetess and patron of mothers
                    was Carmenta, and she too was sometimes represented in double form (Ovid, <hi
                    rend="italic">Fasti,</hi> i. 617 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; Aulus Gellius, xvi.
                    16).</p></note> The oracle of the Praenestine lots was very ancient and
                    continued to be consulted down to Christian times. Constantine and Theodosius
                    forbade the practice and closed the temple. In 1297 the Colonna family who then
                    owned Praeneste (Palestrina) revolted from the pope, but in the following year
                    the town was taken and razed to the ground. In 1437 the city, which had been
                    rebuilt, was captured by the papal general Cardinal Vitelleschi and once more
                    utterly destroyed. It was rebuilt and fortified by Stefano Colonna in 1448. In
                    1630 it passed by purchase into the Barberini family. Praeneste was the native
                    town of Aelian and in modern times of the great composer Palestrina.</p>
                <p>The modern town of Palestrina, a collection of narrow and filthy alleys, stands
                    on the terraces once occupied by the temple of Fortune. On the summit of the
                    hill (2546 feet), nearly a mile from the town, stood the ancient citadel, the
                    site of which is now occupied by a few poor houses (Castel San Pietro) and a
                    ruined mediaeval castle of the Colonnas. The magnificent view embraces Soracte,
                    Rome, the Alban Hills, and the Campagna as far as the sea. Considerable portions
                    of the southern wall of the ancient citadel, built in very massive polygonal
                    (Cyclopean) blocks of limestone, are still to be seen; and the two walls, also
                    polygonal, which formerly united the citadel with the lower town, can still be
                    traced. The ruins of the villa of Hadrian stand in the plain near the church of
                    S. Maria <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n678/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0678-0655"/> della Villa, about three-quarters of a mile from
                    the town. Here was discovered the well-known statue of Antinous, now in the
                    Vatican. Not far off was found in 1773 the calendar which, as Suetonius tells
                    us, was set up by the grammarian Μ. Verrius Flaccus in the forum of Praeneste.
                    Excavations made, especially since 1855, in the ancient necropolis, which lay on
                    a plateau surrounded by valleys at the foot of the hill and of the town, have
                    yielded important results for the history of the art and manufactures of
                    Praeneste. Of the objects found in the oldest graves, and supposed to date from
                    about the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> the cups of silver and
                    silver gilt and most of the gold and amber jewellery are Phoenician (possibly
                    Carthaginian), or at least made on Phoenician models; but the bronzes and some
                    of the ivory articles seem to be Etruscan. No objects have been discovered
                    belonging to the period intermediate between the 7th and 3d centuries B.c.; but
                    the graves of the 3d and 2d centuries have yielded many precious relics, bronze
                    caskets (cisiae), convex metal mirrors, strigils, &amp;c. Among these is the
                    famous Ficoroni casket, engraved with pictures of the arrival of the Argonauts
                    in Bithynia and the victory of Pollux over Amycus. It was found in 1774. The
                    inscriptions on the caskets are all Latin; those on the mirrors are mostly
                    Etruscan; those on the strigils are Latin, Greek, and Etruscan. The Latin
                    inscriptions seem to belong to the 3d century. On the whole it appears that
                    between the 3d and 2d centuries there existed at Praeneste a native Latin art,
                    which was, however, beginning to be affected by Greek art. Most of the objects
                    discovered in the necropolis are preserved in the Roman collections, especially
                    the Kircher Museum (which possesses the Ficoroni casket) and the Barberini
                    Library. Besides these there is preserved in the Barberini Palace at Palestrina
                    a large mosaic, considered one of the most important in existence. It was found
                    on the site of the temple of Fortune and probably dates from the age of Augustus
                    or Tiberius. It represents scenes from the Nile, with animals and figures in
                    Egyptian and Greek costume. (J. G. FR. )</p>
