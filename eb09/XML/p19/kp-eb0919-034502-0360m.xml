                    Marsilio Ficino he imbibed the rudiments of philosophy. The precocity of his
                    genius for scholarship and poetry was early manifested. At thirteen years of age
                    he began to circulate Latin letters; at seventeen he sent forth essays in Greek
                    versification; at eighteen he published an edition of Catullus. In 1470 he won
                    for himself the title of <hi rend="italic">Homericus juvenis</hi> by translating
                    four books of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> into Latin hexameters. Lorenzo
                    de’ Medici, who was then the autocrat of Florence and the chief patron of
                    learning in Italy, took Poliziano into his household, made him the tutor of his
                    children, and secured him a distinguished post in the university of Florence.
                    Before he reached the age of thirty, Poliziano expounded the humanities with
                    almost unexampled lustre even for that epoch of brilliant professors. Among his
                    pupils could be numbered the chief students of Europe, the men who were destined
                    to carry to their homes the <hi rend="italic">spolia opima</hi> of Italian
                    culture. Not to mention Italians, it will suffice to record the names of the
                    German Reuchlin, the English Grocyn and Linacre, and the Portuguese Tessiras.
                    Poliziano had few advantages of person to recommend him. He was ungainly in
                    form, with eyes that squinted, and a nose of disproportionate length. Yet his
                    voice was rich and capable of fine modulation; his eloquence, ease of utterance,
                    and copious stream of erudition were incomparable. It was the method of
                    professors at that period to read the Greek and Latin authors with their class,
                    dictating philological and critical notes, emending corrupt passages in the
                    received texts, offering elucidations of the matter, and pouring forth stores of
                    acquired knowledge regarding the laws, manners, religious and philosophical
                    opinions of the ancients. Poliziano covered nearly the whole ground of classical
                    literature during the years of his professorship, and published the notes of his
                    courses upon Ovid, Suetonius, Statius, the younger Pliny, Quintilian, and the
                    writers of Augustan histories. He also undertook a recension of the text of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Pandects</hi> of Justinian, which formed the subject of one of
                    his courses; and this recension, though it does not rank high in the scale of
                    juristic erudition, gave an impulse to the scholarly criticism of the Roman
                    code. At the same time he was busy as a translator from the Greek. His versions
                    of Epictetus, Herodian, Hippocrates, Galen, Plutarch’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eroticus,</hi> and Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Charmides</hi> delighted
                    contemporaries by a certain limpid fluency of Latin style and grace of manner
                    which distinguished him also as an original writer. Of these learned labours the
                    most universally acceptable to the public of that time were a series of
                    discursive essays on philology and criticism, first published in 1489 under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea.</hi> They had an immediate, a lasting,
                    and a wide renown, encouraging the scholars of the next century and a half to
                    throw their occasional discoveries in the field of scholarship into a form at
                    once so attractive and so instructive. Poliziano was not, however, contented
                    with these simply professorial and scholastic compositions. Nature had endowed
                    him with literary and poetic gifts of the highest order. These he devoted to the
                    composition of Latin and Greek verses, which count among the best of those
                    produced by men of modern times in rivalry with ancient authors. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Manto,</hi> in which he pronounced a panegyric of Virgil; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ambra,</hi> which contains a beautiful idyllic sketch of Tuscan
                    landscape, and a studied eulogy of Homer; the <hi rend="italic">Rusticus,</hi>
                    which celebrated the pleasures of country life in no frigid or scholastic
                    spirit; and the <hi rend="italic">Nutricia,</hi> which was intended to serve as
                    a general introduction to the study of ancient and modern poetry,—these are the
                    masterpieces of Poliziano in Latin verse, displaying an authenticity of
                    inspiration, a sincerity of feeling, and a command of metrical resources which
                    mark them out as original productions of poetic genius rather than as merely
                    professorial lucubrations. Exception may be taken to their style, when compared
                    with the best work of the Augustan or even of the Silver age. But what renders
                    them always noteworthy to the student of modern humanistic literature is that
                    they are in no sense imitative or conventional, but that they convey the genuine
                    thoughts and emotions of a born poet in Latin diction and in metre moulded to
                    suit the characteristics of the singer’s temperament.</p>
                <p>Poliziano was great as a scholar, as a professor, as a critic, and as a Latin
                    poet at an age when the classics were still studied with the passion of
                    assimilative curiosity, and not with the scientific industry of a later period.
                    He was the representative hero of that age of scholarship in which students drew
                    their ideal of life from antiquity and fondly dreamed that they might so restore
                    the past as to compete with the classics in production and bequeath a golden age
                    of resuscitated paganism to the modern world. Yet he was even greater as an
                    Italian poet. Between Boccaccio and Ariosto, no single poet in the mother tongue
                    of Italy deserves so high a place as Poliziano. What he might have achieved in
                    this department of literature had he lived at a period less preoccupied with
                    humanistic studies, and had he found a congenial sphere for his activity, can
                    only be guessed. As it is, we must reckon him as decidedly the foremost and
                    indubitably the most highly gifted among the Italian poets who obeyed Lorenzo
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n361/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0361-0346"/> de’ Medici’s demand for a resuscitation of the
                    vulgar literature. Lorenzo led the way himself, and Poliziano was more a
                    follower in his path than an initiator. Yet what Poliziano produced, impelled by
                    a courtly wish to satisfy his patron’s whim, proves his own immeasurable
                    superiority as an artist. His principal Italian works are the stanzas called <hi
                    rend="italic">La Giostra,</hi> written upon Giuliano de’ Medici’s victory in a
                    tournament; the <hi rend="italic">Orfeo,</hi> a lyrical drama performed at
                    Mantua with musical accompaniment; and a collection of fugitive pieces,
                    reproducing various forms of Tuscan popular poetry. <hi rend="italic">La
                    Giostra</hi> had no plan, and remained imperfect; but it demonstrated the
                    capacities of the octave stanza for rich, harmonious, and sonorous metrical
                    effect. The <hi rend="italic">Orfeo</hi> is a slight piece of work, thrown off
                    at a heat, yet abounding in unpremeditated lyrical beauties, and containing in
                    itself the germ both of the pastoral play and of the opera. The Tuscan songs are
                    distinguished by a “roseate fluency,” an exquisite charm of half romantic half
                    humorous abandonment to fancy, which mark them out as improvisations of genius.
                    It may be added that in all these departments of Italian composition Poliziano
                    showed how the taste and learning of a classical scholar could be engrafted on
                    the stock of the vernacular, and how the highest perfection of artistic form
                    might be attained in Italian without a sacrifice of native spontaneity and
                    natural flow of language.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to combine in one view the several aspects presented to us by
                    this many-sided man of literary genius. At a period when humanism took the lead
                    in forming Italian character and giving tone to European culture, he climbed
                    with facility to the height of achievement in all the branches of scholarship
                    which were then most seriously prized—in varied knowledge of ancient authors, in
                    critical capacity, in rhetorical and poetical exuberance. This was enough at
                    that epoch to direct the attention of all the learned men of Europe on
                    Poliziano. At the same time, almost against his own inclination, certainly with
                    very little enthusiasm on his part, he lent himself so successfully to Lorenzo
                    de’ Medici’s scheme for resuscitating the decayed literature of Tuscany that his
                    slightest Italian effusions exercised a potent influence on the immediate
                    future. He appears before us as the dictator of Italian culture in a double
                    capacity—as the man who most perfectly expressed the Italian conception of
                    humanism, and brought erudition into accord with the pursuit of noble and
                    harmonious form, and also as the man whose vernacular compositions were more
                    significant than any others of the great revolution in favour of Italian poetry
                    which culminated in Ariosto. Beyond the sphere of pure scholarship and pure
                    literature Poliziano did not venture. He was present, indeed, at the attack made
                    by the Pazzi conspirators on the persons of Lorenzo and Giuliano de’ Medici, and
                    wrote an interesting account of its partial success. He also contributed a
                    curious document on the death of Lorenzo de’ Medici to the students of
                    Florentine history. But he was not, like many other humanists of his age,
                    concerned in public affairs of state or diplomacy, and he held no office except
                    that of professor at Florence. His private life was also uneventful. He passed
                    it as a house-friend and dependant of the Medici, as the idol of the learned
                    world, and as a simple man of letters for whom (with truly Tuscan devotion to
                    the Saturnian country) rural pleasures were always acceptable. He was never
                    married; and his morals incurred suspicion, to which his own Greek verses lend a
                    certain amount of plausible colouring. In character Poliziano was decidedly
                    inferior to the intellectual and literary eminence which he displayed. He died
                    half broken-hearted by the loss of his friend and patron Lorenzo de’ Medici, in
                    1494, at the age of forty, just before the wave of foreign invasion which was
                    gathering in France swept over Italy.</p>
