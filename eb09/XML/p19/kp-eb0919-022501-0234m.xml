                    on this estate (plures villae, <hi rend="italic">Ep.</hi> ix. 7). Two of these,
                    his especial favourites, he playfully called “Tragedy and Comedy,” comparing the

                <p>Pliny was a man of refined taste, highly accomplished, devoted to literature,
                    kind and indulgent to his freedmen and his slaves, gentle and considerate in all
                    his family relations, just in his dealings, munificent in the use of his wealth,

                    daily needed pardon oneself, and to abstain from sins as if one viewed sin as
                    unpardonable,” viii. 22. In <hi rend="italic">Ep.</hi> 2 of the same book he
                    finely says, “Mihi egregium in primis videtur, ut foris ita domi, ut in magnis
                    ita in parvis ut in alienis ita in suis, agitare justitiam.”</p></note> By
                    profession an advocate, and a pupil of the famous Quintilian (ii. 14), he was a
                    frequent and very popular pleader at the courts of the centumviri held in the
                    Julian basilica, as well as occasionally in the senate and in public
                    prosecutions (vi. 29).</p>
                <p>His fame in centumviral trials, which were chiefly concerned with will cases, is
                    attested by Martial (x. 19, 17), whose epigram he quotes in lamenting the poet’s
                    death (iii. 21). But, though himself somewhat ambitious of praise as a pleader
                    (for he seems to have regarded Cicero as his model in everything), he sternly
                    reproved the arts of bribery and flattery which were commonly adopted by patrons
                    to secure the applause of their clients. “For half-a-crown a head,” he
                    complains, “you may fill the benches with any number of shouters and bawlers of
                    your praises.” Fond as he was of eloquence, he seems to have given up legal
                    practice from some feeling of disgust at these abuses, and to have devoted
                    himself to the duties of the state-offices. He was appointed augur and praefect
                    of the treasury in the temple of Saturn, and rose in due course through the
                    offices of quaestor, praetor, and tribune of the people, finally attaining to

                    old custom,” he says in his opening sentence, “of commencing all public business
                    with prayers to the gods is especially to be observed by a consul, and on an
                    occasion of offering public thanks to the best of princes by the command of the
                    senate and the state.” The piece teaches us a good deal about the imperial
                    policy and the military career of Trajan (§§ 13-16).</p>
                <p>Between Pliny and Trajan the sincerest regard and even affection seem to have
                    subsisted. In the last book of the <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> which
                    contains a hundred and twenty-one letters and replies on matters of business
                    connected with the province between Pliny and the emperor, the latter is always
                    addressed as “Domine” (sire), the former as “Secunde (or mi Secunde) carissime.”
                    Most of these were written by Pliny as propraetor (103-5) of Bithynia and
                    Pontica, and they show the careful interest taken in the welfare and prosperity
                    of the cities under his charge. The replies of the emperor are
                    characteristically brief; they are written in good and literary Latin, and show
                    Trajan to have been a man of letters as well as a man of business. Pliny’s
                    celebrated inquiry what should be done with recusant Christians, in which he
                    says<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>X. 96, §
                    9.</p></note> that “not only cities but country towns and rural districts have
                    been touched by the contagion of this superstition," is briefly replied to;
                    “conquirendi non sunt,” writes the emperor, “si deferantur et arguantur,
                    puniendi sunt, ita tamen ut qui negaverit se Christianum esse, idque re ipsa
                    manifestum fecerit, id est supplicando dis nostris, quamvis suspectus in
                    praeteritum, veniam ex poenitentia impetret.” Pliny had said :—“Those who
                    obstinately persisted that they were Christians, after being warned of the
                    consequence, I ordered to be led off to punishment, not doubting that, whatever
                    it was that they professed, their inflexible obstinacy deserved it.” Doubts have
                    even been raised as to the genuineness of a passage which appears so
                    inconsistent with the established Roman policy of tolerating every <hi
                    rend="italic">superstitio.</hi> But it is clear that what Pliny doubted was the
                    fidelity to the emperor of those who refused to make the customary religious
                    offerings to his statue. It was zeal for loyalty that led him into a course
                    which his humane nature condemned.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The context shows that he had some suspicion that the
                    Christians were forming secret and illegal societies (hctaeriae, § 8). This is
                    his only excuse for having put two deaconesses (ministrae) to the torture, to
                    find out what they really held.</p></note></p>
                <p>Pliny was twice married, but had no children. The emperor bestowed on him thej⅛zs
                    <hi rend="italic">trium liberorum,</hi> which conferred certain state privileges
                    upon those who brought up that number of legitimate children to become Roman
                    citizens. Three affectionate letters, none of them long, are addressed to his
                    second wife Calpurnia Hispulla.</p>
                <p>In health Pliny seems to have been far from robust. He speaks of his slight and
                    thin figure, “gracilitas mea,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>ii. 11, § 15.</p></note> though in his youth he had seen

                    type="authorial"><p>iii. 11, § 5.</p></note> He was fond too of hunting, but
                    used to boast that he combined the worship of Diana with that of Minerva.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>ix. 10. In i. 6 he gives a
                    droll account of his hunting wild boars, and reading books while the beaters

                    tamen ceras reportarem.”</p></note></p>
                <p>Pliny’s great wealth was most liberally bestowed, both privately and publicly. He
                    undertakes to rebuild a temple of Ceres on his estate, entirely at his own cost,
                    with a new statue and the addition of a portico, with walls and floor decorated

                    of the mortgage debt on an encumbered estate which she had inherited from her
                    father. He founded and endowed with landed property an almshouse for people of

                    have claimed for himself,—and this in addition to over £10,000 which he had
                    already given to the same township. He generously returned a large percentage of
                    the sum he had sold his vintage for, when the produce had been found to
                    disappoint the purchasers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    times are that of Cortius, published in 1734; after his death that of G. H.
                    Schaefer (who reprinted with corrections, in 1805, the text of Gesner and
                    Gierig, 1800), and that of Maurice Doering, 1843. The latest and best is the
                    Teubner text of H. Keil (Leipsic, 1865, 12mo), with full indices and brief
                    introductory notice of the most important different readings. (F. A. P.)</p>
