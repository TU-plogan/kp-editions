                    (1426-1503), a famous Italian humanist and poet, was born in 1426 at Cerreto in
                    the duchy of Spoleto, where his father was murdered in one of the frequent civil
                    brawls which then disturbed the peace of Italian towns. His mother escaped with
                    the boy to Perugia, and it was here that Pontano received his first instruction
                    in languages and literature. Failing to recover his patrimony, he abandoned
                    Umbria, and at the age of twenty-two established himself at Naples, which
                    continued to be his chief place of residence during a long and prosperous
                    career. He here began a close friendship with the distinguished scholar, Antonio
                    Beccadelli, through whose influence he gained admission to the royal chancery of
                    Alphonso the Magnanimous. Alphonso discerned the singular gifts of the young
                    scholar, and made him tutor to his sons. Pontano’s connexion with the Aragonese
                    dynasty as political adviser, military secretary, and chancellor was henceforth
                    a close one; and the most doubtful passage in his diplomatic career is when he
                    welcomed Charles VIII. of France upon the entry of that king into Naples in
                    1495, thus showing that he was too ready to abandon the princes upon whose
                    generosity his fortunes had been raised. Pontano illustrates in a marked manner
                    the position of power to which men of letters and learning had arrived in Italy.
                    He entered Naples as a penniless scholar. He was almost immediately made the
                    companion and trusted friend of its sovereign, loaded with honours, lodged in a
                    fine house, enrolled among the nobles of the realm, enriched, and placed at the
                    very height of social importance. Following the example of Pomponio Leto in <hi
                        rend="subscript"> -</hi> Rome and of Cosimo de’ Medici at Florence, Pontano
                    founded an academy for the meetings of learned and distinguished men. This
                    became the centre of fashion as well as of erudition in the southern capital,
                    and subsisted long after its founder’s death. In 1461 he married his first wife,
                    Adriana Sassone, who bore him one son and three daughters before her death in
                    1491. Nothing distinguished Pontano more than the strength of his domestic
                    feeling. He was passionately attached to his wife and children; and, while his
                    friend Beccadelli signed the licentious verses of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hermaphroditus,</hi> his own Muse celebrated in liberal but loyal strains
                    the pleasures of conjugal affection, the charm of infancy, and the sorrows of a
                    husband and a father in the loss of those he loved. Not long after the death of
                    his first wife Pontano took in second marriage a beautiful girl of Ferrara, who
                    is only known to us under the name of Stella. Although he was at least
                    sixty-five years of age at this period, his poetic faculty displayed itself with
                    more than usual warmth and lustre in the glowing series of elegies, styled <hi
                        rend="italic">Eridanus,</hi> which he poured forth to commemorate the
                    rapture of this union. Stella’s one child, Lucilio, survived his birth but fifty
                    days; nor did his mother long remain to comfort the scholar’s old age. Pontano
                    had already lost his only son by the first marriage; therefore his declining
                    years were solitary. He died in 1503 at Naples, where a remarkable group of
                    terra-cotta figures, life-sized and painted, still adorns his tomb in the church
                    of Monte Oliveto. He is there represented together with his patron Alphonso and
                    his friend Sannazzaro in adoration before the dead Christ.</p>
                <p>As a diplomatist and state official Pontano played a part of some importance in
                    the affairs of southern Italy and in the Barons’ War, the wars with Rome, and
                    the expulsion and restoration of the Aragonese dynasty. But his chief claim upon
                    the attention of posterity is as a scholar. His writings divide themselves into
                    dissertations upon such topics as the “Liberality of Princes” or “Ferocity,”
                    composed in the rhetorical style of the day, and poems. He was distinguished for
                    energy of Latin style, for vigorous intellectual powers, and for the faculty,
                    rare among his contemporaries, of expressing the facts of modern life, the
                    actualities of personal emotion, in language sufficiently classical yet always
                    characteristic of the man. His prose treatises are more useful to students of
                    manners than the similar lucubrations of Poggio. Yet it was principally as a
                    Latin poet that he exhibited his full strength. An ambitious didactic
                    composition in hexameters, entitled <hi rend="italic">Urania,</hi> embodying the
                    astronomical science of the age, and adorning this high theme with brilliant
                    mythological episodes, won the admiration of Italy. It still remains a monument
                    of fertile invention, exuberant facility, and energetic handling of material.
                    Not less excellent is the didactic poem on orange trees, <hi rend="italic"
                        >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Hortis Hesperidum.</hi> His most original
                    compositions in Verse, however, are elegiac and hendecasyllabic pieces on
                    personal topics—the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Conjugali
                        Amore,</hi><hi rend="italic">Eridanus, Tumuli,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Naeniae, Baiae,</hi> &amp;c.—in which he uttered his vehemently passionate
                    emotions with a warmth of southern colouring, an evident sincerity, and a truth
                    of painting from reality which make the reader pardon an erotic freedom that is
                    alien to our present taste. These lyrical compositions breathe the atmosphere of
                    Naples, reproduce its scenery with wonderful brilliancy, and introduce us to the
                    customs of its pleasure-loving pagan people. Yet, in spite of their excessive
                    voluptuousness, we rise from their perusal convinced that their author was
                    essentially a good man, a loving husband and father, and an attached friend.</p>
