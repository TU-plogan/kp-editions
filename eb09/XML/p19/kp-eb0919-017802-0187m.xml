                    (connected with the Greek τrλατυς, flat, the late Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >plata</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">lamina,</hi> and the
                    Spanish <hi rend="italic">plata,</hi> silver) is usually employed to denote
                    works in silver or gold which belong to any class other than those of personal
                    ornaments or coins.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In
                    mediaeval English the term “a plate” was occasionally used in the sense of a
                    silver vessel. A curious survival of this use of the word still exists at
                    Queen’s College, Oxford, where the servants may yet be heard asking at the
                    buttery for so many “plates of beer,” that is, silver tankards.</p></note></p>
                <p>On account of the ease with which it can be worked and the pure state in which it
                    is generally found, it is probable that gold was the first metal used by man;
                    and it is certain that, in some countries at least, he attained to the most
                    marvellous skill in its manipulation at a time when the other arts were in a
                    very elementary condition. As an instance of this we may mention a sword of the
                    bronze age, found in a barrow near Stonehenge, and now in the museum at
                    Devizes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hoare, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ancient Wiltshire,</hi> 1840.</p></note> The hilt of this sword is
                    covered with the most microscopically minute gold mosaic. A simple design is
                    formed by fixing tesserae, or rather pins, of red and yellow gold into the
                    wooden core of the handle. Incredible as it may appear, there are more than two
                    thousand of these gold tesserae to the square inch. The use of silver appears to
                    belong to a rather later period, probably because, though a widely spread metal
                    in almost all parts of the world, it is usually found in a less pure state than
                    gold, and requires some skill to smelt and refine it. Though both these precious
                    metals were largely and skilfully used by prehistoric races, they were generally
                    employed as personal ornaments or decorations for weapons. Except in
                    Scandinavian countries but little that can be called “plate” has been discovered
                    in the early barrows of the prehistoric period in western Europe.</p>
                <p>It will be convenient to consider the no less prehistoric gold and silver work
                    recently found at Troy, Tiryns, and Mycenae as forming a stage in the history of
                    Greek art.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ancient Egypt.</hi> —An enormous amount of the precious metals
                    was annually brought as tribute to the Egyptian kings; according to Diodorus,
                    who quotes the authority of Hecataeus, the yearly produce of the royal gold and
                    silver mines amounted to thirty-two millions of minae—that is, about 133
                    millions sterling of modern money. Though this estimate is probably an
                    exaggeration, the amount must have been very great. The gold chiefly came from
                    the mines in the Bishári desert, about eighteen days’ journey south-east of Kum
                    Ombos. These mines were constantly worked down to the time of the Arab caliphs,
                    but now appear to be exhausted. It is not known where the silver came from. Gold
                    appears to have been relatively more abundant than silver, and the difference in
                    value between them was very much less than it is now. Tribute was paid to the
                    Egyptian kings, not in coined money, which was then unknown, but in rings or
                    ingots. Owing to the Egyptian practice of burying with their dead personal
                    ornaments and jewellery, rather than other possessions less intimately connected
                    with the person of the deceased, but few specimens of either gold or silver
                    plate have survived to our times, whereas the amount of gold jewellery that has
                    been discovered is very large, and shows the utmost amount of skill in working
                    the precious metals. We can, however, form some notion of what the larger works,
                    such as plates and vases in gold and silver, were like from the frequent
                    representations of them in mural sculpture and paintings. In many cases they
                    were extremely elaborate and fanciful in shape, formed with the bodies or heads
                    of griffins, horses, and other animals real or imaginary. Others are simple and
                    graceful in outline, enriched with delicate surface, ornament of leaves, wave
                    and guilloche patterns, hieroglyphs, or sacred animals. Fig. 1 shows a gold vase
                    of the time of Thothmes ÏII. (Dynasty XVIIL, about 1500 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> taken from a wall-painting in one of the tombs at Thebes.</p>
                <p>The figure on its side is the hieroglyph for “gold.” Others appear to have been
                    very large and massive, with human figures in silver or gold supporting a great
                    bowl or crater of the same metal.</p>
                <p>In the language of the hieroglyphs silver is called “white gold,” and gold is the
                    generic name for money,—unlike most languages, in which silver usually has this
                    special meaning,—a fact which points strongly to the priority of the use of
                    gold. On the walls of one of the tombs at Beni Hassan there is an interesting
                    representation of a gold-and silver-smith’s workshop, showing the various
                    processes employed—weighing, melting or soldering with the blow-pipe, refining
                    the metal, and polishing the almost finished bowl or vase. In the time of
                    Rameses III., about 1300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> a clearly defined
                    Assyrian influence appears in the decoration of some of the gold plate. A gold
                    basket, represented in the tomb of this king at Thebes, has on its side a relief
                    of the sacred tree between two beasts, the oldest of purely Aryan or
                    Indo-European subjects, and quite foreign to Egypt.</p>
                <p>The chief existing specimens of Egyptian plate are five silver <hi rend="italic"
                    >phialae</hi> or bowls, found at the ancient Thumuis in the Delta, and now in
                    the Bulak Museum (Nos. 482 to 486 in the catalogue). These are modelled in the
                    form of a lotus blossom, most graceful in design, but are apparently not earlier
                    than the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The Louvre possesses a fine

                <p><hi rend="italic">Assyrian and Phoenician Plate.—</hi> Among the many treasures
                    of early art found by General Cesnola in the tombs of Cyprus none are of more
                    interest than a large number of Phoenician silver phialae or saucer-like dishes,
                    enriched with delicate repoussé and tooled reliefs, which in their design
                    present many characteristics of Assyrian art mingled with a more or less strong
                    Egyptian influence. A considerable number of bowls and phialae found in Assyria
                    itself are so exactly similar to these Cyprian ones, both in shape and
                    ornamentation, that they cannot but be classed together as the production of the
                    same people and the same age. The British Museum possesses a fine collection of
                    these bowls, mostly found in the palace at Nimrùd. Though they are made of
                    bronze, and only occasionally ornamented with a few silver studs, they are
                    evidently the production of artists who were accustomed to work in the precious
                    metals, some of them in fact being almost identical in form and design with the
                    silver phialae found at Curium and elsewhere in Cyprus. They are ornamented in a
                    very delicate and minute manner, partly by incised lines, and partly by the
                    repoussé process, finally completed by chasing. Their designs consist of a
                    central geometrical pattern, with one or more concentric bands round it of
                    figures of gods and men, with various animals and plants. In these bands there
                    is a strange admixture of Assyrian and Egyptian style. The main motives belong
                    to the former class, the principal groups being purely Assyrian—such as the
                    sacred tree between the two attendant beasts, or the king engaged in combat and
                    vanquishing a lion single-handed; while mingled with these are figures and
                    groups purely Egyptian in style, such as the hawk-headed deity, or a king
                    slaying a whole crowd of captives at one blow. Fig. 2 gives a silver dish
                    from</p>
                <p>Curium containing examples of all the above mentioned subjects. Some of the
                    designs are exceedingly beautiful, and are arranged with great decorative skill:
                    a favourite composition is that of antelopes walking in a forest of tall papyrus
                    plants, arranged in radiating lines, so as to suit the circular phiale, and yet
                    treated with perfect grace and freedom. In addition to the numerous silver
                    phialae some were found, with similar decoration, made of pure gold. The Curium
                    find alone is said to have included more than a thousand objects in gold and
                    silver.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Etruscan Plate.—</hi> The Etruscan races of Italy were
                    specially renowned for their skill in working all the metals, and above all in
                    their gold work. Large quantities of the most exquisite gold jewellery have been
                    found in Etruscan tombs, including, in addition to smaller objects, sceptres,
                    wreaths of olive, and massive head-pieces. The Museo Kircheriano in Rome
                    possesses a magnificent specimen of the last form of ornament; it is covered
                    with nearly a hundred little statuettes of lions arranged in parallel rows.<note

                    imported into Italy by the Phoenicians; some almost exactly resemble those found
                    in Cyprus.</p>
                <p>The British Museum (gold ornament room) possesses a fine specimen of early plate
                    found at Agrigentum in Sicily. This is a gold phiale or bowl, about 5 inches
                    across, with central boss or omphalos (φιάλτ? <hi rend="italic">μχσόμφαλος)</hi>
                    which seems once to have contained a large jewel. Round the inside of the bowl
                    are six figures of oxen, repoussé in relief, and at one side a crescent, formed
                    by punched dots. A delicate twisted moulding surrounds the edge; the workmanship
                    of the whole is very skilful (see fig. 3).</p>

                    plains of Troy, at Mycenae, and at Camirus in Rhodes have brought to light a
                    large quantity of gold and silver plate of very remote antiquity. These early
                    specimens of plate are all very similar in character, graceful in shape,
                    hammered, cast, and soldered with great skill, but, with the exception of
                    weapons and ornaments, mostly devoid of surface decoration. The most remarkable
                    find was that which Dr Schliemann calls “Priam’s treasure,” including a large
                    number of silver vases and bowls, with fine massive double-handled cups in gold,
                    and a very curious spherical gold bottle. Fig. 4 shows a silver cup, with gold
                    mounts, found in a tomb at Camirus in Rhodes, apparently a work of the same
                    early date and class. Homer’s poems are full of descriptions of rich works in

                    the taste for valuable pieces of plate was developed among the Greeks at a very
                    early time—much more so probably than it was during <pb break="no"

                    the production of beautifully painted fictile vases seems to some extent to have
                    superseded the more barbaric magnificence of gold and silver. During the 6th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the demand for works of this class,
                    valuable not only for their material but for their workmanship, seems to have
                    been very great under the last dynasty of Lydian kings, whose wealth in gold and
                    silver has become proverbial. Croesus especially encouraged the art, and paid
                    enormous sums for silver vases and cups to the most renowned artists of his
                    time, such as Glaucus and Theodorus the Samian.</p>
                <p>Pliny (A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">H.,</hi> xxxiii.)
                    gives a valuable account of the sources whence the Greeks and Romans derived
                    their precious metals, their methods of refining, and the sculptors who were
                    most celebrated for their skill in making articles of plate. Among the Greeks
                    and Romans the greatest artists of the day did not disdain to practise this
                    branch of art. The same sculptor who produced noble and colossal statues for the
                    temples of the gods would at another time put forth his utmost skill and
                    artistic talent in chasing and embossing some small silver cup or vase. In this
                    way ancient pieces of plate ranked among the most perfect productions of
                    art—very different from the custom of the 19 th century, which leaves its plate
                    to be executed by some dull mechanical craftsman, after the pompous designs
                    supplied by a tradesman whose only standard of merit appears to be the
                    pretentiousness of the design and the number of ounces of silver it
                    contains.</p>
                <p>In the best times of Greek art, the chief works in gold and silver seem to have
                    been dedicated to religious purposes, and to have been seldom used for the
                    ostentatious pomp of private individuals. Vessels for the use of the temples,
                    tripods in gold or silver of the richest work, and statues of the gods were the
                    chief objects on which the precious metals were lavished.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The gold used by the Greeks probably came from Asia Minor or Egypt, while the
                    mines of Laurium, in the mountains which form the promontory of Sunium in
                    Attica, supplied an abundant amount of silver for many centuries.<note

                    the first sculptor who produced works of great merit in the precious metals; he
                    mentions a number of other Greek artists who were celebrated for this class of
                    work, but unluckily does not give their dates. The chief of these were Mentor
                    and Mys (both of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), Acragas,
                    Boethus, the sculptors Myron and Stratonicus, as well as the well-known
                    Praxiteles and Scopas. In Pliny’s time many works in gold and silver by these
                    artists still existed in Rhodes and elsewhere. Among later workers he specially
                    mentions Zopyrus, who made two silver cups, embossed with the scene of the
                    judgment of Orestes by the Areopagite court, and Pytheas, who made a bowl with
                    reliefs of Ulysses and Diomedes carrying off the Palladium. Enormous prices were
                    given by wealthy Romans for ancient silver plate made by distinguished Greek
                    artists; according to Pliny, more than .£300 an ounce was paid for the
                    last-mentioned cup.</p>
                <p>Though a large quantity of later Graeco-Roman plate still exists in various
                    museums, the specimens of Greek silver-work of the best period are extremely
                    rare, and mostly unimportant in point of size. In 1812 Dr Lee discovered at
                    Ithaca a very beautiful vase or cyathus 3∣ inches high (see fig. 5) and a phiale
                    or patera, 9∣ inches across, both of silver, repoussé and chased, with very rich
                    and graceful patterns of leaves and flowers—suggesting a slight tinge of
                    Assyrian style.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    statuettes, sixty-nine pieces in all, the gift of various donors to the temple.
                    It is in itself a small museum of specimens of ancient plate, containing objects
                    of great variety of date and workmanship, from fine Greek work of about 300 B.c.

                    some of the Roman wine-cups and bowls have heads and figures almost detached
                    from the ground. Some of these latter much resemble some silver canthari found

                    as decorating silver plate by Zopyrus, the judgment of Orestes, is represented
                    on a fine cup found at Antium, apparently of Greek design, which is preserved in
                    the Cor · sini Palace in Rome. These may possibly be copies from originals by

                    what may be called Graeco-Roman plate a much larger number of specimens still
                    exist. Even during the 1st century the growing pomp and ostentation of the
                    wealthy Romans led to an enormous demand for large and elaborate pieces of
                    plate, while their good taste induced them to prefer the works of Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">coelatores,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a branch of art which
                    even at that time showed but little signs of decay. It was no doubt the desire
                    for objects which should combine intrinsic value with artistic merit, and also
                    be of a more durable sort, that by slow degrees gave the death-blow to the art
                    of vase painting. It is not always easy to distinguish the best works in silver
                    of this Roman period from the more purely Greek works of an earlier time. They
                    are often of the highest merit both in design and execution. The finest
                    collection of these was found in 1869 at Hildesheim in Hanover, and is now in
                    the Berlin Museum. They consist of a large number of cups, bowls, vases, dishes,
                    and tripods, all of silver, some decorated with gilding and enriched in the most
                    elaborate way with figure and scroll-work reliefs of the greatest beauty and
                    finish; these, except one or two of very rude work, can hardly be later in date
                    than the first century after Christ. The most remarkable is a cylix, inside
                    which a geometrical Greek border in slight relief forms a frame for a seated
                    figure of Athene—an “emblema” soldered on, in very high relief. The attitude of
                    this figure, the folds of the drapery, and other details are arranged with
                    extreme grace. Almost the only point which recalls the fact that this exquisite
                    piece does not belong to the best period of Greek art is the very salient relief
                    of the figure, whereas in earlier times the silver-worker was content with a
                    more moderate amount of relief, and thus decorated the surface of his vessel
                    without injuring its main contour. A large silver crater in the same set (fig.
                    7) is free from this fault. It is covered outside with delicate floral
                    scroll-work, growing in graceful curves all over the surface of the vessel, with
                    very slight projection from the main surface,—a perfect model in every way for
                    the treatment of silver. Pliny specially mentions the custom of Roman generals
                    and other officers travelling on military expeditions with magnificent services
                    of plate; and it appears probable that this had been the case with the</p>
                <p>Hildesheim treasure; defeat or some other disaster may have forced the Roman
                    owner to hide and relinquish the whole set.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    great. In the inscription of Ancyra, Augustus records that he melted down no
                    less than 80 silver statues of himself, and with the money thus obtained
                    presented “golden gifts” to the temple of Apollo Palatinus. See <hi

                <p>The museum at Naples contains a very large number of silver cups found in
                    Pompeii, encrusted with figure-subjects or branches of ivy and vine in relief.
                    In cases of this sort the cup is made double, with a smooth inner skin to hide
                    the sinkings produced by the repoussé work in relief on the outside. Silver
                    vessels ornamented in relief were called by the Romans <hi rend="italic"

                    Bibliothèque—a work of the most marvellous delicacy and high finish—almost
                    gem-like in its minuteness of detail. Though not earlier than about 210 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> a slight clumsiness in the proportion of its
                    embossed figures is the only visible sign of decadence. The outer rim is set
                    with sixteen fine gold coins— <hi rend="italic">aurei</hi> of various members of
                    the Antonine family from Hadrian to Geta. The central <hi rend="italic"
                    >emblema</hi> or medallion represents the drinking contest between Bacchus and
                    Hercules, and round this medallion is a band of repoussé figures showing the
                    triumphal procession of Bacchus after winning the contest. He sits triumphant in
                    his leopard-drawn car, while Hercules is led along, helplessly intoxicated,
                    supported by bacchanals. A long line of nymphs, fauns, and satyrs complete the
                    circular band.</p>
                <p>The so-çalled “shield of Scipio,” also in the Paris Bibliothèque, which was found
                    in the Rhone near Avignon, is the finest example of Roman plate of the 4th
                    century. It is not a shield, but a large silver patera, about 26 inches in
                    diameter, with a repoussé relief representing the restoration of Briseis to
                    Achilles. The composition and general design are good, but the execution is
                    feeble and rather coarse.</p>

                <p>The British Museum possesses good specimens of Roman silver work in its last
                    stage of decline. These are two large caskets or toilet boxes, with silver
                    unguent vases, oblong <hi rend="italic">lances,</hi> paterae, ewers, spoons, and
                    other objects, all found in Rome in 1793. The caskets are decorated in low
                    relief with somewhat blunt repoussé figures and ornaments. The rim of one casket
                    is incised with the following words—SECUNDE ET PR0IECTA VIVATIS IN CHRISTO. One
                    of the silver vases has the words <hi rend="smallcaps">pelegrina vtere</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">felix.</hi> The legend on the casket, and the which appears
                    among the ornaments, show that it was made for a Roman lady, named Projecta, who
                    was a Christian; her portrait, together with that of her husband Secundus, is on
                    the centre of the lid in a medallion supported by two cupids. With the exception
                    of a pair of small silver two-handled vases, undecorated, but of the purest
                    Greek-like form, these various pieces of silver work probably date from the 5th
                    century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Visconti, <hi

                    pieces of plate, both in style of workmanship and the character of their
                    decoration, resemble the work of Greek artists; in some cases nothing but the
                    costume of the figures embossed upon them shows that they were not produced in
                    Athens.</p>
                <p>The earliest in style is a massive gold phiale (φtαλτ∕ <hi rend="italic"
                    >μεσόμφαλος)</hi> covered with the richest and most minute surface ornament. The
                    motive of the design is taken from an open lotus flower; the petals form
                    radiating lobes, and these petals are entirely covered with delicate
                    scroll-work, surrounding Greek-like gorgons’ heads, and other smaller heads,
                    savage-looking and bearded. Though perhaps rather overloaded with ornament, this
                    beautiful phiale, which shows strong traces of Phoenician or Assyrian influence,
                    is a real masterpiece of decorative design. Of later date, probably 4th century
                    B.C., is a small gold bottle, Hellenic in form, but ornamented with a band of
                    nonHellenic figures in relief—Scythian bowmen, as their dress clearly shows. The
                    grandest piece of all is a large silver amphora, of about the same date, shaped
                    like the Greek fictile amphorae, and ornamented with a beautiful flowing
                    pattern, of pure Hellenic honeysuckle form, mingled with birds and very highly
                    projecting animals’ heads. On the shoulder of the vase there is a band of
                    Scythians and horses, executed with great spirit and refinement.<note

                    splendid vase, so graceful in outline, and so pure in its decoration, was not

                    modelling of the figures, show that they were produced under late Roman
                    influence, or in some cases possibly even Greek influence in a highly degraded
                    state, handed down from the time of Alexander’s Indian conquests.</p>
                <p>Under the Sasanian kings of Persia (from the 3rd to 6th centuries) very massive
                    and richly decorated gold vases, bowls, and bottles were made (fig. 8). Those
                    which still exist show a curious mingling of ancient Assyrian art with that of
                    Rome in its decline. Reliefs representing winged lions, or the sacred tree
                    between its attendant beasts, alternate with subjects from Roman mythology, such
                    as the rape of Ganymede; but all are treated alike with much originality, and in
                    a highly decorative manner. The Paris Bibliothèque and the Vienna Museum contain
                    some fine specimens.</p>
                <p>The gold and silver work of Russia resembles in style that of Byzantium at an
                    early period. Shrines and other magnificent pieces of plate in the treasury of
                    the cathedral at Moscow (see Weltmann, <hi rend="italic">Le trésor de
                    Moscou,</hi> 1861), though executed at the end of the 15th century, are exactly
                    similar in design to Byzantine work of the 11th or 12th century, and even since
                    then but little change or development of style has taken place.</p>
                <p>The caliphs of Baghdad, the sultans of Egypt, and other Moslem rulers were once
                    famed for their rich stores of plate, which was probably of extreme beauty both
                    in design and workmanship. Little or nothing of this Moslem plate now remains,
                    and it is only possible to judge of its style and magnificence from the fine
                    works in brass and other less valuable metals which have survived to our
                    time.</p>

                    semi-barbarian peoples, who in the 6th century were masters of Spain, France,
                    and parts of central Europe, produced great quantities of work in the precious
                    metals, especially gold, often of great magnificence of design and not without
                    some skill in workmanship. In 1837 a large number of pieces of very massive gold
                    plate were found at Petrossa in Roumania; much of this find was unfortunately
                    broken up and melted, but a considerable portion was saved, and is now in the
                    museum at Bucharest. These magnificent objects are all of solid gold, and
                    consist of large dishes, vases, ewers, baskets of open work, and personal
                    ornaments (fig. 9). Some of them show a strong Roman influence in their design,
                    others are more purely barbaric in style. To the first of these classes belongs
                    a very fine phiale or patera, 10 inches in diameter. In the centre is a seated
                    statuette of a goddess, holding a cup, while all round, in high relief, are
                    standing figures of various male and female deities, purely Roman in style.
                    Though the execution is somewhat clumsy, there is much reminiscence of classical
                    grace in the attitudes and drapery of these figures. A large basket and other

                    The date of this Petrossa treasure is supposed to be the 6th century. The
                    celebrated Gourdon gold cup and tray now preserved in Paris belong to about the
                    same date. They are very rich and magnificent, quite free from any survival of
                    classic influence, and in style resemble the Merovingian gold work which was
                    found in the tomb of Childeric I. The cup is three inches high, shaped like a
                    miniature two-handled chalice; its companion oblong tray or plate has a large
                    cross in high relief in the centre. They are elaborately ornamented with inlaid
                    work of turquoises and garnets, and delicate filigree patterns in gold, soldered
                    on.</p>
                <p>In the 6th century Byzantium was the chief centre for the production of large and
                    magnificent works in the precious metals. The religious fervour and the great
                    wealth of Justinian and his successors filled the churches of Byzantium, not
                    only with enormous quantities of gold and silver chalices, shrines, and other
                    smaller pieces of ecclesiastical plate, but even large altars, with tall
                    pillared baldacchini over them, fonts, massive candelabra, statues, and high
                    screens, all made of the precious metals. The wealth and artistic splendour with
                    which St Peter’s in Rome and St Sophia in Constantinople were enriched is now
                    almost inconceivable. To read the mere inventories of these treasures dazzles
                    the imagination,—such as that given in the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi

                    the long list of treasures given by Constantine to St Peter’s before he
                    transferred his seat of empire to Byzantium (330), and the scarcely less
                    wonderful list of gold and silver plate presented to the same basilica by Pope
                    Symmachus (498-514).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>During the 7th century France and other Western countries were but little behind
                    Italy and Byzantium in their production of massive works, both secular and
                    religious, in the precious metals. St Éloy, the French goldsmith bishop, made a
                    number of most splendid shrines and other sacred furniture in beaten gold—among
                    them large shrines for the relics of St Denis, St Geneviève, and St Martin, as
                    well as gold thrones, plate, and jewellery for the French kings Clothaire II.
                    and Dagobert I. At this time every cathedral or abbey church in Germany, France,
                    and even England began to accumulate rich treasures of every kind in gold and
                    silver, enriched with jewels and enamel; but few specimens, however, still exist
                    of the work of this early period. The most notable are Charlemagne’s

                    Milan—the gift of Queen Theodelinda in the early part of the 7th century.<note

                <p>The existing examples of magnificent early work in the precious metals mostly
                    belong to a somewhat later period. The chief are the gold and silver altar in
                    Sant’ Ambrogio at Milan, of the 9th century; the “Paia d’Oro,” or gold retable,
                    in St Mark’s at Venice, begun in the 10th century (see <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    his wife Cunigunde, at the beginning of the 11th century, to the cathedral at
                    Basel. The last is about 4 feet high by 6 feet long, repoussé in high relief,
                    with figures of Christ, the three archangels, and St Benedict, standing under an
                    arcade of round arches; it is now in the Cluny Museum in Paris.<note

                <p>A most valuable description of the various methods of work practised by gold-and
                    silver-smiths in the 11th and 12th centuries is given by the monk Theophilus in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Diversarum Artium Schedula</hi> (Hendrie’s ed., 1847). He
                    minutely describes every possible process that could be employed in making and
                    ornamenting elaborate pieces of ecclesiastical plate—such as smelting, refining,
                    hammering, chasing and repoussé work, soldering, casting (by the “cire perdue”
                    process), wire-drawing, gilding with mercury amalgam, and the application of
                    niello, enamel, and gems.</p>
                <p>The silversmith of those days, as in classical times, was not only a thorough
                    artist with a complete sense of beauty and fitness in his work, but he was also
                    a craftsman of the most varied fertility of resource, and made himself
                    thoroughly responsible for every part of his work and every stage through which
                    it passed,—a most striking contrast to the modern subdivision of labour, and
                    eagerness to produce a show of neatness without regard to real excellence of
                    work, which is the curse of all 19th-century handicrafts, and one of the main
                    reasons why our modern productions are in the main neither works of true art nor
                    objects of real lasting utility.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Italian Plate.—</hi> Before the latter part of the 15th
                    century, large pieces of silver work were made more for ecclesiastical use than
                    for the gratification of private luxury. The great silver shrine in Orvieto
                    cathedral, made to contain the blood-stained corporal of the famous Bolsena
                    miracle, is one of the chief of these. It is a very large and elaborate work in
                    solid silver, made to imitate the west front of a cathedral, and decorated in
                    the most sumptuous way with figures cast and chased in relief, and a wonderful
                    series of miniature-like pictures embossed in low relief and covered with
                    translucent enamels of various brilliant colours. This splendid piece of silver
                    work was executed about 1338 by Ugolino da Siena and his pupils. The other most
                    important pieces of silver work in Italy are the frontal and retable of St James
                    in the cathedral at Pistoia, and the altar of San Giovanni at Florence (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Metal-Work).</hi> On these two works were employed a whole
                    series of the chief Tuscan artists of the 14 th and 15th centuries, many of
                    whom, though of great reputation in other branches of art, such as painting,
                    sculpture on a large scale, and architecture, did not disdain to devote their
                    utmost skill, and years of labour, to work which we now as a rule consign to
                    craftsmen of the very smallest capacity.</p>
                <p>Among the distinguished names of Florentines who during the space of one century
                    only, the 15th, worked in gold and silver, the following may be given to suggest
                    the high rank which this class of work took among the arts :— Brunelleschi,
                    Ghiberti, Donatello, Luca della Robbia, the two Pollaiuoli, Verrocchio,
                    Michelozzo, Ghirlandaio, Botticelli, Lorenzo di Credi, Baccio Baldini, and
                    Francia. The cities of Italy which chiefly excelled in this religious and
                    beautiful class of silver-work during the 14th and 15th centuries were Florence,
                    Siena, Arezzo, Pisa, and Pistoia.</p>
                <p>Owing to the demoralization and increase of luxury which grew in Italy with such
                    startling rapidity during the early years of the 16th century, the wealth and
                    artistic skill which in the previous centuries had been mainly devoted to
                    religious objects were diverted into a different channel, and became for the
                    most part absorbed in the production of magnificent pieces of plate—vases,
                    ewers, dishes, and the like—of large size, and decorated in the most lavish way
                    with the fanciful and over-luxuriant forms of ornament introduced by the already
                    declining taste of the Renaissance. This demand created a new school of
                    metal-workers, among whom Benvenuto Cellini <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n193/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0193-0184"/> (1500-1571) was perhaps the ablest, and certainly
                    the most prominent. His graphic and often shameless autobiography makes him one
                    of the foremost and most vivid figures of this wonderful 16th century, in which
                    the most bestial self-indulgence was mingled with the keenest enthusiasm for
                    art. Cellini’s work is always perfect in execution, but very unequal in merit of
                    design; some of his silver pieces, such as the large salt-cellar made for
                    Francis I., are much marred by an attempt to produce a massive grandeur of
                    effect, on a scale and in a material quite unsuited to such ambitious and
                    sculpturesque effects. Cellini’s influence on the design of silver plate was
                    very great, not only in Italy and France, where his life was spent, but also on
                    the great silversmiths of Augsburg and Nuremberg, many of whose finest pieces
                    are often attributed to Cellini.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Germany.—</hi> From very early times Germany was specially
                    famed for its works in the precious metals, mostly, as in other countries, for
                    ecclesiastical use. In the 15th century a large quantity of secular plate was
                    produced, of very beautiful design and the most skilful workmanship. Tall
                    covered cups or hanaps on slender stems, modelled with a series of bosses
                    something like a pineapple and surmounted by a cleverly wrought flower, or
                    beakers, cylindrical tankards with lids, enriched with delicate Gothic cresting
                    or applied foliage, are the most beautiful in form and decoration. On the lids
                    of these cups are frequently placed heraldic figures, holding shields with the
                    owner’s arms, modelled and cast with great spirit and finish. One celebrated
                    silver beaker, of about 1400, now in the South Kensington Museum (fig. 10), is
                    ornamented with Gothic traceried windows filled in with translucent
                    enamels.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Shaw, <hi

                    covered with figures and foliage in minute niello work, a most elaborate and
                    splendid piece of plate.</p>
                <p>During the first half of the 16th century Augsburg and Nuremberg, long celebrated
                    for their silver work, developed a school of artists in plate whose productions
                    are of the most unrivalled beauty, at once graceful in general form and
                    decorated in slight relief with arabesques, strap-work, wreaths, and figure
                    subjects arranged with the utmost good taste, and modelled and chased with the
                    most perfect precision of touch. Though influenced by the contemporary
                    silver-work of Italy, the works of Paul Flint, Wenzel</p>
                <p>Jamnitzer (1508-1585), and Theodor de Bry of Liège (1528-98) are free from the
                    extravagance of outline and over-elaboration of detail which often disfigure the
                    grand silver pieces of men like Cellini (see fig. 11). In Germany the traditions
                    of earlier Gothic art were less rapidly broken with; and many purely Gothic
                    forms survived there till quite the end of the 16th century. In the first half
                    of the 17 th century the technical skill of the German silversmiths reached its
                    highest point of perfection, but there was some falling off in their designs,
                    which rapidly lost their purity of outline. Switzerland produced several
                    silversmiths whose work is similar to that of this German school, especially
                    their large plateaux and ewers, most richly and gracefully covered with
                    ornament, all finished with almost gem-like minuteness. The principal among
                    these artists was François Briot, all of whose productions are of extreme
                    beauty. The majority of his existing works are not in silver, but in pewter, and
                    thus by their absence of intrinsic value have escaped the melting pot (fig. 12).
                    Gaspar Enderlein was another workman of this school, whose productions cannot
                    always be distinguished from those of Briot. Though born in Switzerland, these
                    artists really belong to the great Augsburg and Nuremberg school.</p>
                <p>Many of the famous 15th and 16th century painters, such as Martin Schön, Israel
                    von Mecken, and Holbein, used to supply the silver-workers with elaborate
                    designs for plate. Virgil Solis of Nuremberg (1514-1562) was especially fertile
                    in this sort of invention, and executed a large series of etchings of designs
                    for vases, cups, ewers, tazze, and all sorts of plate.<note anchored="true"

                    magnificent works in the precious metals. The cathedral of Gerona still
                    possesses a most massive silver retable, made by a Valencian silversmith called
                    Peter Bernec. The gold and silver altar-frontal<pb break="no"

                    from this cathedral by the French in the present century. Another very large and
                    beautiful piece of silver work is the throne, Northern Gothic in style, made for
                    King Martin of Aragon, about 1400, and now preserved in Barcelona cathedral.
                    Till after 1500 little that is distinctively Spanish appears in the style of
                    their silver work. At first Moorish influence, and then that of France and
                    Germany, appear to have been paramount. It is not till the 16th century that a
                    really Spanish school of art was developed; and the discovery of America with
                    its rich stores of gold and silver gave an enormous impetus to this class of
                    work.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Riano, <hi

                    personal ornaments, such as torques, fibulae, and the like. A magnificent suit
                    of gold armour, repoussé with simple patterns of lines and dots, was found some
                    years ago at Mold in Flintshire, and is now in the British Museum.<note

                    Ireland during the past century has been enormous; but, owing to the unfortunate
                    law of “treasure-trove,” by far the greater part was immediately melted down by
                    the finders. Little of this period that can be called plate has been discovered
                    in the British Isles,—unlike Denmark and other Scandinavian countries, where the
                    excavation of tombs has in many cases yielded rich results in the way of massive
                    cups, bowls, ladles, and horns of solid gold, mostly decorated with simple
                    designs of spirals, concentric circles, or interlaced grotesques. Others are of
                    silver, parcel-gilt, and some have figure subjects in low relief (fig. 13). In
                    like manner, during the Saxon period, though gold and silver jewellery was
                    common, yet little plate appears to have been made, with the exception of
                    shrines, altar-frontals, and vessels for ecclesiastical use, of which every
                    important church in England must have possessed a magnificent stock. With regard
                    to English secular plate, though but few early examples still exist, we know
                    from various records, such as wills and inventories, that the 14th century was
                    one in which every rich lord or burgher prided himself on his fine and massive
                    collection of silver vessels; on festive occasions this was displayed, not only
                    on the dinner-table, but also on sideboards, arranged with tiers of steps, one
                    above the other, so as to show off to advantage the weighty silver vases,
                    flagons, and dishes with which it was loaded. The central object on every rich
                    man’s table was the “nef ”—a large silver casket, usually (as the name suggests)
                    in the form of a ship, and arranged to contain the host’s napkin, goblet, spoon,
                    and knife, with an assortment of spices and salt. Great sums were often spent on
                    this large and elaborate piece of plate, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> one made
                    for the duke of Anjou in the 14th century weighed</p>
                <p>348 marks of gold. The English silversmiths of this period were highly skilled in
                    their art, and produced objects of great beauty both in design and workmanship.
                    One of the finest specimens of late 14th century plate which still exists is a
                    silver cup belonging to the mayor and corporation of King’s Lynn. It is graceful
                    and chalice-like in form, skilfully chased, and decorated in a very rich and
                    elaborate way with coloured translucent enamels (fig. 14) of ladies and youths,
                    several with hawks on their wrists.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Sculpture, &lt;fcc.,</hi> 1838.</p></note> Silver saltcellars were among the
                    most elaborate pieces of plate produced during the 15th century. Several
                    colleges at Oxford and Cambridge still possess fine specimens of these (fig.
                    15); the favourite shape was a kind of hour-glass form richly ornamented with
                    spiral fluting or bosses.</p>
                <p>But few existing specimens of English plate are older than the beginning of the
                    15th century. Among the few that remain the principal are two or three
                    chalices—such as the two large gold ones found in the coffin of an archbishop of
                    York, now used for holy communion in the cathedral, and a fine silver chalice
                    from the church of Berwick St James, Wilts, now in the British Museum. Both this
                    and the York chalices are devoid of ornament, but, judging from their shape,
                    appear to be of the 12th or 13th century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Among the most important existing specimens are the solid
                    gold chalice and paten preserved at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, the gift of

                <p>It is interesting to note the various changes of form through which the
                    ecclesiastical chalice passed from early Christian times till the 16th century.
                    It was at first an ordinary secular cup (fig. 16, A), with two handles classical
                    in form, and of large capacity, because the laity as well as the clergy received
                    the wine. The double handles were of practical use in passing the cup round like
                    a modern “loving cup.” The first alteration was the omission of the handles, so
                    that it took the form B, with large hemispherical bowl, a round foot, and a knop
                    for security in holding it. For some centuries it appears to have been the
                    custom for the priest to hold the chalice, while the communicant sucked the wine
                    through a silver tube or “fistula.” Some of the most magnificent <pb break="no"

                    bowl mounted in bands, set with jewels, and enriched with minute filigree
                    work,—a design which appears to have been taken from those cups, such as the
                    four magnificent examples in the treasury of St Mark’s at Venice, which have
                    their bowl cut out of crystal, onyx, or some -other precious stone.<note

                    rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Messe,</hi> Paris, 1882, in
                    progress.</p></note> The finest examples of this class are the Ardagh chalice,
                    now in the Dublin Museum, and the chalice of St Remigius, in Rheims cathedral;
                    both are most magnificent specimens of the taste and skill of 11th-century
                    goldsmiths. C shows the next form (12th and 13th centuries). The design is
                    simpler; there is a distinct shaft, extending above and below the knop; and on
                    the foot is marked a cross, not found in the earlier ones, to show which side
                    the priest is to hold towards lιimself at celebration. The next alteration in
                    the form of chalice, which occurred in the 14th century, was to make the foot
                    not circular in plan but polygonal or lobed, so that the cυp might not roll when
                    laid on its side to drain, after it had been rinsed out. It thus took the shape
                    D, and this form lasted in most countries till about 1500, and in England till
                    the Reformation. In countries which did not adopt the Reformed faith the shape
                    was altered, by the general growth of the Renaissance, into a form frequently
                    like E. But in England the change was more complete; the bowl, which in the
                    previous two or three centuries had been slowly reduced in size, owing to the
                    gradually introduced practice of refusing the wine to the laity, was suddenly
                    made more capacious, and the form was altered to the shape F, in order that the
                    Protestant “communion cup” might bear no resemblance to the old Catholic
                    “massing chalice.” This was ordered to be done in 1562, {see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arch. Jour.</hi> xxv. 44-53). The last form, G, shows the usual shape of
                    sepulchral chalices, which, before the Reformation, were •enclosed in the
                    coffins of all ecclesiastics who had received priest’s orders. These are without
                    the knop, and were frequently made of pewter, tin, or even wax, as they were not
                    meant for use. In some few cases a real chalice was buried with some
                    ecclesiastic of rank, but this was exceptional.</p>
                <p>Secular plate during the 15th and 16th centuries was very similar in style to
                    that made in Germany, though the English silversmiths of the latter century
                    never quite equalled the skill or artistic talent of the great Nuremberg and
                    Augsburg silver-workers. In the 17th century, during the reigns of James I. and
                    Charles I., many fine pieces of plate, especially tall hanaps and tankards, were
                    made of very graceful form and decoration. The greater part of this, and all
                    earlier plate, especially the fine collections belonging to the universities,
                    were melted down during the Civil War. In Charles II.’s reign returning
                    prosperity and the increase of luxury in England caused the production of many
                    magnificent pieces of plate, often on a large scale, such as toilet services,
                    wine-coolers, and even fire-dogs and tables. These are very florid in their
                    ornament, and mostly have lost the beautiful forms of the century before (fig.
                    17). In the early part of the</p>
                <p>18th century the designs are mostly poor, and the decoration rather coarse, till
                    tho time of the classical revival which was brought about mainly by the
                    discovery of the buried cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. A quite different
                    style of plate then came into vogue—semiclassical both in form and decoration,
                    and often worked with great delicacy of treatment. A good deal of plate in this
                    style was made under the influence of the brothers Adam (fig. 18), distinguished
                    architects in the second half of the 18th century. Of modern plate from the art
                    point of view there is nothing to say; it is nearly always poor in design and
                    feeble in execution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Assay of Gold and Silver Plate.—</hi> The primitive method
                    of testing the purity of the metal was by marking a streak with it on the
                    touch-stone, and comparing the colour of the mark with that made by various
                    pieces of gold or silver of known degrees of purity. Assay by cupellation is now
                    employed for silver: a piece of the silver to be tested is melted with some lead
                    in a cupel or bone-ash crucible; the lead is oxidized, and rapidly sinks into
                    the bone-ash, carrying with it any other impurities which are present. The
                    residue of pure silver is then weighed, and by its loss shows how much alloy it
                    contained. Gold is now tested by an elaborate chemical process by which the
                    trial bit is dissolved in acid, and then thrown down in the form of precipitate,
                    which can be examined by a careful quantitative analysis. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Assaying, Gold,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Silver.</hi></p>
                <p>The standard of purity required in the time of Edward I. was, for gold, that it
                    should be of the “Paris touch,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 19⅛ carats out of
                    24. Before then 22 carats was the standard. Silver was to be “of the sterling
                    alloy,” viz., 11 oz. 2 dwts. to the pound. Except for a time during the 16th
                    century, this standard of silver has been kept up, and is still required by
                    law.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hall-marks on Silver.—</hi> In the 13th century the English
                    Guild of Gold-and Silver-smiths had grown into great importance, and had
                    acquired monopolies and many special privileges. In order to keep the standard
                    up to the required purity the system of requiring each article to be stamped
                    with certain marks was introduced by royal command. The first of these was the
                    <hi rend="italic">King's mark-Λ</hi> leopard’s or lion’s head crowned. This was
                    introduced in 1300 by Edward I. (29 Edw. 1. stat. 3, c. 30). The second, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Makers mark,</hi> was added in 1363 (37 Edw. III. c. 7). This
                    might be any badge or initial chosen by the master silversmith himself. The
                    third was the <hi rend="italic">Year letter</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Assayer’s
                    mark</hi>; this was an alphabet, one letter being used for a year, counting from

                    one alphabet was exhausted, another with differently shaped letters was begun.
                    The first of these series of year-letters commences in 1438. The earliest
                    existing piece of plate which has the three marks <pb break="no"

                    to Sir Ralph Pudsey; this has the year mark for 1445. Other marks, subsequently
                    introduced, were the lion passant, first used in 1545; the lion’s head erased,
                    and a full-length figure of Britannia, used only between 1697 and 1720; and
                    lastly the portrait of the reigning sovereign, which has been in use since 1784.
                    In addition to these general hall marks, the plate made in various towns had
                    from the year 1423 certain special provincial marks. The best work on
                    hall-marked plate and the marks themselves, with the history of the

                    Delhi, Benares, Lucknow, Cutch, and other places in India and Kashmir still
                    produce a quantity of beautiful silver and gold work,— chiefly ewers, basins,

                    patterns. Their style in the main is Moslem, but some combine an Arab form with
                    native Indian surface decoration. This class of work is not a revival, but has
                    been practised and handed down by unbroken tradition, and with little or no
