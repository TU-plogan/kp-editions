                <p><label type="entry">PROJECTION</label>. If from a fixed point S in space lines or
                    rays be drawn to different points A,B,C, . . . in space, and if these rays are
                    cut by a plane in points A',B',C', . . . the latter are called the projections
                    of the given points on the plane. Instead of the plane another surface may be
                    taken, and then the points are projected to that surface instead of to a plane.
                    In this manner any figure, plane or in space of three dimensions, may be
                    projected to any surface from any point which is called the centre of
                    projection. If the figure projected is in three dimensions then this projection
                    is the same as that used in what is generally known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >perspective.</hi></p>
                <p>In modern mathematics the word <hi rend="italic">projection</hi> is often taken
                    with a slightly different meaning, supposing that plane figures are projected
                    into plane figures, but three-dimensional ones into three-dimensional figures.
                    Projection in this sense, when treated by coordinate geometry, leads in its

                    of invariants and co-variants.</p>
                <p>In this article projection will be treated from a purely geometrical point of
                    view.</p>
                <p>We shall first and principally treat of the projection of plane figures into
                    plane figures, and consider a number of special cases due to special positions
                    of the two planes or of the centre of projection. We shall next consider the
                    representation of figures of three dimensions by plane figures (orthographic
                    projections, drawing in plan and elevation, &amp;c.), then treat of perspective
                    in its ordinary sense, and speak shortly of projections to curved surfaces.</p>
                <p>References like (G. § 87) relate to section II. of the article <hi

                <p>§ 1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Projection of Plane Figures.—</hi> Let us suppose we
                    have in space two planes π and π'. In the plane π a figure is given having known
                    properties; then we have the problem to find its projection from some centre S
                    to the plane ιr', and to deduce from the known properties of the given figure
                    the properties of the new one.</p>
                <p>If a point A is given in the plane <hi rend="italic">π</hi> we have to join it to
                    the centre S and find the point A' where this ray SA cuts the plane √; it is the
                    projection of A. On the other hand if A' is given in the plane √, then A will be
                    its projection in τr. Hence <hi rend="italic">if one figure in √ is the
                    projection of another in ιr, then conversely the latter is also the projection
                    of the former.</hi></p>
                <p>A point and its projection are therefore also called corresponding points, and
                    similarly we speak of corresponding lines and curves, &amp;c.</p>

                <p>§ 2. We at once get the following properties :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The projection of a point is a point, mid one point
                    only.</hi><hi rend="italic">The projection of a line {straight line) is a

                    which is the projection of the given line.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If a point lies in a line its projection lies in the projection
                    of the line.</hi><hi rend="italic">The projection of the line joining two

                    of the line AB contains the rays SA, SB which project the points A, B.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The prelection of the point of intersection of two lines a, b
                    is the point of intersection of the projections a', b' of those lines.</hi></p>

                    the points of intersection of the projections of the given curves.</hi></p>
                <p>If a line cuts a curve in <hi rend="italic">n</hi> points, then the projection of
                    the line cuts the projection of the curve in <hi rend="italic">n</hi> points. Or
                    <hi rend="italic">The order of a curve remains unaltered by projection.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">The projection of a tangent to a curve is a tangent to the
                    projection of the curve.</hi> For the tangent is a line which has two coincident

                <p>The number of tangents that can be drawn from a point to a curve remains
                    unaltered by projection. Or <hi rend="italic">The class of a curve remains
                    unaltered by projection.</hi><hi rend="italic">Example. —</hi> The projection of
                    a circle is a curve of the second order and second class.</p>
                <p>§ 3. Two figures of which one is a projection of the other obtained in the manner
                    described may be moved out of the position in which ^they are obtained. They are
                    then still said to be one the projection of the other, or to be projective or
                    homographie. But when they are in the position originally considered they are
                    said to be in <hi rend="italic">perspective position,</hi> or (shorter) to be
                    <hi rend="italic">perspective.</hi></p>
                <p>All the properties stated in §§ 1, 2 hold for figures which are projective,
                    whether they are perspective or not. There are others which hold only for
                    projective figures when they are in perspective position, which we shall now
                    consider.</p>
                <p>If two planes π and √ are perspective, then their line of intersection is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">axis of projection.</hi> Any point in this line coincides
                    with its projection. Hence <hi rend="italic">All points in the axis are their
                    own projections.</hi> Hence also <hi rend="italic">Every line meets its
                    projection on the axis.</hi></p>
                <p>The property that the lines joining corresponding points all pass through a
                    common point, that any pair of corresponding points and the centre are in a
                    line, is also expressed by saying that the figures are co-linear; and the fact
                    that both figures have a line, the axis, in common on which corresponding lines
                    meet is expressed by saying that the figures are co-axal.</p>
                <p>The connexion between these properties has to be investigated.</p>
                <p>For this purpose we consider in the plane <hi rend="italic">π</hi> a triangle
                    ABC, and let the lines BC, CA, AB be denoted by <hi rend="italic">a, b, c.</hi>
                    The projection will consist of three points A', B', C' and three lines <hi
                    rend="italic">a', b', c'.</hi> These have such a position that the lines A A',
                    BB', CC' meet in a point, viz., at S, and the points of intersection of <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a', b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b',
                    c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c'</hi> lie on the axis (by § 2). The two triangles
                    therefore are said to be both co-linear and co-axal. Of these properties either
                    is a consequence of the other, as will now be proved.</p>
                <p>§ 4. <hi rend="smallcaps">Desargue’s theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If two
                    triangles, whether in the same plane or not, are co-linear they are
                    co-axal.</hi> Or <hi rend="italic">If the lines</hi> A A', BB', CC' <hi

                    rend="italic">and</hi> C'A', AB <hi rend="italic">and</hi> A'B' <hi
                    rend="italic">are three points in a line.</hi> Conversely, <hi rend="italic">If
                    two triangles are co-axal they are co linear.</hi> Or <hi rend="italic">If the
                    intersection of the sides of two triangles</hi> ABC <hi rend="italic">and</hi>

                    A'B', <hi rend="italic">lie in a line, then the lines</hi> AA', BB', <hi
                    rend="italic">and</hi> CC' <hi rend="italic">meet in a point.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Proof.—het</hi> us first suppose the triangles to be in different
                    planes. By supposition the lines AA', BB', CC' (fig. 1) meet in a point S. But
                    three intersecting lines determine three planes, SBC, SCA, and SAB. In the first
                    lie the points B, C and also B', C'. Hence the lines BC and B'C' will intersect
                    at some point P, because any two lines in the same plane intersect. Similarly CA
                    and C'A' will intersect at some point Q, and AB and A'B' at some point R. These
                    points P, Q, R lie in the •pluie of the triangle ABC because they are points on
                    the sides of this triangle, and similarly in the plane of the triangle A'B'C ’.
                    Hence they lie in the intersection of two planes,—that is, in a line.</p>
                <p>Secondly, If the triangles ABC and A'B'C' lie both in the same plane the above
                    proof does not hold. In this case we may consider the plane figure as the
                    projection of the figure in space of which we have just proved the theorem. Let
                    ABC, A'B'C' be the co-linear tiiaigles with S as centre, so that AA', BB', CC'
                    meet at S. Take now any point in space, say your eye E, and from it draw the
                    rays projecting the figure. In the line ES take any point S <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 1</hi>, and in EA, EB, EC take points A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> respectively, but so
                    that S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are not in a plane. In
                    the plane ESA which projects the line <hi rend="smallcaps">S</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript smallcaps"> j</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">A</hi><hi rend="subscript
                    smallcaps"> j</hi> lie then the line S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> α</hi> and also EA'; these will therefore meet in a point A'
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, of which A' will be the projection. Similarly
                    points B' <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, C' <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are
                    found. Hence we have now in space two triangles AjB <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and A' <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B' <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> C'ι which are co-linear. They are therefore co-axal,
                    that is, the points P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, Q <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, R <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, where A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, &amp;c., meet will lie in a line. Their
                    projections therefore lie in a line. But these are the points P, Q, R, which
                    were to be proved to lie in a line.</p>
                <p>This proves the first part of the theorem. The second part or converse theorem is
                    proved in exactly the same way. For another proof see (G. § 37).</p>
                <p>§ 5. By aid of Desargue’s theorem we can now prove a fundamental property of two
                    projective planes.</p>
                <p>Let s be the axis, S the centre, and let A, A' and B, B' be two pairs of
                    corresponding points which we suppose fixed, and C, C' any other pair of
                    corresponding points. Then the triangles ABC and A'B'C' are co-axal, and they
                    will remain co-axal if the one plane √ be turned relative to the other about the
                    axis. They will therefore, by Desargue’s theorem, remain co-linear, and the
                    centre will be the point S', where AA' meets BB'. Hence the line joining any
                    pair of corresponding points C, C' will pass through the centre S'. The figures
                    are therefore perspective. This will remain true if the planes are turned till
                    they coincide, because Desargue’s theorem remains true.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If two planes are
                    perspective, then if the one plane be turned about the axis through any angle,
                    especially if the one plane be turned till it coincides with the other, the two
                    planes will remain perspective; corresponding lines toill still meet on a line
                    called the axis, and the lines joining corresponding points will still pass
                    through a common centre</hi> S <hi rend="italic">situated in the. plane.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Whilst the one plane is turned this point</hi> S <hi rend="italic"
                    >will move in a circle whose centre lies in the plane π, which is kept fixed,
                    and whose plane is perpendicular to the axis.</hi></p>
                <p>The last part will be proved presently. As the plane <hi rend="italic">ιr'</hi>
                    may be turned about the axis in one or the opposite sense, there will be two
                    perspective positions possible when the planes coincide.</p>
                <p>§ 6. Let (fig. 2) ιr, π' be the planes intersecting in the axis <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi> whilst S is the centre of projection. To project a point A in π we join
                    A to S and see where this line cuts π'. This gives the point A'. But if we draw
                    through S any line parallel to ττ, then this line will cut ιr' in some point Γ,
                    and if all lines through S be draλvn which are parallel to <hi rend="italic"
                    >π</hi> these will form a plane parallel to <hi rend="italic">π</hi> which will
                    cut the plane τr' in a line <hi rend="italic">i'</hi> parallel to the axis s. If
                    we say that a line parallel to a plane cuts the latter at an infinite distance,
                    we may say that all points at an infinite distance in <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    are projected into points which lie in a straight line <hi rend="italic"
                    >i',</hi> and conversely all points in the line are projected to an infinite
                    distance in π, whilst all other points are projected to finite points. We say
                    therefore that all points in the plane τ at an infinite distance may be
                    considered as lying in a straight line, because their projections lie in a line.
                    Thus we are again led to consider points at infinity in a plane as lying in a
                    line (comp. G. §§ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.~ <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>Similarly there is a line/ in <hi rend="italic">π</hi> which is projected to
                    infinity in π'; this projection shall be denoted by <hi rend="italic">j'</hi> so
                    that <hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="italic">anàj'</hi> are lines at
                    infinity.</p>
                <p>§ 7. If we suppose through S a plane drawn perpendicular to the axis <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> cutting it at T, and in this plane the two lines SΓ
                    parallel to π and SJ parallel to √, then the lines through I' and J parallel to
                    the axis will be the lines <hi rend="italic">i'</hi> and/. At the same time a
                    parallelogram SJTΓS has been formed. If now the plane √ be turned about the
                    axis, then the points Γ and J will not move in their planes; hence the lengths
                    TJ and TI', and therefore also SI' and SJ, will not change. If the plane w is
                    kept fixed in space the point J will remain fixed, and S describes a circle
                    about J as centre and with SJ as radius. This proves the last part of the
                    theorem in § 5. <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> I</p>
                <p>§ 8. The plane √ may be turned either in the sense indicated by the arrow at Z or
                    in the opposite sense till π' falls into π. In the first case we get a figure
                    like fig. 3; <hi rend="italic">i'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">j</hi> will be on
                    the same side of the axis, and on this side will also lie the centre S; <pb

                <p>and then ST=SJ + SI' or SΓ = JT, SJ = I'T. In the second case (fig. 4) <hi
                    rend="italic">i'</hi> and J will be on opposite sides of the axis, and the
                    centre</p>
                <p>S will lie between them in such a position that I'S = TJ and I'T = SJ. If ΓS =
                    SJ, the point S will lie on the axis.</p>
                <p>It follows that any one of the four points S, T, J, Γ is completely determined by
                    the other three: if the axis, the centre, and one of the lines <hi rend="italic"
                    >i'</hi> or <hi rend="italic">j</hi> are given the other is determined; the
                    three lines <hi rend="italic">s, i', j</hi> determine the centre; the centre and

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If the centre, the axis, and
                    either one pair of corresponding points on a line through the centre or one pair

                    lie on this line. But it must also lie on the line SB. Where both meet is B'.
                    That the figures thus obtained are really projective can be seen by aid of
                    Desargue’s theorem. For, if for any point C the corresponding point C' be found,
                    then the triangles ABC and A'B'C' are, by construction, co-linear, hence

                <p>§ 10. Rows and pencils which are projective or perspective have been considered
                    in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Geometry</hi> (G. §§ 12-40). All that has
                    been said there holds, of course, here for any pair of corresponding rows or
                    pencils. The centre of perspective for any pair of corresponding rows is at the
                    centre of projection S, whilst the axis contains coincident corresponding
                    elements. Corresponding pencils on the other hand have their axis of perspective
                    on the axis of projection whilst the coincident rays pass through the
                    centre.</p>
                <p>We mention here a few of those properties which are independent of the
                    perspective position :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The correspondence between two projective rows, or pencils, is
                    completely determined if to three elements in one the corresponding ones in the
                    other are given.</hi> If for instance in two projective rows three pairs of
                    corresponding points are given, then we can find to every other point in either
                    the corresponding point (G. §§ 29-36).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If A,</hi> B, C, D <hi rend="italic">are four points in a row
                    and A',</hi> B ’, C', D' <hi rend="italic">the corresponding points, then their
                    cross-ratios are equal</hi> (ABCD) = (A'B'C'D'), —where (ABCD) = AC/CB:
                    AD∕DB.</p>
                <p>If in particular the point D lies at infinity we have (ABCD) = - AC/CB = AC∕BC.
                    If therefore the points D and D' are both at infinity we have AC∕BC = AD∕BD, and
                    the rows are similar (G. § 39). This can only happen in special cases. For the
                    line joining corresponding points passes through the centre; the latter must
                    therefore lie at infinity if D, D' are different points at infinity. But if p
                    and D' coincide they must lie on the axis, that is, at the point at infinity of
                    the axis unless the axis is altogether at infinity.</p>
                <p>Hence— <hi rend="italic">In two perspective planes every row which is parallel to
                    the axis is similar to its corresponding roιo, and in general no other row has
                    this property.</hi><hi rend="italic">But if the centre or the axis is at
                    infinity then every row is similar to its corresponding row.</hi></p>
                <p>In either of these two cases the metrical properties are particularly simple. If
                    the axis is at infinity the ratio of similitude is the same for all rows and the
                    figures are similar. If the centre is at infinity we get parallel projection;
                    and the ratio of similitude changes from row to row (see §§ 16, 17).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">In both cases the mid-points of corresponding segments will be
                    corresponding points.</hi></p>

                    The points A' and B corresponding to them will in general be different points;
                    but it may happen that they coincide. Here a theorem holds similar to that about
                    rows (G. §§ 76 <hi rend="italic">sq. ).</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    where the line XA' cuts SC will be the point C' corresponding to C (§ 9). The
                    line B'D' also cuts the axis in X, and therefore the point D corresponding to D'

                <p>This point C' might also be got by drawing CB and joining its intersection Y with

                    now forms a complete quadrilateral, shows that in order to get involution the
                    corresponding points A and A' have to be harmonic conjugates with regard to S

                    not in perspective position, and state in some of the more important cases the
                    conditions which determine the correspondence between them. Here it is of great
                    advantage to start with another definition λvhich, though at first it may seem
                    to be of far greater generality, is in reality equivalent to the one given
                    before.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Definition.—</hi><hi rend="italic">We call two planes
                    projective if to every pointin one corresponds a paint in the other, to every
                    line a line, and to a point in a line a point in the corresponding line, in such
                    a manner that the cross-ratio of four points in a line, or of four rays in a
                    pencil, is equal to the cross-ratio of the corresponding points or
                    rays.</hi></p>
                <p>The last part about the equality of cross-ratios can be proved to be a
                    consequence of the first. But as space does not allow us to give an exact proof
                    for this we include it in the definition.</p>
                <p>If one plane is actually projected to another we get a correspondence which has
                    the properties required in the new definition. This shows that a correspondence
                    between two planes conform to this definition is possible. That it is also
                    definite we have to show. It follows at once that—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Corresponding rows, and likewise corresponding pencils, are

                <p>It is sufficient to prove the first part. Let any line <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    cut <hi rend="italic">u,</hi><hi rend="italic">v</hi> in the points A and B. To
                    these will correspond points A' and B' in <hi rend="italic">u'</hi> and <hi

                    corresponds then the line A'B'. Thus to every line in the one plane the
                    corresponding line in the other can be found, hence also to every point the
                    corresponding point.</p>

                    coincide with their corresponding points, or lines, in the other, then every
                    point and every line coincides with its corresponding point or line so that the
                    figures are identical.</hi></p>
                <p>If the four points A, B, C, D coincide with their corresponding points, then
                    every line joining two of these points will coincide with its corresponding
                    line. Thus the lines AB and CD, and therefore also <pb break="no"

                    their corresponding elements. The row AB has thus three points A, B, E
                    coincident with their corresponding points, and is therefore identical with it
                    (§ 10). As there are six lines which join two and two of the four points A, B,
                    C, D, there are six lines such that each point in either coincides with its
                    corresponding point. Every other line will thus have the six points in which it
                    cuts these, and therefore all points, coincident with their corresponding
                    points. The proof of the second part is exactly the same. It follows—</p>
                <p>§ 14. <hi rend="italic">If two projective figures which are not identical lie in
                    the same plane, then not more than three points which are not in a line, or

                    corresponding points or lines.</hi></p>
                <p>If the figures are in perspective position, then they have in common one line,
                    the axis, with all points in it, and one point, the centre, with all lines
                    through it. No other point or line can therefore coincide with its corresponding
                    point or line without the figures becoming identical.</p>
                <p>It follows also that—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The correspondence between two projective planes is completely
                    determined if there are given —cither to four points in the one the

                    line, or to any four lines the corresponding lines provided that no three of
                    them pass through a point.</hi></p>
                <p>To show this we observe first that two planes <hi rend="italic">π, π'</hi> may be
                    made projective in such a manner that four given points A, B, C, D in the one
                    correspond to four given points A,' B', C', D' in the other; for to the lines
                    AB, CD will correspond the lines A'B' and C'D', and to the intersection E of the
                    former the point E' where the latter meet. The correspondence between these rows
                    is therefore determined, as we know three pairs of corresp mding points. But
                    this determines a correspondence (by § 12). To prove that in this case and also
                    in the case of § 12 there is but one correspondence possible, let us suppose
                    there were two, or that we could have in the plane √ two figures which are each
                    projective to the figure in π and which have each the points A'B'C'D'
                    corresponding to the points ABCD in <hi rend="italic">τr.</hi> Then these two
                    figures will themselves be projective and have four corresponding points
                    coincident. They are therefore identical by § 13.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem. —</hi><hi rend="italic">Two projective planes will
                    be in perspective position if one row coincides with its corresponding row. The

                    >Proof.—</hi> As in this case every point on <hi rend="italic">s</hi> coincides
                    with its corresponding point, it follows that every row <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    meets its corresponding row <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> on s where corresponding
                    points are united. The two rows <hi rend="italic">a, a'</hi> are therefore
                    perspective (G. § 30), and the lines joining corresponding points will meet in a

                    itself. The points B, B' in which <hi rend="italic">r</hi> cuts another pair <hi
                    rend="italic">b, b'</hi> of corresponding rows must therefore be corresponding
                    points. Hence the lines joining corresponding points in <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> also pass through S. Similarly all lines joining
                    corresponding points in the two planes π and √ meet in S; hence the planes are
                    perspective.</p>

                <p>In this case the two planes must of course coincide, whilst in the first case
                    this is not necessary.</p>
                <p>§ 15. We shall now show that two planes which are projective according to
                    definition § 12 can be brought into perspective position, hence that the new
                    definition is really equivalent to the old. We use the following property:—If
                    two coincident planes τr and π' are perspective with S as centre, then any two
                    corresponding rows are also perspective with S as centre. This therefore is true
                    for the rows <hi rend="italic">j</hi> and <hi rend="italic">j'</hi> and for <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i',</hi> of which <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">j'</hi> are the lines at infinity in the two
                    planes. If now the plane ιr' be made to slide on π so that each line moves
                    parallel to itself, then the point at infinity in each line, and hence the whole
                    line at infinity in √, remains fixed. So does the point at infinity on <hi
                    rend="italic">j,</hi> which thus remains coincident with its corresponding point
                    on <hi rend="italic">j',</hi> and therefore the rows <hi rend="italic">j</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">j'</hi> remain perspective, that is to say the rays
                    joining corresponding points in them meet at some point T. Similarly the lines
                    joining corresponding points in <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >i'</hi> will meet in some point T'. These two points T and T' originally
                    coincided with each other and with S.</p>
                <p>Conversely, if two projective planes are placed one on the other, then as soon as
                    the lines/ and rare parallel the two points T and Τ' can be found by joining
                    corresponding points in <hi rend="italic">j</hi> and/, and also in <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i'.</hi> If now a point at infinity
                    is called A as a point in <hi rend="italic">n</hi> and B' ¾s a point in √, then
                    the point A' will lie on <hi rend="italic">i'</hi> and B on <hi rend="italic"
                    >j,</hi> so that the line AA' passes through T' and BB' through T. These two
                    lines are parallel. If then the plane √ be moved parallel to itself till Τ'
                    comes to T, then these two lines will coincide with each other, and with them
                    will coincide the lines AB and A'B'. This line and similarly every line through
                    T will thus now coincide with its corresponding line. The two planes are
                    therefore according to the last theorem in § 14 in perspective position.</p>
                <p>It will be noticed that the plane <hi rend="italic">π'</hi> may be placed on π in
                    two different ways, viz., <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> if we have placed π' on
                    <hi rend="italic">π</hi> we may take it off and turn it over in space before we
                    bring it back to π, so that what was its upper becomes now its lower face. For
                    each of these positions we get one pair of centres T, T', and only one pair,
                    because the above process must give every perspective position. It follows—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">In two projective plains there are in general two and only two
                    pencils in either such that angles in one are equal to their corresponding
                    angles in the other. If one of these pencils is made coincident with its
                    corresponding one, then the planes will be perspective.</hi></p>
                <p>This agrees with the fact that two perspective planes in space can be made
                    coincident by turning one about their axis in two different ways (§ 8).</p>
                <p>In the reasoning employed it is essential that the lines / and <hi rend="italic"
                    >i'</hi> are finite. If one lies at infinity, say <hi rend="italic">j,</hi> then
                    <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and ∕ coincide, hence their corresponding lines <hi
                    rend="italic">i'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">j'</hi> will coincide; that is, <hi
                    rend="italic">i'</hi> also lies at infinity, so that the lines at infinity in
                    the two planes are corresponding lines. If the planes are now made coincident
                    and perspective, then it may happen that the lines at infinity correspond point
                    for point, or can be made to do so by turning the one plane in itself. In this
                    case the line at infinity is the axis, whilst the centre may be a finite point.
                    This gives similar figures (see § 16). In the other case the line at infinity
                    corresponds to itself without being the axis; the lines joining corresponding
                    points therefore all coincide with it, and the centre S lies on it at infinity.
                    The axis will be some finite line. This gives parallel projection (see § 17).
                    For want of space we do not show how to find in these cases the perspective
                    position, but only remark that in the first case any pair of corresponding
                    points in π and √ may be taken as the points T and T', whilst in the other case
                    there is a pencil of parallels in π such that any one line of these can be made
                    to coincide point for point with its corresponding line in √, and thus serve as
                    the axis oι projection. It will therefore be possible to get the planes in
                    perspective position by first placing any point A' on its corresponding point A
                    and then turning π' about this point till lines joining corresponding points are
                    parallel.</p>
                <p>§ 16. <hi rend="smallcaps">Similar Figures.</hi> —If the axis is at infinity
                    every line is parallel to its corresponding line. Corresponding angles are
                    therefore equal. The figures are similar, and (§10) the ratio of similitude of
                    any two corresponding rows is constant.</p>
                <p>If similar figures are in perspective position they are said to be similarly
                    situated, and the centre of projection is called the centre of similitude. To
                    place two similar figures in this position, we observe that their lines at
                    infinity will coincide as soon as both figures are put in the same plane, but
                    the rows on them are not necessarily identical. They are projective, and hence
                    in general not more than two points on one will coincide with their
                    corresponding points in the other (G. § 34). To make them identical it is either
                    sufficient to turn one figure in its plane till three lines in one are parallel
                    to their corresponding lines in the other, or it is necessary before this can be
                    done to turn the one plane over in space. It can be shown that in the former
                    case all lines are, or no line is, parallel to its corresponding line, whilst in
                    the second case there are two directions, at right angles to each other, which
                    have the property that each line in either direction is parallel to its
                    corresponding line. We also see that—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If in two similar figures three lines, of which no two are
                    parallel, are parallel respectively to their corresponding lines, then every
                    line has th is q&gt;roperty and the two figures are similarly situated</hi>; or
                    <hi rend="italic">Two similar figures are similarly situated as soon as two
                    corresponding triangles are so situated.</hi></p>
                <p>If two similar figures are perspective without being in the same plane, their
                    planes must be parallel as the axis is at infinity. Hence <hi rend="italic">Any
                    plane figure is projected from any centre to a parallel plane into a similar
                    figure.</hi></p>
                <p>If two similar figures are similarly situated, then corresponding points may
                    either be on the same or on different sides of the centre. If, besides, the
                    ratio of similitude is unity, then corresponding points will be equidistant from
                    the centre. In the first case therefore the two figures will be identical. In
                    the second case they will be identically equal but not coincident. They can be
                    made to coincide by turning one in its plane through two right angles about the
                    centre of similitude S. The figures are in involution, as is seen at once, and
                    they are said to be <hi rend="italic">symmetrical with regard to the point</hi>
                    S <hi rend="italic">as centre.</hi> If the two figures be considered as part of
                    one, then this is said to have a centre. Thus regular polygons of an even number
                    of sides and parallelograms have each a centre, which is a centre of
                    symmetry.</p>
                <p>§ 17. <hi rend="smallcaps">Parallel Projection.—</hi> If, instead of the axis,
                    the centre be moved to infinity,' all the projecting rays will be parallel, and
                    we get what is called <hi rend="italic">Parallel Projection.</hi> In this case
                    the line at infinity passes through the centre and therefore corresponds to
                    itself, — but not point for point as in the case of similar figures. To any
                    point I at infinity corresponds therefore a point Γ also at infinity but

                    corresponding rows the two points at infinity are corresponding points; hence
                    the rows are similar. This gives the principal properties of parallel projection

                <p>The ratio of similitude for these rows changes with the direction: <hi

                    will be equal to it,</hi> because any two pairs AA' and BB' of corresponding
                    points will form a parallelogram.</p>
                <p>Another important property is the following: —</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The areas of corresponding figures have a constant
                    ratio.</hi></p>
                <p>We prove this first for parallelograms. Let ABCD and EFGH be any two
                    parallelograms in <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> A'B'C'D' and E'F'G'H' the
                    corresponding parallelograms in τr'. Then to the parallelogram KLMN which lies
                    (fig. 6) between the lines AB, CD and EF, GH will correspond a parallelogram
                    K'L'M'N' formed in exactly the same manner. As ABCD and KLMN are between the
                    same parallels their areas are as the bases. Hence</p>
                <p>ABCD AB <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. . <hi rend="subscript"> 1 1</hi> A'B'C'D

                <p>But AB∕KL = A'B'∕K'L', as the rows AB and A'B'are similar. Hence</p>

                <p>ABCD _ EFGHA'B'C'D' E'F'G'H'*</p>
                <p>This proves the theorem for parallelograms and also for their ιalv^s, that is,
                    for any triangles. As polygons can be divided into τiangles the truth of the
                    theorem follows at once for them, and is hen by the well-known method of
                    exhaustion extended to areas &gt;ounded by curves by inscribing polygons in, and
                    circumscribing )olygons about, the curves.</p>
                <p>Just as (G. § 8) a segment of a line is given <hi rend="italic">a</hi> sense, so
                    a sense nay be given to an area. This is done as follows. If we go round he
                    boundary of an area, the latter is either to the right or to the left. <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> we turn round and go in the opposite sense, then the area
                    will be;o the left if it was first to the right, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> If we give he boundary a definite sense, and go round in this sense,
                    then the <hi rend="italic">urea is said to be either of the one or of the other
                    sense according as he area is to the right or to the left.</hi> The area is
                    generally said to &gt;e positive if it is to the left. The sense of the boundary
                    is indi-ated either by an arrowhead or by the order of the letters which lenote
                    points in the boundary. Thus, if A, B, C be the vertices of L triangle, then ABC
                    shall denote the area in magnitude and sense, he sense being fixed by going
                    round the triangle in the order rom A to B to C. It will then be seen that ABC
                    and ACB denote he same area but with opposite sense, and generally ABC = BCA =
                    √AB= -ACB= -BAC= -CBA; that is, an interchange of two etters changes the sense.
                    Also, if A and A' are two points on &gt;pposite sides of, and equidistant from,
                    the line BC, then IBC= -A'BC.</p>
                <p>Taking account of the sense, we may make the following state-nent :—</p>
                <p>If A, A' are two corresponding points, if the line A A' cuts the Lxis in B, and
                    if C is any other point in the axis, then the triangles VBC and A'BC are
                    corresponding, and</p>
                <p>ABC AB _ AB A'BC A'B^ BA' ’</p>
                <p>&gt;r <hi rend="italic">The constant ratio of corresponding areas is equal and
                    opposite o the ratio in which the axis divides the segment joining two

                <p>Orthographic projection is of constant use in geometrical drawing and will be
                    treated of fully later on in this article (§ 28 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Shear.—</hi> If the centre of projection be taken at infinity
                    on the axis, then the projecting rays aie parallel to the axis; hence
                    corresponding points will be equidistant from the axis. In this case therefore
                    <hi rend="italic">areas of corresponding figures will be equal.</hi></p>
                <p>If A, A' and B, B' (fig. 7) are two pairs of corresponding points on the same
                    line, parallel to the axis, then, as corresponding segments parallel to the axis
                    are equal, it follows that AB = A'B', hence also AA' = BB'. If these points be
                    joined to any point 0 on the axis, then AO and ΑΌ will be corresponding lines;
                    they will therefore be cut by any line parallel to the axis in corresponding
                    points. In the figure therefore C, C' and also D, D' will be pairs of
                    corresponding points and CC' = DD'. As the ratio CC'/AA' equals the ratio of the
                    distances of C and A from the axis, therefore—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Two corresponding figures may be got one out of the other by
                    moving all points in the one parallel to a fixed line, the axis, through

                    a line remain hereby in a line.</hi></p>
                <p>Such a transformation of a plane figure is produced by a shearing stress in any
                    section of a homogeneous elastic solid. For this reason Sir William Thomson has
                    given it the name of shear.</p>
                <p>A shear of a plane figure is determined if we are given the axis and the distance
                    through which one point has been moved; for in this case the axis, the centre,
                    and a pair of corresponding points are given.</p>

                    on the axis, and if corresponding points are at equal distances from it, they
                    must be on opposite sides of it. The figures will be in involution (§ 11). In
                    this case the direction of the projecting rays is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >conjugate</hi> to the axis.</p>
                <p>The conjugate direction may be perpendicular to the axis. If the line joining two
                    corresponding points A, A' cuts the axis in B, then AB = BA'. Therefore, if the
                    plane be folded over along the axis, A will fall on A'. Hence by this folding
                    over every point will coincide with its corresponding point. The figures
                    therefore are identically equal or congruent, and in their original position
                    they are <hi rend="italic">symmetrical</hi> with regard to the axis, which

                    are considered as one this one is said to be symmetrical with regard to an axis,
                    and is said to have an axis of symmetry or simply an axis. Every diameter of a
                    circle is thus an axis; also the median line of an isosceles triangle and the
                    diagonals of a rhombus are axes of the figures to which they belong.</p>
                <p>In the more general case where the projecting rays are not perpendicular to the
                    axis we have a kind of twisted symmetry which maybe called <hi rend="italic"
                    >skew-symmetry.</hi> It can be got from symmetry by giving the whole figure a
                    shear. It will also be easily seen that we get skew-symmetry if we first form a
                    shear to a given figure and then separate it from its shear by folding it over
                    along the axis of the shear, which thereby becomes an axis of skew-symmetry.</p>
                <p>Skew-symmetrical and therefore also symmetrical figures have the following
                    properties :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Corresponding areas are equal, but of opposite sense.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Any</hi><hi rend="italic">two corresponding lines are harmonic
                    conjugates with regard to the axis and a line in the conjugate
                    direction.</hi></p>
                <p>If the two figures be again considered as one whole, this is said to be
                    skew-symmetrical and to have an axis of skew-symmetry. Thus the median line of
                    any triangle is an axis of skew-symmetry, the side on which it stands having the
                    conjugate direction, tħe other sides being conjugate lines. From this it
                    follows, for instance, that the three median lines of a triangle meet in a
                    point. For two median lines will be corresponding lines with regard to the third
                    as axis, and must therefore meet on the axis.</p>
                <p>An axis of skew-symmetry is generally called a <hi rend="italic">diameter.</hi>
                    Thus every diameter of a conic is an axis of skew-symmetry, the conjugate
                    direction being the direction of the chords which it bisects.</p>

                <p>It is of interest to notice how a great many propositions of Euclid are only
                    special cases of projection. The theorems Euel. I. 35-41 about parallelograms or
                    triangles on equal bases and between the same parallels are examples of shear,
                    whilst I. 43 gives a case of skew-symmetry, hence of involution. Figures which
                    are identically equal are of course projective, and they are perspective when
                    placed so that they have an axis or a centre of symmetry (comp. Henriei, <hi

                    the relation is that of involution. The importance of treating similar figures
                    when in perspective position has long been recognized; we need only mention the
                    well-known proposition about the centres of similitude of circles.</p>

                    projected into any other conic. This may be done in such a manner that three
                    points on one conic and the tangents at two of them are projected to three
                    arbitrarily selected points and the tangents at two of them on the
                    other.</hi><hi rend="italic">Proof.—</hi> If <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">u'</hi> are any two conics, then we have to prove that we can
                    project <hi rend="italic">u</hi> in such a manner that five points on it will be
                    projected to points on <hi rend="italic">u'.</hi> As the projection is
                    determined as soon as the projections of any four points or four lines are
                    selected, we cannot project any five points of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> to any
                    five arbitrarily selected points on √. But if A, B, C be any three points on <hi
                    rend="italic">u,</hi> and if the tangents at B and C meet at D, if further A',
                    B', C' are any three points on <hi rend="italic">u',</hi> and if the tangents at
                    B 'and C' meet at D', then the plane of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> may be
                    projected to the plane of <hi rend="italic">u'</hi> in such a manner that the
                    points A, B, C, D are projected to to A', B', C', D'. This determines the
                    correspondence (§ 14). The conic <hi rend="italic">u</hi> will be projected into
                    a conic, the points A, B, C and the tangents BD and CD to the points A', B', C'
                    and the lines B'D' and C'D', which are tangents to <hi rend="italic">u'</hi> at
                    B' and C'. The projection of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> must therefore (G. § 52)
                    coincide with <hi rend="italic">u',</hi> because it is a conic which has three
                    points and the tangents at two of them in common with <hi rend="italic"
                    >u'.</hi></p>
                <p>Similarly we might have taken <hi rend="italic">three tangents and the points of
                    contact of two of them as corresponding to similar elements on the
                    other.</hi></p>
                <p>If the one conic be a circle which cuts the line <hi rend="italic">j,</hi> the
                    projection will cut the line at infinity in two points; hence it will be an
                    hyperbola. Similarly, if the circle touches <hi rend="italic">j,</hi> the
                    projection will be a parabola; and, if the circle has no point in common with
                    <hi rend="italic">j,</hi> the projection will be an ellipse. These curves appear
                    thus as sections of a circular cone, for in case that the two planes of
                    projection are separated the rays projecting the circle form such a cone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Any conic may be projected into itself.</hi></p>
                <p>If we take any point S in the plane of a conic as centre, the polar of this point
                    as axis of projection, and any two points in which a line through S cuts the
                    conic as corresponding points, then these will be harmonic conjugates with
                    regard to the centre and the axis. We therefore have involution (§ 11), and
                    every point is projected into its harmonic conjugate with regard to the centre
                    and the axis,— hence every point A on the conic into that point A' on the conic
                    in which the line SA' cuts the conic again, as follows from the harmonic
                    properties of pole and polar (G. § 62 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi><hi

                <p>To prove this, we take the line at infinity and the asymptotes of one as
                    corresponding to the line at infinity and the asymptotes of the other, and
                    besides a tangent to the first as corresponding to a parallel tangent to the

                    that is, the points A, B and the point at infinity on the one may be made to
                    correspond respectively to the points A', B' and the point at infinity on the

                    tangent at B' and at infinity of the other. This completely determines the
                    correspondence, and it is parallel projection because the line at infinity
                    corresponds to the line at infinity. Let the tangents at A and B meet at C, and
                    those at Λ', B' at C'; then C, C <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> will correspond,

                    If AC, BD are any pair of conjugate diameters of the one and A'C', B'D' any pair
                    of conjugate diameters of the other, then these may be made to correspond to
                    each other, and the correspondence will be completely determined if the

                    formed by the tangents at A', B', C', D' (§§ 17 and 21). As the projection of
                    the first conic has the four points A', B', C', D' and the tangents at these
                    points in common with the second, the two ellipses are projected one into the

                <p>It follows at once that <hi rend="italic">All parallelograms inscribed in an

                <p>§ 24. <hi rend="smallcaps">Projective Properties.</hi> —The properties of the
                    projection of a figure depend partly on the relative position of the planes of
                    the figure and the centre of projection, but principally on the properties of
                    the given figure. Points in a line are projected into points in a line, harmonic
                    points into harmonic points, a conic into a conic; but parallel lines are not
                    projected into parallel lines nor right angles into right angles, neither are
                    the projections of equal segments or angles again equal. There are then some
                    properties which remain unaltered by projection, whilst others change. The
                    former are called projective or descriptive, the latter metrical properties of
                    figures, became the latter all depend on measurement.</p>
                <p>To a triangle and its median lines correspond a triangle and three lines which
                    meet in a point, but which as a rule are not median lines.</p>
                <p>In this case, if we take the triangle together with the line at infinity, we get
                    as the projection a triangle ABO, and some other line <hi rend="italic">j</hi>
                    which cuts the sides <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi

                    then the lines AA <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, BB <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    CC <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> will be the projections of the median lines in
                    the given figure. Hence these lines must meet in a point.</p>
                <p>As the triangle and the fourth line we may take any four given lines, because any
                    four lines may be projected into any four given lines (§ 14). This gives a

                    line at infinity to the lines in the given figure.</p>
                <p>In a similar manner a great many theorems relating to metrical properties can be
                    generalized by taking the line at infinity or points at infinity as forming part
                    of the original figure. Conversely special cases relating to measurement are
                    obtained by projecting some line in a figure of known properties to infinity.
                    This is true for all properties relating to parallel lines or to bisection of
                    segments, but not immediately for angles. It is, however, possible to establish
                    for every metrical relation the corresponding projective property. To do this it
                    is necessary to consider imaginary elements. These have originally been
                    introduced into geometry by aid of coordinate geometry, where imaginary
                    quantities constantly occur as roots of equations.</p>
                <p>Their introduction into pure geometry is due principally to Poncelet, who by the
                    publication of his great work <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Figures</hi> became the founder of projective geometry in its widest sense.
                    Monge had considered parallel projection and had already distinguished between
                    permanent and accidental properties of figures, the latter being those which
                    depended merely on the accidental position of one part to another. Thus in
                    projecting two circles which lie in different planes it depends on the
                    accidental position of the centre of projection whether the projections be two
                    conics which do or do not meet. Poncelet introduced the principle of continuity
                    in order to make theorems general and independent of those accidental positions
                    which depend analytically on the fact that the equations used have real or
                    imaginary roots. But the correctness of this principle remained without a proof.
                    Von Staudt has, however, shown how it is possible to introduce imaginary
                    elements by purely geometrical reasoning, and we shall now try to give the
                    reader some idea of his theory.</p>
                <p>§ 25. <hi rend="smallcaps">Imaginary Elements.</hi> —If a line cuts a curve and
                    if the line be moved, turned for instance about a point in it, it may happen
                    that two of the points of intersection approach each other till they coincide.
                    The line then becomes a tangent. If the line is still further moved in the same
                    manner it separates from the curve and two points of intersection are lost. Thus
                    in considering the relation of a line to a conic we have to distinguish three
                    cases—the line cuts the conic in two points, touches it, or has no point in
                    common with it. This is quite analogous to the fact that a quadratic equation
                    with one unknown quantity has either two, one, or no roots. But in algebra it
                    has long been found convenient to express this differently by saying a quadratic
                    equation has always two roots, but these may be either both real and different,
                    or equal, or they may be imaginary. In geometry a similar mode of expressing the
                    fact above stated is not less convenient.</p>
                <p>We say therefore a line has always two points in common with a conic, but these
                    are either distinct, or coincident, or invisible. The word imaginary is
                    generally used instead of invisible; but, as the points have nothing to do with
                    imagination, we prefer the word “invisible” recommended originally by
                    Clifford.</p>
                <p>Invisible points occur in pairs of conjugate points, for a line loses always two
                    visible points of intersection with a curve simultaneously. This is analogous to
                    the fact that an algebraical equation with real coefficients has imaginary roots
                    in pairs. <hi rend="italic">Only one real line can be drawn through an invisible
                    point,</hi> for two real lines meet in a real or visible point. <hi
                    rend="italic">The real line through an invisible point contains also its
                    conjugate.</hi></p>
                <p>Similarly there are invisible lines—tangents, for instance, from a point within a
                    conic—which occur in pairs of conjugates, two conjugates having a real point in
                    common.</p>
                <p>The introduction of invisible points would be nothing but a play upon words
                    unless there is a real geometrical property indicated which can be used in
                    geometrical constructions—that it has a definite meaning, for instance, to say
                    that two conics cut a line in the same two invisible points, or that we can draw
                    one conic through three real points and the two invisible ones which another
                    conic has in common with a line that does not actually cut it. We have in fact
                    to give a geometrical definition of invisible points. This is done by aid of the
                    theory of involution (G. § 76 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">).</hi></p>
                <p>An involution of points on a line has (according to G. § 77 (2)) either two or
                    one or no foci. Instead of this we now say it has always two foci which may be
                    distinct, coincident, or invisible. These foci are determined by the involution,
                    but they also determine the involution. If the foci are real this follows from
                    the fact that conjugate points are harmonic conjugates with regard to the foci.
                    That it is also the case for invisible foci will presently appear. If we take
                    this at present for granted we may replace a pair of real, coincident, or
                    invisible points by the involution of which they are the foci.</p>
                <p>^Now any two pairs of conjugate points determine an involution <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hence any point-pair, whether real or invisible, is completely determined by
                    any two pairs of conjugate points of the involution which has the given
                    point-pair as foci and may therefore be replaced by them.</hi></p>
                <p>Two pairs of invisible points are thus said to be identical if, and only if, they
                    are the foci of the same involution.</p>
                <p>We know (G. § 82) that a conic detιrmines on every line an involution in which
                    conjugate points are conjugate poles with regard to the conic—that is, that
                    either lies on the polar of the other. This holds whether the line cuts the
                    conic or not. Furthermore, in the former case the points common to the line and
                    the conic are the foci of the involution. Hence we now say that this is always
                    the case, and that the <hi rend="italic">invisible</hi> points common to a line
                    and a conic are the <hi rend="italic">invisible</hi> f&lt;⅛ei of the involution
                    in question. If then we state the problem of drawing a conic which passes
                    through two points given as the intersection of a conic and a line as that of
                    drawing a conic which determines a given involution on the line, we have it in a
                    form in which it is independent of the accidental circumstance of the
                    intersections being real or invisible. So is the solution of the problem, as we
                    shall now show.</p>
                <p>§ 26. We have seen (§ 21) that a conic may always be projected into itself by
                    taking any point S as centre and its polar <hi rend="italic">s</hi> as axis of
                    projection, corresponding points being those in which a line through S cuts the
                    conic. If then (fig. 9) A, A' and B, B' are pairs of corresponding points so
                    that the lines AA' and BB' pass through S, then the lines AB and A'B', as
                    corresponding lines, will meet at a point Ron the axis, and the lines AB' and
                    A'B will meet at another point R' on the axis. These points R, R' are conjugate
                    points in the involution which the conic determines on the line <hi
                    rend="italic">s,</hi> because the triangle RSR' is a polar triangle (G. § 62),
                    so that R' lies on the polar of R.</p>
                <p>This gives a simple means of determining for any point Q on the line <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> its conjugate point Q'. We take any two points A, A' on the
                    conic which lie on a line through S, join Q to A by a line cutting the conic
                    again in C, and join C to A'. This line will cut <hi rend="italic">s</hi> in the
                    point Q' required.</p>

                    draw some conic which shall determine on a line s a given involution.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Solution.—</hi> We have here to reconstruct the fig. 9, having
                    given on the line s an involution. Let Q, Q' and R, R' (fig. 9) be two pairs of
                    conjugate points in this involution. We take any point B and join it to R and
                    R', and another point C to Q and Q'. Let BR and CQ meet at A, and BR' and CQ' at
                    A'. If now a point P be moved along <hi rend="italic">s</hi> its conjugate point
                    P' will also move and the two points will describe projective rows. The two rays
                    AP and A'P' will therefore describe projective pencils, and the intersection of
                    corresponding rays will lie on a conic which passes through A, A', B, and C.
                    This conic determines on <hi rend="italic">s</hi> the given involution.</p>
                <p>Of these four points not only B and C but also the point A may be taken
                    arbitrarily, for if A, B, C are given, the line AB will cut s in some point R.
                    As the involution is supposed known, we can find the point R' conjugate to R,
                    which we join to B. In the same way the line CA will cut s in some point Q. Its
                    conjugate point Q' we join to C. The line CQ' will cut BR' in a point A', and
                    then AA' will pass through the pole S (comp. fig. 9). We may now interchange A
                    and B and find the point B'. Then BB' will also pass through S, which is thus
                    found. At the same time five points A, B, C, A', B' on the conic have been
                    found, so that the conic is completely known which determines on the line s the
                    given involution. Hence—</p>

                    always draw one conic, and only one, which determines on a given line a given

                    invisible foci.</hi></p>

                <p>§ 27. The above theory of invisible points gives rise to a great number of
                    interesting consequences of which we state a iew.</p>
                <p>The theorem at the end of § 21 may now be stated :—</p>

                <p>It follows that <hi rend="italic">Any two</hi><hi rend="italic">parabolas are
                    similar; and they are similarly situated as soon as their axes are
                    parallel.</hi></p>
                <p>The involution which a circle determines at its centre is circular (G. § 79);
                    that is, every line is perpendicular to its conjugate line. This will be cut by
                    the line at infinity in an involution which has the following property:—The
                    lines which join any finite point to two conjugate points in the involution are
                    at right angles to each other. Hence all circular involutions in a plane
                    determine the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n823/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0823-0800"/> same involution on the line at infinity. The
                    latter is therefore called <hi rend="italic">the circular involution on the line
                    at infinity,</hi> and the involution which a circle determines at its centre is
                    called <hi rend="italic">the circular involution at that point.</hi> All circles
                    determine thus on the line at infinity the same involution; in other w∩rds, they
                    have the same two invisible points in common with the line at infinity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">All circles may be
                    considered as passing through the same two points at infinity.</hi></p>
                <p>These points a&gt;∙e called the <hi rend="italic">circular points</hi> at
                    infinity, and by Prof. Cayley the <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> in the plane.
                    They* are the foci of the circular involution in the line at infinity.</p>
                <p>Conversely— <hi rend="italic">Every conic which passes through the circular
                    points is a circle</hi>; because the involution at its centre is circular, hence
                    conjugate diameters are at right angles, and this property only circles
                    possess.</p>
                <p>We now see why we can draw always one and only one circle through any three
                    points: these three points together with the circular points at infinity are
                    five points through which one conic only can be drawn.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Any two circles are similar and similarly situated</hi> because
                    they have the same points at infinity (§ 21).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Any two concentric circles may be considered as having double
                    contact at infinity,</hi> because the lines joining the common centre to the
                    circular points at infinity are tangents to both circles at the circular points,
                    as the line at infinity is the polar of the centre.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Any two lines at right angles to one another are harmonic
                    conjugates with regard to the rays joining their intersection to the circular
                    points,</hi> because these rays are the focal rays of the circular involution at
                    the intersection of the given lines.</p>
                <p>To bisect an angle with the vertex A means (G. § 23) to find two rays through A
                    which are harmonic conjugates with regard to the limits of the angle and
                    perpendicular to each other. These rays are therefore harmonic with regard to
                    the limits of the given angle and with regard to the rays through the circular
                    points. Thus perpendicularity and bisection of an angle have been stated in a
                    projective form.</p>
                <p>It must not be forgotten that the circular points do not exist at all; but to
                    introduce them gives us a short way of making a statement which would otherwise
                    be long and cumbrous.</p>
                <p>We can now generalize any theorem relating to metrical properties. For instance,
                    the simple fact that the chord of a circle is touched by a concentric circle at
                    its <hi rend="italic">mid point</hi> proves the theorem:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If two conics have double contact, then the points where any

                    contact and the point where the tangent cuts the chord of contact.</hi></p>
                <p>DESCRIPTIVE GEOMETRY.</p>
                <p>For many, especially technical, purposes it is of the utmost importance to
                    represent solids and other figures in three dimensions by a drawing in one
                    plane.</p>
                <p>A variety of methods have been introduced for this purpose. The most important is
                    that which towards the end of the last century was invented by Monge under the
                    name of “descriptive geometry.” We give the elements of his method. It is based
                    on parallel projections to a plane by rays perpendicular to the plane. Such a
                    projection is called orthographic (§ 18). If the plane is horizontal the
                    projection is called the plan of the figure, and if the plane is vertical the
                    elevation. In Monge’s method a figure is represented by its plan and elevation.
                    It is therefore often called drawing in plan and elevation, and sometimes simply
                    orthographic projection.</p>
                <p>§ 28. We suppose then that we have two planes, one horizontal, the other
                    vertical, and these we call the planes of plan and of elevation respectively, or
                    the horizontal and the vertical plane, and denote them by the letters π <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and π <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Their line of
                    intersection is called the axis, and shall be denoted by the letter <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi></p>
                <p>If the surface of the drawing naper is taken as the plane of the plan, then the
                    vertical plane will be the plane perpendicular to it through the axis <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi> To bring this also into the plane of the drawing paper we
                    turn it about the axis till it coincides with the horizontal plane. This process
                    of turning one plane down till it coincides with another is called <hi
                    rend="italic">rabatting</hi> one to the other. Of course there is no necessity
                    to have one of the two planes horizontal, but even when this is not the case it
                    is convenient to retain the above names.</p>
                <p>The whole arrangement will be better understood by a glance at fig. 10. A point A

                <p>§ 29. The two planes w <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, π <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> in their original position divide space into four parts. These are called
                    the four quadrants. We suppose that the plane τr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is
                    turned as indicated in fig. 10, so that the point P comes to Q and R to S, then
                    the quadrant in which the point A lies is called the first, and we say that in
                    the first quadrant a point lies above the horizontal and in front of the
                    vertical plane. Now we go round the axis in the sense in which the plane ιr <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is turned and come in succession to the second, third,
                    and fourth quadrant. In the second a point lies above the plane of the plan and
                    behind the plane of elevation, and so on. In fig. 12, which represents a side
                    view of the planes in fig. 10 the quadrants are marked, and in each a point with
                    its projection is taken. Fig. 11 shows how these are represented when the plane
                    π <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is turned down. We see that <hi rend="italic">A
                    point lies in the first quadrant if the plan lies below, the elevation above the
                    axis; in the second if plan and elevation both lie above; in the third if the

                <p>Of each of these propositions, which will easily be seen to be time, the converse
                    holds also.</p>
                <p>§ 30. <hi rend="smallcaps">Representation of a Plane.</hi> —As we are thus
                    enabled to represent points in a plane, we can represent any finite figure by
                    representing its separate points. It is, however, not possible to represent a
                    plane in this way, for the projections of its points completely cover the planes
                    π <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and π <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and no plane
                    would appear different from any other. But any plane α cuts each of the planes
                    π,, π <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> in a line. These are called the traces of the
                    plane. They cut each other in the axis at the point where the latter cuts the
                    plane α.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A plane is determined by its two traces, which are two lines
                    that meet on the axis,</hi> and, conversely, <hi rend="italic">any two lines
                    which meet on the axis determine a plane.</hi></p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">If the plane is parallel to the axis its traces are parallel to
                    the axis.</hi> Of these one may be at infinity; then the plane will cut one of
                    the planes of projection at infinity and will be parallel to it. Thus a plane
                    parallel to the horizontal plane of the plan has only one finite trace, viz.,
                    that with the plane of elevation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If the plane passes through the axis both its traces coincide
                    with the axis.</hi> This is the only case in which the representation of the
                    plane by its two traces fails. A third plane of projection is therefore
                    introduced, which is best taken perpendicular to the other two. We call it
                    simply the third nlane, and denote it by τr <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. As it
                    is perpendicular to π <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, it may υe taken as the plane
                    of elevation, its line of intersection <hi rend="italic">y</hi> with ιr <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> being the axis, and be turned down to coincide with π
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. This is represented in fig. 13, OC is the axis <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> whilst OA and OB are the traces of the third plane. They
                    lie in one line <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> The plane is rabatted about <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> to the horizontal plane. A plane <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    through the axis <hi rend="italic">x</hi> will then show in it a trace α <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. In fig. 13 the lines OC and OP will thus be the traces
                    of a plane through the axis <hi rend="italic">x</hi> which makes an angle POQ
                    with the horizontal plane.</p>
                <p>We can also find the trace which any other plane makes with <hi rend="italic"

                <p>§ 31. <hi rend="smallcaps">Representation of a Line.—</hi> A line is determined
                    either by two points in it or by two planes through it. We get accordingly two

                <p>First.— <hi rend="italic">A line a is represented by its projections a</hi><hi

                    perpendicular to π <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and τr <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> respectively will intersect in some line <hi rend="italic">a</hi> which
                    has <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >, a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> as its projections.</p>
                <p>Secondly. — <hi rend="italic">A line a is represented by its traces—that is, by
                    the points in which it cuts the two planes</hi> π <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,
                    π <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Any two points may be taken as the traces of a
                    line in space, for it is determined when the planes are in their original
                    position as the line joining the two traces. This representation becomes
                    undetermined if the two traces coincide in the axis. In this case we again use a
                    third plane, or else the projections of the line.</p>
                <p>§ 32. The fact that there are different methods of representing points and
                    planes, and hence two methods of representing lines, suggests the principle of
                    duality (G. § 41). It is worth while to keep this in mind. It is also worth
                    remembering that traces of planes or lines always lie in the planes or lines
                    which they represent. Projections do not as a rule do this excepting when the
                    point or line projected lies in one of the planes of projection.</p>
                <p>§ 33. Having now shown how to represent points, planes, and lines, we have to
                    state the conditions which must hold in order that these elements may lie one in
                    the other, or else that the figure formed by them may possess certain metrical
                    properties. It will be found that the former are very much simpler than the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>Before we do this, however, we shall explain the notation used; for it is of
                    great importance to have a systematic notation. We shall denote points in space
                    by capitals A, B, C; planes in space by Greek letters <hi rend="italic">a,
                    β,</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> lines in space by small

                    projections by suffixes 2, like A <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, <hi

                    traces by single and double dashes <hi rend="italic">a a, a' a".</hi> Hence P
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> will be the horizontal projection of a point P in
                    space; a line <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will have the projections α <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic

                    rend="italic">a.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 34. <hi rend="italic">If a point lies in a line, the projections of the point
                    lie in the projections of the line.</hi><hi rend="italic">If a line lies in a
                    plane, the traces of the line lie in the traces of the plane.</hi></p>
                <p>These propositions follow at once from the definitions of the projections and of
                    the traces.</p>
                <p>If a point lies in two lines its projections must lie in the projections of both.
                    Hence <hi rend="italic">If two lines, given by their projections, intersect, the
                    intersection of their plaits and the intersection of their elevations must lie
                    in a line perpendicular to the axis,</hi> because they must be the projections
                    of the point common to the two lines.</p>
                <p>Similarly— <hi rend="italic">If two lines given by their traces lie in the same
                    plane or intersect, then the lines joining their horizontal and vertical traces

                    points in the line whose projections are known or at all events easily found.
                    They are the traces themselves and the feet of the perpendiculars from them to
                    the axis.</p>

                <p>§ 39. We have in the last example got more points, or can easily get more points,
                    than are necessary for the determination of the figure required—in this case the
                    traces of the plane. This will happen in a great many constructions and is of
                    considerable importance. It may happen that some of the points or lines obtained
                    are not convenient in the actual construction. The horizontal traces of the
                    lines AB and AC may, for instance, fall very near together, in which case the
                    line joining them is not well defined. Or, one or both of them may fall beyond
                    the drawing paper, so that they are practically non-existent for the
                    construction. In this case the traces of the line BC may be used. Or, if the
                    vertical traces of AB and AC are both in convenient position, so that the
                    vertical trace of the required plane is found and one of the horizontal traces
                    is got, then we may join the latter to the point where the vertical trace cuts
                    the axis.</p>
                <p>Furthermore the draughtsman will never forget that the lines which he draws are
                    not mathematical lines without thickness. For this reason alone every drawing is
                    affected by some errors. And inaccuracies also come in in drawing the lines
                    required in the construction. It is therefore very desirable to be able
                    constantly to check the latter. Such checks always present themselves when the
                    same result can be obtained by different constructions, or <pb break="no"

                    on the axis, or if three points must lie in a line. A careful draughtsman will
                    always avail himself of these checks.</p>

                    its horizontal projection c <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> parallel to α'.</p>
                <p>§ 41. We now come to the metrical properties of figures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A line is perpendicular to a plane if the projections of the
                    line are perpendicular to the traces of the plane.</hi> We prove it for the
                    horizontal projection. If a line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is perpendicular· to a
                    plane α, every plane through <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is perpendicular to α;
                    hence also the vertical plane which projects the line <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    to <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi> As this plane is perpendicular both to the horizontal plane and to the
                    plane <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> it is also perpendicular to their intersection
                    —that is, to the horizontal trace of <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> It follows that
                    every line in this projecting plane, therefore also <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> the plan of <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> is perpendicular to the horizontal trace of a. Q.E.D.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To draw a plane through a given point</hi> A <hi rend="italic"
                    >perpendicular to a given line p,</hi> we first draw through some point 0 in the
                    axis lines <hi rend="italic">y', y"</hi> perpendicular respectively to the
                    projections <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> of the given line. These

                    the given line. We next draw through the given point A a plane parallel to the
                    plane <hi rend="italic">y</hi>; this will be the plane required.</p>
                <p>Other metrical properties depend on the determination of the real size or shape
                    of a figure.</p>
                <p>In general the projection of a figure differs both in size and shape from the
                    figure itself. But figures in a plane parallel to a plane of projection will be
                    identical with their projections, and will thus be given in their true
                    dimensions. In other cases there is the problem, constantly recurring, either to
                    find the true shape and size of a plane figure when plan and elevation are
                    given, or, conversely, to find the latter from the known true shape of tire
                    figure itself. To do this, the plane is turned about one of its traces till it
                    is laid down into that plane of projection to which the trace belongs. This is
                    technically called rabatting the plane respectively into the plane of the plan
                    or the elevation. As there is no difference in the treatment of the two cases,
                    we shall consider only the case of rabatting a plane α into the plane of the
                    plan. The plan of the figure is a parallel (orthographic) projection of the
                    figure itself. The results of parallel projection (§§ 17 and 18) may therefore
                    now be used. The trace <hi rend="italic">a!</hi> will hereby take the place of
                    what formerly was called the axis of projection. Hence we see that corresponding
                    points in the plan and in the rabatted plane are joined by lines which are
                    perpendicular to the trace α' and that corresponding lines meet on this trace.
                    We also see that the correspondence is completely determined if we know for one
                    point or one line in the plan the corresponding point or line in the rabatted
                    plane.</p>
                <p>Before, however, we treat of this we consider some special cases.</p>

                    comes to a point S on the line P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Q perpendicular to

                    The lines α'S and c'S will therefore include angles equal to those made by the
                    given lines. It is to be remembered that two lines include two angles which are
                    supplementary. Which of these is to be taken in any special case depends upon
                    the circumstances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To determine the angle between a line and a plane,</hi> we draw

                    the angle between it and the given line. The complement of this angle is the
                    required one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To determine the angle between two planes,</hi> we draw through
                    any point two lines perpendicular to the two planes and determine the angle

                <p>In special cases it is simpler to determine at once the angle between the two
                    planes by taking a plane section perpendicular to the intersection of the two
                    planes and rabatt this. This is especially the case if one of the planes is the
                    horizontal or vertical plane of projection.</p>
                <p>Thus in fig. 18 the angle P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> QR is the angle which
                    the plane <hi rend="italic">a</hi> makes with the horizontal plane.</p>
                <p>§ 44. We return to the general case of rabatting a plane α of which the traces
                    <hi rend="italic">a a"</hi> are given.</p>
                <p>Here it will be convenient to determine first the position which the trace
                    α"—which is a line in <hi rend="italic">a—</hi> assumes when rabatted. Points in
                    this line coincide with their elevations. Hence it is given in its true
                    dimension, and we can measure off along it the true distance between two
                    pointsinit. If therefore (fig. 18) P is any point in <hi rend="italic">a"</hi>
                    originally coincident with its elevation P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and if
                    0 is the point where <hi rend="italic">a"</hi> cuts the axis <hi rend="italic"

                    foot of the perpendicular from P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to the axis <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi> We draw therefore, to find P, from P <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>Then the line OP will be the position of <hi rend="italic">a"</hi> when rabatted.
                    This line corresponds therefore to the plan of <hi rend="italic">a"—</hi> that
                    is, to the axis <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> corresponding points on these lines
                    being those which lie on a perpendicular to α'.</p>
                <p>We have thus one pair of corresponding lines and can now find for any point B <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> in the plan the corresponding point B in the rabatted
                    plane. We draw a line through B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, say B <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, cutting <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> in C. To it corresponds the line CP, and the point where
                    this is cut by the projecting ray through B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,
                    perpendicular to α', is the required point B.</p>
                <p>Similarly any figure in the rabatted plane can be found when the plan is known;
                    but this is usually found in a different manner without any reference to the
                    general theory of parallel projection. As this method and the reasoning employed
                    for it have their peculiar advantages, we give it also.</p>
                <p>Supposing the planes π <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and ιr <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> to be in their positions in space ρeιpendicular to each other, we take a
                    section of the whole figure by a plane perpendicular to the trace <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> about which we are going to rabatt the plane <hi
                    rend="italic">a.</hi> Let this section pass through the point Q in α'. Its
                    traces will then be the lines QP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (fig. 18). These will be
                    at right angles, and will therefore, together with the section QP <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> of the plane α, form a right-angled triangle QP <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> with the right angle at
                    Pj, and having the sides P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Q and P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> which both are given, in
                    their true lengths. This triangle we rabatt about its base P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Q, making P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> R=P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ∙ The line QR will then
                    give the true length of the line QP in space. If now the plane α be turned about
                    α' the point P will describe a circle about Q as centre with radius QP—QR, in a
                    plane perpendicular to the trace <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Hence when the plane
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> has been rabatted into the horizontal plane the point P
                    will lie in the perpendicular P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Q to α', so that QP
                    = QR.</p>
                <p>If A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is the plan of a point A in the plane <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> and if A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> lies in QP <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, then the point A will lie vertically above A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> in the line QP. On turning down the triangle QP <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, the point A will come
                    to A <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>, the line A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> being perpendicular to QP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>.
                    Hence A will be a point in QP such that QA=QA <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> ∙</p>
                <p>If B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is the plan of another point, but such that A
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is parallel to <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> then the corresponding line AB will also be parallel to
                    <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Hence, if through A a line AB be drawn parallel to α',
                    and B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    then their intersection gives the point B. Thus of any point given in plan the
                    real position in the plane <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> when rabatted, can be found
                    by this second method. This is the one most generally given in books on
                    geometrical drawing. The first method explained is, however, in most cases
                    preferable as it gives the draughtsman a greater variety of constructions. It
                    requires a somewhat greater amount of theoretical knowledge.</p>
                <p>If instead of our knowing the plan of a figure the latter is itself given; then
                    the process of finding the plan is the reverse of the above and needs little
                    explanation. We give an example.</p>
                <p>§ 45. <hi rend="smallcaps">Problem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">It is required to draw
                    the plan and elevation of a polygon of which the real shape and position in a
                    given plane a are known.</hi><hi rend="italic">Solution.—</hi> We first rabatt
                    the plane α (fig. 19) as before so that P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> comes to
                    P, hence</p>
                <p>OP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to OP. Let the given polygon in <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> be the figure ABODE. We project, not the vertices, but the sides. To
                    project the line AB, we produce it to cut α' in F and OP in G, and draw GG <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">a</hi>; then G <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> corresponds to G, therefore FG <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> to FG. In the same manner we might project all the other sides, at least
                    those which cut OF and OP in convenient points. It will be best, however, first
                    to produce all the sides to cut OP and α' and then to draw all the projecting
                    rays through A, B,C . . . perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">a',</hi> and in the
                    same direction the lines G,G <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, &amp;c. By drawing FG
                    wβ get the points A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    on the projecting ray through A and B. We then join B to the point Μ where ÉC
                    produced meets the trace α'. This gives C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. So we go
                    on till we have found E <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. The line A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> E <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> must then meet AE in α',
                    and this gives a check. If one of the sides cuts <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> or OP
                    beyond the drawing paper this method fails, but then we may easily find the
                    projection of some other line, say of a diagonal, or directly the projection of
                    a point, by the former methods. The diagonals may also serve to check the
                    drawing, for two corresponding diagonals must meet in the trace α'.</p>
                <p>Having got the plan we easily find the elevation. The elevation of G is above G
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> in a", and that of F is at F <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> in the axis. This gives the elevation F <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> G
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> of FG and in it we get A <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> in the verticals through A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. As a check we have
                    OG=OG <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, Similarly the elevation of the other sides
                    and vertices are found.</p>

                    some applications to the representation of solids and of the solution of
                    problems connected with them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Problem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Of a pyramid are given its
                    base, the length of the perpendicular from the vertex to the base, and the point
                    where this perpendicular cuts the base; it is required first to develop the
                    whole surface of the pyramid into one plane, and second to determine its section
                    by a plane which cuts the plane of the base in a given line and makes a given
                    angle with it.</hi><hi rend="italic">Solution.—</hi> (1) As the planes of
                    projection are not given we can take them as we like, and we select them in such
                    a manner that the solution becomes as simple as possible. We take the plane of
                    the base as the horizontal plane and the vertical plane perpendicular to the
                    plane of the section. Let then (fig. 20) ABCD be the base of the pyramid, V <hi

                    and elevation are known.</p>
                <p>We develop the surface into the plane of the base by turning each lateral face
                    about its lower edge into the horizontal plane by the method used in § 43. If
                    one face has been turned down, say ABV to ABP, then the point Q to which the
                    vertex of the next face BCV comes can be got more simply by finding on the line
                    V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Q perpendicular to BC the point Q such that BQ =
                    BP, for these lines represent the same edge BY of the pyramid. Next R is found
                    by making CR=CQ, and so on till we have got the last vertex—in this case S. The
                    fact that AS must equal AP gives a convenient check.</p>
                <p>(2) The plane α whose section we have to determine has its horizontal trace given
                    perpendicular to the axis, and its vertical trace makes the given angle with the
                    axis. This determines it. To find the section of the pyramid by this plane there
                    are two methods applicable: we find the sections of the plane either with the
                    faces or with the edges of the pyramid. We use the latter.</p>
                <p>As the plane <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is perpendicular to the vertical plane, the
                    trace <hi rend="italic">a"</hi> contains the projection of every figure in it;
                    the points E <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, F <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, G <hi

                    the elevations of the edges will therefore be the elevations of the points where
                    the edges cut <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> From these we find the plans E <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, F <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> lines be drawn
                    perpendicular to AB, these will determine the points E, F on the developed face
                    in which the plane α cuts it; hence also the line EF. Similarly on the other
                    faces. Of course BF must be the same length on BP and on BQ. If the plane α be
                    rabatted to the plan, we get the real shape of the section as shown in the
                    figure in EFGH. This is done easily by making F <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>
                    F-OF <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, Ac. If the figure representing the

                    lateral faces be bent along the lines AB, BC, &amp;c., we get a model of the
                    pyramid with the section marked on its faces. This may be placed on its plan A
                    BCD and the plane of elevation bent about the axis <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> The
                    pyramid stands then in front of its elevations. If next the plane <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> with a hole cut out representing the true section be bent
                    along the trace α' till its edge coincides with a", the edges of the hole ought
                    to coincide with the lines EF, FG, &amp;c., on the faces.</p>
                <p>§ 47. Polyhedra like the pyramid in § 46 are represented by the projections of
                    their edges and vertices. But solids bounded by curved surfaces, or surfaces
                    themselves, cannot be thus represented.</p>
                <p>For a surface we may use, as in case of the plane, its traces—that is, the curves
                    in which it cuts the planes of projection. We may also project points and curves
                    on the surface. A ray cuts the surface generally in more than one point; hence
                    it will happen that some of the rays touch the surface, if two of these points
                    coincide. The points of contact of these rays will form some curve on the
                    surface and this will appear from the centre of projection as the boundary of
                    the surface or of part of the surface. The outlines of all surfaces of solids
                    which we see about us are formed by the points at which rays through our eye
                    touch the surface. The projections of these contours are therefore best adapted
                    to give an idea of the shape of a surface.</p>
                <p>Thus the tangents drawn from any finite centre to a sphere form a right circular
                    cone, and this will be cut by any plane in a conic. It is often called the
                    projection of a sphere, but it is better called the contour-line of the sphere,
                    as it is the boundary of the projections of all points on the sphere.</p>
                <p>If the centre is at infinity the tangent cone becomes a right circular cylinder
                    touching the sphere along a great circle, and if the projection is, as in our
                    case, orthographic, then the section of this cone by a plane of projection will
                    be a circle equal to the great circle of the sphere. We get such a circle in the
                    plan and another in the elevation, their centres being plan and elevation of the
                    centre of the sphere.</p>
                <p>Similarly the rays touching a cone of the second order will lie in two planes
                    which pass through the vertex of the cone, the contour-line of the projection of
                    the cone consists therefore of two lines meeting in the projection of the
                    vertex. These may, however, be invisible if no real tangent rays can be drawn
                    from the centre of projection; and this happens when the ray projecting the
                    centre of the vertex lies within the cone. In this case the traces of the cone
                    are of importance. Thus in representing a cone of revolution with a vertical
                    axis we get in the plan a circular trace of the surface whose centre is the plan
                    of the vertex of the cone, and in the elevation the contour, consisting of a
                    pair of lines intersecting in the elevation of the vertex of the cone. The
                    circle in the plan and the pair of lines in the elevation do not determine the
                    surface, for an infinite number of surfaces might be conceived which pass
                    through the circular trace and touch two planes through the contour lines in the
                    vertical plane. The surface becomes only completely defined if we write down to
                    the figure that it shall represent a cone. The same holds for all surfaces. Even
                    a plane is fully represented by its traces only under the silent understanding
                    that the traces are those of a plane.</p>
                <p>§ 48. Some of the simpler problems connected with the representation of surfaces
                    are the determination of plane sections and of the curves of intersection of two
                    such surfaces. The former is constantly used in nearly all problems concerning
                    surfaces. Its solution depends of course on the nature of the surface.</p>
                <p>To determine the curve of intersection of two surfaces, we take a plane and
                    determine its section with each of the two surfaces, rabatting this plane if
                    necessary. This gives two curves which lie in the same plane and whose
                    intersections will give us points on both surfaces. It must here be remembered
                    that two curves in space do not necessarily intersect, hence that the points in
                    which their projections intersect are not necessarily the projections of points
                    common to the two curves. This will, however, be the case if the two curves lie
                    in a common plane. By taking then a number of plane sections of the surfaces we
                    can get as many points on their curve of intersection as we like. These planes
                    have, of course, to be selected in such a way that the sections are curves as
                    simple as the case permits of, and such that they can be easily and accurately
                    drawn. Thus when possible the sections should be straight lines or circles. This
                    not only saves time in drawing but determines all points on the sections, and
                    therefore also the points where the two curves meet, with equal accuracy.</p>
                <p>§ 49. We give afew examples how these sections have to be selected.</p>
                <p>A cone is cut by every plane through the vertex in lines, and if it is a cone of
                    revolution by planes perpendicular to the axis in circles.</p>
                <p>A cylinder is cut by every plane parallel to the axis in lines, and if it is a
                    cylinder of revolution by planes perpendicular to the axis in circles.</p>
                <p>A sphere is cut by every plane in a circle.</p>
                <p>Hence in case of two cones situated anywhere in space we take sections through
                    both vertices. These will cut both cones in lines. Similarly in case of two
                    cylinders we may take sections parallel to the axis of both. In case of a sphere
                    and a cone of revolution with vertical axis, horizontal sections will cut both
                    surfaces in circles whose plans are circles and whose elevations are lines,
                    whilst vertical sections through the vertex of the cone cut the latter in lines
                    and the sphere in circles. To avoid drawing the projections of these circles,
                    which would in general be ellipses, we rabatt the plane and then draw the
                    circles in their real shape. And so on in other cases.</p>
                <p>Special attention should in all cases be paid to those points in which the
                    tangents to the projection of the curve of intersection are parallel or
                    perpendicular to the axis <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> or where these projections
                    touch the contour of one of the surfaces.</p>
