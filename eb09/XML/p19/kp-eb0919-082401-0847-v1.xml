                    earth-goddess Demeter. In Greek mythology Demeter and Proserpine were closely
                    associated, being known together as the two goddesses, the venerable or august
                    goddesses, sometimes as the great goddesses. Proserpine herself was commonly
                    known as the daughter (Core), sometimes as the first-born. As she was gathering
                    flowers with her playmates in a meadow, the earth opened and Pluto, god of the
                    dead, appeared and carried her off to be his queen in the world below. This
                    legend was localized hi various places, as at Eleusis, Lerna, and “that fair
                    field of Enna” in Sicily. Torch in hand, her sorrowing mother sought her through
                    the wide world, and finding her not she forbade the earth to put forth its
                    increase. So all that year not a blade of corn grew on the earth, and men would
                    have died of hunger if Zeus had not persuaded Pluto to let Proserpine go. But
                    before he let her go Pluto made her eat the seed of a pomegranate, and thus she
                    could not stay away from him for ever.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            the food of the dead appears elsewhere, as in New Zealand (R. Taylor,
                                <hi rend="italic">New Zealand,</hi> pp. 233, 271).</p></note> So it
                    was arranged that she should spend two-thirds (according to later authors,
                    one-half) of every year with her mother and the heavenly gods, and should pass
                    the rest of the year with Pluto beneath the earth. There can be little doubt
                    that this is a mythological expression for the growth of vegetation in spring
                    and its disappearance in autumn. According to Theopompus there was a Western
                    people who actually called the spring Proserpine. As wife of Pluto, she sent
                    spectres, ruled the ghosts, and carried into effect the curses of men. The lake
                    of Avernus, as an entrance to the infernal regions, was sacred to her. From the
                    head of a dying person Proserpine was supposed to cut a lock of hair which had
                    been kept sacred and unshorn through life.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            token that there was a corpse in the house. At least this seems a fair
                            inference from Eurip., <hi rend="italic">Ale.,</hi> 75, 76, 101-4. The
                            lock so cut may have been that which was kept sacred to the gods and
                            unshorn <hi rend="italic">(Etym,. Mag., s.υ.,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                            called in to cut off some hairs 1rom the head of a &lt;lying person, in
                            order that his soul may escape through the top of his head, which is
                            deemed an essential condition of a good transmigration (Horace de la
                            Penna, in Bogle and Manning’s <hi rend="italic">Travées</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">in Tibet). Via</hi> can hardly doubt that the
                            intention of the Graeco-Roman custom was similar. In modern Greece the
                            god of death, Charos, is supposed to draw the soul out of the body, and
                            if a man resists the Arachobites believe that Charos slits open his
                            breast (B. Schmidt, <hi rend="italic">Volksleben der</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">Neugriechen,</hi> p. 228). There are other instances
                            of incisions made in the body of a dying person to allow his soul to
                            escape (cp. Bastian, <hi rend="italic">Mensch,</hi> ii. 342). The custom
                            probably dates from the times when death in battle was the usual death.
                            In the legend of Nisus and Scylla there is a trace of the custom which
                            was still observed in classical times in the sacrifice of animals. The
                            practice of cutting off the hair of the dead prevailed in India, though
                            it does not appear in the Vedas (Monier Williams, <hi rend="italic"
                                >Religious Thought</hi><hi rend="italic">and Life in India,</hi> p.
                            281). We are reminded of the practice of the Pawnees and other North
                            American Indians, who shaved the head with the exception of one lock
                            (the scalp-lock), which was removed by a victorious enemy (Catlin, <hi

                            slain foe (Ellis, <hi rend="italic">Pol. Res.,</hi> vol. iv. p.
                            159).</p></note> She was sometimes identified with Hecate. On the other
                    hand in her character of goddess of the spring she was honoured with
                    flower-festivals in Sicily and at</p>
                <p>Hipponium in Italy. Sicily was a favourite haunt of the&gt; two goddesses, and
                    ancient tradition affirmed that the whole island was sacred to them. The
                    Sicilians claimed to be the first on whom Demeter had bestowed the gift of corn,
                    and hence they honoured the two goddesses with many festivals. They celebrated
                    the festival of Demeter when the corn began to shoot, and the descent of
                    Proserpine when it was ripe. At Cyare, a fountain near Syracuse which Pluto made
                    to spring up when he carried off his bride, the Syracusians held an annual
                    festival in the course of which bulls were sacrificed by being drowned in the
                    water. At Cyzicus also, in Asia Minor, bulls were sacrificed to Proserpine.
                    Demeter and Proserpine were worshipped together by the Athenians at the greater
                    and less Eleusinian festivals, held in autumn and spring respectively. In the
                    Eleusinian mysteries Proserpine nodoubt played an important part (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Eleusinia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Mysteries).</hi>
                    One Greek writer, Achemachus, identified Proserpine with the Egyptian Isis. At
                    Rome Proserpine was associated with Ceres (the Roman representative of Demeter)
                    in the festival of the Cerealia (April 12 to 19), she was represented as the
                    wife of Dis Pater (the Roman Pluto), and was sometimes identified with the
                    native Latin goddess Libera. The pomegranate was Proserpine’s· symbol, and the
                    pigeon and cock were sacred to her. Her votaries abstained from the flesh of
                    domestic fowls, fish, beans, pomegranates, and apples. In works of art she
                    appears with a cornucopia or with ears of com and a cock. The regular form of
                    her name in Greek was Persephone, but various other forms occur—Phersephone,
                    Persephassa, Phersephassa, Pherrephatta, &amp;c., to explain which different
                    etymologies were invented. Corresponding to Proserpine as goddess of the dead is
                    the old Norse goddess <hi rend="italic">Hel</hi> (Gothic <hi rend="italic"
                        >Haifa),</hi> whom Saxo Grammaticus calls Proserpine. (j. o. <hi
