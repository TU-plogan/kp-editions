                    (“River of Silver”), in South America (see vol. ii. Plate xxv., and vol. iv.
                    Plate xvii.), was at first known as Rio de Solis, after Juan Diaz de Solis, who
                    discovered it in 1515, and lost his life on its banks. The present name, a
                    double misnomer, was bestowed by Sebastian Cabot, who, ignorant that he was on
                    the wrong side of the continent, thought he had reached a country of mineral
                    wealth—a mistake (perpetuated also in the designation Argentine Republic) which
                    may be said to have received a kind of poetic justification in the fact that the
                    distant mines of Potosi lie within the drainage area of the La Plata system.
                    Like Rio Grande do Sul and Rio de Janeiro on the Brazilian coast, this Rio is
                    not a river but a vast estuary into which rivers discharge. At its narrowest it
                    is 23 miles across, opposite Buenos Ayres 34 miles, and opposite Montevideo 63
                    miles. By some writers the conventional limit between estuary and ocean is drawn
                    from Montevideo, where the water is still fresh enough to be drunk; but others
                    go farther out and take the line 150 miles across from Maldonado to Cabo San
                    Antonio. In the former case the length of the estuary is 125 miles. At one time
                    it must evidently have extended 200 miles farther inland to Diamante, at the
                    bend of the Paranâ; and nature is steadily and rapidly at work prolonging the
                    rivers proper at the expense of the estuary. At low water the average depth may
                    be taken at 18 feet, and shoals and sandbanks are abundant, especially in the
                    upper end. Nearly the whole expanse between Buenos Ayres and Martin Garcia
                    Island is between 3 and 6 feet deep, and a great portion is even shallower. In
                    the shallower portions the bottom consists of a very fine hard-grained sand, in
                    the deeper portions of a sticky ooze. The tidal movement is so disguised by the
                    more obvious effects of wind that Mr Révy found people who had lived all their
                    lives on the banks ready to deny its existence. But at Buenos Ayres the normal
                    neap-tide is 5 feet 3 inches above ordinary low water, and the spring tides vary
                    from 6 to more than 10 feet. The region being one of “storms and extraordinary
                    electric disturbance,” with the pampero at one time blowing<pb break="no"

                    driving the ocean before it, the ordinary levels and currents are often
                    violently disturbed. The general slope of the surface may even be reversed, and
                    the main current of estuary and river run up stream for a hundred miles or more.
                    It has been estimated that the volume of water poured into the Rio de la Plata
                    exceeds the aggregate discharge of all the rivers of Europe put together. Nor
                    need this be matter of surprise when the enormous extent and the character of
                    the drainage area are taken into account. The headwaters of the Rio Blanco (a
                    feeder of the Pilcomayo sub-system) rise only 125 miles from the coast of the
                    Pacific, in 68° 10' W. long., and those of the Rio Grande are not more than 70
                    miles from the coast of the Atlantic, in 44° W. long.; the basin thus extends
                    east and west over twenty-four degrees of longitude, or 1500 miles, and the
                    direct distance from the northmost source to the mouth of the Parana is about as
                    great. A considerable proportion of this vast area lies within the tropics, and
                    receives an abundant rainfall, which, owing to the character of the strata, is
                    largely carried off by the surface drainage. As an instance of the effect of
                    this rainfall on even the secondary tributaries, Mr Bigg-Wither’s experience may
                    be cited: at Jatahy on the Tibagy he was detained from the 2d to the 25th of
                    July by the river, after nine days of incessant downpour, rising 33 feet at a
                    place where it was 200 yards wide, and pouring along a volume of 90,000 cubic
                    feet per second, or twenty-five times its low-water volume (see <hi
                        rend="italic">Journ. Roy. Geogr. Soc.,</hi> 1876).</p>
                <p>The three great rivers of the La Plata system are the Paranâ, its equal affluent
                    the Paraguay, and the Uruguay—the second being the most important as a waterway,
                    and the first the most interesting from its physical features.<note

                    of which rise in Brazil, has already been sketched in the article on that
                    country (vol. iv. p. 222), it simply remains to direct attention to a few points
                    of interest. In regard to the great “Seven Falls” of the Paranâ, we have still
                    no better account than that of Azara in the 18th century; but the Hundred
                    Cataracts or Victoria Falls of the Curityba or Y-guazu have been described in
                    detail by the members of the first Germano-Argentine colonial land-surveying
                    expedition to Misiones in 1883 (see <hi rend="italic">Verhandl. d. Ges.
                        f.</hi><hi rend="italic">Erdkunde zu</hi><hi rend="italic">Berlin,</hi> vol.
                    X. pp. 357-364). For combined beauty and grandeur of scenery they claim to rank
                    among the foremost cataracts in the world. About 6 or 7 miles higher up the
                    river is 3 miles broad; it gradually narrows until, after passing through a
                    perfect labyrinth of islands (King Albert Archipelago), it pours, not in a
                    single mass, but in numerous streams, over a horse-shoe edge of rock into a
                    gorge 120 to 150 feet deep. Niederlein divides the falls into three groups—a
                    northern or Brazilian, a central or insular, and a southern or Argentine, to
                    which he has attached respectively the names of the Emperor Don Pedro, the
                    Emperor William, and General Roca. The river continues for some distance shut in
                    by overhanging cliffs; and a large number of secondary cataracts (Bosetti Falls,
                    Prince Bismarck Falls, &lt;kc.) are formed by tributary streams, and add to the
                    bewildering beauty of the scene.</p>
                <p>The watersheds between the north-eastern headwaters of the Paraguay system and
                    the southern affluents of the Amazons are so low and narrow that in some
                    instances canoes have been conveyed overland from the one to the other. Interest
                    has recently been concentrated on the exploration of the Pilcomayo, a right-hand
                    tributary which joins the Paraguay proper in 25° 20' S. lat. Though its sources
                    have long been known, all attempts to trace it downward from Bolivia or upward
                    from the Argentine Republic had been foiled by the hostility of the Indians. At
                    length, on April 27, 1882, Dr Crevaux, the great French explorer of
                    South-American rivers, was slain with all his party by the Tobas at a place
                    called Ipanticapn. General interest was thus aroused; and the task in which Dr
                    Crevaux perished has since been practically accomplished by Dr Thouar, his
                    fellow-countryman, who, leaving the San Francisco mission-station on 10th
                    September 1883, reached the mouth of the river on 10th November, though he had
                    not been able to keep close to its course in the lower section of the journey.
                    The Pilcomayo rises in Vilcapujia (a mountain 13,500 feet high to the E. of Lago
                    Poopo), and passes between the Cordillera of Livichuco and the Cordillera de los
                    Frailes, a fe&gt;v miles to the north of Potosi. It cuts through the last range
                    of the Andes in 21° 16'50" S. lat. and 63° 25' W. long., and enters the plains
                    of the Gran Chaco at a height of 1456 feet above sea-level (J. B. Minchin<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Eastern Bolivia,
                            &amp;c.,” in <hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Geo. Soc.,</hi>
                        1881.</p></note>). It is soon after joined by the Pilaga, which brings down
                    the waters of the Rio Blanco and other streams from the mountains. Till in its
                    south-eastern course it reaches 22° S. lat., the river has a very regular
                    course, flowing at the rate of 6500 feet per hour over a sandy bed 600 to 700
                    feet wide, unimpeded by rocks or trees, and enclosed by steep banks 15 to 20
                    feet high, above which the country stretches out in pasture-covered plains.
                    Farther down tire banks increase in height to from 20 to 45 feet, and embrace a
                    channel or valley 5500 feet or more in breadth, though the actual river does not
                    exceed 150 or 200 feet. At the point called Cabello Muerto, 24° 20' S. lat.,
                    commence the marshy plains of the lower course, in which the banks hardly rise
                    above the level of the water, and a whole series of lagoons lie at a distance of
                    a mile or two on the left hand. So flat is the country, and so tortuous the
                    river that when Mr Robinson, in 1873, ascended for 150 miles, he never lost
                    sight of the white houses of Asuncion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>About 150 miles below the mouth of the Pilcomayo the Paraguay is joined by
                    another Andean river the Rio Vermejo or Y-pyta, whose red waters, pouring into
                    the dark clear water of the main stream, are sufficient to tinge the whole
                    current downwards to the confluence of the Parana. “From the junction of its
                    headstreams down to the Paraguay, the Vermejo does not receive a single
                    affluent; its breadth varies from 70 to 250 yards, its depth from 5 to 16 feet;
                    and the current appears to average 1⅜ miles an hour” (Keith Johnston). Its
                    navigability was shown about 1780 by the Franciscan missionaries Murillo and
                    Lapa descending the whole way in a canoe, but it was not till 1874 that, under
                    Don Natalio Roldan, the regular navigation was undertaken.</p>
                <p>At their confluence the Paraguay has a width of half a mile, the Parana of 3
                    miles. The united river continues for 686 miles, first in a south-south-west,
                    then in a south, and finally in a south-east direction before it reaches the
                    head of the La Plata estuary. Down to Diamante, or for 433 miles, its left bank
                    is at intervals formed by lines of bold bluffs from 100 to 200 feet high, on
                    which several of the more important towns are built; but the channel often
                    breaks up so as to enclose extensive islands. The worst reach in this respect is
                    the 45 miles below Goya, a little town in 29° 7' S. lat. At Diamante begins the
                    enormous delta (some 5000 or 6000 square miles) which is traversed by countless
                    and changing channels, and presents nothing else, even if viewed from the
                    masthead of the steamer, but a boundless labyrinth of islands clothed with
                    exuberant vegetation. The two chief lines of navigation through this deltaic
                    region are the Parana de las Palmas (so called by Cabot, in 1526, but now
                    showing comparatively few palms among its ceibos, willows, and poplars) and the
                    Parana Guazu. The former has its mouth about 24 miles north of Buenos Ayres, the
                    latter joining the estuary of the Uruguay 22 miles farther north, in 34° N. lat.
                    and 58° 24' 30" W. long.</p>
                <p>The third great confluent of the La Plata system, the Uruguay, is quite unlike
                    the other two. Instead of having a fairly steady and continuous flow, it appears
                    sometimes as an insignificant torrent and at other times as a magnificent river.
                    It has its headwaters in the Serra Geral, and for several hundred miles
                    continues to flow west through Brazil (forming the northern boundary of Rio
                    Grande do Sul province), as if it meant, like the Curityba, to carry its waters
                    to the Parana; but about 54° W. long, it is turned aside by the mountain range
                    of Misiones, and flows south-west and south almost parallel with the Parana. It
                    has a total length of 950 miles, and a drainage area of 200,000 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p>In the matter of annual rise and fall the three rivers differ considerably. The
                    Paraguay is regular, reaching its lowest stage in the end of February, and its
                    highest about the end of June, and showing an average difference of level not
                    exceeding 15 feet. The ordinary flow at Asuncion is between 97,400 and 99,950
                    cubic feet per second. Above the junction of the Paraguay the Parana appears to
                    have numerous and rapid risings at irregular intervals, but to reach its maximum
                    in December. Below the junction it has much the same movement as the Paraguay,
                    having high water in sum-wer<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n198/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0919-0198-0189"/>, gradually shrinking through September,
                    October, and December, flooding in January, and continuing high and steady till
                    June. The Uruguay rises about the middle of January (at Salto sometimes 22 feet
                    above low water); again in April, to continue in flood for two months (30 feet
                    at Salto); and for the third time, and with great regularity, in September or
                    October, to last a whole month, •and reach 40 to 50 feet above low water.
                    Occasionally the flood level of the Parana is maintained throughout a whole
                    year, or even two years in succession; and at intervals, as in 1858 and 1868,
                    the water rises so high that the whole delta is submerged. The highest floods on
                    record stood 24 feet above ordinary low-water mark at Rosario, or 12 feet above
                    ordinary high water. As a system of waterways the La Plata rivers are but
                    partially developed. Steamers, mainly Brazilian, ascend from Buenos Ayres by the
                    Parana, Paraguay, and Cuyabâ, a total distance of 2146 miles, to the town of
                    Cuyaba in Brazil; and the Pilcomayo and the Vermejo, the Apa, the Jejuy, and the
                    Tebiquary are all more or less navigable. The Parana affords a free passage for
                    280 miles above the confluence to the Seven Falls, except during low water, when
                    the rapids of Apipe interfere; and, according to Bigg-Wither, the upper Parana
                    and its tributaries the Tibagy, Paranapanéma, Tiete, I bah y, &amp;c., furnish
                    1290 miles of navigable stream, of which 510 could be at once utilized by
                    steamers of light draught, while the remainder would require a certain outlay in
                    the way of improvements. Vessels drawing 4⅛ feet of water can always ascend the
                    Uruguay to Salto (200 miles), and during six months they can cross the Salto
                    Chico, or Lesser Fall, a mile higher up; but the Salto Grande, 8 miles farther,
                    stops all progress except during six weeks in October and September. The whole
                    system may be estimated to give upwards of 5000 miles of waterway, of which 3500
                    are accessible from the sea, without counting the secondary deltaic
                    channels.</p>
