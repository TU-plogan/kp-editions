                <p><label type="entry">POPULATION</label>. The phenomena of population are the
                    product of physical forces the nature of which it will be necessary to
                    investigate. It will, however, be convenient to consider population, in the
                    first place, as a statical phenomenon, that is, to observe and classify the
                    principal features it presents, without attempting to investigate the system of
                    causes of which they are the effects. Thereafter the dynamical aspects of the
                    subject, namely, the general laws governing the forces whose joint action has
                    produced population, will receive attention.</p>
                <p>I. Population, <hi rend="italic">statically</hi> considered, may be · defined as
                    “the totality of human beings existing within a given area at a given moment of
                    time.” This definition is identical with that adopted by Haushofer (p. 87),
                    except that that eminent authority thought it unnecessary to add the clause
                    relating to time. The totality just mentioned is ascertained in modern times and
                    by civilized nations by the statistical operation known as the <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Census</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> It is usual to
                    obtain by means of a census a good deal of information beyond the bare fact of
                    the number of persons whose existence is, for the purposes of the census, taken
                    cognizance of. Part of this information is obtained for purposes connected with
                    the administration of the state, such as that contained in replies to questions
                    as to the religion, profession, &lt;fcc,, of the individuals numbered. But these
                    facts, though highly important, are not facts of population strictly speaking.
                    There are two very important characteristics common to all considerable
                    populations— namely, the approximate constancy of the distribution of the
                    population as regards sex and age. A census which did not distinguish between
                    the number of male and the number of female persons composing the population of
                    which it takes cognizance would be seriously defective. Inquiries as to the
                    height and the girth round the chest of individuals are usually made in
                    countries where military service is compulsory, and the degree of prevalence of
                    bodily defects, such as blindness and deafness, is also noted for similar
                    reasons; but such inquiries are the work of specialists, official and other, and
                    in any case are not included in the information obtained from a census. The age
                    of each individual is, however, easily obtained in the course of the operations
                    of the census. We shall now briefly set forth the general characteristics of a
                    population, examined at a particular point of time and without reference to
                    similar phenomena at previous points of time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population of the World.—</hi> The total population of the
                    world is, to a large extent, an estimate, inasmuch as in some countries a proper
                    census has never been taken, while in many the interval that has elapsed since
                    the last operation is so long as to reduce it to the level of serving as a basis
                    for a calculation in which estimates play a large part.</p>
                <p>So great, indeed, is the uncertainty in which all such calculations are involved
                    that an eminent French statistician, Μ. Block, abandons all attempt to deal with
                    the problem, dismissing the subject in the following note <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Traité,</hi> &lt;fcc,, p. 401),—“Nous abstenons de donner le chiffre de
                    l’ensemble de la population de la terre; personne ne connaît ce chiffre.” With
                    this view of the matter we entirely agree, without, however, any disparagement
                    to the valuable work done by Behm and Wagner, who have made the population of
                    the earth their special study, and are under no illusions as to the accuracy of
                    the results they have to offer. The work of these two eminent men of science has

                    unknown or partially known, which is at present large, will gradually
                    diminish.Table I. (p. 513 <hi rend="italic">supra),</hi> taken from Haushofer’s

                    since people first began to make them. We venture to say that any person of fair
                    intelligence and ordinary education would, even without any statistical
                    training, come to the conclusion that there was nothing certain to be known on
                    the subject which these figures profess to illustrate. The fact that Behm and
                    Wagner’s latest estimate is less than that published by them two years
                    previously shows how difficult the subject is. We should add that the reasons
                    given by them for this discrepancy, for even a tyro would have expected a slight
                    increase, are quite satisfactory, and add to our confidence in that part of the
                    investigation for which they profess to give figures approximating to
                    accuracy.According to Behm and Wagner <hi rend="italic">(Die</hi><hi

                    any accurate knowledge whatever as to the sexual constitution of that
                    population. We have, however, tolerably accurate information on this subject for
                    most of the countries of Europe, for the United States, and for Canada. From the
                    figures available it is evident that no general proposition can be laid down on
                    the subject of the normal proportion of females to miles, except that in
                    so-called “old” countries there is usually a slight excess of the former.

                    mentioned (Haushofer, p. 216) :— The census of England and Wales for 1881 gave
                    1055 females to 1000 males. A slight tendency to an increase in the proportion
                    is perceptible in some countries, and to a decrease in others, as the following
                    table (IV.) given by Wappäus and quoted by Haushofer (p. 217) will show. The
                    reader will observe that Wappäus’s figures are the proportions to 100, not to

                    1855104’14United States..185095Ό5 The 1880 census of the United States states
                    the proportion of females to males at 96’54 per cent., which is rather smaller
                    than that shown in 1870 (97’2 per cent.); but immigration is still a potent
                    factor in the growth of the population of that country.With regard to the causes
                    of the excess of females, as in most other social phenomena, our knowledge is
                    very small at present. The reason for the broad distinction between Europe and
                    North America is pretty obvious. New countries are continually receiving many
                    male and fewer female immigrants. Probably also, life being very rough in the

                <p>places where women can receive more protection from hardship. On the other hand,
                    even in Europe men run many risks to which women are not exposed. The subject is
                    a very interesting one, but cannot be adequately treated except at much greater
                    length than is possible here, and we must refer our readers to special works for
                    further information.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Age.—</hi> The characteristics of a population from the point
                    of view of age, which German writers term “Altersaufbau,” can only be treated
                    very generally. Table V. on p. 514 is quoted by Haushofer (p. 213) from Von
                    Scheel’s <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der Statistik.</hi></p>
                <p>This “age scale” shows us the proportion in which persons of various categories
                    of age are found combined to form populations. The general characteristics of
                    the groups are tolerably obvious. It must be remembered that after thirty years
                    the periods are decennial. The difference between the age scale of Europe and
                    that of North America is considerable. In the latter, owing mainly to the fact
                    that emigrants are usually young, a much larger proportion of the population
                    than in Europe are under thirty years of age. On the other hand the age scale of
                    France presents a feature of an opposite kind, namely, a deficiency of persons
                    under fifteen years of age, and an excess of those over forty, as compared with
                    the average of Europe. This conformation of the age scale may be compared with
                    that of Hungary, where the number of children is larger and the number of
                    persons over forty less than the average. It is probable that the smaller number
                    of children in the one case and the larger in the other directly lead
                    respectively to a smaller infant mortality in France than in Hungary. As Μ.
                    Block observes <hi rend="italic">{Traité,</hi> p. 409), “Nous avons moins
                    d’enfants; mais, grâce à une moindre mortalité dans le jeune âge, nous avons
                    plus d’adults.” It is obvious that <hi rend="italic">caeteris</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">paribus</hi> it is easier to pay the requisite attention to
                    the rearing of a small number of children than to do the same for a larger
                    number.</p>
                <p>Careful inquiries into age scales are of very recent origin, the data required
                    for evaluating those relating to earlier periods being absent. Moreover,
                    erroneous statements as to their age are made by a much larger number of persons
                    than might be supposed, sometimes from carelessness or ignorance, but also
                    intentionally. The tendency of women over twenty-five to understate their age,
                    combined with overstatements of age by girls and young women under twenty,
                    always tends to make the twenty to twenty-five section of the age scale unduly
                    large (see <hi rend="italic">Census of England and Wales,</hi> 1881, vol. iv.,
                    “General Report”). We must regard even the age scales now in existence as merely
                    first approximations, for it is evident that observations obtained from several
                    censuses must be reduced and combined before we can feel certain that accidental
                    causes of error have been eliminated. This is all the more necessary as the age
                    scale of any given population cannot be regarded as fixed, any more than the
                    magnitude of the population itself, both being liable to modifications arising
                    out of the varying dynamical conditions existing at different periods. And this
                    brings us to the second portion of our inquiry, in which we shall indicate in
                    the most general way the nature of the proximate causes which underlie the
                    phenomena of population considered as a fact existing at a particular moment of
                    time.</p>
                <p>II. Population, <hi rend="italic">dynamically</hi> considered, is the result of
                    two pairs of opposing forces, whose combined action may, for convenience, be
                    theoretically conceived of as balancing each other, but which never do so
                    balance as a matter of fact. A comparison of two successive censuses invariably
                    shows some “movement of population.” In nearly all civilized countries the
                    movement shown is one of growth when the body of population examined is large.
                    The population of a village or a small town may, quite conceivably, show a
                    reduction in number for the period between two -censuses, but this can hardly be
                    the case with a large town, and still less with a nation, unless as the
                    consequence of some great calamity such as an earthquake or a pestilence or a
                    change in the climatic or economic conditions of the country inhabited. A great
                    war, of course, produces a certain retardation of the rate of increase. Although
                    some of the uncivilized peoples of the world are rapidly disappearing, the
                    tendency of the population of the whole world is evidently to increase—at what
                    rate it is impossible to say, for reasons already mentioned; and our inquiry
                    will, therefore, be confined to peoples regarding whose population we have
                    comparatively accurate information for an adequate number of years.</p>
                <p>The causes of the movement of population are internal and external. The internal
                    arise out of the numerical relation between the births and deaths of a given
                    period, there being an increase when there are more births than deaths, a
                    decrease in the contrary case. Haushofer expresses this by a formula which is
                    sometimes convenient :—“There is an increase where the intervals between
                    successive births are smaller than those between successive deaths” (p. 115).
                    The external are immigration and emigration. The intensity of these two forces
                    operating on population depends on a variety of causes, into which we do not
                    propose to enter. Generally speaking, it may be said that “new” countries, where
                    the density of population is small, attract immigrants from countries in which
                    the density of population is great. The density of population is expressed by
                    the figure denoting the number of inhabitants per square mile (or square
                    kilometre) of the territory they occupy. For a discussion of the various
                    political, social, and economic causes which determine density of population, we
                    must refer our readers to the works of Haushofer (p. 173) and Block (p. 456).
                    Before analysing the components of the movement of population it will be useful
                    to examine briefly that movement itself, and ascertain what is its normal rate
                    in civilized countries. The mode of expressing this rate which is most commonly
                    adopted in the exposition of statistics of population is to state the number of
                    years in which a given population “doubles itself.” It is not a very scientific
                    method of expressing the facts, since it assumes that the rate of a few years
                    will continue for a period of many years, but, in deference to custom, we give a
                    table constructed in accordance with it.</p>

                <p>We now proceed to give a table (VII.) constructed by Signore Luigi Bodio on the
                    best principles, which shows the annual rates of increase of a number of
                    countries, for two distinct periods, taking account of the important changes <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n535/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0919-0535-0516"/> of frontier which have occurred during the
                    whole period covered by the table. If this rectification had not been made it is
                    obvious that the figures resulting from the observations of the two periods
                    would not have been comparable in the case of Italy and several other states
                    (Block, p. 405; Haushofer, p. 120). We may mention that the actually observed
                    yearly rate of increase in the population of England and Wales between 1871 and
                    1881 was 1*44 per cent, of the population in 1871.</p>

                <p>It must be noted that, while the table may be relied on so far as Signior Bodio’s
                    treatment of the data goes, the data for the earlier part of the century are
                    very defective, and the results deduced from them must be regarded as less
                    trustworthy than those for the more recent of the two periods.</p>
                <p>The above tables of increase of population include the effects of immigration and
                    emigration, regarding which we have nothing further to say in this article, as
                    the causes of these phenomena are too heterogeneous for general treatment.
                    Moreover, except in comparatively unimportant cases—unimportant, that is, from
                    our point of view, but by no means so from the standpoint of the statesman— the
                    effects of these two causes are small, the main cause of the growth of
                    population being the internal forces already mentioned, namely, the birth-rate
                    and the death-rate.</p>
                <p>During the earlier half of the century the rate of increase in the United States
                    ranged from 2∣ to 3 per cent, per annum in the successive decades from census to
                    census. The increase in the population of the United States has hitherto
                    depended so much on immigration that at present inquiries into the normal birth
                    and death rates of that country are very difficult, except in the eastern
                    States. Of the total population, 50,442,066, as shown in the census of 1880, no
                    less than 6,619,943, or over 13 per cent., were foreigners. The fact already
                    mentioned, that the proportion of women to men is unusually low, serves to
                    remind us that normal phenomena of population must not as yet be looked for in
                    the American Union.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Birth-Rate.—</hi> The birth-rate of a population is the
                    proportion borne by the number of births in a year to the number of the
                    population. It might seem that it is easy to obtain this rate, but as a matter
                    of fact it is practically impossible to do so. It is not difficult to ascertain,
                    with sufficient accuracy, the number of births; the difficulty is to ascertain
                    what is the number of the population, for that number is never the same for two
                    days together. It is obvious that it would never do to evaluate the birthrate of
                    the United Kingdom, say for 1885, by means of the figures obtained in the census
                    taken on April 4, 1881, and the error would be greater next year, and greater
                    still the year after. The growth of the population since the last census must,
                    therefore, be taken into account; but, even when it has been decided to adopt
                    this plan, there is the difficulty of fixing on the date up to which the
                    additions are to be made. The usual practice is to take the population of a date
                    as near as possible to the middle of the year for which the birth-rate is
                    required as the basis for the calculation. We mention these difficulties as a
                    caution to students of statistics. The following table (VIII.) quoted by
                    Haushofer, p. 123, is taken from Bodio’s <hi rend="italic">Movimento</hi><hi

                <p>The birth-rate in different countries is influenced by various circumstances into
                    which it is not possible to enter at length. The most important circumstance is
                    the proportion borne by the number of women of child-bearing age to the whole
                    population. There are other circumstances which must be kept in mind in
                    comparing the birth-rates of different countries, such as the character of the
                    age scale as a whole, and the density of population, besides climatic and other
                    physical characteristics of the environment of the populations examined. The
                    birth-rate is high in new countries, where there is always a larger proportion
                    of young men than in old states, and where the proportion of women of
                    child-bearing age is also large. The latter circumstance is, we may point out,
                    quite consistent with the statement already made, that in new countries the
                    proportion of women to men is smaller than in old ones. For an unusually large
                    proportion of the total number of women in new countries are young.</p>
                <p>Some facts relating to the absolute number of births may here be briefly referred
                    to. The most important of these is its composition as regards sex. We have
                    already seen that in most populations there are more women than men. This is not
                    a consequence of there being more girls born than boys, for the fact is just the
                    contrary. The following table (IX.) shows the number of male births to every 100
                    female births which took place in the undermentioned countries during the
                    periods stated <hi rend="italic">(^Movimento,</hi> &lt;fcc., p. 126; Haushofer,

                <p>On the somewhat anomalous figures we must observe that those relating to Greece
                    and Servia are possibly to be explained by the hypothesis of inaccurate returns.
                    We may add that, if a distinction is made between legitimate and illegitimate
                    children, it is usually found that the excess of male births is greater among
                    the latter. In countries, therefore, where the proportion of illegitimate to
                    legitimate births is high there will usually be a higher proportion of male to
                    female births than in countries where there are not relatively so many
                    illegitimate births (Block, p. 429).</p>
                <p>Interesting inquiries have been made into the facts regarding the distribution of
                    births during the year, showing that there are, as a rule, more births in some
                    months than in others, and also as to the influence high prices for the primary
                    necessaries of life have on the number of births (Mayr, p. 235).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Death-Rate.—</hi> The death-rate of a population is the
                    proportion borne by the number of deaths in a year to the number of the
                    population. The population is to be reckoned as has been already described in
                    dealing with the birth-rate. This very important statistical quantity is
                    sometimes confused with another relating to the same phenomenon,—namely, the
                    mean duration of life. The difficulties in obtaining an accurate death-rate are,
                    if anything, greater than in the case of the birth-rate.</p>

                <p>This table is sufficient for our purpose, which is to give a general idea as to
                    the death-rate of these countries. Much more accurate approximations are,
                    however, needed for actuarial purposes, and very elaborate valuations of the
                    death-rate will be found in G. F. Knapp’s work <hi rend="italic">Ueber

                <p>It will be seen that from nearly one-fifth to nearly one-third of the deaths were
                    those of children less than twelve months old. The very high proportion of
                    deaths at this age in Bavaria was some years ago made the subject of a special
                    inquiry by Dr Mayr, and it was found to be largely due to the bad mode of
                    bringing up infants peculiar to certain localities (Mayr, pp. 91, 319).</p>
                <p>The composition of the death-rate in regard to sex must be touched on briefly. As
                    we have seen, more boys are born than girls. Owing, however, to the greater
                    mortality among the former their number is rapidly reduced during the first few
                    years of life, so that at any given moment the population is composed as stated
                    in the age scales. The exact mode in which a given number of persons born in the
                    same year disappears by death is shown in the elaborate tables of mortality used
                    by actuaries. These tables are different for different countries and for males
                    and females. Very elaborate tables of survival were prepared for the British
                    Government in 1883-84 for calculating annuities.</p>
                <p>We cannot here deal with what is known as the “population question.” Any adequate
                    discussion of that highly important subject would involve considerations outside
                    the limits of this article. The “population question” is a question of conduct,
                    while the present article seeks only to point out certain well-ascertained facts
                    regarding the phenomenon of superorganic evolution called population. The facts
                    in question are general, and, though sufficient to indicate the nature of the
                    phenomenon, and the broad divisions which are most convenient for its further
                    investigation, are quite insufficient as the basis for the formation of any
                    ethical judgment regarding the actions of the individuals composing the
                    population.</p>
                <p>Among the works that may be consulted to the greatest advantage by the student
                    are the following :—the numerous works of the late Dr William Farr, F.R.S.,
                    formerly registrar-general; various works by Dr W. A. Guy, F.R.S.; those of
                    Adolphe Quetelet; various monographs by Dr Ernst Engel, and other eminent
                    statists in the official publications of the Prussian Statistical Office;
                    various publications of the Italian Statistical Bureau; the publications of the
                    International Congress of Statistics. Systematic treatment of the whole subject
                    of population will be found in the following works :—Bertillon, <hi
