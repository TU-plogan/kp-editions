                    >(Brethren,</hi></hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Christian Brethren)</hi> are a
                    sect of Christians who received the name in 1830 when the Rev. J. N. Darby
                    induced many of the inhabitants of Plymouth to associate themselves with him for
                    the promulgation of opinions which they held in common. Although small Christian
                    communities existed in Ireland and elsewhere calling themselves <hi
                    rend="italic">Brethren</hi> and holding similar views, the accession to the
                    ranks of Mr Darby so increased their numbers and influence that he is usually
                    reckoned the founder of Plymouthism. Darby (born in Nov. 1800, in London;
                    graduated at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1819; died April 29, 1882 at
                    Bournemouth) was a curate in the Episcopalian Church of Ireland until 1827, when
                    he felt himself constrained to leave the Established Church; betaking himself to
                    Dublin, he became associated with several devout people who refused all
                    ecclesiastical fellowship, met statedly for public worship, and called
                    themselves the Brethren. In 1830 Darby at Plymouth won over a large number of
                    people to his way of thinking, among whom were the Rev. Benjamin Wills Newton,
                    who had been a clergyman of the Established Church of England; the Rev. James L.
                    Harris, a Plymouth clergyman; and the well known Biblical scholar Dr Samuel
                    Prideaux Tregelles. ' The Brethren started a newspaper, <hi rend="italic">The,
                    Christian Witness,</hi> continued under the names <hi rend="italic">The Present
                    Testimony</hi> (1849) and <hi rend="italic">The Bible Treasury</hi> (1856), with
                    Harris as editor and Darby as the most important contributor. During the next
                    eight years the progress of the sect was rapid, and communities of the brethren
                    were to be found in many of the principal towns in England.</p>
                <p>In 1838 Darby, after a short stay in Paris, went to reside in French Switzerland,
                    and found many disciples. Congregations were formed in Geneva, at Lausanne,
                    where most of the Methodist and other dissenters joined the Brethren, at Vevey,
                    and elsewhere in Vaud. His opinions also found their way into Germany, German
                    Switzerland, Italy, and France; but French Switzerland has always remained the
                    stronghold of Plymouthism on the Continent, and for his followers there Mr Darby
                    wrote two of his most important tracts, <hi rend="italic">Le Ministère considéré
                    dans sa Nature</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De la</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Presence</hi><hi rend="italic">et de VAction du S. Esprit dans VÉglise.</hi>
                    The revolution in the canton Vaud, instigated by the Jesuits in 1845, brought
                    persecution to the Brethren in the canton and in other parts of French
                    Switzerland, and Darby felt his own life insecure there.</p>
                <p>He returned to England, and his reappearance was accompanied by divisions among
                    the Brethren at home. These divisions began at Plymouth. Mr B. Wills Newton, at
                    the head of the community there, was accused of departing from the testimony of
                    the Brethren against an official ministry, and of reintroducing the spirit of
                    clericalism. Unable to detach the congregation from the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n248/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0248-0239"/> preacher, Darby began a rival and separate
                    assembly. The majority of the Brethren out of Plymouth supported Darby, but a
                    minority kept by Newton. The separation became wider in 1847 on the discovery of
                    supposed heretical teaching by Newton. In 1848 another division took place. The
                    Bethesda congregation at Bristol, where Mr George Müller was the most
                    influential member, received into communion several of Newton’s followers and
                    justified their action. A large number of communities approved of their conduct;
                    others were strongly opposed to it. Out of this came the separation into Neutral
                    Brethren led by Müller, and Exclusive Brethren or Darbyites, who refused to hold
                    communion with the followers of Newton or Müller. The exclusives, who were the
                    more numerous, suffered further divisions. An Irish clergyman named Cluff had
                    adopted the views of Mr Pearsall Smith, and when these were repudiated seceded
                    with his followers. The most important division among the exclusives came to a
                    crisis in 1881, when Mr William Kelly and Mr Darby became the recognized leaders
                    of two sections who separated on some point of discipline. There are therefore
                    at least five official divisions or sects of Plymouthists :—(1) the followers of
                    Mr B. Wills Newton; (2) the Neutrals, who incline to the Congregationalist idea
                    that each assembly should judge for itself in matters of discipline, headed by
                    Mr George Müller; (3) the Darbyite Exclusives; (4) the Exclusives who follow Mr
                    Kelly; and (5) the followers of Mr Cluff. The fundamental principle of the
                    Exclusives, “Separation from evil God’s principle of unity,” has led to many
                    unimportant excommunications and separations besides those mentioned.</p>
                <p>The theological views of the Brethren do not differ greatly from those held by
                    evangelical Protestants (for a list of divergences, see Reid, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plymouth Brethrenism Unveiled and Refuted)·,</hi> they make the baptism of
                    infants an open question and celebrate the Lord’s Supper weekly. Their
                    distinctive doctrines are ecclesiastical. They hold that all official ministry,
                    anything like a clergy, whether on Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or
                    Congregationalist theories, is a denial of the spiritual priesthood of all
                    believers, and a striving against the Holy Spirit. Hence it is a point of
                    conscience to have no communion with any church which possesses a regular
                    ministry. The gradual growth of this opinion, and perhaps the reasons for
                    holding it, may be traced in Mr Darby’s earlier writings. While a curate in the
                    Church of Ireland he was indignant with Archbishop Magee for stopping the
                    progress of mission work among Roman Catholics by imposing on all who joined the
                    church the oath of supremacy. This led Darby to the idea that established
                    churches are as foreign to the spirit of Christianity as the papacy is
                    (“Considerations addressed to the Archbishop of Dublin, &amp;c.,” <hi
                    rend="italic">Coll. Works,</hi> vol. i. 1). The parochial system, when enforced
                    to the extent of prohibiting the preaching of the gospel within a parish where
                    the incumbent was opposed to it, led him to consider the whole system a
                    hindrance to the proper work of the church and therefore anti-Christian
                    (“Thoughts on the present position of the Home Mission,” <hi rend="italic">Coll.
                    Works,</hi> i. 78). And the waste of power implied in the refusal to sanction
                    lay-preaching seemed to him to lead to the conclusion that an official ministry
                    was a refusal of the gifts of the Spirit to the church (“On Lay Preaching,” <hi
                    rend="italic">Coll. Works,</hi> p. 200). These three ideas seem to have led in
                    the end to Plymouthism; and the movement, if it has had small results in the
                    formation of a sect, has at least set churches to consider how they might make
                    their machinery more elastic. Perhaps one of the reasons of the comparatively
                    small number of Brethren may be found in their idea that their mission is not to
                    the heathen but to “the awakened in the ehurches.”</p>
