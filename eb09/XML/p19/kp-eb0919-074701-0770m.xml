                <p><label type="entry">PRISON DISCIPLINE</label>. Authority in every age and in
                    every country has claimed to impose penalties on all who offend against it.
                    Either coercion or protection has been the moving principle: the master extorted
                    submission, or society, through its rulers, defended itself against evil doers.
                    The most common punishments in early times were naturally those most easily
                    inflicted. Offenders paid in their persons: they were put to death with every
                    variety of the capital sentence, were branded, mutilated, or sold as slaves.
                    They were fined also, were degraded, or forfeited civil rights, or yet again
                    were simply banished from their homes. Enforced detention, incarceration within
                    four walls, was another method of coercion which grew and gained favour under
                    the feudal system. The lord temporal or spiritual or corporate body could thus
                    hold the vassal safe until he yielded fealty or submitted to extortion. A
                    dungeon told no tales, and served conveniently to bury the victims of mediaeval
                    oppression. The unrestrained and unjustifiable exercise of the power to imprison
                    lingered long in lands where personal liberty was unknown ∙, nor did arbitrary
                    imprisonment terminate with the destruction of the Bastille. In England,
                    however, freedom from illegal arrest, the dearest of the Briton’s privileges,
                    was resolutely fought for and early achieved. The Great Charters conceded it;
                    and, although often in danger, it was confirmed finally and beyond all question
                    by the Habeas Corpus Act passed in the reign of Charles II. But the theory was
                    better than the practice: numbers always languished in jail, the victims of
                    needlessly severe or misinterpreted laws, who nowadays would have been at large.
                    Through long years of trouble and disquiet, when the country was torn with
                    religious and political dissensions, the prisons were always full. Intolerance
                    appealed to the strong arm, and the jail was the antechamber of the scaffold or
                    stake. When party warfare ran high, when kings struggled for larger powers or
                    their ministers and myrmidons ruled with a high hand, incarceration was the easy
                    recompense for all on the losing side. The commercial laws of a nation wedded to
                    trade kept a large contingent always in jail. The debtor was at the mercy of his
                    creditor, who could command the best efforts of the Jaw to assist him in
                    recovering his own again. Irregularity in the administration of justice
                    contributed largely to fill the prisons. Jail deliveries were frequently delayed
                    indefinitely; while, even when tardy trial ended in an acquittal, release was
                    not always accorded, and innocent men, unable to meet extortionate demands in
                    fees, were carried back to prison. This was one reason why jails were full; yet
                    another was the laxity or entire absence of discipline which suffered the
                    families of accused persons to share their confinement. Under such conditions,
                    more or less universal, the state of prisons, not in England alone, but
                    throughout the then civilized world, was deplorable in the extreme. Yet the
                    terrors of incarceration were long but vaguely understood. Glimpses of light
                    sometimes penetrated the dark recesses of the prison house, as when the
                    atrocities perpetrated by the keepers of the chief debtors’ prisons in London
                    were made the subject of parliamentary inquiry. This was in 1730, forty-three
                    years before the revelations of Howard. But in the interval voices were
                    occasionally raised in protest, and there was a general sense of uneasiness
                    throughout the country to which the great philanthropist gave point and
                    expression. Howard began his journeys of inspection in 1773; in the following
                    year he was examined by the House of Commons, and received the thanks of the
                    House for his arduous and self-sacrificing labours for the mitigation of
                    suffering in jails. What Howard found is sufficiently well known. The prisons of
                    the kingdom were a disgrace to humanity: they were for the most part poisonous
                    pestiferous dens, densely overcrowded, dark, foully dirty, not only
                    ill-ventilated, but deprived altogether of fresh air. The wretched inmates were
                    thrown into subterranean dungeons, into wet and noisome caverns and hideous
                    holes to rot and fester, a prey to fell disease bred and propagated in the
                    prison house, and deprived of the commonest necessaries of life. For food they
                    were dependent upon the caprice of their jailers or the charity of the
                    benevolent; water was denied them· except in the scantiest proportions; they
                    were half naked or in rags; their only bedding was putrid straw reeking with
                    exhalations and accumulated filth. Every one in durance, whether tried or
                    untried, was heavily ironed; women did not escape the infliction. All alike were
                    subject to the rapacity of their jailers and the extortions of their fellows.
                    Jail fees were levied ruthlessly,—“garnish” also, the tax or contribution paid
                    by each individual to a common fund to be spent by the whole body, generally in
                    drink. Drunkenness was universal and quite unchecked; gambling of all kinds was
                    practised; vice and obscenity were everywhere in the ascendant. Idleness,
                    drunkenness, vicious intercourse, sickness, starvation, squalor, cruelty,
                    chains, awful oppression, and everywhere culpable neglect — in these words may
                    be summed up the state of the jails at the time of Howard’s visitation.</p>
                <p>It must be borne in mind that all this time the prisons were primarily places of
                    detention, not of punishment. The bulk of those committed to their safe keeping
                    were accused persons awaiting trial in due process of law, or debtors; and of
                    these again by far the most numerous class were the impecunious and the
                    unfortunate, whom a mistaken system locked up and deprived of all means of
                    paying their liabilities. Now and again an offender was sentenced to be
                    imprisoned in default of payment of fine, or to pass the intervals between
                    certain periods of disgraceful exposure on the pillory. Imprisonment had as yet
                    no regular place in the code of penalties, and the jail was only the temporary
                    lodging of culprits duly tried and sentenced according to law. The punishment
                    most in favour in these ruthless times was death. The statute-book bristled with
                    capital felonies, and the gallows was in perpetual requisition. These were days
                    when the pickpocket was hanged; so was the sheep-stealer, and the forger of
                    one-pound notes. Well might Sir Samuel Romilly, to whose strenuous exertions the
                    amelioration of the penal code is in a great measure due, declare that the laws
                    of England were written in blood. But even then there was another and a less
                    sanguinary penalty. The deportation of criminals beyond seas grew naturally out
                    of the laws which prescribed banishment for certain offences. The Vagrancy Act
                    of Elizabeth’s reign contained in it the germ of transportation, by empowering
                    justices in quarter sessions to banish offenders and order them to be conveyed
                    into such parts beyond the seas as should be assigned by Her Majesty’s privy
                    council. Full effect was given to this statute in the next reign, as is proved
                    by a letter <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n771/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0771-0748"/> of James I., dated 1619, in which the king
                    directs “a hundred dissolute persons” to be sent to Virginia. Another Act of
                    similar tenor was passed in the reign of Charles II., in which the term
                    “transportation” appears to have been first used. A further and more systematic
                    development of the system of transportation took place in 1718, when an Act was
                    passed by which offenders who had escaped the death penalty were handed over to
                    contractors, who engaged to transport them to the American colonies. These
                    contractors were vested with a property in the labour of the convicts for a
                    certain term, generally from seven to fourteen years, and this right they
                    frequently sold. Labour in those early days was scarce in the new settlements;
                    and before the general adoption of negro slavery there was a keen competition
                    for felon hands. The demand was indeed so great that it produced illegal methods
                    of supply. An organized system of kidnapping prevailed along the British coasts;
                    young lads were seized and sold into what was practically white slavery in the
                    American plantations. These malpractices were checked, but the legitimate
                    traffic in convict labour continued until it was ended peremptorily by the
                    revolt of the American colonies and the achievement of their independence. In
                    1776 the British legislature, making a virtue of necessity, discovered that
                    transportation to His Majesty’s colonies (which three years previously had
                    declared their independence) was bound to be attended by various inconveniences,
                    particularly by depriving the kingdom of many subjects whose labour might be
                    useful to the community; and an Act was accordingly passed which provided that
                    convicts sentenced to transportation might be employed at hard labour at home.
                    At the same time the consideration of some scheme for their disposal was
                    entrusted to three eminent public men—Sir William Blackstone, Mr Eden
                    (afterwards Lord Auckland), and John Howard. The result of their labours was an
                    Act for the establishment of penitentiary houses, dated 1778. This Act is of
                    peculiar importance. It contains the first public enunciation of a general
                    principle of penal treatment, and shows that even at that early date the system
                    since nearly universally adopted was fully understood. The object in view was
                    thus stated. It was hoped, by sobriety, cleanliness, and medical assistance, by
                    a regular series of labour, by solitary confinement during the intervals of
                    work, and by due religious instruction, to preserve and amend the health of the
                    unhappy offenders, to inure them to habits of industry, to guard them from
                    pernicious company, to accustom them to serious reflexion, and to teach them
                    both the principles and practice of every Christian and moral duty. The
                    experience of a century has added nothing to these the true principles of penal
                    discipline; they form the basis of every species of prison system carried out
                    since the passing of the Act 19 Geo. III. c. 74 in 1779.</p>
                <p>The first step towards giving effect to this Act was the appointment of a
                    commission of three “supervisors” to select and acquire a site for the first
                    penitentiary house. Howard was one, and no doubt the most influential, of these;
                    but he could not agree with his colleagues as to the most suitable situation.
                    One was for Islington, another for Limehouse, while Howard insisted upon some
                    site which was healthy, well supplied with water, and in such a convenient spot
                    that it could be readily visited and inspected. It is interesting to observe
                    that the great philanthropist anticipated modern English practice in his
                    preparation of the plans for the construction of the prison. He was strongly of
                    opinion that the penitentiary should be built by convict labour, just as in
                    recent years the new prison has been erected at Wormwood Scrubs, and large
                    blocks added to the prisons of Chatham, Portsmouth, and Dartmoor. Howard,
                    however, withdrew from the commission, and new supervisors were appointed, who
                    were on the eve of commencing the first penitentiary when the discoveries of
                    Captain Cook in the South Seas turned the attention of the Government towards
                    these new lands. The vast territories of Australasia promised an unlimited field
                    for convict colonization, and for the moment the scheme for penitentiary houses
                    fell to the ground. Public opinion generally preferred the idea of establishing
                    penal settlements at a distance from home. “There was general confidence,” says
                    Merivale in his work on colonization, “in the favourite theory that the best
                    mode of punishing offenders was that which removed them from the scene of
                    offence and temptation, cut them off by a great gulf of space from all their
                    former connexions, and gave them the opportunity of redeeming past crimes by
                    becoming useful members of society.” These views so far prevailed that an
                    expedition consisting of nine transports and two men-of-war, the “first fleet”
                    of Australian annals, sailed in March 1787 for New South Wales. This first fleet
                    reached Botany Bay in January 1788, but passed on and landed at Port Jackson,
                    where it entered and occupied the harbour of Sydney, one of the finest and most
                    secure havens in the world. We shall return further on to the proceedings of
                    these first criminal colonists when the progress of transportation as a
                    secondary punishment will be described.</p>
                <p>The penitentiary scheme was not, however, abandoned on the adoption of
                    transportation to New South Wales. It was revived and kept alive by Jeremy
                    Bentham, who in 1791 published a work on prison discipline entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The, Panopticon or Inspection House,</hi> and followed it next
                    year by a formal proposal to erect a prison house on his own plan. Bentham’s
                    main idea was “a circular building, an iron cage glazed, a glass lantern as
                    large as Ranelagh, with the cells on the outer circumference.” Within, in the
                    centre, an inspection station was so fixed that every cell or part of a cell
                    could be at all times closely observed,— the prisoners being themselves at
                    liberty to communicate with visitors and make known their complaints by means of
                    tubes. He hoped to effect much in the way of reformation from a system of
                    solitude or limited seclusion, with constant employment on work in the profits
                    of which the prisoners were to share. His project was warmly approved by Pitt,
                    but secret influences—the personal hostility, it was said, of George III. to
                    Bentham as an advanced Radical—hindered its adoption until 1794. A contract was
                    then made between the treasury and Bentham, by which the latter was to erect a
                    prison for a thousand convicts, with chapel and other necessary buildings, for
                    &lt;£19,000. A portion of this sum was advanced, and Bentham also acquired on
                    behalf of the Government certain lands in the neighbourhood of Tothill Fields.
                    But the undertaking languished, and never took practical shape. Nearly fifteen
                    years later, when the penitentiary question was again revived, Bentham’s claims
                    were referred to arbitration, and the Government proceeded to erect the prison
                    on its own account, “fully recognizing the importance of attempting reformation
                    by the seclusion, employment, and religious instruction of prisoners.” This had
                    been tried already on a small scale but with satisfactory results, first at the
                    Gloucester prison erected in 1791 and afterwards in the house of correction at
                    Southwell. A larger and more ambitious experiment was resolved upon, worthy of
                    the state; and the great penitentiary still standing after many vicissitudes,
                    but practically unaltered, at Millbank was the result of this determination. It
                    was built on the lands originally acquired by Bentham, and the work commenced in
                    1813 was continued at great outlay until 1816, when a portion was ready for the
                    reception <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n772/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0772-0749"/></p>
                <p>of prisoners. A great flourish attended its opening. Its affairs were entrusted
                    to a specially appointed committee of eminent and distinguished personages, the
                    chairman being the Speaker of the House of Commons. Crowds of visitors—royal
                    dukes, foreign princes, the élite of society —came to see the new prison; most
                    elaborate arrangements were made for its internal government, and no money was
                    spared either upon the staff or upon the completion of the buildings. The sum
                    total expended upon the latter amounted to half a million of money, and the
                    yearly charges of the establishment were a heavy burthen on the exchequer.</p>
                <p>The erection of Millbank -was, however, a step in the right direction. The energy
                    with which it was undertaken was the more remarkable because elsewhere
                    throughout the United Kingdom the prisons, with but few exceptions, remained
                    deplorably bad. Mr Neild, who in 1812 followed in the footsteps of John Howard,
                    found that the old conditions, overcrowding and indiscriminate intercourse,
                    remained unchanged. “The great reformation produced by Howard,” to use Neild’s
                    own words, “was merely temporary; prisons were relapsing into their former
                    horrid state of privation, filthiness, severity, and neglect.” Yet the
                    legislature was alive to the need for prison reform. Besides the building of
                    Millbank it had promulgated many Acts for the amelioration of prisoners. Jail
                    fees were once more distinctly abolished; the appointment of chaplains was
                    insisted upon; the erection of improved prison buildings was rendered imperative
                    upon local authorities. But these with other and much older Acts remained in
                    abeyance. Thus an Act which provided for the classification of prisoners had
                    remained a dead letter; even the separation of the males from the females was
                    not an universal rule. Humane provisions intended to secure the good government
                    of prisons, their cleanliness and ventilation, and the proper supply of food,
                    clothing, and bedding to the prisoners were still systematically ignored. Roused
                    by these crying evils, a small band of earnest men, philanthropists and members
                    of the Society of Friends, formed themselves into an association for the
                    improvement of prison discipline, and devoted themselves with rare energy and
                    singleness of purpose to their self-constituted task. They perambulated the
                    country inspecting all the prisons; they issued lengthy interrogatories to
                    prison officials; they published periodical reports giving the result of their
                    inquiries, with their views on the true principles of prison management, and
                    much sound advice, accompanied by elaborate plans, on the subject of prison
                    construction. The labours of this society brought out into strong relief the
                    naked deformity of the bulk of the British jails. It was the old story. Jails,
                    speaking broadly, were lamentably inadequate for the numbers crowded into them.
                    Hence there was the most terrible overcrowding: by day in some prisons it was
                    nearly impossible to push through the throngs in the yards; by night the
                    wretched prisoners ran the risk of suffocation. Prisoners were still very
                    generally obliged to wear heavy irons. They had no regular diet—at best only dry
                    bread. Speaking of St Albans from his personal observation, Mr Buxton, a most
                    active member of the Society, says, “All were in ill health; almost all were in
                    rags; almost all were filthy in the extreme. The state of the prison, the
                    desperation of the prisoners, broadly hinted in their conversation and plainly
                    expressed in their conduct, the uproar of oaths, complaints, and obscenity, the
                    indescribable stench, presented together a concentration of the utmost misery
                    and the utmost guilt.” This was no over-coloured picture; nor did it portray a
                    solitary instance. The reports of the Society laid bare the existence of similar
                    horrors in numbers of other jails. Yet this was in 1818, when the legislature
                    was setting a praiseworthy example—when half a million had been spent in
                    providing large airy cells for a thousand prisoners. Even in London itself,
                    within easy reach of this palatial Millbank penitentiary, the chief prison of
                    the city, Newgate, was in a disgraceful condition. This had been exposed by a
                    parliamentary inquiry as far back as 1814, but nothing had been done to remedy
                    the evils laid bare. All the shameful conditions of neglect, ill-treatment, and
                    overcrowding were present in Newgate, and to the same extent as in any of the
                    provincial prisons. The state of the female side had already attracted the
                    attention of that devoted woman, Mrs Fry, whose ministrations and wonderful
                    success no doubt encouraged, if they did not bring about, the formation of the
                    Prison Society. Mrs Fry went first to Newgate in 1813, but only as a casual
                    visitor. It was not till 1817 that she entered upon the great and noble work
                    with which her name will ever be associated. She worked a miracle there in an
                    incredibly short space of time. The ward into which she penetrated, although
                    strongly dissuaded by the officials, was like a den of wild beasts; it was
                    filled with women unsexed, fighting, swearing, dancing, gaming, yelling, and
                    justly deserved its name of “hell above ground.” Within a month it was
                    transformed, and presented, says an eye witness, “a scene where stillness and
                    propriety reigned.” The wild beasts were tamed. It was not strange that such
                    marvellous results should be bruited abroad, that public attention should be
                    attracted to Mrs Fry’s labours, and that others should seek to follow in her
                    footsteps. Movements similar to that which Mrs Fry headed were soon set on foot
                    both in England and on the Continent, and public attention was generally
                    directed to the urgent necessity for prison reform.</p>
                <p>Stimulated no doubt by the success achieved by Mrs Fry, the Prison Discipline
                    Society continued its useful labours. Hostile critics were not wanting; many
                    voices were raised in protest against the ultra-humanitarianism which sought to
                    make jails too comfortable and tended to pamper criminals. But the society
                    pursued its way undeterred by sarcasm, through evil and good report striving
                    earnestly after the objects it had in view. Many of these are now accepted as
                    axioms in prison treatment. It is, for instance, established beyond question
                    that female officers only should have charge of female prisoners, that prisoners
                    of both sexes should be kept constantly employed. Yet these principles were
                    unacknowledged at that time, and were first enunciated in Acts such as the 4
                    Geo. IV. c. 65 and the 5 Geo. IV. c. 85 (1823-24), the passing of which were
                    mainly due to the strenuous exertions of the Prison Discipline Society. It was
                    laid down in these that over and above safe custody it was essential to preserve
                    health, improve morals, and enforce hard labour on all prisoners sentenced to
                    it. These Acts also provided that male and female prisoners should be confined
                    in separate buildings, that matrons should be appointed, and schoolmasters, and
                    that there should be divine service daily in the jails. Now at last irons were
                    strictly forbidden except in cases of “urgent and absolute necessity,” and it
                    was ruled that every prisoner should have a bed to himself,—if possible a
                    separate cell, the last being the first formal statement of a principle upon
                    which all future prison discipline was to be based.</p>
                <p>The importance of these Acts cannot be overestimated as supplying a legal
                    standard of efficiency by which all prisons could be measured. Still the
                    progress of improvement was extremely slow, and years after the managers of
                    jails still evaded or ignored the Acts. Many local authorities grudged the money
                    to rebuild or enlarge their jails; others varied much in their interpretation of
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n773/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0773-0750"/> rules as to hard labour and the hours of
                    employment. One great drawback to general reform was that a large number of
                    small prisons lay beyond the reach of the law. Those under small jurisdictions
                    in the boroughs and under the petty corporate bodies continued open to the
                    strongest reprobation. Not only were they wanting in all the indispensable
                    requirements as laid down by the most recent Acts, but they were often unfit for
                    the confinement of human beings, and were described “as fruitful sources of vice
                    and misery, debasing all who are confined within their walls.” They thus
                    remained until they were swept away by the measure which brought about the
                    reform of the municipal corporations in 1835. But by this time a still more
                    determined effort had been made to establish some uniform and improved system of
                    prison discipline. In 1831 a select committee of the House of Commons went into
                    the whole subject of secondary punishment, and reported that, as the
                    difficulties in the way of an effective classification of prisoners were
                    insurmountable, they were strongly in favour of the confinement of prisoners in
                    separate cells, recommending that the whole of the prisons should be altered
                    accordingly, and the expense borne by the public exchequer. There can be little
                    doubt that this committee, like every one just then, was greatly struck by the
                    superior methods of prison discipline pursued in the United States. The best
                    American prisons had recently been visited by two eminent Frenchmen, MM.
                    Beaumont and De Tocqueville, who spoke of them in terms of the highest praise.
                    It was with the object of appropriating what was best in the American system
                    that Mr Crawfurd was despatched across the Atlantic on a special mission of
                    inquiry. His able and exhaustive report, published in 1834, was a valuable
                    contribution to the whole question of penal discipline, and it was closely and
                    attentively studied at the time. Another select committee, this time of the
                    House of Lords, returned to the subject in 1835, and after a long investigation
                    re-enunciated the theory that all prisoners should be kept separate and apart
                    from one another. It also urged in strong terms the necessity for one uhiform
                    system of treatment, more especially as regarded dietaries, labour, and
                    education, and strongly recommended the appointment of official inspectors to
                    enforce obedience to the Acts. These recommendations were eventually adopted,
                    and formed the basis of a new departure. This was the first indication of a
                    system which, although greatly modified, enlarged, and improved, is in its main
                    outlines the same as that now in force.</p>
                <p>It must, however, be borne in mind that the prisons at home still formed an item
                    only, and not the largest, in the scheme of secondary punishment. The jail was
                    only a place of temporary detention, where prisoners awaited trial, suffered
                    short terms of imprisonment, or passed on to the gallows or the penal colonies.
                    The last-named was the chief outlet, for by this time the country was fully
                    committed to the system of deportation. Since the first fleet in 1787 convicts
                    had been sent out in constantly increasing numbers to the antipodes. Yet the
                    early settlement at Sydney had not greatly prospered. The infant colony,
                    composed of such incongruous materials, of guards and criminals, had had a
                    bitter struggle for existence. It had been hoped that the community would raise
                    its own produce and speedily become self-supporting. But the soil was
                    unfruitful; the convicts knew nothing of farming; there was no one fully
                    competent to instruct them in agriculture. All lived upon rations sent out from
                    home"; and when convoys with relief lingered by the way famine stared all in the
                    face. The colony was long a penal settlement and nothing more, peopled only by
                    two classes, convicts and their masters— criminal bondsmen on the one hand who
                    had forfeited their independence and were bound to labour without wages for the
                    state, on the other officials to guard and exact the due performance of tasks.
                    From the first it had been felt that the formation of a steady respectable class
                    was essential to the future healthy life of the colony.. But such an element was
                    not easy to infuse into the community. A few free families were encouraged to
                    emigrate, but they were lost in the mass they were intended to leaven, swamped
                    and outnumbered by the convicts, shiploads of whom continued to pour in year
                    after year. As the influx increased difficulties arose as to their employment.
                    Free settlers were too few to give work to more than a small proportion.
                    Moreover, a new policy was in the ascendant, initiated by Governor Macquarie,
                    who considered the convicts and their rehabilitation his chief care, and
                    steadily discouraged the immigration of any but those who “came out for their
                    country’s good.” The great bulk of the convict labour thus remained in
                    Government hands. This period marked the first phase in the history of
                    transportation. The penal colony, having triumphed over early dangers and
                    difficulties, was crowded with convicts in a state of semi-freedom, maintained
                    at the public expense, and utilized in the development of the latent resources
                    of the country. The methods employed by Governor Macquarie were not perhaps
                    invariably the best; the time was hardly ripe as yet for the erection of
                    palatial buildings in Sydney, while the congregation of the workmen in large
                    bodies tended greatly to their demoralization. But some of the works undertaken
                    and carried out were of incalculable service to the young colony; and its early
                    advance in wealth and prosperity was greatly due to the magnificent roads,
                    bridges, and other facilities of inter-communication for which it was indebted
                    to Governor Macquarie.</p>
                <p>But now the criminal sewage flowing from the Old World to the New was greatly
                    increased in volume under milder and more humane laws. Many now escaped the
                    gallows, and much of the over-crowding of the jails at home already mentioned
                    was caused by the gangs of convicts awaiting transhipment to the antipodes. They
                    were packed off, however, with all convenient despatch, and the numbers on
                    Government hands in the colonies multiplied exceedingly, causing increasing
                    embarrassment as to their disposal. Moreover, the expense of the Australian
                    convict establishments was enormous, and some change in system was inevitable.
                    These were the conditions that brought about the plan of “assignments,” in other
                    words of freely lending the convicts to any who would relievç the authorities of
                    the burdensome charge. By this time free settlers were arriving in greater
                    number, invited by a different and more liberal policy than that of Governor
                    Macquarie. Inducements were especially offered to persons possessed of capital
                    to venture in the development of the country. Assignment developed rapidly; soon
                    eager competition arose for the convict hands that were at first very
                    reluctantly taken. Great facilities existed for utilizing them on the wide areas
                    of grazing land and on the new stations in the interior. A pastoral life,
                    without temptations and contaminating influences, was well suited for convicts.
                    As the colony grew richer and more populous, other than agricultural employers
                    became assignees, and numerous enterprises were set on foot. The trades and
                    callings which minister to the needs of all civilized communities were more and
                    more largely pursued. There was plenty of work for skilled convicts in the
                    towns, and the services of the more intelligent were highly prized. It was a
                    great boon to secure gratis the assistance of men specially trained as clerks,
                    book-keepers, or handicraftsmen. Hence all manner of intrigues and manoeuvres
                    were set agoing on the arrival of drafts, and there was a scramble for the best
                    hands. Here at once was a flaw in the system of assignment. The lot of the
                    convict was altogether unequal. Some, the dull unlettered and unskilled, were
                    drafted to heavy manual labour at which they remained, while clever and expert
                    rogues found pleasant, congenial, and often profitable employment. The contrast
                    was very marked from the first, but it became the more apparent, the anomaly
                    more monstrous, as time passed on and some were still engaged in unlovely toil
                    while others, who had come out by the same ship, had already attained to
                    affluence and ease. For the latter transportation was no punishment, but often
                    the reverse. It meant too often transfer to a new world under conditions more
                    favourable to success, removed from the keener competition of the old. By adroit
                    management, too, they often obtained the command of funds, the product of
                    nefarious transactions at home, which wives or near relatives or unconvicted
                    accomplices presently brought out to them. It was easy for the free new-comers
                    tô secure the assignment of their convict friends; and the latter, although
                    still nominally servants and in the background, at once assumed the real
                    control. Another system productive of much evil was the employment of convict
                    clerks in positions of trust in various Government offices; convicts did much of
                    the legal work of the colony; a convict was clerk to the attorney-general;
                    others were schoolmasters, and were entrusted with the education of youth.</p>
                <p>Under a system so anomalous and uncertain the main object of transportation as a
                    method of penal discipline and repression was in danger of being quite
                    overlooked. Yet the state could not entirely abdicate its functions, although it
                    suιτendered to a great extent the care of criminals to private persons. It had
                    established a code of penalties for the coercion of the ill-conducted, while it
                    kept the worst, perforce, in its own hands. The master was always at liberty to
                    appeal to the strong arm of the law. A message carried to a neignbouring
                    magistrate, often by the culprit himself, brought down the prompt retribution of
                    the lash. Con- <pb break="no"

                <p>victs might be flogged for petty offences, for idleness, drunkenness, turbulence,
                    absconding, and so forth. At the out-stations some show of decorum and
                    regularity was observed, although the work done was generally scanty, and the
                    convicts were secretly given to all manner of evil courses. The town convicts
                    were worse, because they were far less under control. They were nominally under
                    the surveillance and supervision of the police, which amounted to nothing at
                    all. They came and went, and amused themselves after working hours, so that
                    Sydney and all the large towns were hot-beds of vice and immorality. The masters
                    as a rule made no attempt to watch over their charges; many of them were
                    absolutely unfitted to do so, being themselves of low character, “emancipists”
                    frequently, old convicts pardoned or who had finished their terms. No effort was
                    made to prevent the assignment of convicts to improper persons; every applicant
                    got what he wanted, even though his own character would not bear inspection. All
                    whom the masters could not manage—the incorrigibles upon whom lash and bread and
                    water had been tried in vain—were returned to Government charge. These, in a
                    word, comprised the whole of the refuse of colonial convictdom. Every man who
                    could not agree with his master, or who was to undergo a penalty greater than
                    flogging or less than capital punishment, came back to Government, and was
                    disposed of in one of three ways—the road parties, the chain gangs, or the'penal
                    settlements. The convicts in the first might be kept in the vicinity of the
                    towns or marched about the country according to the work in hand; the labour was
                    irksome, but, owing to inefficient supervision^ never intolerable; the diet was
                    ample, and there was no great restraint upon independence within certain wide
                    limits. To the slackness of control over the road parties was directly traceable
                    the frequent escape of desperadoes, who, defying recapture, recruited the gangs
                    of bushrangers, which were a constant terror to the whole country. In the chain
                    or iron gangs, as they were sometimes styled, discipline was far more vigorous.
                    It was maintained by the constant presence of a military guard, and, when most
                    efficiently organized, was governed by a military officer who was also a
                    magistrate. The work was really hard, the custody close—in hulk, stockaded
                    barrack, or caravan; the first was at Sydney, the second in the interior, the
                    last when the undertaking required constant change of place. All were locked up
                    from sunset to sunrise; all wore heavy leg irons; and all were liable to
                    immediate flagellation. The convict “scourger” was one of the regular officials
                    attached to every chain gang. The third and ultimate receptacle was the penal
                    settlement, to which no offenders were transferred till all other methods of
                    treatment had failed. These were terrible cesspools of iniquity, so bad that it
                    seemed, to use the words of one who knew them well, “the heart of a man who went
                    to them was taken from him and he was given that of a beast.” The horrors
                    accumulated at Norfolk Island, Moreton Bay, Port Arthur, and Tasman’s Peninsula
                    are almost beyond description. The convicts herded together in them grew utterly
                    degraded and brutalized; no wonder that reckless despair took possession of
                    them, that death on the gallows for murder purposely committed, or the slow
                    terror from starvation following escape into surrounding wilds, was often
                    welcomed as a relief.</p>
                <p>The stage which transportation was now reaching, and the actual condition of
                    affairs in the Australian colonies about this period, do not appear to have been
                    much understood in England. Earnest and thoughtful men might busy themselves
                    with prison discipline at home, and the legislature might watch with peculiar
                    interest the results obtained from the special treatment of a limited number of
                    selected offenders in Millbank penitentiary. But for the great mass of
                    criminality deported to a distant shore no very active concern was shown. The
                    country for a long time seemed satisfied with transportation. Portions of the
                    system might be open to criticism. Thus the Commons committee of 1832 freely
                    condemned the hulks at Woolwich and other arsenals in which a large number of
                    convicts were kept while waiting embarkation. The indiscriminate association of
                    prisoners in them produced more vice, profaneness, and demoralization than in
                    the ordinary prisons. After dark the wildest orgies went on in them—dancing,
                    fighting, gambling, singing, and so forth; it was easy to get drink and tobacco,
                    and see friends from outside. The labour hours were short, the tasks light;
                    “altogether the situation of the convict” in the hulks, says the report, “cannot
                    be considered penal; it is a state of restriction, but hardly of punishment.”
                    But this same committee spoke well of transportation, considering it “a most
                    valuable expedient in the system of secondary punishment.” All that it felt
                    necessary to suggest was that exile should be preceded by a period of severe
                    probationary punishment in England, a proposal which was reiterated later on and
                    actually adopted, as we shall see. It was in the country most closely affected
                    that dissatisfaction first began to find voice. Already in 1832 the most
                    reputable sections of Australian society were beginning to find grave fault with
                    transportation. It had fostered the growth of a strong party—that representing
                    convict views— and these were advocated boldly in unprincipled prints. This
                    party, constantly recruited from the emancipists and ticket-of-leave holders,
                    gradually grew very numerous, and threatened soon to swamp the respectable and
                    untainted parts of the community. As years passed the prevalence of crime, and
                    the universally low tone of morality due to the convict element, became more and
                    more noticeable, and created greater disgust. At length, in 1835, Judge Burton
                    raised a loud protest, and in a charge to the grand jury of Sydney plainly
                    intimated that transportation must cease. While it existed, he said, the
                    colonies could never rise to their proper position; they could not claim free
                    institutions; in a word, Australia suffered in its whole moral aspect. This bold
                    but forcible language commanded attention. It was speedily echoed in England,
                    and by none more eloquently than Archbishop Whately, who logically argued that
                    transportation failed in all the leading requisites of any system of secondary
                    punishment. It was not formidable—criminals did not dread it; it was not
                    corrective, but tended obviously to produce further moral debasement; it was not
                    cheap—on the contrary it entailed great outlay without bringing any adequate
                    returns. In the first most important object it had certainly failed.
                    Transportation exercised no salutary terror in offenders; it was no longer exile
                    to an unknown inhospitable region, but to one flowing with milk and honey,
                    whither innumerable friends and associates had gone already. There was every
                    chance of doing well in the new country. The most glowing descriptions came back
                    of the wealth which any clever fellow might easily amass; stories were told and
                    names mentioned of those who had made ample fortunes in Australia in a few
                    years. As a matter of fact the convicts, or at least large numbers of them, had
                    prospered exceedingly. Some had incomes of twenty, thirty, even forty thousand
                    pounds a year. They owned shops and farms and public houses and ships, drove in
                    carriages, and kept up grand establishments. It could be no great punishment to
                    be put within reach of such advantages. As regarded the deteriorating effects of
                    the system, these were plainly manifest on the surface from the condition of the
                    colony—the profligacy of the towns, the leniency shown to crimes and those who
                    had committed them. Down below, in the depths where the dregs rankled
                    perpetually, in the openly sanctioned slavery called assignment, in the
                    demoralizing chain gangs, and in the inexpressibly horrible penal settlements,
                    were more abundant and more awful proofs of' the general wickedness and
                    corruption. Moreover, these appalling results were accompanied by a vast
                    expenditure. The cost of the colonial convict establishments, with the passages
                    out, amounted annually to upwards of £300,000; another hundred thousand was
                    expended on the military garrisons; and various items brought the whole outlay
                    to about half a million per annum. It may be argued that this was not a heavy
                    price to pay for peopling a continent and laying the foundations of our vast
                    Australasian empire. But that empire could never have expanded to its present
                    dimensions if it had depended on convict immigration alone. There was a point,
                    too, at which all development, all progress, would have come to a full stop had
                    it not been relieved of its stigma as a penal colony.</p>
                <p>That point was reached between 1835 and 1840, when a powerful party came into
                    existence in New South Wales, pledged to procure the abandonment of
                    transportation. A strongly hostile feeling was also gaining ground in England.
                    In 1837 a new committee of the House of Commons had made a patient and searching
                    investigation into the merits and demerits of the system, and freely condemned
                    it. The Government had no choice but to give way; it could not ignore the
                    protest of the colonists backed up by such an authoritative expression of
                    opinion. In 1840 orders were issued to suspend the deportation of criminals to
                    New South Wales. But what was to become of the convicts? It was impossible to
                    keep them at home. The hulks, which might have served, had also failed; the
                    faultiness of their internal management had been fully proved. The committee
                    last mentioned had recommended the erection of more penitentiaries. But the
                    costly experiment of Millbank had been barren of results. The model prison at
                    Bentonville, now in process of construction under the pressure of a movement
                    towards prison reform, could offer but limited accommodation. A proposal was put
                    forward to construct convict barracks in the vicinity of the great arsenals; but
                    this, which contained really the germ of the present British penal system, was
                    premature. The Government in this dilemma steered a middle course, and resolved
                    to adhere to transportation, but under a greatly modified and, it was hoped,
                    much improved form. The colony of Van Diemen’s Land, younger and less
                    self-reliant than its neighbour, had also endured convict immigration, but had
                    made no protest. It was resolved to direct the whole stream of deportation upon
                    Van Diemen’s Land, which was thus constituted one vast colonial prison. The main
                    principle of the new system was one of probation; hence its name. All convicts
                    were to pass through various stages and degrees of punishment according to their
                    conduct and character. Some general depot was needed where the necessary
                    observation could be made, and it was found at Millbank penitentiary. Thence
                    boys were sent to the prison for juveniles at Parkhurst; the most promising
                    subjects <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n775/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0775-0752"/> among the adults were selected to undergo the
                    experimental discipline of solitude and separation at Pentonville; less hopeful
                    cases went to the hulks; and all adults alike passed on to the antipodes. Fresh
                    stages awaited the convict on his arrival at Van Diemen’s Land. The first was
                    limited to “lifers” and colonial convicts sentenced a second time. It consisted
                    in detention at one of the penal stations, either Norfolk Island or Tasman’s
                    Peninsula, where the disgraceful conditions already described continued
                    unchanged to the very last. The second stage received the largest number, who
                    were subjected in it to gang labour, working under restraint in various parts of
                    the colony. These probation stations, as they were called, were intended to
                    inculcate habits of industry and subordination; they were provided with
                    supervisors and religious instructors; and, had they not been soon tainted by
                    the vicious virus brought to them by others arriving from the penal stations,
                    they might have answered their purpose for a time. But they became as bad as the
                    worst of the penal settlements, and contributed greatly to the deplorable
                    breakdown of the whole system. The third stage, and the first step towards
                    freedom, was the concession of a pass which permitted the convict to be at large
                    under certain conditions to seek work for himself; the fourth was a
                    ticket-of-leave, the possession of which allowed him to come and go much as he
                    pleased; the fifth, and last, was absolute pardon, with the prospects of
                    rehabilitation.</p>
                <p>This scheme seemed admirable on paper; yet it failed completely when put into
                    practice. Colonial resources were quite unable to bear the pressure. Within two
                    or three years Van Diemen’s Land was fairly inundated with convicts. Sixteen
                    thousand were sent out in four years; the average annual draft in the colony was
                    about thirty thousand, and this when there were only thirty-seven thousand free
                    settlers. Half the whole number of convicts remained in Government hands, and
                    were kept in the probation gangs, engaged upon public works of great utility;
                    but the other half, pass-holders and ticket-of-leave men in a state of
                    semi-freedom, could get little or no employment. The supply greatly exceeded the
                    demand; there were no hirers of labour. Had the colony been as large and as
                    prosperous as its neighbour it could scarcely have absorbed the mass of workmen;
                    but it was really on the verge of bankruptcy—its finances were embarrassed, its
                    trades and industries at a standstill. But not only were the convicts idle; they
                    were utterly depraved. It was soon found that the system which kept large bodies
                    always together had a most pernicious effect upon their moral condition. “The
                    congregation of criminals in large batches without adequate supervision meant
                    simply wholesale widespread pollution,” as was said at the time. These
                    ever-present and constantly increasing evils forced the Government to reconsider
                    its position; and in 1846 transportation to Van Diemen’s Land was temporarily
                    suspended for a couple of years, during which it was hoped some relief might be
                    afforded. The formation of a new convict colony, in North Australia had been
                    contemplated; but the project, warmly espoused by Mr Gladstone, then under
                    secretary of state for the colonies, was presently abandoned; and it now became
                    clear that no resumption of transportation was possible.</p>
                <p>Some fresh scheme had to be devised, and that without delay. The task fell upon
                    Sir George Grey as home secretary, who, in dealing with it laid the foundations
                    of the present British penal system. This system was to consist (1) of a limited
                    period of separate confinement in a home prison or penitentiary, accompanied by
                    industrial employment and moral training · (2) of hard labour at some public
                    works prison either at home or abroad; and (3) of exile to a colony with a
                    conditional pardon or ticket-of-leave. No pains were spared to give effect to
                    this plan as soon as it was decided upon. Pentonville was available for the
                    first phase; Millbank was also pressed into the service, and accommodation was
                    hired in some of the best provincial prisons, as at Wakefield, Leicester, and
                    elsewhere. Few facilities existed for carrying out the second stage, but they
                    were speedily improvised. Although the hulks at home had been condemned, convict
                    establishments in which these floating prisons still formed the principal part
                    were organized at Bermuda and Gibraltar. Neither of these, it may be stated at
                    once, was a conspicuous success; they were too remote for effective supervision;
                    and, although they lingered on for some years, they were finally condemned. The
                    chief efforts of the authorities were directed to the formation of public works
                    prisons at home, and here the most satisfactory results were soon obtained. The
                    construction of a harbour of refuge at Portland had been recommended in 1845; in
                    1847 an Act was passed to facilitate the purchase of land there, and a sum of
                    money taken up in the estimates for the erection of a prison, which was
                    commenced next year. At another point Dartmoor, a prison already, stood
                    available, although it had not been occupied since the last war, when ten
                    thousand French and American prisoners had been incarcerated in it. A little
                    reconstruction made Dartmoor into a modern jail, and in the waste lands around
                    there was ample labour for any number of convict hands. Dartmoor was opened in
                    1850; two years later a convict prison was established at Portsmouth in
                    connexion with the dockyard, and another of the same class at Chatham in 1856.
                    The works undertaken at these various stations were of national importance, and
                    the results obtained extremely valuable, as will presently be shown. The
                    usefulness of these public works prisons and the need for their development soon
                    . became apparent. Although the authorities still clung to the principle of
                    transportation, that punishment grew more and more difficult to inflict. The
                    third stage in Sir George Grey’s scheme contemplated the enforced emigration of
                    released convicts, whom the discipline of separation and public works was
                    supposed to have purged and purified, and who would have better hopes of
                    entering on a new career of honest industry in a new country than when thrown
                    back among vicious associations at home. The theory was good, the practice
                    difficult. No colony would accept these ticket-of-leave men as a gift. Van
                    Diemen’s Land, hitherto submissive, rebelled, and positively refused to receive
                    them, even though this denial cut off the supply of labour, now urgently needed.
                    Other colonies were no less resolute in their opposition. The appearance of a
                    convict ship at the Cape of Good Hope nearly produced a revolt. Athough Earl
                    Grey addressed a circular to all colonial Governments, offering them the
                    questionable boon of transportation, only one, the comparatively new colony of
                    Western Australia, responded in the affirmative. But this single receptacle
                    could not absorb a tithe of the whole number of convicts awaiting exile. It
                    became necessary therefore to find some other means for the disposal of those so
                    rapidly accumulating at home. Accordingly, in 1853 the first Penal Servitude Act
                    was passed, substituting certain shorter sentences of penal servitude for
                    transportation. It was only just to abbreviate the terms; under the old sentence
                    the transportée knew that if well conducted he would spend the greater part of
                    it in the comparative freedom of exile. But, although sentences were shortened,
                    it was not thought safe to surrender all control over the released convict; and
                    he was only granted a ticket-of-leave for the unexpired portion of his original
                    sentence. But no effective supervision was maintained over these convicts at
                    large. They speedily relapsed into crime; their numbers, as the years passed,
                    became so great, and their depredations so serious, especially in garotte
                    robberies, that a cry of indignation, led by general alarm, was raised against
                    the system which exposed society to such dangers. There was a vague desire to
                    return to transportation—to rid the country once more, by removal to far-off
                    points, of the criminals who preyed upon it. The usual panacea for all public
                    grievances was presently tried, and the system with which Sir Joshua Jebb’s name
                    had come to be identified was arraigned before a select committee of the House
                    of Commons in 1863.</p>
                <p>Before reviewing the report of this committee, it will be well to retrace our
                    steps and examine the phases through which prison discipline had passed since
                    1836. We left this, which embraces the preliminary stages of secondary
                    punishment, at a date when public attention was very generally drawn to it. The
                    true object of penal treatment had begun to be understood, and keen controversy
                    had arisen as to the best methods for securing it. This <pb break="no"

                <p>object, broadly stated, was to compass the reformation of the convicted offender
                    and at the same time deter others from crime. The chief experiments in this
                    direction had been made in the United States, where two remarkable systems of
                    penal discipline had for some time been in operation. Each had its warm
                    supporters and friends. One had originated with the Quakers of Pennsylvania,
                    who, as far back as 1786, had abolished capital punishment and all other purely
                    personal penalties, and had subjected all offenders instead to solitary
                    confinement without occupation for mind or body. This, as developed in the years
                    following, became the purely solitary system, and was the first of the two
                    methods mentioned above. The idea, although not absolutely new, having been
                    already accepted in the United Kingdom both in the Gloucester penitentiary and
                    the Glasgow bridewell, was hailed with enthusiasm as a solution of all
                    difficulties of prison treatment. Many other States in the Union followed the
                    lead of Pennsylvania. That of New York built the great Auburn penitentiary in
                    1816 to carry out the new principles. There every prisoner was kept continuously
                    in complete isolation. He saw no one, spoke to no one, and did no work. But
                    within a short period very deplorable results began to show themselves at
                    Auburn. Many prisoners became insane; health was impaired, and life greatly
                    endangered. Mr Crawfurd, whose mission to the United States has been already
                    referred to, was in favour of solitary confinement, but he could not deny that
                    several cases of suicide followed this isolation. Some relaxation of the
                    disastrous severity seemed desirable, and out of this grew the second great
                    system, which was presently introduced at Auburn, and afterwards at the no less
                    renowned prison of Sing Sing. It was called the silent system. While the
                    prisoners were still separated at night or meals, they were suffered to labour
                    in association, but under a rule of silence ruthlessly and rigorously
                    maintained. The latter, entrusted to irresponsible subordinates, degenerated
                    into a despotism which brought the system into great discredit. All discipline
                    officers were permitted to wield the whip summarily and without the slightest
                    check. “The quantity of punishment,” says Mr Crawfurd, “is entirely dependent on
                    the will of the overseers, against whose acts there is no appeal.” Under such a
                    system the most frightful excesses were possible, and many cases of brutal
                    cruelty were laid bare. Reviewing the merits and demerits of each system, Mr
                    Crawfurd gave in his adhesion to that of unvarying solitude as pursued in the
                    Eastern Penitentiary in Pennsylvania. “I have no hesitation in declaring my
                    conviction,” he says, “that its discipline is a safe and efficacious mode of
                    prison management”; of the opposite system, that of Auburn, he reports that,
                    notwithstanding the order and regularity with which its discipline was enforced,
                    “its effects were greatly overrated.”</p>
                <p>Mr Crawfurd came back from the United States an ardent champion of the solitary
                    system. To use his own words, “so greatly does increasing experience prove the
                    importance of solitude in the management of prisons that I could not, if
                    circumstances admitted, too strongly advocate its application in Great Britain,
                    for every class of offenders as well as for persons before trial, under
                    modifications which would divest seclusion of its harshest character.” He saw
                    great difficulties in making this the universal rule, chief among which was the
                    enormous expense of providing suitable prisons. Some modification of the rule of
                    unbroken solitude would be inevitable; but he strongly urged its adoption for
                    certain classes, and he was equally convinced of the imperative necessity for
                    giving every prisoner a separate sleeping cell. It is clear that the Government
                    endorsed Mr Crawfurd’s views. Where it was possible they gave effect to them at
                    once. At Millbank, with its spacious solitary cells, the rule of seclusion was
                    more and more strictly enforced under the supervision of a reverend governor,
                    also a warm partisan of the system. Ere long permissive legislation strove to
                    disseminate the new principles. In 1830 Lord John Russell had given it as his
                    opinion that cellular separation was desirable in all prisons. But it was not
                    until 1839 that an Act was passed which laid it down that individuals might be
                    confined separately and apart in single cells. Even now the executive did not
                    insist upon the construction of prisons on a new plan. It only set a good
                    example by undertaking the erection of one which should serve as a model for the
                    whole country. In 1840 the first stone of Bentonville prison was laid; and,
                    after three years of very considerable outlay, its cells, 520 in number, were
                    occupied on the solitary, or more exactly the separate, system,—the latter being
                    somewhat less rigorous and irksome in its restraints. To the credit of many
                    local j urisdictions, they speedily followed the lead of the central authority.
                    Within half a dozen years no less than fifty-four new prisons were built on the
                    Bentonville plan, which now began to serve generally as a “model” for imitation,
                    not in England alone, but all over the world. That able administrator Sir Joshua
                    Jebb, who presided over its erection, may fairly claim indeed to be the author
                    and originator of modern prison architecture.</p>
                <p>Other jurisdictions were less prompt to recognize their responsibilities, the
                    city of London among the number. They were satisfied with small makeshifts and
                    modifications, without entering upon that complete and radical reconstruction
                    which could alone meet the case. From this inertness there followed a lamentable
                    want of uniformity in the administration of legal penalties. Criminals suffered
                    more or less punishment according to the locality in which they were
                    incarcerated. Dietaries differed—here too high, there too low. The amount of
                    exercise allowed varied greatly; there was no universal rule as to employment.
                    In some prisons hard labour was insisted upon, and embraced treadwheels or the
                    newly invented cranks; in others it was industrial, devoted to manufactures;
                    while in some it did not exist at all. The cells inhabited by prisoners (and
                    separate cellular confinement was now very general) were of different
                    dimensions,—variously lighted, warmed, and ventilated. The time spent in these
                    cells was not invariably the same, and as yet no authoritative decision had been
                    made between the solitary and silent systems. The first-named had been tried at
                    Bentonville, but the period for which it was deemed possible had been greatly
                    reduced. The duration had been at first fixed at eighteen months, but it was
                    incontestably proved that the prisoners’ minds had become enfeebled by this long
                    isolation, and the period was limited to nine months. In many jurisdictions,
                    however, the silent system, or that of associated labour in silence, was still
                    preferred; and there might be prisons within a short distance of each other at
                    which two entirely different systems of discipline were in force. In 1849 Mr
                    Charles Bearson, M.B., moved for a select committee to report upon the best
                    means of securing some uniform system which should be at once punitive,
                    reformatory, and self-supporting. He urged that all existing plans were
                    inefficacious, and he advocated a new scheme by which the labour of all
                    prisoners should be applied to agriculture in district prisons. The result of a
                    full inquiry was the reiteration of views already accepted in theory, but not
                    yet generally adopted in practice. The committee recommended separation, so long
                    as it was conducted under proper safeguards; it animadverted upon the great
                    variety which still existed in prison discipline and the construction of jails
                    and strongly urged the legislature to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n777/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0777-0754"/> entrust full powers to some central authority who
                    would exact adherence to the rules laid down. Thirteen more years elapsed and
                    still no such steps had been taken. A new committee sat in 1863, and in its
                    report again remarked, and in no measured terms, upon the many and wide
                    differences that still existed in the jails of Great Britain as regards
                    construction, diet, labour, and general discipline, “leading to an inequality,
                    uncertainty, and inefficiency of punishment productive of the most prejudicial
                    results.” Even yet separation was not universal; labour, dietaries,
                    education—everything varied still. Matters could only be mended by the exercise
                    of legislative authority, and this came in the Prison Act of 1865, an Act which
                    consolidated all previous statutes on the subject of prison discipline, many of
                    its provisions being still in force. It promulgated minute and precise
                    regulations on every item of prison management, and backed them up with pains
                    and penalties that ought to have ensured attention. Yet the years passed and
                    uniformity was still far from secured; it was impossible, indeed, while prison
                    administration was still left to a number of local authorities, no two of which
                    were often of the same mind. Great varieties of practice still obtained. The
                    number of feet ascended at hard labour on the treadwheel differed in different
                    districts; each jurisdiction still pleased itself as to dietaries; and it was
                    still, as of old, a mere accident of locality whether imprisonment was light or
                    heavy. The legislature had tried its best, but its best had failed. It had
                    exercised some supervision through its inspectors, had forbidden cells to be
                    used until duly certified as fit, had threatened to withhold exchequer
                    contributions from prisons of which unfavourable reports were received. Such
                    penalties had exercised no sufficient terrors. It began to be understood,
                    moreover, that the prisons under local jurisdictions were not always
                    conveniently and economically situated. In one district there might be too many,
                    in another not enough; one prison was empty and its neighbour full to
                    overflowing; yet there was no power to make transfers and equalize
                    accommodation. All this produced excessive, even wasteful, expenditure. Nor was
                    its incidence, under altered conditions, exactly fair. Crime, with the many
                    facilities offered for rapid locomotion to those who committed it, had ceased to
                    be merely local, and the whole state rather than individual communities ought to
                    be taxed; prison charges should be borne by the exchequer, and not by local
                    rates. These considerations gained strength, and led at length to the
                    introduction of the Prison Bill which became law in 1877, and which is the last
                    Act passed for the regulation of prisons. By the Act of 1877 the control of all
                    jails was vested in a body of prison commissioners appointed by, and responsible
                    to, the home secretary. These commissioners had power to consolidate by closing
                    superfluous prisons, to establish one system of discipline, and generally by
                    watchful supervision, aided by the experience of specialists, to maintain that
                    much desired uniformity which had been so long and unsuccessfully sought. At the
                    same time the co-operation of the local magistrates was invited so far as advice
                    and assistance were concerned; but all real power and control had passed from
                    their hands into that of the commissioners of prisons. The system established by
                    the Act of 1877 is that now in force, and we shall recur to it directly, in
                    recapitulating the whole of our present method of secondary punishment.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile considerable changes had been introduced into penal servitude, the
                    punishment reserved for the gravest offences. We left this branch of the subject
                    at a date (1863) when its efficiency was about to be tested by a parliamentary
                    inquiry. The verdict given was in the main satisfactory; but doubts were
                    expressed as to the severity of the discipline inflicted, the principal features
                    of which were moderate labour, ample diet, and substantial gratuities. The first
                    was far less than the work free men did for a livelihood, the second larger, the
                    third excessive, so that convicts often left prison with thirty, forty, even
                    eighty pounds in their pockets. Penal servitude, to use the words of the lord
                    chief justice, Sir Alexander Cockburn, one of the members of the committee, “was
                    hardly calculated to produce on the mind of the criminal that salutary dread of
                    the recurrence of the punishment which may be the means of deterring him, and
                    through his example others, from the commission of crime.” The chief
                    recommendations put forward to mend the system comprised lengthening of all
                    sentences, a diminution in the dietaries, the abolition of large gratuities,
                    and, speaking broadly, a general tightening of the reins. The most notable
                    change, however, was in regard to labour, the quantity and value of which was to
                    be regulated in future by the so-called “mark system.” This plan had originated
                    with Captain Maconochie, at one time superintendent in Norfolk Island, who had
                    recommended that the punishment inflicted upon criminals should be measured, not
                    by time, but by the amount of labour actually performed. In support of his
                    theory he devised an ingenious system of recording the convicts’ daily industry
                    by marks, which on reaching a given total would entitle them to their release.
                    The mark system had already been tried with good results in Ireland, where the
                    Irish system, as it was called, introduced by Sir Walter Crofton had attracted
                    widespread attention from the extraordinary success which seemed to follow it.
                    There had been a very marked diminution in crime, attributable it was supposed
                    to the system, which was in almost all respects the same as the English,
                    although the Irish authorities had invented an “intermediate stage” in which
                    convicts worked in a state of semi-freedom, and thus practised the self-reliance
                    which in many superinduced reform. As a matter of fact the diminution in crime
                    was traceable to general causes, such as a general exodus by emigration, the
                    introduction of a poor law, and an increase in the facilities for earning an
                    honest livelihood. It may be added here that, judged by later experience, the
                    Irish system has evinced no transcendent merits, and it is now (1885) moribund.
                    But we owe something to the Irish practice which first popularized the idea of
                    maintaining a strict supervision over convicts in a state of conditional
                    release, and it reconciled us to a system which was long wrongfully stigmatized
                    as espionage. The mark system, as recommended by the committee of 1863, and as
                    subsequently introduced, had, however, little in common with either Maconochie’s
                    or the Irish plan. It was similar in principle, and that was all. According to
                    the committee every convict should have it in his power to earn a remission—in
                    other words, to shorten his sentence by his industry. This industry was to be
                    measured by marks, earned by hard labour at the public works, after a short
                    probational term of close “separate” confinement. But the remission gained did
                    not mean absolute release. All males were to be sent, during the latter part of
                    their sentences, “without disguise to a thinly peopled colony,” to work out
                    (heir time and their own rehabilitation. The committee, it will be seen, still
                    clung to the old theory of transportation, and this in spite of the lively
                    protests of some of its members. The one outlet remaining, however, that of
                    Western Australia, was soon afterwards (1867) closed to convict emigrants; and
                    this part of the committee’s recommendations became a dead letter. Not so the
                    mark system, or the plan of earning remission by steady industry. This was
                    carried out on a broad and intelligent basis by officials prompt to avail
                    themselves of the advantages it offered; a readiness <pb break="no"

                <p>to move with the times, to adopt suggestions tending towards improvement, and
                    generally to benefit by external advice and experience, has always characterized
                    convict prison administration in recent years. Remedies have been at once
                    applied where flaws were found. Thus in 1877-78 efforts were made to minimize
                    contamination by segregating the worst criminals, and restricting conversation
                    at exercise. Again, the recommendation of the latest commission of inquiry, that
                    of 1878-79, tending in the same direction was immediately adopted, and a special
                    class was formed in 1880 in which all convicts “not versed in crime,” first
                    offenders or at least comparatively innocent men, are now kept apart from the
                    older and more hardened criminals. While these concessions have been cheerfully
                    made, the stern necessities of a penal system have been rigorously maintained.
                    The committee last quoted gave it as their opinion that “penal servitude as at
                    present administered is on the whole satisfactory; it is effective as a
                    punishment and free from serious abuses; a sentence of penal servitude is now
                    generally an object of dread to the criminal population.” This change is
                    ascribed to the various improvements introduced —“longer sentences, spare diet,
                    and generally a more strict enforcement of work and discipline.”</p>
                <p>Having thus traced the history of secondary punishments and prison discipline in
                    England from the earliest times to the present day, it will be well to describe
                    briefly the system of penal repression as now actually in force. This will best
                    be effected by following those who break the law through all stages from that of
                    arrest, through conviction, to release, conditional or complete. After a short
                    detention in a police cell—places of durance which still need improvement — an
                    offender, unless disposed of summarily, passes into one of Her Majesty’s local
                    prisons, there to await his trial at sessions or assizes. The period thus spent
                    in the provinces will never exceed three months; in London, with the frequent
                    sittings at Werken well and of the Central Criminal Court, it is seldom more
                    than one month. While awaiting trial the prisoner may wear his own clothes,
                    provide his own food, see and communicate with his friends and legal adviser, so
                    as to prepare fully for his defence. His fate after conviction depends on his
                    sentence. If this be imprisonment, so called to distinguish it from penal
                    servitude, although both mean deprivation of liberty and are closely akin, it is
                    undergone in one of the “local” prisons—the prisons till 1878 under local
                    jurisdiction, but now entirely controlled by the state through the home
                    secretary and the commissioners of prisons. The régime undergone is cellular;
                    able-bodied prisoners are kept in strict separation for at least one month, and
                    during that time subjected to first-class hard labour, which is purely penal in
                    character; and nowadays, under the uniform system introduced by the
                    commissioners, consists of the treadwheel, in which each individual ascends 8640
                    feet in a day’s work, or six hours’ work on cranks or hard labour machines is
                    exacted where there are no treadwheels; and the labour, whether of treadwheel or
                    crank, is generally utilized as the motive power for grinding corn or pumping
                    water for prison use. Beating oakum with a heavy beater and mat-making with
                    heavy implements are also considered first-class hard labour. Ä system of
                    progressive stages not unlike the mark system has been adopted in the local
                    prisons, and the prisoner’s progress through each depends on his own industry
                    and good conduct. During the first month he sleeps on a plank bed, a wooden
                    frame raised from the floor, with bedding but without mattress. When he has
                    earned the proper number of marks, which at the earliest cannot be until one
                    month has elapsed, he passes into the second stage, and is allowed better diet,
                    and a mattress twice a week. The third stage, at the end of the third month,
                    gives him further privileges as regards diet and bed. The fourth stage concedes
                    to the prisoner a mattress every night, and the privilege, if well conducted, to
                    communicate by letter or through visits with his friends outside. These stages
                    are applicable to females except as regards the plank bed; while youths under
                    sixteen and old men above sixty are also allowed mattresses. A small gratuity
                    may be earned during the second and three following stages, amounting in the
                    aggregate to ten shillings. The labour, too, may be industrial, and include
                    instruction in tailoring, shoemaking, basket-making, book-binding, printing, and
                    many more handicrafts. Throughout the sentence the prisoner has the advantage of
                    religious and moral instruction; he attends divine service regularly and
                    according to his creed, is visited by the chaplain, and receives educational
                    assistance according to his needs. His physical welfare is watched over by
                    competent medical men; close attention is paid to the sanitary condition of
                    prisons; strict rules govern the size of the cells, with their lighting,
                    warming, and ventilation. Dietaries are everywhere the same; they are calculated
                    with great nicety according to the terms of durance, and afford variety and
                    ample nutrition without running into excess. In a word, as regards discipline,
                    labour, treatment, exactly the same system obtains throughout the United Kingdom
                    from Bodmin to the far north, from Cork to Belfast.</p>
                <p>Where the sentence passes beyond two years it ceases to be styled imprisonment
                    and becomes penal servitude, which may be inflicted for any period from five
                    years to life. The prisoner becomes a convict, and undergoes his penalty in one
                    or more of the convict prisons. These are entirely under state management. A
                    sentence of penal servitude, as now administered, consists of three distinct
                    periods or stages :—(1) that of probation endured in separate confinement · at a
                    so-called “close” prison; (2) a period of labour in association at a public
                    works prison; and (3) conditional release for the unexpired portion of the
                    sentence upon licence or ticket-of-leave. (1) In the first stage, which is
                    limited to nine months for reasons already given, the convict passes his whole
                    time in his cell apart from other prisoners, engaged at some industrial
                    employment. He exercises and goes to chapel daily in the society of others, but
                    holds no communication with them; his only intercourse with his fellow creatures
                    is when he is visited by the governor, chaplain, schoolmaster, or trade
                    instructor. This period of almost unbroken solitude, when the mind, thrown in on
                    itself, is supposed to be peculiarly open to lessons of admonition and warning,
                    is one of severely penal character, and its duration has therefore been wisely
                    limited. It is deemed, moreover, that perpetual seclusion in a cell is an
                    artificial state of existence, that its infliction for long terms would
                    altogether unfit an offender for a return to the ordinary conditions of daily
                    life. (2) The second is a longer stage, and endures for the whole or a greater
                    part of the remainder of the sentence,—its duration being governed by the power
                    a convict holds in his own hands to earn a remission. It is passed at a public
                    works prison,—either at Borstal, Chatham, Chattenden, Portsmouth, Portland,
                    Dartmoor, or (for the present) Wormwood Scrubs. While cellular separation,
                    except at work, at prayers, or exercise, is strictly maintained, labour is in
                    association under the close and constant supervision of officials.
                    Intercommunication no doubt takes place; men working together in quarry,
                    brickfield, or barrow-run, and out of earshot of their guardians, may and do
                    converse at times. But the work is too arduous to allow of long and desultory
                    conversation; while the chance of mutual contamination is now minimized by the
                    separation of the less <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n779/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0779-0756"/> hardened from the old offenders in the manner
                    already pointed out. There is no reason to suppose that any great evils result
                    from this association, and without it the execution of the many important
                    national public works which now attest its value would have been impossible.
                    Among these may be mentioned the following :—the quarrying of stone for the
                    great Portland breakwater, which is nearly 2 miles in length, and between 50 and
                    60 feet deep in the sea, with the defensive works on the Verne, batteries,
                    casemates, and barracks intended to render the island of Portland impregnable,
                    and the enlargement and extension of the dockyards at Chatham and Portsmouth; at
                    the former three grand basins 20, 21, and 28 acres respectively in extent have
                    been completed on the marshy lands and reaches of the Medway, and at the latter
                    extensive operations of the same kind have long been in progress. At Borstal a
                    line of forts intended to protect Chatham on the southern and western side are
                    being erected by convicts; they are also building magazines at Chattenden on the
                    left bank of the Medway; they will soon be at work at Dover on the vast
                    improvements for the enlargement of the harbour and port. Besides this, convict
                    labour has been usefully employed in the erection of prison buildings at new
                    points or in extension c f those at the old; at Borstal cells for five hundred,
                    and at Wormwood Scrubs for ten hundred and fifty-two have been built, with
                    chapel, quarters, hospitals, and so forth; large additions have been made to the
                    prisons of Woking, Pentonville, Chatham, Portsmouth, Dartmoor, Parkhurst, and
                    Brixton. In all cases the bricks have been made, the stone quarried and dressed,
                    the timber sawn, the iron cast, forged, and wrought by the prisoners; only one
                    article was bought ready made, and that was the locks. The great merit of this
                    system is the skill acquired in handicrafts by so many otherwise idle and
                    useless hands. Convict mechanics are rarely found ready made. A return dated
                    July 1882 shows that 82 per cent, of the total number employed at trades had
                    learnt them in prison. These results are no doubt greatly aided by the judicious
                    stimulus given to the highest effort by the mark system. The chief objection to
                    enforced labour has been the difficulty in ensuring this; but the convict
                    nowadays eagerly tries his best, because only thus can he win privileges while
                    in prison and an earlier release from it. Every day’s work is gauged, and marks
                    recorded according to its value; upon the total earned depend his passage
                    through the stages or classes which regulate his diet and general treatment, and
                    more especially his interviews and communications with his relations and
                    friends. Yet more; steady willing labour continuously performed will earn a
                    remission of a fourth of the sentence, less the time spent in separate
                    confinement. It must be borne in mind that the marks thus earned may be
                    forfeited at any time by misconduct, but only to this extent does conduct affect
                    remission, and the latter is really directly dependent upon industry. The full
                    remission in a five years’ sentence is one year and twenty-three days; in seven
                    years, one year two hundred and seventy-three days; in fourteen, three years one
                    hundred and eighty-one days; in twenty, four years eighty-six days. “Lifers”
                    cannot claim any remission, but their cases are brought forward at the end of
                    twenty years, and then considered on their merits. (3) Having earned his
                    remission, the convict enters upon the third stage of his punishment. He is
                    released, but only conditionally, on licence or ticket-of-leave. This permission
                    to be at large may easily be forfeited. Stringent conditions are endorsed upon
                    the licence, and well known to every licence holder. He has to produce the
                    licence when called upon; he must not break the law, nor associate with
                    notoriously bad characters, nor lead an idle dissolute life, without visible
                    means of obtaining an honest livelihood. The observance of these rules is
                    enforced by the police, to whom Acts known as the Prevention of Crimes Acts give
                    large powers. The licence holder is ordered to report himself at intervals to
                    the police, to whom also he must notify any change in his place of residence; he
                    must take care that he is not found in any suspicious locality under suspicious
                    circumstances. A breach of the regulations may entail the forfeiture of the
                    licence, with imprisonment and the obligation to return to a convict prison to
                    serve out the unexpired term of penal servitude. Police supervision by special
                    sentence of a court may be extended in the case of habitual criminals to longer
                    periods than that of the original sentence. An elaborate machinery also exists
                    for the registration of these habitual criminals, and voluminous official
                    records are regularly published and circulated giving detailed information,
                    distinctive marks, and previous history, to enable the police in all parts of
                    the country to identify habitual criminals. A system so rigorous towards
                    offenders who have already expiated their crimes may be deemed to bear heavily
                    on any who have repented of their evil ways and are anxious to turn over a new
                    leaf. To be ever subjected to the intrusive watchfulness of the myrmidons of the
                    law must often increase the licence holder’s difficulty of leading an honest
                    life. The struggle is often severe; employers of labour are not too ready to
                    accept the services of “jail birds,” and free workmen often resent the admission
                    of an old convict amongst their number. Private charity has happily come forward
                    to diminish or remove this hardship, and many societies have been called into
                    existence for the special purpose of assisting discharged prisoners. The first
                    of these, now honoured with the title of “Royal,” was organized in 1856, and had
                    assisted, up to 1879, some eleven thousand prisoners. This society labours
                    chiefly in the metropolis; it is supported by private subscriptions, but it has
                    control also over the gratuities of the licensees who accept its aid. The
                    prisoners on release are first examined at the society’s office as to their
                    prospects and wishes; they are given some pocket money out of their own
                    gratuities; and their “liberty clothing,” a present from the prison, is changed
                    for more suitable clothes. They are then placed in respectable lodging-houses
                    until in due course employment is obtained for them, after which the society
                    undertakes the reporting to the police, and by its own agents exercises a
                    watchful care over its protégés. There are now upwards of twenty societies
                    established in various parts of the country, and the number is rapidly
                    increasing.</p>
                <p>The foregoing system is applicable more particularly to adult males; but for
                    females the rules are much the same as regards imprisonment and penal servitude.
                    But the remission a female convict can earn is greater, and amounts to a third
                    of the sentence, less the separate confinement. Moreover, female convicts whose
                    conduct and character warrant a hope of complete amendment are admitted into
                    “refuges” nine months before the date of their conditional release on leave.
                    There are two of these refuges, which are more like “homes” than prisons,—the
                    Westminster Memorial Refuge at Streatham for Protestants, and the East End
                    House, Finchley, for Roman Catholics. The training of these refuges is
                    calculated to fit the licensee for more complete freedom, and many of the women
                    who go from them into the world do well. The aid societies also help effectually
                    in obtaining situations, often very good ones, for the released female
                    convicts.</p>
                <p>Juvenile criminals are now subjected to special treatment. Young offenders,
                    although liable to be treated as adults by the court before which they are
                    brought, are generally dealt with summarily under various powers, <pb break="no"

                    or, in the case of a child, of the parent or guardian. The discretionary powers
                    of summary courts are wide, ranging in many cases from dismissal (although the
                    charge is proved) to payment of damages and costs, or fine, or limited
                    imprisonment, and in the case of a male child with private whipping either in
                    addition to or instead of any other punishment; and whipping in addition to
                    other punishment may be imposed by all courts on the trial of male offenders
                    under sixteen for the majority of offences. For the very important power of
                    relegating juvenile offenders to reformatory schools and vagrant and neglected
                    children to industrial schools see the separate article, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Reformatory and Industrial Schools</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(ç.v.).</hi></p>
                <p>Juvenile offenders and children while detained in reformatory or industrial
                    schools are not subject to prison discipline, but the rules for the management
                    and discipline of the schools and the detention in them may be enforced by
                    imprisonment. Very beneficial results as regards the diminution of crimes are
                    undoubtedly obtained by various institutions, both public and private. The
                    possible criminal is removed from evil associations while still amenable to
                    better influences; and while still malleable he is taught to labour honestly
                    with his hands. Prison statistics, more especially of the convict prisons, show
                    a marked decrease in the number of youthful offenders in durance, and it is
                    reasonble to suppose that from the causes above mentioned there is a gradual
                    stoppage in the supply. In the ten years between 1871 and 1881 the number in
                    custody of ages between fifteen to twenty-four fell from 2948 to 1957, and this
                    although the general population had increased four millions. The same reduction
                    has shown itself as regards the number of the same ages in local prisons; and it
                    is clear that the improvement is general.</p>
                <p>Uniformity in prison discipline is now general throughout the United Kingdom. The
                    Prisons Act of 1877 also extended to Scotland and Ireland, and in both those
                    countries the system of imprisonment for terms of two years and under has been
                    assimilated to that in force in England. As regards penal servitude, convicts
                    pass through the same stages or periods; but Scottish convicts, after undergoing
                    their separate confinement in the general prison at Perth, have been drafted
                    into the English public works prisons. Of late there has been a movement towards
                    securing some of the advantages of convict labour for works north of the Tweed,
                    and it is probable that harbour works will soon be undertaken at one or more
                    points on the Scottish coast. For Ireland, the progressive periods are passed in
                    that country,—separate confinement in Mountjoy prison, public works at Spike
                    Island. The administration of prisons has also been assimilated in Great Britain
                    and Ireland, and has been centralized in each capital under the •authority of
                    the state. Boards of prison commissioners in London, Edinburgh, and Dublin, and
                    acting under the immediate orders of the executive, control all local prison
                    affairs, including finance, victualling, clothing, the appointment of officers
                    of all grades, and the discipline of prisoners. The English convicts are still
                    managed by an independent board called the directors of convict prisons, but
                    both •commissioners and directors have the same chairman and chief, while the
                    staff of clerks and accountants and storekeepers—in a word, the whole
                    administrative machinery— is identical for both. The welfare of the inmates of
                    all prisons is not, however, left entirely at the discretion of official
                    managers. The local magistracy have still a certain jurisdiction in the local
                    prisons; through elected representatives styled “visiting committees,” they
                    constantly inspect the prisons and exercise supervision over their inmates. They
                    have retained their power to punish and generally deal with all cases of
                    aggravated misconduct. The functions exercised by these visiting committees
                    might seem to constitute a dual authority in prison management. But so far the
                    two powers have worked harmoniously and well. Since 1880 unofficial and unpaid
                    visitors have also been appointed to undertake an independent inspection of the
                    convict prisons. This practice was introduced, not on account of any
                    administrative failure in the system, but as a safeguard against possible
                    abuses, and to strengthen public confidence. These visitors can give no orders,
                    but they are empowered to make full inquiries into the state of the prisoners
                    and the condition and discipline of the prison.</p>
                <p>The sum voted in 1883-84 for convict establishments in England was £414,463, but
                    this includes &lt;£18,100 for expenditure in colonies where a few imperial
                    convicts still survive, and grants in aid of colonial magistrates, police, and
                    jails. The vote for local prisons in the same year was £481,852. The returns
                    from male prisoners’ labour in the convict prisons in 1883-84 amounted to
                    £248,995, Ils. 3d. Of this total, £121,956, 5s. 2d. represented the estimated
                    value, by measurement, of labour on public works, and £42,159, 8s. 4d. more the
                    value of prison buildings erected, while the earnings in manufactures amounted
                    to £37,581, 8s. 8d. The balance was the farm and the work performed for the
                    prisons. The female convicts’ labour amounted in the same year to £9933, 9s.
                    5d., half of which was in washing and manufactures. In the local prisons in
                    England manufactures brought in £39,790, 3s. lid. The value of the labour on
                    prison buildings was £24,510, 4s. 2d., and that in the service of the prisons
                    £59,562, 0s. 8d. The prison vote in Scotland for 1883-84 was £110,170, the
                    returns from earnings £6000; in Ireland the vote was £145,689 and the earnings
                    £4000. The above terms of expenditure include all outlay—staff (superior and
                    subordinate), maintenance, travelling expenses, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Most civilized nations have considered the question of prison discipline from
                    time to time, and have endeavoured, but with varying degrees of earnestness, to
                    conform to accepted modern ideas as to the proper method of dealing with
                    criminals. The subject has also been dealt with at two international congresses,
                    one of which assembled in London in 1873, and the other at Stockholm in 1878,
                    when views were exchanged and matters of much interest discussed. It is proposed
                    now to supplement the foregoing account of British prison discipline by a brief
                    survey of the prison systems in force in the British dependencies and in various
                    other countries'.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">British Colonies and India.—</hi> The prison systems of most of
                    the British colonies have been assimilated as far as possible to that in force
                    in the mother country. In all the larger colonies there are convict prisons and
                    local prisons, and in all cellular separation for the whole or part of the
                    sentence is the rule. This is the ease in the Australian colonies, in Tasmania,
                    andin New Zealand.</p>
                <p>The prison system of Canada is advanced and enlightened. The numbers incarcerated
                    are not great, and crime is not very prevalent. Six establishments suffice for
                    the Dominion—Kingston, St Vincent de Paul (for the province of Quebec), Halifax,
                    Manitoba, British Columbia, and Dorchester. The last-named has replaced that at
                    St John’s. All these are cellular prisons; and they receive prisoners of all
                    categories, for trial and after sentence whatever the term. Females have a
                    special quarter in each prison. Isolation is strictly carried out for all short
                    sentences; but for the longer labour is in association. A great deal of good
                    work is turned out in the Canadian prisons. All the rolling stock for railways
                    in Government hands, iron-work, clothing, and boots and shoes are produced at
                    the various prisons, but not to an extent to allow all prisoners to be
                    instructed in trades. Most of the prisons possess land in their vicinity which
                    is tilled by the prisoners. There are no prisoners’ aid societies as yet in
                    Ca..ada, although their formation has been earnestly recommended.</p>
                <p>For the Cape of Good Hope there is a good prison at Cape Town. In Ceylon, since
                    1867, cellular separation has been enforced for the whole period of short
                    sentences, and the first six months of long sentences. In Jamaica there are
                    several kinds of prisons, but only the principal, the general penitentiary, has
                    any number of separate sleeping cells.</p>
                <p>In India the jails number upwards of 230, with an indefinite number of small
                    lock-ups&gt; There is also the large convict dépôt at Port Blair in the Andaman
                    Islands. Very few of the Indian jails <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n781/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0781-0758"/> are entirely cellular; two in particular may be
                    mentioned, that of Utakamand and that of Hazaribagh, both of which are for
                    European convicts. “The remainder,” says Dr Mouatt, formerly inspector general
                    of prisons in Bengal, “are built on every conceivable plan; a large number of
                    them are miserable mud structures, which are constantly being washed away by
                    heavy rain, and as constantly provide work for the prisoners in repairing them.”
                    A few of them are radiating, and nearly all provide for the separation by night
                    of the male and female prisoners; and there is a certain rough classification
                    according to sentence. All work is in association, except when prisoners are
                    kept in cells for misconduct. The proportion of cell accommodation, when Dr
                    Mouatt wrote, was barely 10 per cent. Work is mostly intramural, and generally
                    remunerative and industrial. Prisoners are occasionally employed out of doors in
                    gangs upon canals and other public works. The ironing of prisoners where prisons
                    are insecure still prevails as a safeguard against escape. Prison punishments
                    are generally severe, and include flogging, fetters, penal labour, and complete
                    isolation. The whole question of prison discipline in India is strictly
                    subordinated to financial considerations, and the svstem in consequence lacks
                    uniformity and completeness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Austria.—</hi> It was not until 1867 that the Austrian
                    Government declared in favour of a system of cellular imprisonment. Till then
                    all prisoners had been kept in association, but at the date above mentioned a
                    recommendation that separation should be the rule was made to the reichsrath and
                    approved. Owing to the expense of reconstructing or converting prisons, the
                    principle could not be generally adopted; moreover, the Austrian authorities
                    were not in favour of continuous isolation. Hence the practice adopted was a
                    combination of the two methods. Short imprisonments might be endured entirely in
                    separate cells; every prisoner might pass the first part of a long term in a
                    cell, but the isolation was not to exceed eight months, the remainder of the
                    sentence to be undergone in association or collectively, due regard being had to
                    the classification of the prisoners brought together. This classification is
                    based upon the individual’s age, education, state of mind, and former life, and
                    the nature of his crime. The progress made in the erection of cellular prisons
                    has not been very rapid. Although the total number of prisoners in
                    Austria-Hungary exceeds 17,000, up to the end of 1879 only 1050 cells had been
                    provided, viz., at Gratz 252, at Stein 348, at Pilsen 387, and at Karthaus 63,
                    while two small prisons for trial prisoners have also been built at Cilli and
                    Reichenberg. These new prisons are, however, very complete and perfect; they
                    have all modern appliances, chapels, hospitals, worκshops, and baths; the cells
                    are spacious, and well ventilated, lighted, and warmed. Two days of cellular
                    imprisonment, after three months have elapsed, count as three in association.
                    There is no distinctly penal labour. In separation prisoners follow such trades
                    as shoemaking, tailoring, weaving, button-making, wood-carving; women are
                    employed in embroidery, spinning, quill-pen making, and knitting. In association
                    the principal employments are carpentering, coopering, smith’s work,
                    brick-making; and a number of the more trustworthy prisoners have helped to
                    construct railways and lay down roads. As a rule the prisoners’ labour is let
                    out to contractors; this plan is preferred as relieving the state of all risks,
                    while officials are more at liberty to attend to the pure disciplinary treatment
                    of the prisoners. As a rule every prisoner who enters ignorant of a trade is
                    taught one in prison. Prisoners can earn substantial wages; where contractors
                    are employed, the prisoners receive half what is paid over, after all costs have
                    been deducted. Half of the earnings may be spent in the prison canteen in the
                    purchase of luxuries, including beer and tobacco, or in the support of a
                    prisoner’s family, or in the purchase of clothing to be worn on discharge. There
                    is only one “Liberated Prisoner Aid Society,” which is established at Vienna,
                    and which does good service in supporting prisoners until they find occupation,
                    and providing them with money, clothes, and tools. Speaking generally, there are
                    three classes of prisons in Austria-Hungary, viz., for minor offences, and for
                    prisoners sentenced to terms less than one year and to terms of one year and
                    upwards respectively. The treatment of the incarcerated is humane: their diet is
                    sufficient; they have good beds and bedding; the sick are cared for in
                    hospitals; the labour of the able-bodied is not excessive, although supposed to
                    extend over ten hours daily. Religious services are provided for, and
                    non-Roman-Catholic frisoners may be seen by ministers of their own form of
                    faith.</p>
                <p>’ rison administration is under the minister of justice, who delegates his powers
                    to an inspector ge^ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> ral of prisons. Commissions
                    of inspection are appointed to .-&lt; <hi rend="subscript"> u</hi> all the
                    cellular prisons monthly, and there are also local boards of management and
                    control.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Belgium.—</hi> Prison discipline has perhaps received as close
                    attention in Belgium as anywhere in the world. In 1835, when the great movement
                    towards prison reform was in progress, Belgium first adopted the cellular system
                    experimentally by constructing thirty-two cells in connexion with the old prison
                    at Ghent. After a trial of nine years a verdict was passed in favour of cellular
                    separation and it was authoritatively adopted in 1844. Progress was steady if
                    not rapid; by degrees many cellular prisons were built; and up to the present
                    date (1885) twenty-four are in existence. A model prison for 600 on the same
                    plan is in process of construction at Brussels, and three others, smaller, will
                    soon be finished. Belgium has unhesitatingly accepted the rule of absolute
                    separation as regards all prisoners, whatever the duration of their sentences.
                    That solitude which disastrous results in England have strictly limited to
                    either nine months, or, under certain modifications, to two years, may be
                    enforced in Belgian prisons for at least ten years. At the end of that period a
                    prisoner may claim to go into association, and they are then removed to Ghent,
                    where they work and eat in company but have separate sleeping cells. Separation,
                    again, is· not insisted upon with the sickly, or those whose minds appear weak;
                    while all upon whom cellular imprisonment has failed may also in due course be
                    removed to association. But for the rest the separate system is the invariable
                    rule, and it is carried out with careful and unvarying sternness. The prisoner
                    never leaves his cell save for chapel or exercise; at the former he is in a
                    separate box or compartment; the latter he takes alone in a narrow yard. His
                    life, however, is not one of absolute solitude. He is visited frequently by his
                    warders and schoolmasters and trade instructors; chaplain, governor, and doctor
                    also break the monotony of his life. According to the Belgian view of the case,
                    he ‘ ‘ lives in association with the prison staff,” not with his fellow
                    criminals. It is claimed for this system, which aims primarily at the
                    reformation of individuals, that no evil consequences have as yet been seen to
                    follow from the treatment. Official statistics may be searched in vain for the·
                    record of cases of suicide or of mental alienation; neither are abnormally
                    frequent. On the other hand the Belgian authorities insist that the dread of the
                    punishment has had a marked effect upon crime, and that there is a diminution in
                    the number of second sentences. “Recidivists,” or reconvicted prisoners, are,
                    moreover, subjected to a more rigorous discipline.</p>
                <p>There are three classes of prisons in Belgium;—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >maisons</hi><hi rend="italic">d'arrêt,</hi> or prisons of detention, for
                    accused persons undergoing examination or awaiting trial; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >maisons</hi><hi rend="italic">de sûreté,</hi> or prisons for the infliction of
                    short sentences; and the <hi rend="italic">maison centrales,</hi> which
                    correspond to the English convict prisons. Prisoners awaiting trial, and still
                    innocent in the eyes of the law, are treated with much leniency and
                    consideration. An arrangement peculiar to the French and Belgian prisons is the
                    privilege of the “pistole.” A prisoner on payment of a certain charge is
                    conceded better accommodation; he has a room, not a cell, decently furnished,
                    and may provide his own food, have books, see his friends, and do no work.
                    Offenders of the better class, and never previously convicted, are sometimes
                    relegated specially to the pistole by the tribunals; and the local boards of
                    visitors have also power to transfer prisoners to this privileged class.
                    Independent of the pistole the law provides three kinds of penalty—correctional
                    imprisonment, seclusion, and imprisonment with hard labour. But, except the
                    slight differences as regards privileges of letters and visits, the treatment is
                    identical in all three categories. It is correctional for all; all prisoners are
                    kept in seclusion; and there is no hard labour, as we understand it. Purely
                    penal labour does not exist in the Belgian prisons. Public works are obviously
                    impossible; and there are no treadmills or cranks. The labour is entirely
                    industrial; but its object is rather to reform individuals than to produce
                    profit to the state. With strict cellular confinement the range of prison
                    industries is generally limited to sedentary employment; but, besides weaving,
                    tailoring, shoemaking, book-binding, and so forth, various handicrafts are
                    practised. The prisoner’s labour is partly let out to contractors, partly
                    utilized by the authorities. A portion of the earnings for work done goes to the
                    prisoners; and part of the money may be spent in the purchase of better food or
                    tobacco, where it is permitted, from the canteen. No pains are spared to
                    instruct the prisoners; those ignorant of any trade are regularly apprenticed
                    and taught, the idea being to provide every one with a means of livelihood on
                    release. The severity, not to say cruelty, of the strict rule of separation is
                    mitigated as far as possible by the paternal solicitude of the authorities. The
                    administrative arrangements of the Belgian prisons are nearly perfect. The
                    buildings are spacious—the halls lofty, light, and airy; the cells are of ample
                    dimensions, carefully ventilated, well-lighted, and well-warmed. An abundant
                    water supply assists the sanitary services; dietaries are sufficient and
                    well-chosen, soup with plenty of vegetables forming an especial feature in them.
                    School instruction is available for all. There are well-supplied libraries. The
                    hospitals are clean and spacious, fitted with every necessary, and the
                    percentage of patients under treatment is usually small. An epidemic of
                    ophthalmia was, however, long present in the reformatory prison of St Hubert. An
                    independent system of visitation is supposed to protect the prisoners from ill
                    usage; local boards composed of local functionaries exercise constant
                    supervision and control over the prisons in their vicinity. The central
                    administration is intelligent; and the prison service being esteemed highly
                    honourable attracts good men to recruit its ranks. Female prisons are
                    exclusively managed by the nuns of some religious order in the locality. Besides
                    the prisons of punishment for adults, there are two establishments in Belgium
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n782/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0782-0759"/></p>
                <p>which deal exclusively with juvenile crime. These are at St Hubert in Luxemburg,
                    and at Namur. The first, dating from 1840, is an agricultural colony which
                    receives all youths up to the age of fourteen; the labour is exclusively in the
                    fields. Young criminals belonging to the towns are sent to Namur, where the work
                    is mechanical but more sedentary. A good education both moral and practical is
                    received at these reformatories, which are more like schools than prisons. There
                    are also philanthropic schools for vagrants and non-criminal children. At
                    present no societies labour to assist prisoners on release. A complete
                    organization once existed for the purpose, but it was wholly official, and those
                    whom it was supposed to benefit suspected and kept aloof from it. It may be
                    added that, although there is no power in the prisoners’ own hands of working
                    out remission by steady industry and good conduct, sentences may be abbreviated
                    on these grounds on the recommendation of the prison authorities. All sentences,
                    too, have been shortened since the general introduction of cellular
                    imprisonment; as the treatment was more severe, justice demanded a curtailment
                    of the penalties. Capital punishment, although not definitively abolished, is
                    never inflicted, and all sentenced to death pass into prison for life. But after
                    ten years they too are transferred to Ghent for the remainder of their days.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Brazil. —</hi> The present emperor of Brazil has long taken an
                    active interest in prison reform. He has encouraged the prison administration of
                    his country to introduce a scheme which is in many respects the same as that in
                    force in England. Prisoners, after sentence, are subjected to a period of close
                    cellular confinement enduring eight mouths; they then pass to another prison,
                    where cellular separation is still enforced, but the daily labour is in
                    association and in silence. This is styled the reformatory stage; after that
                    comes the third stage, which is reached by marks gained through industry and
                    good conduct. In this last stage, called the testing stage, prisoners work
                    together; they may converse, may wear their own clothes, and are under the care
                    and supervision of the most trustworthy of their fellows. They sleep in large
                    dormitories, not in cells, are allowed to cultivate a piece of garden ground on
                    their own account, and a large portion of their earnings is placed to their
                    credit and handed over to them on release.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Denmark.—</hi> The prison system in force in Denmark dates from
                    1840, previous to which time the arrangements were extremely unsatisfactory. In
                    the early part of the century Danish prisons were in as deplorable condition as
                    any in Europe; after enduring indescribable horrors, the worst malefactors
                    passed on to hard labour in the fortresses or in the fleets. But a commission
                    was appointed in 1840 to report, and recommended the adoption of the cellular
                    system for all prisoners awaiting trial, and under shortterm sentences,—those
                    condemned to long imprisonments to be put to hard labour in association. The
                    necessary prisons were constructed at a cost, within a quarter of a century, of
                    two millions of pounds. There are a large number of small detention prisons, and
                    four principal prisons for the convicted; one cellular for males at
                    Vridsloesville, and two associated at Horsens and Viborg, one for females
                    combined cellular and associated at Christianshavn. About 75 per cent, of the
                    whole are sentenced to separative confinement in cells; its infliction is
                    limited to first offenders, youths, or those sentenced to six months and upwards
                    to three years and a half; the associated or aggregate system applies to the
                    reconvicted, and for terms from two years to life. There is no distinctly penal
                    l ιbour in the prisons; the industrial prevails, and is in the hands of
                    contractors. Prisoners in cells are constantly visited; religious and secular
                    instruction is imparted; the dietaries are carefully calculated, and the régime
                    generally intelligent and humane.</p>
                <p>A number of aid societies have been established at the seat of the large prisons,
                    which assist prisoners on release who have been diligent and well conducted in
                    confinement. Work is found, tools and subsistence given, as in England. It is
                    interesting to note that the first aid society was formed at Copenhagen in 1841
                    through the exertions of Mrs Fry. Besides the regular prisons, there are three
                    reformatories for juveniles modelled on the French school at Mettray; they have
                    been founded by private benevolence, but receive aid from the state. Agriculture
                    is the principal employment of the inmates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">France.—</hi> Prisons and their management have not attracted
                    close or continuous attention in France. Dynastic changes, wars, revolutions,
                    and intestinal troubles may be pleaded as the excuse. A system based on the
                    principle of individual separation as practised in the United States was on the
                    point of being adopted in France when the legislation to secure it was
                    interrupted by the revolution of 1848. Under the empire the question was
                    generally subordinated to more pressing political needs. Cellular imprisonment
                    was, however, adopted partially, but only to a limited extent, for persons
                    awaiting trial. Central prisons in which the prisoners lived and worked in
                    association had been established early in the century, and their use was
                    extended. They received all sentenced to the shorter terms. The long-term
                    convicts went to the <hi rend="italic">l·agnes,</hi> the great convict prisons
                    at the arsenals of Rochefort, Brest, and Toulon; and in 1851, a few years after
                    it had been abandoned by England, transportation to penal colonies was adopted
                    by France. In 1869 Napoleon III. appointed a commission to inquire and report
                    upon the whole question, but its labours were rudely interrupted by the
                    Franco-German W ar. Three years later a fresh commission, appointed by the
                    national assembly to discuss parliamentary reform, made a most exhaustive report
                    in 1874. It unhesitatingly recommended cellular confinement, and the principle
                    became law the following year. This system of prison discipline then became
                    applicable to all persons awaiting trial, to those sentenced to any term up to a
                    year and a day, and to those for longer terms provided they asked to be kept
                    separate and apart. It was calculated by the commission first mentioned that
                    there were nearly eight thousand cells already in existence and available, but
                    an additional twenty-one thousand would have to be constructed at an outlay of
                    sixty-three millions of francs in order to meet the demands of this ħeλv system.
                    A model cell was designed and plans for model prisons, but the expense the
                    change would entail appears to have deterred French authorities, both the
                    central executive and the <hi rend="italic">conseils généraux,</hi> from
                    promptly making it. There are not more than ten or a dozen cellular prisons in
                    France, and two of them are in Paris—Mazas (for trial prisoners) and La Santé,
                    but the latter is not entirely cellular. The construction of others has been
                    contemplated, but in few cases proceeded with, and many years will probably
                    elapse before any uniformity in penal treatment is established in France.</p>
                <p>Prison administration is complex in France, and there are many kinds of
                    prisons,—a few of them being under the authority of the minister of the interior
                    :—(1) the <hi rend="italic">maison</hi><hi rend="italic">d'arrêt,</hi> temporary
                    places of durance in every arrondissement for persons charged with offences, and
                    those sentenced to more than a year’s imprisonment who are awaiting transfer to
                    a <hi rend="italic">maison</hi><hi rend="italic">centrale</hi>; (2) the <hi
                    rend="italic">maison de justice,</hi> often part and parcel of the former, but
                    only existing in the assize court towns for the safe custody of those tried or
                    condemned at the assizes; (3) the dépôt situated on the island of Ré, for all
                    sentenced to <hi rend="italic">travaux forcés</hi> awaiting deportation to New
                    Caledonia (Arabs so sentenced wait at Avignon their removal to French Guiana);
                    (4) departmental prisons or houses of correction, for summary convictions, or
                    those sentenced to less than a year, or, if provided with sufficient cells,
                    those amenable to separate confinement; (5) the <hi rend="italic">maisons
                    centrales, or</hi> central prisons, for all sentenced to more than a year, or
                    for men and women above sixty sentenced to <hi rend="italic">travaux
                    forcés</hi>; (6) <hi rend="italic">maisons de force,</hi> for women sentenced to
                    <hi rend="italic">travaux forcés,</hi> or both sexes condemned to seclusion; (7)
                    prisons for those sentenced to simple detention; (8) penal settlements in
                    Corsica, more particularly at Chiavari, Casablanca, and Castellucio, the régime
                    of which is the same as in the <hi rend="italic">maisons centrales;</hi> (9)
                    reformatory establishments for juvenile offenders; and (10) <hi rend="italic"
                    >dépôts de sûreté,</hi> for prisoners who are travelling, at places where there
                    are no other prisons. The total number of prisons of all classes in France,
                    exclusive of the last, exceeds 500, and the prison population averages 50,000
                    daily. Besides the foregoing there are a certain number of military prisons
                    under the war minister seated at the great garrison towns, or in Algeria; and at
                    all the seaports there are maritime prisons for soldiers or sailors who have
                    broken laws civil or military. The latter are under the minister of marine, who
                    also has special charge of the penal settlements at a distance from France,
                    including French Guiana and New Caledonia, where there are several prisons and
                    hulks adapted for the confinement of convicts. The disciplinary treatment of all
                    prisoners in separate confinement is much the same in France as elsewhere; the
                    isolation while it lasts is complete and is broken only by the frequent visits
                    of officials. The exercise is solitary, and at chapel the same rule obtains by
                    each prisoner occupying a separate box, or by having service in the centre of
                    the prison, to which all the cell doors, slightly opened, converge. It may be
                    stated here that religious tolerance prevails everywhere; and prisoners not
                    Roman Catholics may receive the ministration of clergymen of their own creed.
                    Female prisons are mostly managed by nuns or members of the female religious
                    orders. There is one at Doullens especially kept for Protestant female
                    prisoners, and managed by a Protestant sisterhood. The evils of association in
                    the congregate prisons are diminished by classification, so far as it goes. But
                    prisoners are at least kept in categories: trial prisoners are together; those
                    for a year are kept apart from the summary convictions, and convicts <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">route</hi> for the island of Ré from all
                    the rest. Males and females occupy different prisons. As almost all prisons have
                    at least a few separate cells, these are utilized either for the recidivists and
                    those of worst character, or for any well-disposed prisoners who exhibit a real
                    desire to amend. The diet, although coarse, is liberal. It may be supplemented
                    by purchase made from the canteen, at which both wine and tobacco may be
                    obtained by all who can pay for it. Each person may thus spend a certain
                    proportion of his earnings or <hi rend="italic">pécule,</hi> the rest being
                    reserved for his discharge. What remains of the product of the prisoner’s labour
                    is handed over to the contractor, who also receives a grant per prisoner from
                    the state. Labour is only obligatory upon those so sentenced; it is purely
                    industrial; penal labour, such as treadmill or crank, does not exist in French
                    prisons. In the smaller it is not easy to find occupation for the inmates, but
                    in the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n783/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0783-0760"/> larger many and various industries are carried
                    on. Among the more ordinary trades the manufacture of "articles de Paris,” toys,
                    neat bonbon boxes, hosiery, and cabinet-making produce good financial returns.
                    The labour of the prisoners in Corsican settlements has been usefully directed
                    upon the reclamation of marshy lands, the clearing of forests, and the tilling
                    of the less fertile districts. The agricultural results have been good as
                    regards the cultivation of the orange, olive, and vine; mulberry trees have been
                    planted for the silk-worm, and the wheat fields have returned rich harvests of
                    grain, much esteemed in Italy and the south of France. Good roads and many
                    canals have been made, to open up the interior. These Corsican prisons have long
                    suffered from the unhealthiness of their neighbourhood, but the draining of the
                    marshes, the development of irrigation, and the plantation of trees have all
                    combined to improve their sanitary conditions.</p>
                <p>The efforts made in France, more particularly by private benevolence, to cope
                    with juvenile delinquency have been very praiseworthy. French reformatories are
                    of two classes—those that are punitive or correctional, and those that are
                    simply reformatory. To the first, where the discipline is severe, are sent all
                    youths convicted of offences committed with full knowledge of their criminality,
                    and these relegated from the reformatories as insubordinate; to the second,
                    children proved guilty but not responsible for their acts, or the ill-conducted
                    whose parents cannot manage them. The first-named are public institutions
                    maintained by the state; the latter are private, and may be supported entirely
                    by subscriptions. There are in all thirty-eight of the former, as well as five
                    penal colonies, and five juvenile quarters attached to various departmental
                    prisons; of the latter there are twenty-eight. All these are for males. For
                    females there are twenty-three private establishments and one public. The most
                    important of the public reformatories for boys is that of La Petite Roquette in
                    Paris, immediately opposite the convict prison of the same name, in front of
                    which executions are carried out. Of the private institutions that of Mettray
                    near Tours, started by the benevolent enterprise of Μ. de Metz, has a world-wide
                    reputation. A very successful female reformatory is that of Darnétal near Rouen,
                    where the women are employed in farming and field operations.</p>
                <p>As regards the most heinous offenders, France not only clings to deportation, but
                    is disposed to enlarge and multiply her penal settlements. In 1884 the
                    Government had under consideration the necessity for sending out all
                    “recidivists” to the Polynesian islands. This, however, has been hindered for
                    the moment by the energetic protest of the Australian colonies, and, instead of
                    the number sent to New Caledonia being increased, French Guiana will probably be
                    more largely utilized. In the former islands most of the evils which attended
                    the early days of transportation to Australia have been apparent. The French
                    convicts either remain in the hands of the Government incarcerated in badly
                    constructed*prisons, where discipline and supervision are unsatisfactory or
                    incomplete, or they pass into a state of semi-freedom to work for free settlers
                    on their own account. There are not enough of the latter to afford much
                    employment, and the conditions of the soil of New Caledonia are not such as to
                    encourage the convicts to work for themselves. It is extremely improbable that
                    the penal settlement will ever grow into a prosperous self-supporting colony,
                    and thus the chief end of deportation remains unachieved. At present the French
                    penal settlements beyond sea are merely badly-built indifferently-managed
                    prisons at a long distance from home.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Germany. —</hi> There is a similarity in the prison discipline
                    of the various units of the German empire. In the grand-duchy of <hi
                    rend="italic">Baden</hi> there are four kinds of prisons—district prisons,
                    fortresses, houses of correction, and central prisons. The punishment in the two
                    first named is simply detention or privation of liberty,—the district prisons
                    being for persons under examination and waiting trial, or those sentenced to
                    less than six weeks’ imprisonment. Sentences above that time are endured in the
                    central prisons. The principle of cellular imprisonment is the general rule, but
                    it is not extended, unless at a prisoner’s wish, beyond three years. For youths
                    between twelve and eighteen the limit is six months. Prisoners unfit for
                    solitary confinement and those who have endured three years’ detention are kept
                    together, but they are not associated during working hours. Both systems are
                    supposed to be attended with good results in Baden. Both have their merits, but
                    popular feeling inclines most to the cellular plan as conducing to reform while
                    it keeps the prisoners from mutual contamination. The chief cellular prison is
                    at Bruchsal, where there is accommodation for five hundred, but there are a
                    certain number of separate cells attached to many other prisons. The labour in
                    the prisons is industrial as opposed to penal; contractors are not encouraged;
                    and in most prisons the administration itself keeps the employment of the prison
                    in its own hands. Forty per cent, of the prisoners on admission are ignorant of
                    any trade, but they do not leave prison without learning one. Prisoners’ aid
                    societies exist in twenty-nine out of fifty-nine districts, and they achieve
                    good results, although their aid is not too frequently invoked.</p>
                <p>The bulk of the prisons in <hi rend="italic">Bavaria,</hi> mostly converted
                    castles and convents, are on the collective system, but there are four cellular
                    prisons—one at Nuremberg, and three other district prisons for those awaiting
                    trial. The prisons are much the same as in Baden. There are police prisons for
                    first arrests; district prisons mentioned above, which also take short
                    sentences; prisons for three months’ sentences and upwards, and for juveniles;
                    and houses of correction. There are also special prisons set apart for persons
                    convicted of theft, fraud, robbery, receiving, whose sentences exceed three
                    months; and a system of classification exists which separates all likely by
                    their previous character to exercise a baneful influence on their fellows. For
                    the long-term prisoners the labour may be upon public works beyond the walls of
                    the jail, and prisoners may demand to be so employed, or in work for which they
                    are fit. Industry and good conduct will secure a remission of sentence. After
                    three months of the sentence have been served there is no purely penal labour.
                    Industrial labour is conducted by the prison authorities, who are not in favour
                    of the employment of contractors, which is thought to jeopardize discipline.
                    Secular education is not overlooked; there are hospitals, chapels, libraries,
                    and the administration generally is humane. There are numerous societies to
                    assist discharged prisoners, which, however, are said to be much hampered in
                    action by the ignorance and prejudice of the public. One at Munich has
                    nevertheless done great good.</p>
                <p>There are but few prisons in <hi rend="italic">Prussia</hi> in which isolation is
                    exclusively carried out. But in forty-six cellular and associated imprisonment
                    exist side by side; the total number of cells is, however, small when compared
                    with the total population in prison. The advantage of introducing the system of
                    “progressive stages,” of passing from strict separation to labour in
                    association, is anxiously discussed, but nothing yet has been done. Prussian
                    prisons may be classed as—(1) those exclusively for hard labour, (2) those for
                    imprisonment and simple detention, and (3) those of a mixed character.
                    Hard-labour sentences may be for any term from one year to life; the labour is
                    compulsory, without restriction, both inside and beyond the walls. The maximum
                    of simple imprisonment or detention is for five years, during which time a
                    prisoner is not compelled to work except in accordance with his capacity and the
                    position he occupied in social life; nor need he work outside the prison against
                    his will. Imprisonment in a fortress, which may be for life and the minimum of
                    which is for one day, means simple deprivation of liberty. There is also a
                    detention on summary conviction for vagrants and beggars limited to six weeks.
                    These may be made to work inside or outside the prison. There is no penal
                    labour; but much variety and enterprise exist as regards the prison industrial
                    employments, which, in addition to the ordinary kinds, include featherscraping,
                    leather-dressing, turning, carving, illuminating, &amp;c. The males also farm;
                    the ιvomen make gloves, cigars, and tapestry, embroider, knit, weave, and spin.
                    The work is carried on through contractors, who pay a certain sum on the amount
                    produced. A portion of their earnings goes to the prisoners,—half of it to be
                    expended in buying extra food, half accumulated against release. To reduce evils
                    of association it is ordered that first sentences shall be separated from
                    hardened offenders, but this classification is not always possible; juvenile
                    prisoners are, however, kept apart in cells. Release, provisionally, may take
                    place after three-fourths of the sentence has been endured with good conduct,
                    but the licence to be abroad may be revoked for a breach of law. There are many
                    prisoners’ aid societies, the best being in Rhenish Prussia and Westphalia, but
                    the results obtained have not been very satisfactory. Employers and free workmen
                    will not receive liberated prisoners freely, and the aid societies would effect
                    more if they were more centralized and worked more together. Prussian prisons
                    are on the whole well organized; the discipline is severe yet just; order reigns
                    everywhere; secular instruction and religious ministrations are ample, and the
                    employment of prisoners according to their capacities is carefully attended to.
                    But many of the prisons require rebuilding or reconstruction; isolation at night
                    should be the universal rule; and more cells are needed to ensure the separation
                    of the trial prisoners and short sentences. Administrative centralization is
                    much needed in Prussia.</p>
                <p>Prison discipline has attracted close attention in the kingdom of <hi
                    rend="italic">Saxony</hi> since 1850, when the penitentiary at Zwickau was first
                    opened and conducted with satisfactory results. In 1854 it was decreed that all
                    Saxon prisons should follow the same system, which is that of treatment either
                    solitary or associated according to individual wants; neither rule obtains
                    exclusively, and the prisons have facilities for both. Work, education, and diet
                    are supposed to be carefully allotted to prisoners. The prisons follow the usual
                    classification of German prisons; there are those. for severe punishment, two in
                    number, three for less severe punishment, and two for the older offenders.
                    Besides these there are the fortresses and the prisons of detention. The labour
                    is purely industrial, not penal; Saxony is a very industrial country, and its
                    prisons produce nearly every article of manufacture. Work is carried out in them
                    partly by contractors and partly by the authorities. In the five reformatories
                    agriculture is the principal <pb break="no"

                <p>occupation. A graduated system of remission of sentences is in force, dependent
                    on industry and conduct.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Wiirtemberg</hi> the cellular system was adopted for women
                    in 1865, and a prison on that plan erected at Heilbronn, which has since been
                    utilized exclusively for men. The bulk of the Wiirtemberg prisons are, however,
                    still on the collective system; but at all prisons there are places for the
                    isolated detention of a certain number of prisoners. The classification of
                    prisons is much the same as in other parts of the German empire under the penal
                    code of the empire. There is no distinction between penal and industrial labour;
                    the latter is of the varied character followed in either German prisons, and is
                    partly in the hands of contractors, partly in that of the administration. An aid
                    society has existed in Wiirtemberg since 1831, and it has numerous ramifications
                    through the country. It does good service in obtaining work, providing tools,
                    and assisting emigration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Italy.—</hi> There is a want of uniformity in the prison system
                    of the Italian kingdom, which is not strange, having regard to the recent
                    unification of the country. The various units which were till recently
                    independent of each other had each its own views. Many varieties of prison
                    discipline, therefore, still remain in force. There are some prisons in which
                    complete isolation is the rule, others where the labour is associated with
                    cellular separation at night. But the largest number are on the collective
                    system. All new prisons of detention are built on the principle of isolation,
                    and this rule is as far as possible strictly observed for all prisoners awaiting
                    trial. This period of detention may be spent in a provincial <hi rend="italic"
                    >(carcere</hi><hi rend="italic">centrale),</hi> district <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cir</hi><hi rend="italic">condar</hi><hi rend="italic">ale),</hi> or communal
                    <hi rend="italic">(mandamentale)</hi> jail. Sentences are carried out according
                    to their character in different prisons. There are prisons for those condemned
                    to simple confinement and detention; others for “relegates”; others again for
                    reclusion accompanied with hard labour; and twenty are <hi rend="italic"
                    >bagnios</hi> or hard-labour prisons for those sentenced for long periods (up to
                    life), to undergo the punishment of the <hi rend="italic">ergastolo</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">galera.</hi> The discipline is progressive. In the ordinary
                    prisons a gradual amelioration of condition may be secured by good conduct; in
                    the bagnios, besides the exemption from fetters, convicts may gain the privilege
                    of completing the last half of their sentences in one or other of the
                    agricultural colonies. These have been established in various islands of the
                    Tuscan archipelago, as at Pianosa and Gorgona; and an intermediate prison has
                    been established on the island of Capraia for well-conducted prisoners in a last
                    stage of semi-liberty. Associated convict labour has produced good results in
                    Italy. By it all necessary prison buildings have been erected at the penal
                    colonies and at various points on the mainland; it has also been applied to
                    agriculture, the reclamation of land, the construction of storehouses, docks,
                    salt works, and on the improvement of various ports. In the prisons or
                    penitentiaries the labour is industrial, and follows the usual lines.
                    Contractors have generally the control of this labour, receiving the results
                    after deductions for prisoners’ earnings to be spent in the usual way and with
                    the obligation to teach trades. Ou the latter condition contractors are granted
                    the exclusive right to the labour of juveniles in houses of correction; and
                    there are a number of reformatory schools, mostly on a charitable basis, into
                    which are drafted all juveniles, vagrants, and idlers sentenced to compulsory
                    detention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mexico.—</hi> In Mexico the rule of constant separation for all
                    prisoners has been accepted, but not yet carried out entirely. The old prisons
                    were on the associated system; but new cellular prisons have recently been
                    built, or are in process of construction at Jalisco, Durango, Puebla, and
                    Mexico. These will receive trial prisoners and those sentenced. There is an
                    “hospicio de pobres” for young children; also a special reformatory
                    establishment for children between nine and eighteen. Political offenders are
                    kept apart from ordinary offenders. All convicted prisoners may earn conditional
                    release on completion of half their whole sentence. This form of release is
                    called preparatory liberty, and for a short time preceding it they are allowed
                    to leave the jails to run errands or seek work. The labour in Mexican prisons is
                    industrial, not penal, and in theory at least the advantages of learning a trade
                    in prison are fully understood. Contracts for prison labour are forbidden. . A
                    portion of the proceeds goes to the prisoners, and may be spent in purchasing
                    food or furniture or articles of comfort. There are “protective boards” who
                    visit and seek to improve the prisoners, and independent philanthropists are
                    also admitted. Prisoners on release go to the protective boards, who assist in
                    obtaining them an honest livelihood.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Netherlands.—</hi> Here the treatment a condemned prisoner
                    undergoes depends mainly upon the sentence awarded. The judge at his discretion
                    may direct the imprisonment to be on the solitary or the associated system. This
                    power as regards the first is, however, limited to half the whole term of
                    sentence, and in 1851 it could only be applied to sentences of one year; this
                    was extended in 1864 to two years, and in 1871 to four years,—so that now the
                    maximum of Cellular imprisonment to be inflicted is actually limited to two
                    years. There are several prisons on the cellular plan; but in most the two kinds
                    of imprisonment exist side by side. There are four classes of prisons :—(1) the
                    central prisons for persons sentenced to eighteen months and upwards; (2)
                    detention prisons for less than eighteen months; (3) prisons of arrest for those
                    sentenced to three months or less; and (4) police or central prisons for those
                    condemned to one month and under. In the three last named are also kept
                    prisoners awaiting trial. As regards classification nothing more is attempted
                    where association is the rule than the separation of the most hardened and
                    previously convicted offenders from other prisoners. Imprisonment is either
                    simple detention or accompanied by hard labour. The latter is industrial only,
                    never penal, and embraces a great variety of handicrafts, most of which are
                    carried out under contractors. But work is also done on account of the state,
                    with the advantage that it is not subject to the fluctuations of supply and
                    demand. All prisoners, except those for short terms, are, if possible, taught a
                    trade. The earnings go in part to the prisoners, to be expended by them in the
                    usual way. Remissions of sentence not exceeding six months may be accorded to
                    all originally condemned to not less than three years, and who have undergone at
                    least half. There is a society for the moral amelioration of prisoners in the
                    Netherlands, which has numerous ramifications, and is devoted to prison visiting
                    and the welfare of prisoners generally. This extends to efforts to obtain
                    employment for them on release, which are praiseworthy, and on the whole
                    eminently successful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Norway.—</hi> Prisons in Norway may be divided into two
                    principal classes, the <hi rend="italic">Strafarbeidesanstalter,</hi> or penal
                    institutions where prisoners are compelled to labour, and the district prisons
                    established in 1857 for detention and simple imprisonment. (1) The first may be
                    further subdivided into fortress prisons, houses of correction, and the cellular
                    prison or penitentiary of Christiania. This last takes the first convicted for
                    short terms between the ages of eighteen and thirty, the fortresses the longer
                    sentences, and the houses of correction the intermediate terms. All these
                    prisons except that of Christiania are on the associated system, with no attempt
                    at classification beyond the separation of the worst from the least corrupt in
                    workshops or dormitories. The hours of labour are long—fourteen in summer and
                    ten in winter. The labour, conducted solely by the authorities, is industrial;
                    at Christiania cloth manufacture is a principal trade, at Akershuus it is
                    stonecutting. Most prisoners learn a trade if they are ignorant of one on
                    reception. No portion of the proceeds of their labour goes to the prisoners.
                    There is no regular system of granting remissions. All the penal institutions
                    have chaplains, schools, libraries, and hospitals. Released prisoners are, as
                    far as possible, preserved from relapse by the care taken to provide them with
                    work when free. There are a few aid societies, but their operations are somewhat
                    circumscribed from want of means. (2) The district prisons, fifty-six in number,
                    take summary convictions from four to two hundred and forty days. Imprisonment
                    may be endured on bread and water with regulated intervals, or on the jail
                    allowance. Prisoners in these prisons are not compelled to work, but they can
                    have employment if they wish it. These district jails are also used for the
                    detention of all persons apprehended and awaiting trial, and as debtors’
                    prisons. They are mostly on the cellular plan, especially in the cases of those
                    sentenced to solitary confinement on bread and water and those committed for
                    trial.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Portugal</hi> is still behindhand as regards its prison
                    administration. The jails are extremely defective in construction; the
                    discipline is lax and the management careless. All prisons are on the associated
                    plan; they stand mostly in the market places of the large towns, with the
                    first-floor windows upon the public thoroughfares, so that the inmates are at
                    liberty to talk and communicate with the passers by, whom they importune
                    constantly for alms. Little less lamentable than the neglect of prison
                    discipline is the practice of indefinitely postponing jail deliveries, with the
                    inevitable consequence of frequent failures of justice. Juries often will not
                    convict, alleging that the accused have been sufficiently punished by long
                    detention awaiting trial.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Russia.—</hi> Prison discipline was much discussed in Russia as
                    far back as the commencement of the present century, and in the year 1819 a
                    society, now known as the Imperial Society, was established to watch over the
                    administration of prisons. This society still exists, and is affiliated to the
                    ministry of the interior. Its central committee and the provincial committees
                    working under it select the staff of the prisons, and exercise a general
                    surveillance over them. Various classes of prisons have existed in European
                    Russia. As at present organized they consist of—(1) the fortresses, for grave
                    offenders, especially the political and revolutionary,—-in these the discipline
                    is very severe; (2) the military prisons, in which the discipline is not less
                    strict; (3) the house of detention, the ancient <hi rend="italic">ostrog</hi> or
                    stronghold which every town has always had for the safe keeping of prisoners
                    charged with offences,—in these were detained also prisoners awaiting corporal
                    punishment or deportation to a penal colony; (4) the hard-labour prisons, in
                    which were located the labour parties or correctional corps instituted by the
                    emperor Nicholas, organized and disciplined on a military basis; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n785/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0785-0762"/> (5) the amendment prisons or houses of industry
                    established by the empress Catherine. These are all on the associated system,
                    and fall very far short of accepted ideas on prison management. But an entirely
                    new cellular prison has recently been erected in St Petersburg, which is a model
                    of its kind. It is a house of detention for persons awaiting trial, and contains
                    upwards of a hundred cells. All the internal arrangements of this prison are
                    excellent; but it may be doubted whether the Russian Government will embark upon
                    the expenditure necessary to build others of the class. The emancipation of the
                    serfs in 1867, followed by the substitution of imprisonment for corporal
                    punishment, added enormously to the prison population of Russia. A great
                    increase of prison accommodation became necessary, and a commission was
                    appointed to frame a new penitentiary system. This, as now adopted, although not
                    entirely carried out, consists of two parts—punitive imprisonment for short
                    sentences, and penal probationary detention as a preliminary to banishment to a
                    colony. For the first, central prisons, associated not cellular, are being
                    constructed at various points, and a regulated system of labour will be
                    introduced following the lines of that in force in other European countries. For
                    the second, at the end of the probationary period banishment, or, as it is
                    styled in official language, enforced colonization, will be the rule.</p>
                <p>Deportation to Siberia began in 1591. It was principally used for political
                    prisoners, insurgents, religious dissenters, and conspirators. Large numbers of
                    Poles were exiled in 1758; others again in 1830, and now, since the Nihilist
                    movement, numbers of these implacable foes to the existing régime are regularly
                    despatched to Siberia. The total number deported varies from 17,000 to 20,000
                    per annum, but this includes wives and children who may elect to accompany the
                    exiles. The sentences are of two kinds—(1) the loss of all rights and (2) the
                    loss of particular rights. The first includes degradation, the rupture of the
                    marriage tie, inability to sign legal documents, to hold property, or to give a
                    bond. The exile must wear prison dress, and have his head half-shaved. He may be
                    flogged, and if murdered would not be much missed. After a lengthened period of
                    probation in prison the exile becomes a colonist and may work on his own
                    account. Those sentenced to the loss of particular rights are only compelled to
                    live in Siberia, where they may get their living as they can. Many, however, are
                    condemned to spend a portion of their time in confinement but without hard
                    labour. The exiles are sent from all parts of the empire by rail or river to
                    Ekaterinburg, and thence to Tiumen, whence they are distributed through Siberia.
                    Those deprived of partial rights are generally located in western Siberia. Those
                    deprived of all rights go on to eastern Siberia. The latter go by river
                    generally to Tomsk; thence they walk to their ultimate resting place, which may
                    be Irkutsk or Yakutsk or Tchita, or the island of Saghalien, and the journey may
                    occupy months. Not long ago a party of convicts was despatched by sea to the
                    last-named destination, embarking at Odessa and travelling through the Suez
                    Canal and by the Pacific Ocean. There are several hundred prisons in Siberia.
                    They are of three kinds:—(1) the <hi rend="italic">etape,</hi> which afford
                    temporary lodgings for prisoners on the line of march; (2) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pτisylnie,</hi> where the detention is often for several months during the
                    winter or until the ice is broken up; and (3) the <hi rend="italic">ostrog,</hi>
                    the generic Russian name for a prison, which is the place of durance for all
                    exiles not on their own resources. Few of the large prisons in Siberia were
                    built for the purpose. They are converted buildings—old factories, distilleries,
                    and so forth. They are all upon the associate principle, containing a number of
                    large rooms to accommodate any number from twenty-five to a hundred. The great
                    central prison near Irkutsk, called the Alexandreflsky, one of the most
                    important in Siberia, generally holds from 1600 to 2000 prisoners all under
                    sentence of hard labour, and awaiting transfer to the mines. Dr Lausdell, who
                    visited this prison in 1879, found the prisoners very short of work. Some were
                    engaged in making cigarette papers, others in shoemaking and brickmaking. The
                    prison is a huge stone-built building, very different from the ordinary run of
                    Siberian prisons, which are usually built of logs caulked with moss to keep out
                    the cold. They are surrounded by a high wooden palisade. Each prison has its
                    hospital, chapel, generally a schoolroom, and a few workshops. The prisoners
                    themselves are not unkindly treated. At most of the stations there are local
                    committees to watch over the welfare of the prisoners. This is an extension of
                    the Imperial Society of St Petersburg already mentioned. The committees supply
                    books and visit the prisoners. They clothe and educate the prisoners’ children,
                    and help their wives to employment. They also augment the prisoners’ diet from
                    funds obtained by subscription. The regulation rations of Siberian exiles seem
                    very liberal. The Russian prisoner has nearly twice the amount of solid food
                    that an English prisoner receives, and he is at liberty to add to his diet out
                    of his own means, which the English prisoner is not. The prisoners are also
                    supplied with ample clothing if they have none of their own, those sentenced to
                    deprivation of all rights being obliged to wear convict dress. The discipline of
                    the prisons is now in accordance with European ideas. Prison offences are
                    punished by relegation to a solitary cell, a certain number of which exis t at
                    all the prisons. Diminutions of diet are also inflicted, and an obligation to
                    wear irons if they are not already worn. All exiles wear leg-irons for a certain
                    time. These are riveted on to the ankles, and caught by a chain which is earned
                    suspended to a belt round the waist. The irons are worn for various periods from
                    eighteen months to four and even eight years. Very heinous offenders or those
                    who have escaped frequently are chained to a wheelbarrow, which they are obliged
                    to pull about with them wherever they go. A more severe punishment when
                    confinement and irons fail is birching with a rod, for the knout is now
                    abolished. The rod consists of switches so small that three may be passed
                    together into the muzzle of a musket. The punishment is described as not more
                    severe than that inflicted at English public schools. There is another
                    flagellator, however, called the <hi rend="italic">plete,</hi> a whip of twisted
                    hide, which is still retained at a few of the most distant Siberian prisons and
                    only for the most incorrigible, on whom irons, the birch, and other punishments
                    have had no effect. The costliness of deportation is enormous and the results it
                    obtains doubtful. The slow colonization of this vast territory may follow
                    eventually, but there are already great difficulties in finding employment for
                    thejnass of labour in the Government’s hands. The mines of gold, silver, and
                    coal are passing into private hands, and there are no other public works. Hence
                    part of the Russian criminals who would have gone to Siberia are detained in the
                    large prisons in Russia, where they are employed in manufactories or in the
                    labours of ordinary mechanics, or any outdoor work such as making bricks,
                    mending roads, and manufacturing salt. Nevertheless recent visitors to Russian
                    prisons, whether in Russia proper or in the heart of Siberia, describe the
                    prisoners as generally idle. The principle of progressive stages by which a
                    prisoner can gain a remission of sentence or milder treatment prevails
                    throughout. The well-conducted persons can earn wages, and may spend the money
                    in buying an increase to their diet. The bulk of the worst convicts gravitate to
                    the island of Saghalien, where the number in 1879 was about 2600. Half of those
                    were kept in prison, half remained comparatively free. The discipline here is
                    very severe. The diet is said to be scanty, and as the island is barren
                    everything has to be imported. Fish, however, is found in large quantities.
                    There are four large prisons at Dui, the principal post on the island, which are
                    insufficiently heated in winter and generally overcrowded. The convicts are
                    chiefly employed in raising coal from mines which are let to a company. Very
                    conflicting evidence is current as regards the Siberian prisons. Prince
                    Kropotkine, an exile, speaking with some authority, denounces them as hotbeds of
                    vice and cruelty. Dr Lansdell on the other hand, a reputable eyewitness, does
                    not on the whole speak unfavourably of them. He describes them as rough,
                    perhaps; but so are Siberian dwellings. He thinks that as compared with the
                    English convict the Siberian is not badly off. The labour is lighter; he has
                    more privileges; friends may see him offener and bring him food; and he passes
                    his time neither in the seclusion of a cell nor in unbroken silence, but among
                    his fellows with whom he may lounge, talk, and speak. The Russian convict,
                    however, misses those intellectual, moral, and religious influences which are
                    abundantly showered upon the English. There are no prisoners’ aid societies in
                    Siberia, and the convict, after release, when suffered to begin life again on
                    his own account, carries with him always the convict stain and is hindered
                    rather than helped to begin life afresh. Dr Lansdell sums up his opinion in
                    these words :—</p>
                <p>“Taken at the worst, condemnation to the mines is not so bad as it seems; and, in
                    the case of peasant exiles willing to work, I cannot but think that many of them
                    have abetterchance of doing well in several parts of Siberia than at home in
                    some parts of Russia. There is reason to suppose that reports of the
                    ill-treatment of Russian prisoners have been greatly exaggerated by careless,
                    ill-informed, or malicious wιiters. No doubt some years ago there were good
                    grounds for serious complaint. It is very evident that now the political
                    prisoner, beyond exile, and temporary confinement in the jail, is not ill-used.
                    He is not always subjected to the ordinary discipline of the criminal convict,
                    nor is he obliged to associate with them. A fabulous story l&gt;as long been
                    current that the worst criminals were buried alive in quicksilver mines, where
                    they were speedily killed by the unhealthy fumes. There are no quicksilver mines
                    in Siberia, and the principal mines, those of Nertchinsk, are now passing out of
                    Government hands. These are mostly of silver, although other minerals and gems
                    are found in the neighbourhood. The hours of labour in tl∣e Nertchinsk mines
                    were thirteen, and it was the same at the Kara gold mines. The convicts arrange
                    their hours of work themselves. No definite amount of mineral was required, so
                    they might work hard or not as they pleased. No doubt the lot of convicts in
                    these mines was hard. Besides the laxity of discipline, the herding together of
                    the worst characters and the deprivation of social, intellectual, and religious
                    privileges must have made life a burden to many.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spain,</hi> like Portugal, still lags behind. It is not to the
                    credit of a country in which prison discipline was discussed three centuries ago
                    that now at the close of the 19th its prison system is about the worst in
                    Europe. Till very recently the posts of governors in the jails were sold to the
                    highest bidder, and purchasers were suffered to recoup themselves out of the
                    unfortunate wretches committed to their charge. The principal prison in the
                    capital of the kingdom was nothing more than a converted slaughter house where
                    pigs were killed and salted, as its name, the Saladero, implied. This dark,
                    dirty, noisome den, although generally condemned, continues to serve even now.
                    Numerous efforts to provide a more suitable prison have been made from time to
                    time. The <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n786/mode/1up"

                <p>construction of model prisons was decreed as far back as 1847, but in 1860
                    nothing had been done, and a new project was brought forward. Again in 1869 a
                    fresh scheme replaced the previous ones, which were still dead letters. Seven
                    more years elapsed, and in 1876 a new law was passed providing for the
                    construction of a new cellular prison in Madrid with cells for a thousand
                    prisoners. This law too hung fire, and the prison is not yet completed. The bulk
                    of the prison population in Spain is still sent to <hi rend="italic"
                    >presidios,</hi> or convict establishments, where general association both in
                    the prison and at labour is the rule. The principal of these are situated at
                    Cartagena, Valencia, where there are two prisons, Valladolid, Granada, and
                    Burgos. There are also prisons at Alcala, Tarragona, Saragossa, and Santona.
                    Persons convicted of grave crimes are deported to the Balearic Islands or to the
                    penal settlements in Africa, the principal of which are situated at Ceuta and
                    Melilla. Throughout these establishments there is an utter absence of sanitary
                    regulations; the diet is coarse and meagre; the discipline is brutal; the
                    authorities are quite callous; and morality does not exist. The Spanish
                    authorities, however, claim the credit of having abolished corporal punishment
                    in their prisons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sweden.—</hi> A great impetus was given to prison reform in
                    Sweden by the interest taken in the question by King Oscar I. in 1840. Following
                    special legislation, thirty-eight new cellular prisons were built in the various
                    provinces of the kingdom. These prisons have been used since for all prisoners
                    awaiting trial, those condemned to reclusion and those sentenced to imprisonment
                    with hard labour for two years and under. Persons sentenced to pay fines, but
                    unable to pay, go to the cellular prisons. The isolation is continuous day and
                    night. Besides these cellular there are a number of associated prisons for terms
                    longer than two years and up to life. The labour in the first-named is of the
                    usual kind—tailoring, shoemaking, and some kinds of carpentry. Trade instructors
                    are specially appointed, so as to provide a prisoner on liberation with some
                    employment. In the associated prisons there is more variety of work: linen and
                    woollen cloths are manufactured, timber split up for matches, granite cut and
                    dressed for buildings and pavements. The female prisoners weave textile fabrics,
                    and make match boxes. A portion of the earnings is granted to prisoners, which,
                    to a limited extent, may be spent in buying extra food. There is no purely penal
                    labour, nor any regulated system of granting remissions for industry or good
                    conduct. Many aid societies were formed about twenty-five years ago, but through
                    want of success or funds their number has dwindled down to two.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Switzerland. —</hi> From the complete independence of each
                    canton, each has its own special penal system and places of imprisonment. Hence
                    the systems are various, and are not all equally good. The prisons of
                    Switzerland may be divided into four groups :—(1) those of the cantons of Uri,
                    Schwyz, Unterwalden, and Valais, which are still of a patriarchal character; (2)
                    those of Fribourg, Basel (rural), and Lucerne, which are on the associated plan
                    and unsatisfactory from every point of view; (3) those of the cantons of St
                    Gall, Vaud, Geneva, and Zurich, which have prisons for associated labour and
                    separation at night, while Soleure, Grisons, Bern, and Schaffhausen are
                    labouring to raise their prisons to this level; (5) the penitentiaries of
                    Lenzburg, Basel (urban), Neuchâtel, and Ticino, which are good modern prisons in
                    which the cellular system is completely applied. The system is one of
                    progression, the prisoner passes through several stages of isolation, employment
                    in association, and comparative freedom; but only at Neuchâtel is there
                    separation by day as well as night. The general principle is one of collective
                    imprisonment; but there is an attempt at classification, according to degrees of
                    morality, in the best prisons. Sentences may be either to imprisonment or
                    reclusion with hard labour. The first may be from twenty-four hours to five
                    years; the second from one year to fifteen, twenty, thirty years, or to life. An
                    abbreviation of punishment may under all the cantonal laws be obtained, but such
                    reduction is rarely made according to fixed rules. In most of the cantons
                    prisoners have a share in their own labour. This labour is chiefly industrial,
                    but there is a form of penal labour to be seen where the plan has survived of
                    employing certain prisoners to sweep the streets, make roads, or dyke the
                    rivers. Such labour is felt to have a bad moral effect, and industrial labour is
                    preferred. The latter is conducted by the administration itself, and not by
                    contractors. It is thought that the state can introduce a greater variety of
                    employments, and control the prisoner better when at labour than could free
                    employers. Aid societies exist in most of the cantons; the first was established
                    at St Gall about 1845. Wherever they exist the societies protect prisoners in
                    durance and assist prisoners on release by providing tools and employment with
                    private persons. The only drawback in the Swiss aid societies is the want of
                    organization and uniformity of action.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> There is no uniform prison system in the
                    United States. The variety of jurisdictions following the constant extension of
                    territory and development of communities more or less populous perpetuates
                    changing conditions, and the supreme Government has not concerned itself greatly
                    with prison affairs, and has claimed no supervision or special control. The rule
                    of local selfgovernment has left each jurisdiction to manage its prison
                    according to its own ideas, and hence the utmost diversity of practice still
                    obtains. While some prisons are as good as need be, others are marked with many
                    defects. There is a wide distinction between the best and the worst. In the
                    country which initiated prison reform, numbers of prisons exist nowadays which
                    fall far below the commonest requirements of a good prison system. Taken
                    broadly, the prisons of the Union may be classed into—(1) State prisons; (2)
                    district prisons; (3) county prisons; (4) municipal or city prisons. Each State
                    as a rule has its own State prison, but Pennsylvania and Indiana have two and
                    New York three such prisons. The cellular system, or the rule of continuous
                    separation, to which reference has been made already (see p. 753), was at first
                    followed by several States, but gradually abandoned in favour of the so-called
                    silent system, or that of labour in association under the rule of silence, with
                    cellular separation at night. At the present time there is but one prison, the
                    Eastern Penitentiary of Philadelphia, managed on the purely solitary plan. Of
                    the long-sentenced convicts 96 per cent, are now confined in congregate prisons.
                    There are about forty State prisons in all. Of the distinct prisons intermediate
                    between the State and the county prisons there· are but few. The county prisons
                    are by far the most numerous. The county in the United States is the unit of
                    political organization under the State, and, with area and population
                    comparatively limited, is a convenient subdivison for the purposes of the
                    criminal law. Hence it has been asserted that no one knows exactly the number of
                    county prisons in the United States, but it has been computed at upwards of two
                    thousand. The city or municipal prisons are also very numerous and constantly
                    increasing. Each and every one, as in the State prisons, is managed locally by
                    local authorities, with the inevitable result of the utmost diversity in
                    practice, and often enough the utmost neglect of the commonest rules of prison
                    discipline. A self-constituted body inspected a couple of hundred of these jails
                    a few years back, and reported that they were mostly defective from a sanitary
                    point of view, insecure, and so constructed as to compel the promiscuous
                    association of all classes old and young, the guilty and innocent, the novice
                    and the hardened in crime. The sexes even were not invariably separated. Little
                    or no employment was provided for the prisoners, and in few prisons was any
                    effort made to compass religious or intellectual culture. An eyewitness, Dr
                    Wines, reporting of other jails of the same class still more recently,
                    unhesitatingly condemned them. “Ohio, to-day,” says the Ohio Board of Charity,
                    “supports base seminaries of crime at public expense.” “In our jail system
                    lingers more barbarism than in all our other State institutions together.” Yet
                    there are a few and conspicuous exceptions to the general verdict of
                    condemnation. The discipline and management of the district prisons at Albany,
                    Detroit, Rochester, and Pittsburgh are excellent. The good example is gradually
                    becoming more and more largely imitated. Where good prisons exist it will be
                    found that their administration remains for some length of time in intelligent
                    hands, free from the “pernicious influence of partisan politics.” The chief
                    drawback to improvement is the uncertainty no less than the complexity of the
                    governing bodies. These are apt to be changed capriciously; and, what is worse,
                    they are needlessly intricate and often far too numerous. They act
                    independently, without reference to each other, and they are not too ready to
                    benefit by example and experience. What is wanted is a supreme central authority
                    over all the prisons of a State, if not throughout the Union. Wherever there is
                    the nearest approach to this the results are most satisfactory.</p>
                <p>It is not strange that under these conditions discipline should also vary
                    greatly, or, as has been said, “every variety of discipline, lack of discipline,
                    or abuse of discipline is found.’ Neither the deterrent nor the reformatory
                    agencies are properly or uniformly brought to bear. Prison punishments are still
                    severe; although flogging is nominally abolished, it is said to be still
                    practised in prisons where it is forbidden; and some more ancient methods such
                    as the yoke, the shower bath, and the iron crown have not yet entirely
                    disappeared. There is, however, often good secular and religious instruction.
                    The dietaries are fuller than on the opposite side of the Atlantic, meat is a
                    more common ingredient, and Indian meal is very largely issued. The financial
                    results obtained are not unsatisfactory: many of the State prisons are now
                    self-supporting, and an examination of the labour returns will prove that much
                    enterprise has been displayed in finding employment for the prisoners. There is
                    no purely penal labour, although much of the labour performed is sufficiently
                    severe. There may be no treadwheel or cranks, but convicts in Alabama and Texas
                    have been employed to build railways; they have raised cotton in Mississippi,
                    and have worked mines in Tennessee and New York, while in many States they are
                    utilized in gardening and agriculture. A great deal of labour has been expended
                    on quarrying and dressing stone for building, or for burning into quicklime; at
                    Auburn there is a large manufactory of agricultural tools; Ohio employs
                    saddlers; Massachusetts prisoners make ornamental iron work; in Michigan they
                    tan leather; and at Dannemora, in northern New York, iron ore is quarried,
                    smelted, forged, and wrought into nails by the prisoners.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n787/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0787-0764"/>
                <p>In general the labour is hired by contractors at a fixed sum per day, which
                    varies from a few cents to as much as a dollar. The chief cause for the present
                    inadequacy of the American prisons, over and above the faults in administration
                    already mentioned, is probably the rapidly increased demand on their
                    accommodation in recent years. This is due partly to the growth of population,
                    partly also to the influx of “coloured” criminals since the emancipation. In the
                    days of slavery the slave was punished summarily by his master, but now he is
                    arraigned and sent to prison. The result has been that the prisons were suddenly
                    crowded before any new and improved system could be introduced.</p>
                <p>While there are but few agencies for the assistance of discharged prisoners,
                    considerable care is devoted in the United States to the treatment and checking
                    of juvenile crime. Reformatories have existed since 1825, when the first was
                    established on Randall’s Island within the limits of the city of New York.
                    Others followed; but these did not form part of the penal system of the States
                    till 1847, when the State reform school at Westborough was established by law.
                    They soon increased and multiplied, and now between sixteen and twenty are to be
                    found within the principal States. There are also a number of semi-public
                    schools. The average reformatory population is about 15,000. The results are
                    said to be very satisfactory. The percentage of youths reformed and trained into
                    good citizens has been placed as high as 60, 75, even 80 per cent. Parents may
                    in some States contribute to the support of their children in reformatories, but
                    as a rule the inmates are orphans or abandoned children or those whose parents
                    are very poor. The best system for training and caring for juvenile offenders
                    probably is that which obtains in Massachusetts. (A. G. )</p>
