                    a Greek goddess, daughter of Zeus and the earth-goddess Demeter. In Greek
                    mythology Demeter and Proserpine were closely associated, being known together
                    as the two goddesses, the venerable or august goddesses, sometimes as the great
                    goddesses. Proserpine herself was commonly known as the daughter (Core),
                    sometimes as the first-born. As she was gathering flowers with her playmates in
                    a meadow, the earth opened and Pluto, god of the dead, appeared and carried her
                    off to be his queen in the world below. This legend was localized hi various
                    places, as at Eleusis, Lerna, and “that fair field of Enna” in Sicily. Torch in
                    hand, her sorrowing mother sought her through the wide world, and finding her
                    not she forbade the earth to put forth its increase. So all that year not a
                    blade of corn grew on the earth, and men would have died of hunger if Zeus had
                    not persuaded Pluto to let Proserpine go. But before he let her go Pluto made
                    her eat the seed of a pomegranate, and thus she could not stay away from him for
                    ever.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The idea that
                    persons who have made their way to the abode of the dead can return to the upper
                    world if they have not tasted the food of the dead appears elsewhere, as in New
                    Zealand (R. Taylor, <hi rend="italic">New Zealand,</hi> pp. 233,
                    271).</p></note> So it was arranged that she should spend two-thirds (according
                    to later authors, one-half) of every year with her mother and the heavenly gods,
                    and should pass the rest of the year with Pluto beneath the earth. There can be
                    little doubt that this is a mythological expression for the growth of vegetation
                    in spring and its disappearance in autumn. According to Theopompus there was a
                    Western people who actually called the spring Proserpine. As wife of Pluto, she
                    sent spectres, ruled the ghosts, and carried into effect the curses of men. The
                    lake of Avernus, as an entrance to the infernal regions, was sacred to her. From
                    the head of a dying person Proserpine was supposed to cut a lock of hair which
                    had been kept sacred and unshorn through life.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Aen.,</hi> iv. 698 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi> It appears to have been a Greek custom to cut a lock of
                    hair from a dead man’s head, and hang it outside of the house door, in token
                    that there was a corpse in the house. At least this seems a fair inference from
                    Eurip., <hi rend="italic">Ale.,</hi> 75, 76, 101-4. The lock so cut may have
                    been that which was kept sacred to the gods and unshorn <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Etym,. Mag., s.υ.,</hi><hi rend="italic">aπeσκoλυμμevos).</hi> For examples of
                    hair dedicated to gods, see 7Z., xxiii. 141 <hi rend="italic">sq.;</hi> Plut.,
                    <hi rend="italic">Thes.,</hi> 5; Paus., viii. 20, 3. In Tibet a lama (priest) is
                    called in to cut off some hairs 1rom the head of a &lt;lying person, in order
                    that his soul may escape through the top of his head, which is deemed an
                    essential condition of a good transmigration (Horace de la Penna, in Bogle and
                    Manning’s <hi rend="italic">Travées</hi><hi rend="italic">in Tibet). Via</hi>
                    can hardly doubt that the intention of the Graeco-Roman custom was similar. In
                    modern Greece the god of death, Charos, is supposed to draw the soul out of the
                    body, and if a man resists the Arachobites believe that Charos slits open his
                    breast (B. Schmidt, <hi rend="italic">Volksleben der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Neugriechen,</hi> p. 228). There are other instances of incisions made in the
                    body of a dying person to allow his soul to escape (cp. Bastian, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mensch,</hi> ii. 342). The custom probably dates from the times
                    when death in battle was the usual death. In the legend of Nisus and Scylla
                    there is a trace of the custom which was still observed in classical times in
                    the sacrifice of animals. The practice of cutting off the hair of the dead
                    prevailed in India, though it does not appear in the Vedas (Monier Williams, <hi
                    rend="italic">Religious Thought</hi><hi rend="italic">and Life in India,</hi> p.
                    281). We are reminded of the practice of the Pawnees and other North American
                    Indians, who shaved the head with the exception of one lock (the scalp-lock),
                    which was removed by a victorious enemy (Catlin, <hi rend="italic">North
                    American Indians,</hi> vol. ii. P∙,,&gt;∙ <hi rend="superscript"> The</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> fc</hi> &gt; <hi rend="superscript"> andwich</hi> Islanders
                    also cut a lock from a slain foe (Ellis, <hi rend="italic">Pol. Res.,</hi> vol.
                    iv. p. 159).</p></note> She was sometimes identified with Hecate. On the other
                    hand in her character of goddess of the spring she was honoured with
                    flower-festivals in Sicily and at</p>
                <p>Hipponium in Italy. Sicily was a favourite haunt of the&gt; two goddesses, and
                    ancient tradition affirmed that the whole island was sacred to them. The
                    Sicilians claimed to be the first on whom Demeter had bestowed the gift of corn,
                    and hence they honoured the two goddesses with many festivals. They celebrated
                    the festival of Demeter when the corn began to shoot, and the descent of
                    Proserpine when it was ripe. At Cyare, a fountain near Syracuse which Pluto made
                    to spring up when he carried off his bride, the Syracusians held an annual
                    festival in the course of which bulls were sacrificed by being drowned in the
                    water. At Cyzicus also, in Asia Minor, bulls were sacrificed to Proserpine.
                    Demeter and Proserpine were worshipped together by the Athenians at the greater
                    and less Eleusinian festivals, held in autumn and spring respectively. In the
                    Eleusinian mysteries Proserpine nodoubt played an important part (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Eleusinia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Mysteries).</hi> One
                    Greek writer, Achemachus, identified Proserpine with the Egyptian Isis. At Rome
                    Proserpine was associated with Ceres (the Roman representative of Demeter) in
                    the festival of the Cerealia (April 12 to 19), she was represented as the wife
                    of Dis Pater (the Roman Pluto), and was sometimes identified with the native
                    Latin goddess Libera. The pomegranate was Proserpine’s· symbol, and the pigeon
                    and cock were sacred to her. Her votaries abstained from the flesh of domestic
                    fowls, fish, beans, pomegranates, and apples. In works of art she appears with a
                    cornucopia or with ears of com and a cock. The regular form of her name in Greek
                    was Persephone, but various other forms occur—Phersephone, Persephassa,
                    Phersephassa, Pherrephatta, &amp;c., to explain which different etymologies were
                    invented. Corresponding to Proserpine as goddess of the dead is the old Norse
                    goddess <hi rend="italic">Hel</hi> (Gothic <hi rend="italic">Haifa),</hi> whom
                    Saxo Grammaticus calls Proserpine. (j. o. <hi rend="smallcaps">er.)</hi></p>
