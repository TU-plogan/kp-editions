                    Dominican order, passing from the monastery of Voghera to that of Vigevano, and
                    thence to Bologna. Having been ordained priest at Genoa in 1528, he settled at
                    Pavia, where he lectured for sixteen years. He soon gave evidence of the
                    opinions which found a more practical expression in his pontificate, by
                    advancing at Parma thirty propositions in support of the papal chair and against
                    the heresies of the time. As president of more than one Dominican monastery he
                    proved himself a rigid disciplinarian, and, in accordance with his own wish to
                    discharge the office of inquisitor, received an appointment to that post at
                    Como. His zeal provoking resentment, he was compelled in 1550 to return to Rome,
                    where, after having been employed in several inquisitorial missions, he was
                    elected to the commissariat of the Holy Office. Paul IV., who while still
                    Cardinal Caraffa had shown him special favour, conferred upon him the bishopric
                    of Sutri and Nepi, the cardinalate with the title of Alessandrino, and the
                    honour—unique in one not of pontifical rank—of the supreme inquisitorship. Under
                    Pius IV. he became bishop of Mondovi in Piedmont, but his opposition to that
                    pontiff procured his dismissal from the palace and the abridgment of his
                    authority as inquisitor.</p>
                <p>Before Ghislieri could return to his episcopate, Pius IV. died, and on January 7,
                    1566, he was elected to the papal chair with duly attendant prodigies, his
                    coronation taking place on his birthday, ten days later. Fully alive to the
                    necessity of restoring discipline and morality at Rome to ensure success
                    without, he at once proceeded to reduce the cost of the papal court, compel
                    residence, regulate inns, expel prostitutes, and assert the importance of
                    ceremonial. In his wider policy, which was characterized throughout by a
                    stringency which tended to defeat its own ends, the maintenance and increase of
                    the efficacy of the Inquisition and the enforcement of the canons and decrees of
                    the Tridentine council had precedence over all other considerations. The
                    prudence of Commendone alone saved him at the commencement of his pontificate
                    from trouble with Germany, as in the general diet of the empire at Augsburg
                    (March 26, 1566) Pius saw a threatened invasion of his own supremacy and was
                    desirous of limiting its discussions. In France, where his influence was
                    stronger, he directed the dismissal of Cardinal Odet de Coligny and seven
                    bishops, nullified the royal edict tolerating the extra-mural services of the
                    Reformers, introduced the Roman catechism, restored papal discipline, and
                    strenuously opposed all compromise with the heretics—his exertions leading up in
                    no small degree to the massacre of St Bartholomew. In the list of more important
                    bulls issued by him the famous bull “In Ccena Domini” (1568) takes a leading
                    place; but amongst others throwing light on his character and policy there may
                    be mentioned his prohibition of quaestuary (February 1567 and January 1570); the
                    condemnation of Michael Baius, the heretical professor of Louvain (1567); the
                    reform of the breviary (July 1568); the denunciation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dirum nefas</hi> (August 1568); the banishment of the Jews from the
                    ecclesiastical dominions except Rome and Ancona (1569); the injunction of the
                    use of the reformed missal (July 1570); the confirmation of the privileges of
                    the Society of Crusaders for the protection of the Inquisition (October 1570);
                    the prohibition of discussions concerning the miraculous conception (November
                    1570); the suppression of the Fratres Humiliati for alleged profligacy (February
                    1571); the approbation of the new office of the Blessed Virgin (March 1571); the
                    enforcement of the daily recitation of the canonical hours (September 1571); and
                    the purchase of assistance against the Turks by offers of plenary pardon (March
                    1572). His antagonism to Elizabeth was shown, not only in the countenance lent
                    by him to Mary Stuart and those who sought in her name to deliver England “ex
                    turpissima muliebris libidinis servitute,” but in the publication of a bull,
                    dated April 27, 1570, excommunicating Elizabeth and releasing her subjects from
                    their allegiance. His energy was in no respect more favourably exhibited than in
                    his persistent and successful endeavours to form a general league against the
                    Turks, as the result of which the battle of Lepanto (Oct. 7, 1571) was won by
                    the combined fleet under Colonna. Three national synods were held during his
                    pontificate— at Naples under Cardinal Alfonso Caraffa (whose family had, after
                    inquiry, been reinstated by Pius V.), at Milan under Carlo Borromeo, and at
                    Mechlin. His death took place on May 1, 1572, and he was canonized by Clement
                    XI. on May 24 th 1712. He was succeeded by Gregory</p>
