                    solution. Insoluble colours, when used in printing textile fabrics, are
                    distinguished as pigment colours. The sources of materials available as pigments
                    are numerous; many are native coloured earths, others are separated from native
                    metallic compounds and other mineral substances; a large number are artificially
                    prepared from inorganic—principally metallic—sources; an important class consist
                    of animal and vegetable colouring principles, forming with earthy bodies
                    insoluble powders called lakes; and the dye-stuffs artificially obtained from
                    organic sources are also similarly utilized. In fact all substances coloured or
                    neutral, capable of being presented in the form of impalpable powder, which at
                    the same time are insoluble and unalterable under ordinary atmospheric
                    influences, may be regarded as possible pigments. But there are many qualities
                    practically essential in a pigment which limit the range of available
                    substances. A consideration of the first importance is the “body” or covering
                    power of a pigment,—that is, the property of fully covering and concealing with
                    an opaque coating the surface over which it is spread. It is also important that
                    the material should work well in, and be unaffected in appearance and
                    constitution by the medium with which it is made into a paint, and that it
                    should spread in an even uniform coat, which should dry well and quickly in the
                    air and adhere firmly to the surface to which it is applied. When dry it should
                    possess durability and resist change under the action of weather and other
                    influences to which paint is exposed. These are the principal qualities
                    requisite in paints in their important function of preservative coatings for the
                    surfaces to which they are applied. On their artistic side, as decorative and
                    pictorial materials, pigments should possess purity and brightness of colour
                    with intensity of tinting power, capacity for mixing or coming into contact with
                    other colours without injuriously <pb break="no"

                    and permanence and unalterability of tone after long exposure.</p>
                <p>Pigments being so numerous and so diverse in their origin, the industries
                    connected with their production and preparation are of necessity varied in
                    character. Many of the substances employed being used in large quantities in
                    other important industrial relations, as well as for paints, are manufactured on
                    a large scale and constitute the basis of considerable chemical industries, as,
                    for example, the manufacture of white lead, Prussian blue, ultramarine, the
                    chrome materials, &amp;c. In other cases the materials require no preparation
                    other than that given to them by the paint-grinder or the artists’ colourman,
                    according to the purpose for which the substances are to be prepared.</p>
                <p>The colour trade embraces two distinct departments :— that of the paint-grinder,
                    who manufactures and compounds the pigments used by artisans, house-painters,
                    and paper-stainers; and that of the artists’ colour man, who prepares and
                    supplies the finer, more brilliant, and extensive assortment of pigments used
                    for artistic purposes. The pigments employed for pottery painting and glass and
                    enamel work are a special class of preparations to suit the requirements of
                    these trades. Leaving out of account the chemical reactions involved in
                    preparing raw materials, the ordinary manufacturing operations connected with
                    the preparation of painters’ colours are simple, and consist essentially of a
                    careful system of grinding. Formerly, when painters ground their own colours, a
                    stone slab and muller formed the entire apparatus; but now, when paintgrinding
                    has become a separate industry, efficient machinery has been devised for
                    grinding and its collateral operations. Bulky and rough colours such as whiting
                    and common ochres are dry-ground under heavy edge stones which revolve in a
                    strong iron bed. Ordinary dry colours requiring to be pulverized with more care
                    are mixed to a thin cream with water, which is fed into and ground principally
                    between a pair of millstones dressed and mounted like the ordinary horizontal
                    stones of a flour mill, but smaller in diameter. For fine colours the pigment so
                    ground is levigated, or floated into a vat in which the heavier particles sink,
                    and the lighter, more finely divided portion is run into another vessel at a
                    lower level, where it is deposited as a fine sediment. The sediment is dried in
                    a uniformly heated stove, and when thoroughly dry is again pulverized under a
                    pair of edge stones, and sifted or winnowed; so treated it is ready for use as
                    dry colour. The greater proportion of the white lead and the other common oil
                    paints are ground in oil. For this purpose the raw material is mixed in a
                    machine with oil (sometimes boiled) to the consistence of a stiffish paste, and
                    in this state it is ground in horizontal paint millstones, after which it
                    requires no further preparation than the necessary thinning with oil when to be
                    used for painting. There are many varieties of apparatus used for grinding both
                    dry and oil colours.</p>
                <p>The artists’ colourman grinds his pigments with much greater labour, and selects
                    his materials in a more careful manner, than is necessary in the case of the
                    ordinary paint-grinder. Pigments for artistic painting in oil are ground in that
                    medium to a definite consistency, and are put up for use in convenient
                    compressible tubes of tin. For water colours the pigments are prepared
                    principally in the form of small indurated cakes or as “moist colours” contained
                    in small porcelain dishes. Water colours may also be obtained thin in tin tubes
                    like oil colours, or as “pastilles,” which are thin round cakes intermediate in
                    condition between cake and moist colours.</p>
                <p>In enumerating the principal commercial pigments it is usual and convenient to
                    classify them according to their tints. They are not, as a rule, definite
                    chemical compounds: many indeed are mixed substances prepared by processes and
                    according to recipes known only to their makers; and, while the same commercial
                    name is frequently given to substances quite dissimilar in character, the
                    confusion is further increased by applying many different titles to substances
                    which are practically identi. cal. Thus white lead is known by at least a dozen
                    names, and distinct and even conflicting qualities are by authorities attributed
                    to this one substance under its various aliases.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible to catalogue all the paints met with in commercial lists,
                    and it would serve no good purpose to enumerate the whole of the pigments which
                    might be and are occasionally used. Premising that details regarding many of the
                    substances will be found under the heading of the metals, &lt;fcc., whence they
                    are derived, we shall here simply classify, according to their colour, the
                    principal well-recognized pigments of commerce, adding brief remarks regarding
                    each class.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">White Pigments.</hi> —The whites are the most important
                    pigments used by painters, forming as they do the basis or body of nearly all
                    paints, excepting only certain dark hues. Good available whites are limited in
                    number, and all of real importance are included in the following list :—white
                    lead, a carbonate of lead (chiefly); zinc white, oxide of zinc, called also
                    Chinese white; antimony white, oxide of antimony; fixed white, sulphate of
                    baryta; “silicate” white, sulphate of baryta, or strontia and sulphide of zinc;
                    mineral white, powdered gypsum (with alumina it forms satin white); chalk or
                    whiting carbonate of lime· and china clay, silicate of alumina.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">White Lead</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lead,</hi> vol. xiv.
                    p. 378) is the most important of all pigments, and forms the basis of nearly all
                    ordinary oil paints, which, when coloured, consist of white lead tinted with the
                    necessary coloured pigments. It possesses the greatest amount of body or
                    covering power, and works beautifully in oil, with which it partially combines,
                    drying as a hard homogeneous adherent plaster. On the other hand it is a most
                    poisonous body, very injurious to the persons connected with many of the
                    processes by which it is prepared. As an oil colour it darkens gradually in an
                    atmosphere containing traces of sulphur; it cannot be used at all as a water or
                    distemper colour; and it acts injuriously on the colour of several important
                    pigments. Notwithstanding these drawbacks no white has yet been made that can
                    compete with white lead, although paint manufacturers go far to provide a
                    substitute by adulterating it to such an extent that the white lead frequently
                    bears only a small ratio to the adulterant. Baryta white is the ordinary
                    adulterant, and among respectable manufacturers the intermixture is a
                    well-understood fact, and the relative proportions of white lead and baryta are
                    regulated by a series of grades passing from “genuine” to No. 5 or No. 6 white
                    lead. Many efforts have been made to substitute for ordinary white lead lead
                    carbonates made by other processes, and other lead salts such as the oxychloride
                    (Pattinson’s), sulphate, tungstate, antimoniate, &amp;c.; but none of these has
                    proved permanently successful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Zinc White.—</hi> Next in importance to white lead, is an oxide
                    of zinc prepared by the sublimation and combustion of metallic zinc. The pigment
                    is deficient in covering power and it dries but slowly when mixed with oil. On
                    the other hand it is not injurious to health, its purity of tone is not affected
                    by sulphurous air, it does not affect tints added to it or with which it comes
                    in contact, and it can be used in water as well as in oil. Like white lead it is
                    very much adulterated, and generally with the same agent—baryta white.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Baryta White</hi> plays an important independent part as well
                    as acting so extensively as a sophisticator of other pigments. It is prepared by
                    grinding to a fine powder the pure white native sulphate of baryta (heavy spar),
                    and the same substance artificially prepared is known as permanent white or <hi
                    rend="italic">blanc fixé.</hi> The artificial preparation is much superior, as a
                    pigment, to the powdered spar; but both are deficient in body, notwithstanding
                    which they are of great value to paper-stainers and for distemper painting.</p>
                <p>Under the name of <hi rend="italic">Charlton White</hi> or silicate paints, Mr J.
                    B. Orr prepares a range of white paints which have come into extensive use. The
                    pigment as originally prepared under Mr Orr’s patent of 1874 consisted of an
                    intimate mixture of artificial sulphate of baryta and sulphide of zinc in
                    certain proportions, made by the double decomposition of solutions of barium
                    sulphide and sulphate of zinc. In 1881 a patent was secured by Mr Orr for a
                    combination in which strontia takes the place of baryta. It is claimed for these
                    pigments that they possess body greater than white lead, that they are
                    non-poisonous, and that with certain modifications in the manufacture they can
                    be made quite as valuable for distemper painting as for oil colours.</p>

                <p>The oxides of antimony, tin, bismuth, &amp;c., form white pigments; but these
                    possess no peculiarities which render them valuable for painters’ use. The
                    carbonate of lime, more or less pure and in various degrees of pulverulence
                    under several names, such as <hi rend="italic">Chalk White, Paris White,
                    Whiting,</hi> &amp;c., is very extensively used in distemper work for walls,
                    roofs, &amp;c., and in paper-staining, occupying in these relations the
                    important place held by white lead in oil painting. Mineral white or satin white
                    consists of powdered gypsum and alumina, a preparation very largely used by
                    paper-stainers for their glossy satin bodies. There are several other white
                    earths of relatively little importance as pigments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Blue Pigments.</hi> —The list of blue colours of real
                    importance is not extensive, comprising, as principal items, ultramarine,
                    Prussian blue, the cobalt blues, and indigo. The following list embraces the
                    names and varieties ordinarily recognized in commerce :—ultramarine (native),
                    powdered lapis lazuli; ultramarine (artificial), silicates of alumina and soda
                    with sulphide of sodium; Prussian blue, cyanide of iron; Paris blue, modified
                    Prussian blue; Antwerp blue, fine Prussian blue; smalts, a cobalt glass; azure
                    blue, a preparation of smalts; cobalt or Thenard’s blue, sub-phosphate of
                    cobalt; caeruleum, stannate of cobalt and sulphate of lime; mountain blue,
                    native carbonate of copper; lime blue, carbonate of copper and lime; Verdi ter

                <p>Apart from the important colours <hi rend="smallcaps">Ultramarine, Prussian
                    Blue,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Indigo,</hi> separately noticed, these
                    blues, which are not of much value for painters, owe their colour principally to
                    cobalt and copper. The principal cobalt colour is <hi rend="italic">Smalts,</hi>
                    called also strewing smalts, cobalt glass, zaffre, Saxony blue, &amp;c. It is
                    prepared by smelting together the mineral arsenide of cobalt, pure sand, and
                    carbonate of potash into a glass. The molten glass is cast into cold water, then
                    ground fine and levigated. Smalts is chiefly available for distemper and fresco
                    painting, and is not much used as an oil colour. <hi rend="italic">Azure
                    Blue</hi> is generally recognized as a preparation of smalts, but the name is
                    given to several compounds. <hi rend="italic">Cxruleum</hi> is a light blue
                    colour of durable quality with a greenish tinge, consisting of a combination of
                    cobalt oxide with stannic acid; and <hi rend="italic">Cobalt Blue,</hi> the
                    subphosphate of cobalt, a colour discovered by Thenard, possesses a purple
                    tinge. Carbonate of copper, either in the form of the mineral azurite or
                    artificially prepared, is a principal source of the copper blues, which,
                    however, possess little value as pigments owing to their tendency to blacken
                    under exposure. <hi rend="italic">Blue Verditer,</hi> a greenish blue which
                    passes into green verditer, is a hydrated oxide of copper.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Yellow Pigments.</hi> —The following list includes the
                    ordinary yellow colours of commerce :—ochres and sienna earth, native earths
                    tinted with iron; Mars yellow, hydrated ferric oxide; chromes, chromates of lead
                    and other metals; massicot, protoxide of lead; Naples yellow, antimoniate of
                    lead; mineral yellow, basic chloride of lead; aureolin, nitrate of potassium and
                    cobalt; cadmium yellow, sulphide of cadmium; orpiment, trisulphide of arsenic;
                    Indian yellow, urio-phosphate of calcium; gamboge, resin of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Garcinia</hi>; Dutch pink, a vegetable lake; yellow lakes.</p>
                <p>Of these colours the more important are the ochres and the various combinations
                    containing chromium. The <hi rend="italic">Yellow Ochres</hi> are native earths
                    coloured with hydrated ferric oxide, the brownish yellow substance that colours,
                    and is deposited from, highly ferruginous water. These ochres are of two
                    kinds—one having an argillaceous basis, while the other is a calcareous earth,
                    the argillaceous variety being in general the richer and more pure in colour of
                    the two. Both kinds are widely distributed, fine qualities being found in
                    Oxfordshire, the Isle of Wight, near Jena and Nuremberg in Germany, and in
                    France in the departments of Yonne, Cher, and Nièvre. The original colour of
                    these ochres can be modified and varied into browns and reds of more or less
                    intensity by calcination. The high heat expels the water of hydration from the
                    iron oxide, changing it into red ferric oxide. The nature of the associated
                    earth also influences the colour assumed by an ochre under calcination,
                    aluminous ochres developing red and violet ’tints, while the calcareous
                    varieties take brownish red and dark brown hues. The well-known ochre <hi
                    rend="italic">Terra da Sienna</hi> which in its raw state is a dull-coloured
                    ochre, becomes when burnt a fine warm mahogany brown hue highly valued for
                    artistic purposes. Yellojy ochres are also artificially prepared— <hi
                    rend="italic">Mars Yellow</hi> being either pure hydrated ferric oxide or an
                    intimate mixture of that substance with an argillaceous or calcareous earth, and
                    such compounds by careful calcination can be transformed into <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mars Orange, Violet,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Red,</hi> all highly important,
                    stable, and reliable tints. The metal chromium owes its name to the intense
                    coloration produced by the combination of its oxide, chromic acid, with various
                    metals and alkaline earths. Several of these salts are soluble, but those which
                    form pigments are insoluble compounds. The principal chrome pigments—the various
                    shades of lemon and yellow chrome deepening to orange tints—are composed of the
                    neutral chromate of lead, the difference of hue depending on the greater or
                    smaller proportion of lead used in the preparation. The basic chromate of lead
                    has a deep orange colour passing into the minium-red-like hue of chrome red. <hi
                    rend="italic">Strontia Chrome,</hi> the chromate of strontium, is a pale lemon
                    pigment of fine quality and permanence. With zinc, chromic acid forms two
                    combinations, neutral and basic, both possessed of an intense yellow colour; and
                    chromate of barium also furnishes a useful yellow colour. Lead itself, without
                    chromium, is the basis of several valuable yellows. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Massicot,</hi> the protoxide of lead, is a clear yellow pigment deficient in

                    artists, is an antimoniate of lead which in early times was obtained from native
                    sources; and <hi rend="italic">Mineral Yellow</hi> is an oxychloride of lead.
                    The sulphide of cadmium forms the fine durable <hi rend="italic">Cadmium
                    Yellow,</hi> a colour now much appreciated for artistic use. The arsenical
                    yellow, <hi rend="italic">Orpiment,</hi> is now little used as a pigment,
                    although formerly, under such names as <hi rend="italic">King’s Yellow, Imperial
                    Yellow,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chinese Yellow,</hi> it was held in high
                    esteem by artists. <hi rend="italic">Aureolin,</hi> a nitrate of potassium and
                    cobalt, is a colour of recent origin which has come into high favour among
                    artists. <hi rend="italic">Indian Yellow</hi> is a colour of animal origin of no
                    permanence, and <hi rend="italic">Gamboge</hi> is a gum resin yielded by trees
                    of the genus <hi rend="italic">Garcinia,</hi> principally employed as a water
                    colour. The yellow lakes are comparatively unimportant, but some, known, rather
                    absurdly, as <hi rend="italic">Dutch, English,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Italian
                    Pink,</hi> are largely used in paper-staining.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Red Pigments</hi> embrace two distinct series of
                    substances—the reds of inorganic origin, and red lakes obtained from animal and
                    vegetable colours. The principal commercial varieties are as follows :—rouge,
                    Turkey red, and Indian red, red fρrric oxide; Venetian red, ochreous ferric
                    oxide; ochres, earths coloured by ferric oxide; vermilion and cinnabar, sulphide
                    of mercury; antimony vermilion, red sulphide of antimony; Derby red, a form of
                    chrome red; red lead or minium, red oxide of lead; chrome red, basic chromate of
                    lead; realgar, bisulphide of arsenic; madder lake, alizarin and alumina; madder
                    carmine, preparation of alizarin; carmine lake, cochineal red and alumina;
                    carmine, preparation of cochineal; wood lakes, from various red dyewoods.</p>
                <p>The principal mineral reds owe their colour to oxides of iron and to compounds of
                    mercury. The reds due to iron are closely allied to the yellow ochres and other
                    ferruginous pigments. As already explained in connexion with these yellows,
                    tints passing through, orange to deep purple reds are obtained by calcination of
                    yellow hydrated ferric oxide, and in this way a great variety of ruddy and red
                    tints are prepared. The proportion of ferric oxide in these compounds ranges
                    from pure oxide to combinations in natural ochres containing not more than 2 or
                    3 per cent, of iron. <hi rend="italic">Rouge</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mars Red,
                    Crocus, Indian Red,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Turkey Red</hi> are all pure
                    ferric oxide, varying in depth of tint from having undergone different degrees
                    of calcination, or from being made from different artificial or natural sources.
                    The other iron reds are all of the nature of ochres—some of them, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Venetian Red,</hi> being artificial compounds. These reds form
                    exceedingly useful durable colours which do not injuriously affect the tints
                    with which they are associated. Of red colours from mercury, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cinnabar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vermilion</hi> are the most important, the
                    former being the native and the latter an artificial sulphide of mercury (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mercury,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 34). Vermilion is one of the
                    most pure, brilliant, solid, and durable of all colours. Its beauty is largely
                    affected by the smoothness of the powder to which it is reduced, and in this
                    respect that obtained from China is of the highest excellence. Being a costly
                    pigment, vermilion is freely adulterated with other reds, a fraud easily
                    detected by the perfect volatility of the genuine substance. From mercury
                    combined with iodine is prepared a pigment of unequalled vivacity and
                    brilliance, <hi rend="italic">Iodine Scarlet,</hi> but unfortunately as fugitive
                    as it is bright, and consequently not available for work requiring permanence.
                    The principal red colour from lead is <hi rend="italic">Minium</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Red Lead,</hi> a pigment of great antiquity obtained as a product
                    of the oxidation of massicot, or by the calcination and oxidation of white lead.
                    It is orange red in colour, of good opacity and body, but it has the fault of
                    white lead and lead colours generally, blackening in contaminated air and
                    injuring colours with which it comes in contact. By itself it is a valuable
                    paint for first coating exposed iron surfaces to prevent their oxidation, and it
                    is an excellent dryer, on which account it is much used in preparing boiled oil
                    for painters. <hi rend="italic">Chrome Red,</hi> a basic chromate of lead known
                    also as <hi rend="italic">Persian or Derby Red,</hi> is a brilliant pigment
                    ranging in tone from orange to a deep vermilion hue. It is obtained by
                    precipitating a solution of acetate of lead with bichromate of potash, with the
                    addition of more or less of caustic potash or soda,—the proportion of the latter
                    addition determining the depth of resultant tone. <hi rend="italic">Antimony
                    Vermilion</hi> is the red variety of the sulphide of antimony which, as found in
                    nature (stibnite), is a dark grey body with metallic lustre. This, when fused
                    and kept-some time at a high heat and suddenly cooled, by allotropic
                    modification becomes a fine vermilion red. The colour is artificially prepared
                    by acting on solutions of the butter of antimony (antimony chloride) with
                    hyposulphite of soda or lime. It is a colour of excellent purity and body as a
                    water colour, but unfortunately it becomes brown by exposure. The lakes form a
                    numerous and important class of red pigments. A lake is a combination of a
                    colour of organic origin with a metallic oxide or salt, <pb break="no"

                    red colours, the name being derived from the lac insect <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">Carmine,</hi> a colouring matter from cochineal, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Madder Carmine or Field’s Carmine,</hi> from madder, are
                    exceedingly brilliant colours; but the first of them is of a fugitive
                    character.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Green Pigments</hi> form an extensive group embracing two
                    sections :—(1) simple greens, in which green is a primary inherent or natural
                    colour; and (2) compound greens, made up of intimate mixtures of blue and yellow
                    pigments. The latter class it is obvious are capable of indefinite modification
                    by simply varying the proportions of the compound ingredients. The following
                    list embraces the principal commercial greens :—Brunswick green, oxychloride of
                    copper; malachite green or mountain green, hydrated carbonate of copper;
                    verdigris, sub-acetate of copper; verditer or Bremen green, hydrated oxide of
                    copper; Scheele’s green, arsenite of copper; Schweinfurt green, mixed acetate
                    and arsenite of copper; emerald green, a variety of Schweinfurt green; mineral
                    green, mixed copper oxide and arsenite; chrome green, oxide of chromium; Guignet
                    green or veridian, hydrated oxide of chromium; Cassel green, manganate of
                    baryta; cobalt green, oxides of cobalt and zinc; ultramarine green, modified
                    artificial ultramarine; Veronese earth or terra verde, a form of ochre; green
                    lakes.</p>
                <p>The greater proportion of these greens are copper compounds— the most brilliant
                    of them containing also arsenic. They are all poisonous colours, the latter
                    especially being dangerous poison; and there can be no doubt that their free use
                    in wall papers, the colouring of toys, artificial flowers, &amp;c., is
                    frequently the source of dangerous disease and even death. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brunswick Green,</hi> the most important non-arsenical green, is an oxychloride
                    of copper, but factitious Brunswick greens are not uncommon. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scheele’s Green,</hi> the arsenite of copper, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schweinfurt</hi><hi rend="italic">Green,</hi> mixed arsenite and acetate of
                    copper, are very powerful and brilliant colours. These copper greens all blacken
                    in foul gases and when mixed with oil, and thus, although they possess great
                    body, they are much more useful to the paper-stainer than the painter. The
                    sesquioxide of chromium both water-free and hydrated, prepared in various ways,
                    forms important stable green colours which resist atmospheric influences; and
                    chromium is further the basis of several other green colours, which, however,
                    are not of importance. <hi rend="italic">Cobalt Green,</hi> a mixed oxide of
                    cobalt and zinc, discovered by the Swedish chemist Hinman, is a valuable and
                    durable but expensive colour. <hi rend="italic">Cassel</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Green,</hi> called also <hi rend="italic">Rosenstiehl's Green,</hi> is a fine
                    innocuous pigment made by melting together sulphate of baryta and oxide of
                    manganese, and carefully washing the resulting mass in water. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Verona Green</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Terra Verde,</hi> a natural celadon
                    green highly valued by artists for permanence, is a mixed earthy body coloured
                    by ferrous oxide, and <hi rend="italic">Ultramarine Green,</hi> also a stable
                    body, is an intermediate product of the manufacture of ultramarine blue.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brown Pigments.</hi> —Many of the painters’ browns are
                    simply tints obtained by mixture. In the case of simple pigments the shades pass
                    by fine gradations into yellows and reds, so that the limits of classification
                    are not well defined. The following are generally classed as pure browns
                    :—umber, silicate of iron and manganese; brown ochres, called Mars brown, iron
                    brown, &amp;c., native and artificial earths; Vandyke brown and Cologne or
                    Cassel brown, peaty ochres; purple brown, ferric oxide; Spanish brown or tiver,
                    a brown iron ochre; bistre, washed beechwood soot; sepia, secretion of
                    cuttle-fish; brown lake; asphaltum, natural and artificial pitch.</p>
                <p>Iron and manganese, separately or combined, earthy or pure, are the sources of
                    the principal brown pigments. Some of them are intermediate products between
                    yellow ochres and red ochres by calcination of the yellow, and, as they are
                    ochreous in their nature, their colours may be heightened or otherwise modified
                    by calcining. Thus <hi rend="italic">Umber,</hi> which properly is a hydrated
                    silicate of manganese and iron, is brightened in colour by calcination into <hi
                    rend="italic">Burnt</hi><hi rend="italic">Umber.</hi> The finest umber comes
                    from the island of Cyprus, and is known as Turkey umber. Large quantities also
                    of “English” umber are mined in Devonshire and Cornwall. Real <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vandyke Brown,</hi> a very celebrated pigment, ought to be a kind of bituminous
                    peaty earth of a fine rich semi-transparent colour, allied to which are <hi
                    rend="italic">Cologne</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cassel Earth.</hi> But under
                    the name Vandyke brown pure ferric oxide and ferruginous earths of a clear brown
                    hue are also sold. <hi rend="italic">Cappagh Brown</hi> is a peaty earth
                    coloured by manganese, found at Cappagh near Cork, Ireland, and is a valuable
                    artists’ colour, as is also <hi rend="italic">Bistre,</hi> a brown washed from
                    the soot of beech wood. <hi rend="italic">Sepia,</hi> a much valued warm brown,
                    is a substance secreted by the cuttlefish, <hi rend="italic">Sepia
                    officinalis,</hi> which emits it to cloud the water for concealing its
                    whereabouts when alarmed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Black Pigments</hi> form a numerous class of bodies, though
                    those in common use are easily enumerated. They appear in commerce principally
                    under these names :—vegetable black, carbonized vegetable matter; lamp black,
                    soot of oils and fats; Indian ink, preparation of lamp black; ivory black,
                    carbonized ivory and bone; bone black, carbonized bone; blue black, washed wood
                    charcoal; charcoal black, carbonized wood; black wad, a native oxide of
                    manganese; black lead, a form of carbon: tar, from distillation of organic
                    substances.</p>
                <p>Most of these blacks owe their colour to carbon. From the charring of vegetable
                    substances are prepared <hi rend="italic">Charcoal Black, Blue Black,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Vegetable Black,</hi> but these take many names according as
                    they are prepared from carbonized wood, twigs of the grape vine, peach and other
                    fruit stones, cork, the lees of wine, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Bone</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Ivory Blacks</hi> again are carbonized animal substances,
                    principally bones, which when skilfully burned yield dense durable blacks. <hi
                    rend="italic">Lamp Black</hi> of the best quality is the soot deposited from the
                    imperfect combustion of oils and fats, and the soots of resin and tar are also
                    collected and used under this name. <hi rend="italic">Indian Ink</hi> (see vol.
                    xiii. p. 80) is a form under which lamp black of the finest quality occupies an
                    important position among pigments. Of the other blacks <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tar</hi> is the most important owing to its extensive use as a preservative and
                    antiseptic coating.</p>
                <p>Several pigments are prepared on account of special properties apart from the
                    protective aud decorative purposes for which ordinary paints are applied. Among
                    such may be mentioned Balmain’s luminous paint, a preparation in oil or water of
                    certain of the phosphorescent sulphides. Objects coated with this material have
                    the property of continuing to emit light in dark situations for some time after
                    they have been exposed in daylight or to high artificial light. The luminous
                    paint has been proposed for coating buoys, signals, public notice boards, clock
                    and watch dials, playing balls, match boxes, &amp;c., but it has not come into
                    extensive use. Powdered asbestos has been introduced as a fire-proof paint for
                    wood; but all common paints applied as distemper colour are equally fire-proof
                    in the sense that they themselves are incombustible, and when they coat wood
                    thickly they offer great resistance to an incipient fire, and even retard
                    combustion under very high heat. Numerous anti-fouling compositions for the
