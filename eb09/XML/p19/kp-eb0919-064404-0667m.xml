                <p><label type="entry">POULTRY</label>. The term “poultry” (Fr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >oiseaux de basse</hi><hi rend="italic">cour)</hi> is usually regarded as
                    including the whole of the domesticated birds reclaimed by man for the sake of
                    their flesh and their eggs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Although pigeons are not generally included among poultry, yet, on account
                    of their close connexion, it has been deemed advisable to add a short section on
                    them to this article.</p></note> The most important are the Common Fowl, which
                    is remarkable as having no distinctive English name, the Turkey, and the
                    Guinea-fowl, all members of the family of birds known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phasianidae.</hi> The Pheasants themselves, belonging to the restricted genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Phasianus,</hi> are not capable of being domesticated, and the
                    Peacock is to be regarded rather as an ornamental than as a poultry bird. The
                    aquatic birds which are strictly entitled to be considered domesticated poultry
                    are the Duck and the Goose, two species of the latter having been perfectly
                    reclaimed.</p>
                <p>The common fowl belongs to the restricted genus <hi rend="italic">Gallus,</hi> of
                    which four wild species are known,—the Bankiva Jungle fowl (6 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">ferrugineus),</hi> the Sonnerat
                    Jungle fowl <hi rend="italic">(G. sonnerati),</hi> the Ceylon Jungle fowl (6 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>. <hi rend="italic">stanleyi),</hi> and the
                    Forked-tail Jungle fowl <hi rend="italic">(G. furcatus).</hi> The range of these
                    species is given under <hi rend="smallcaps">Fowl</hi> (vol. ix. pp. 491-492).
                    The origin of the domesticated breeds is ascribed by Darwin, Blyth, and other
                    naturalists to the Bankiva fowl, much stress being laid on the comparative want
                    of fertility in the hybrids produced between this species or the domesticated
                    breeds and the other three forms of wild <hi rend="italic">Galli,</hi> but it is
                    probable that this want of fertility was due in great part to the unnatural
                    conditions under which the parent and offspring were placed, as, if bred under
                    more natural conditions, there is no difficulty in rearing these hybrids or in
                    breeding from them with the domesticated varieties. The number of distinctive
                    breeds of the domesticated fowl has very greatly increased of late years, owing
                    to the emulation excited by poultry shows. Darwin, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Variation of Animals, &lt;Vc., under Domestication,</hi> enumerated thirteen
                    principal breeds with numerous sub-varieties, but several very distinctive races
                    have come into notice during the last ten years, varieties having been formed by
                    careful selection that may be relied on for reproducing their own distinctive
                    peculiarities in the descendants, and hence constituting what are regarded by
                    fanciers as pure breeds. The classification of the known varieties is not an
                    easy task; each is capable of interbreeding with every other, and so great an
                    intermixture of local races has taken place that the arrangement of the breeds
                    is as difficult in poultry as in dogs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Game Fowls.—</hi> Game fowls differ less from the wild Bankiva
                    than any other variety; they are, however, considerably larger, and carry the
                    tail more erect than the wild birds. In some parts of India sportsmen find it
                    not easy to distinguish between the wild and the domesticated birds. Game fowls
                    in England have been long cultivated not only as useful poultry but on account
                    of their combative tendencies, which have become so intensified by careful
                    selection that they have extended even to the other sex, and hens have been not
                    unfrequently fought in the cockpit. The comb in the Game is single, the beak
                    massive, the spurs strong and very sharp. There is a tendency towards the
                    assumption of the female plumage by the males, and distinct breeds of “henny”
                    Game are known. The peculiarity is not associated with any loss of
                    combativeness, the birds being highly valued for their courage and endurance in
                    the pit. Economically considered, Game are highly esteemed for the table on
                    account of their plumpness, the amount of the breast-meat, owing to the size of
                    the pectoral muscles, being very great, from which cause, combined with their
                    hardihood, they are most valuable for crossing with other breeds, as the
                    Dorking. English-bred Game have been reared of many varieties of colour,
                    retaining in all cases their distinctive peculiarities of form. Within the last
                    few years Game fowls have been reduced in size by selective breeding, and the
                    exceedingly minute Game bantams have been produced with the distinguishing
                    characters of the larger breed. During the last twenty years Game fowls have
                    been considerably altered in form, owing to the influence of poultry shows,—the
                    legs and necks having been greatly lengthened. This has been <pb break="no"

                    not by crossing with any other breed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Malayan Fowls.—</hi> The Malayan type has been long recognized
                    as of Eastern origin. The birds are of large size, close and scant in plumage,
                    with very long legs and necks. The <hi rend="italic">Gallus giganteus</hi> of
                    Temminck, which he regarded erroneously as a distinct species, belonged to this
                    group, as did the Kulm fowl and the Grey Chittagong of the United States. The
                    Malays are of savage disposition. Several smaller breeds of a somewhat similar
                    type are known as Indian Game; some of these, as the Aseels, are of indomitable
                    courage. Until the arrival of the so-called Cochin breeds from the north of
                    China, Malays were the largest fowls known in Europe and were employed to impart
                    size to other varieties by crossing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cochins.—</hi> This type, which must be regarded as including
                    not only the birds generally so called but also the Brahmas and Langshans, is of
                    very large size, some of the males reaching the great weight of 16 or 17 lb.
                    They are distinguished by a profusion of downy plumage, with small wings and
                    tails; they are incapable of long flight, and the pectoral muscles are
                    consequently but feebly developed. The Cochins originally imported from Shanghai
                    were of several colours; some of the grey birds in America were crossed with the
                    grey Chittagong, the Brahmas being the result of the cross, and they have been
                    long since established as a pure breed, faithfully reproducing their own type.
                    The Langshans are a more recent importation; since their introduction they have
                    been bred by careful selection for eating, and have fuller breasts and less
                    abundant plumage than the older-known Cochins and Brahmas. Recently a
                    sub-variety of Cochin has been raised in America by crossing with a
                    cuckoo-coloured breed long known as Dominiques. These have become fashionable
                    under the name of Plymouth Rocks. They are cuckoo-coloured, viz., each feather
                    is marked with transverse grey stripes on a lighter ground, and, as in all
                    cuckoo-coloured breeds, the cocks are of the same colour as the hens; their legs
                    are not feathered, and the plumage is not so loose as that of the more typical
                    Cochins. They are admirable layers, but the intense yellow of the skin lessens
                    their value for the table.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spanish.—</hi> The Spanish or Mediterranean type is well
                    marked. The birds are of moderate size, with large single erect combs and white
                    ear-lobes. In the black Spanish the whiteness of the ear-lobe extends over the
                    face, and its size has been so greatly developed by cultivation that in some
                    specimens it is 6 or 7 inches in length and several in breadth. Closely related
                    to the Spanish, differing only in colouι ’ of plumage and extent of white face
                    and earlobe, are the white and brown Leghorns, the slaty-blue Andalusians, the
                    black Minorcas, &amp;c. All are non-incu-bators, the desire to sit having been
                    lost in the tendency to the increased production of eggs, which has been
                    developed by the persistent and long-continued selection of the most fertile
                    layers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hamburghs.—</hi> The Hamburghs, erroneously so called from a
                    name given them in the classification adopted at the early Birmingham shows, are
                    chiefly breeds of English origin. They have double combs and small white
                    earlobes. There are various sub-varieties. Those with a dark crescent-like mark
                    on the end of each feather of the hen are termed Spangled Hamburghs. Others are
                    of uniform black plumage. A somewhat similar breed of smaller size, with each
                    feather of the hens marked with transverse bands of black on a white or bay
                    ground, is termed Pencilled Hamburghs; they were formerly known as Dutch
                    everyday Layers. These breeds are all non-sitters and lay a remarkably large
                    number of eggs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Crested Fowls.—</hi> The crested breeds have long been
                    cultivated on the Continent and are admirably delineated in the pictures by
                    Hondekoeter and other early Dutch artists. In Great Britain they are erroneously
                    termed Polish. The development of the feathered crest is accompanied by a great
                    diminution in the size of the comb, which is sometimes entirely wanting. The
                    wattles also are absent in some breeds, their place being occupied by a large
                    tuft of feathers, forming what is termed the “beard.” In all the crested breeds
                    there is a remarkable alteration of the cranium, the anterior part of the skull
                    forming a prominent hollow tuberosity which contains a very large part of the
                    brain. This portion of the brain-case is rarely entirely ossified. There are
                    numerous sub-varieties of crested fowls. The best-known breeds in England are
                    the spangled, with a dark mark at the end of each feather. This mark often
                    assumes a crescent shape, the horns of the crescent sometimes running up each
                    margin of the feather so as to form a black border; feathers so marked are
                    termed “laced” by poultry-fanciers. There are also white Polish and a buff
                    variety. A very distinct sub-variety is the black breed with a white crest on
                    the head and large pendent wattles. A variety with the arrangement of these
                    colours reversed was formerly known, but it has now become extinct. Some of the
                    larger breeds of the west of Europe are closely related to the Polish. The
                    Crève-coeur is a crested breed of uniform black colour; it is of large size and
                    of great value for the table and for egg-production. The Houdan is a black and
                    white breed of very similar character. In some breeds the form of the body and
                    structure of bones of the face closely resemble those of the Polish, but there
                    is an absence of the feathered crest, the crescent-shaped comb becoming more
                    largely developed; such are those known as Guelders, Bredas, and La Flèche, the
                    latter being the best French fowl for eating. A small white-crested variety,
                    profusely feathered on the legs, was received some twenty years since (1864)
                    from Turkey; they are now known as Sultans. The crested breeds are all
                    non-incubating.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dorkings.—</hi> The Dorking type includes fowls that have for
                    many generations been bred for the supply of the London markets. They are all
                    fleshy on the breast and of fine quality. The Dorkings have an extra toe, a
                    monstrosity which leads to disease of the feet. The Surrey and Sussex fowls are
                    four-toed. The coloured Dorkings were greatly increased in size some few years
                    since by crossing with an Indian breed of the Malay type. The birds of the
                    Dorking type are fair layers and good sitters. They are rather delicate in
                    constitution and are chiefly bred in the south of England. Crossed with the Game
                    breed they furnish a hardy fowl, plumper than the Dorking and larger than the
                    Game, which is of unsurpassed excellence for the table. Mating a Dorking cock
                    with large Game hens is found to be the most advantageous.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Silk Fowls.—</hi> These constitute a singular variety, in which
                    the barbs of the feathers are not connected by barbules and the entire plumage
                    has a loose fibrous appearance; similar variations are found amongst other
                    species of birds, but are soon lost in a wild state. The silk fowl best known is
                    that in which the plumage is perfectly white, whilst the skin, cellular tissue
                    between the muscles, and the periosteum covering the bones are a deep
                    blue-black, the comb and wattles being a dark leaden blue. The birds are
                    admirable sitters and mothers, and are much valued for rearing pheasants, being
                    of somewhat small size. Though of remarkable appearance when cooked, they are of
                    good quality. In crosses with other breeds the silky character of the plumage is
                    generally lost, but the dark skin and intermuscular cellular tissue remain and
                    greatly lessen the value of the birds in the market.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Frizzled fowls</hi> are birds in which each feather curls

                    are not adapted to the climate of Britain, as the plumage offers an imperfect
                    protection against wet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bumpless fowls</hi> are those in which the coccygeal vertebrae
                    are absent; there is consequently no tail. By crossing, rumpless breeds of any
                    variety may be produced. They are not desirable to cultivate, as, from the
                    structural peculiarities, the eggs are very apt to escape being fertilized.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dumpies</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Creepers</hi> are birds in
                    which the bones of the legs are so short that their progression is considerably
                    interfered with. The best known are the Scotch dumpies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Long-tailed fowls,</hi> under the various names of Yokohama or
                    Phoenix fowls, or Shinotawaro fowls, are singular varieties recently introduced
                    from Japan, in which the sickle-feathers of the tail are 6 or 7 feet long. In
                    Japan they are said to assume a much greater length. One bird in the museum at
                    Tokio is stated to have sickle-feathers 17 feet long; but examination is not
                    permitted. In other respects the fowls are not peculiar, resembling the birds of
                    the Game type.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bantam.—</hi> This term is applied to fowls of a diminutive
                    size without any reference to the particular breed. By careful selection and
                    crossing with small specimens any variety can be reduced to the desired size.
                    The Chinese had in the summer palace at Peking small Cochins weighing not more
                    than 1 ft) each. Game bantams of less size have been established during the past
                    twenty-five years. The Malays have been reduced to bantam size within a very few
                    years, as have the crested breeds. The Japanese have long possessed a dwarf
                    breed with enormous tail and comb, and with very short legs. One of the most
                    artificial breeds is the Sebright bantam, named after its originator. This bird
                    has the laced or marginal feather of the Polish combined with the absence of
                    male plumage in the cocks, so that it may be described as a hen-feathered breed
                    with laced plumage. When perfect in marking it is of singular beauty, but is not
                    remarkable for fertility.</p>
                <p>In breeding the domestic fowl for useful purposes it is desirable to follow to a
                    greater extent than is usual the natural habits and instincts of the bird. The
                    wild fowl is a resident in forests, coming out to feed in the open; in addition
                    to green vegetables and fruit it lives on grain, seeds, worms, grubs, and
                    insects, which it obtains by scratching in the soil; it roosts in the higher
                    branches of trees, and the hen deposits heι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> eggs
                    on the ground, usually in a concealed situation, laying one egg every other day
                    until the number is completed, when she sits for twenty-one days. On the
                    chickens being hatched they do not leave the nest for twenty-four or thirty
                    hours, being nourished by the absorption of the yolk into the intestinal caual.
                    When they are sufficiently strong to run after the hen she takes them in search
                    of food, which she obtains by scratching in the ground or amongst decaying
                    vegetable matter.</p>
                <p>A domesticated hen allowed to make her own nest in a hedge or coppice always
                    brings out a much larger, stronger, and healthier brood than one that sits in
                    the dry close atmosphere of a hen-house. Wherever the nest is placed it should
                    always be made of damp earth so as to supply the requisite moisture and cool the
                    under surface of the eggs as compared with the upper. When hatched the chicken
                    should not be removed for twenty-four hours, feeding not being required. The
                    first food should be <hi rend="italic">egg</hi> and milk—equal parts— beaten
                    together and heated until it sets into a soft mass; this may be given with a
                    little canary seed for the first day or two, or millet or wheat; newly-ground
                    sweet oatmeal is good, but pungent rancid meal very injurious. The chickens do
                    much better if the hen is allowed to scratch for them than when she is shut up
                    in a coop. If a coop must be used it should be so constructed as to include a
                    plot of grass and be moved daily. The perches in a hen-house should be on one
                    level, or the fowls fight for the highest. All should be low, so that in flying
                    down the breast-bone and feet may not be injured by coming violently in contact
                    with the ground.</p>
                <p>Keeping poultry without an extended range in which they can obtain a large
                    portion of their own food is not desirable, nor has the establishment of
                    poultry-farms, in which large numbers of birds are kept in one locality, ever
                    under any conditions been attended with success. In all cases in which a large
                    number of fowls are congregated together the ground becomes contaminated by the
                    excrement of the birds; the food is eaten off the soiled surface; disease breaks
                    out amongst the adults; and rearing chickens successfully is out of the
                    question. There are no poultry-farms in France, the eggs and chickens being
                    produced by the peasant-proprietors. In England many poultry-farms have been
                    started, but none have ever proved successful. Poultry-rearing is an industry
                    adapted to the small holder, to the rearer for home consumption, or as an
                    adjunct to the work of a large farm, but as an industry of its own it is never
                    likely to be worked to advantage. There is no difficulty whatever in hatching
                    any number of chickens, but when the young birds are crowded together and are
                    living on tainted soil they invariably become diseased and die with extreme
                    rapidity. The conditions of a crowded poultry-run necessarily resemble those of
                    an army encamped without due sanitary precautions, which cannot be adopted in
                    the case of the birds. The inevitable result is that they perish of diseases of
                    a typhoid character which are quite beyond the power of the owners to control or
                    alleviate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Turkeys.—</hi> The origin of the domesticated turkey is
                    probably of a composite character; by Mr Gould and other naturalists this bird
                    is generally regarded as having been derived from the Mexican species <hi
                    rend="italic">Meleagris mexicana;</hi> but this has recently been crossed with
                    the North-American <hi rend="italic">Μ. gcdlo-paυo,</hi> with great advantage as
                    to size and hardihood. The varieties of the turkey differ chiefly as to colour.
                    The principal English breeds are the bronze or Cambridgeshire, the black or
                    Norfolk, the fawn, and the white. Of these the first, especially when crossed
                    with the American, is the largest and most desirable.</p>
                <p>Turkeys are not so extensively raised in Great Britain as in France, from a
                    prevalent opinion that they are very delicate and difficult to rear; this idea
                    arises in great part from errors in their management and feeding. The chicks,
                    when hatched after twenty-eight days’ incubation, should be left undisturbed for
                    twenty-four or thirty hours, during which time they are digesting the yolk that
                    is absorbed into the intestinal canal at birth. No attempt should be made to
                    cram them; their first food should consist of sweet fresh meal, soft custard
                    made with equal parts of egg and milk set by a gentle heat, and, above all,
                    abundance of some bitter milky herb, as dandelion, or, much better, lettuce
                    running to seed, on which they can be reared successfully with very little food
                    of any other description. The young turkeys progress much better if the hen has
                    the range of a small enclosure from the first than if she is confined to a coop;
                    thus reared they are much hardier than when cooped and corn-fed, and not so
                    susceptible to injury from slight showers; but a damp locality should be
                    avoided. Turkey-hens are most persevering sitters, and are employed in France to
                    hatch successions of sittings of hens’ eggs. Turkeys can often be most
                    advantageously reared by cottagers, as one or two hens only can be kept, one
                    visit to the male being sufficient to fertilize the entire batch of eggs. The
                    young turkeys find a larger proportion of their own food than fowls, and with a
                    good free range cost but little until they are ready for fattening for the
                    table. In places where the opportunity serves they may be allowed to roost in
                    the trees with great advantage. Some wild flocks treated like pheasants are to
                    be found in several of the large parks in Scotland as well as in England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Guinea-fowls.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The Common
                    Guinea-fowl <hi rend="italic">(Numida</hi><hi rend="italic">meleagris')</hi> is
                    a native of eastern Africa, from whence it has been carried to many parts of the
                    world, in some of which, as the West Indian Islands, it has become wild. It has
                    also been reared in a half-wild state in many English preserves; under these
                    conditions it flourishes exceedingly, but has the disadvantage of driving away
                    the pheasants. In any dry locality guinea-fowls may be successfully reared,
                    provided they have a good range and trees in which they can roost. The hen lays
                    an abundance of eggs, which are generally hidden. The birds are useful as
                    furnishing a supply of poultry for the table in the interval that ensues between
                    the time when game are out of season and that before chickens arrive at
                    maturity. On a dry, sandy, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n670/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0670-0647"/> and chalky soil and in a warm situation they are
                    reared with ease, but are quite unsuited to damp cold localities. The continued
                    vociferation of the hen-birds renders their maintenance near a house very
                    objectionable, as the cry is continued throughout great part öf the night.
                    Several variations of colour exist, but they do not require any detailed
                    description.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ducks.—</hi> All the varieties of the domesticated duck are
                    descended from the Common Mallard or Wild Duck, <hi rend="italic">Anas
                    boschas,</hi> a species which, though timid in its wild state, is easily
                    domesticated, and suffers changes of form and colour in a few generations. The
                    most important breeds are—the Rouen, which, retaining the colour of the original
                    species, grows to a large size; the Aylesbury, a large white breed with an
                    expanded lemon-coloured bill; the Pekin, a white breed with a pale yellowish
                    tint in the plumage, and a very bright orange bill; two breeds which are
                    entirely black. The smaller of these, which has been bred down to a very
                    diminutive size, is remarkable for the extreme lustre of its feathers and the
                    fact that its eggs are covered with a dark black pigment, which becomes less in
                    quantity as each successive egg is deposited. It is known by the equally absurd
                    names of East Indian, Labrador, or Buenos Ayres duck. The larger black variety,
                    the Cayuga duck, has been recently introduced into England. Decoy or call ducks
                    are small breeds of a very loquacious character, which were originally bred for
                    the purpose of attracting the wild birds to the decoys. Some are of the natural
                    colour, others are white. Amongst the less known breeds are the Duclair ducks of
                    France, evidently the result of crossing white and coloured varieties. Among the
                    breeds differing in structure may be mentioned the Penguin duck, so called from
                    its erect attitude, the Hook-billed and the Tufted ducks, &lt;fcc., but these
                    are not of practical importance. For table and market purposes no breed
                    surpasses the Aylesbury; its large size, great prolificacy, early maturity, and
                    white skin and plumage cause it to be reared in immense numbers for the London
                    markets. By good feeding the ducks are caused to lay in the winter months, when
                    the eggs are hatched under Cochin or Brahma hens, the young ducklijιgs being
                    reared in artificially-warmed buildings or in the labourers’ cottages; they are
                    fed most liberally on soft food, soaked grits, boiled rice with tallow-melters’
                    greaves, and in ten or twelve weeks are fit for the market; if killed before
                    moulting their quills, which they do when about twelve weeks old, they are
                    heavier than afterwards and much better eating. When ducklings are required for
                    the early spring markets the old birds must be fed most freely to cause the
                    production of eggs in cold weather, corn being given in vessels of water, and
                    the birds must be shut up at night, or the eggs will be laid in the water, where
                    they sink and become putrid. Duck-rearing is a very profitable industry, very
                    high prices being paid for ducklings in the early months of the year. The
                    so-called Muscovy duck is a Brazilian species, <hi rend="italic">Cairina
                    moschata,</hi> which is not reared for the market, although the young birds are
                    edible. The drake not unfrequently mates with the common duck, and large but
                    sterile hybrids are the result.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geese.—</hi> The domestic goose of Europe is undoubtedly the
                    descendant of the migratory Grey Lag Goose, <hi rend="italic">Anser
                    cinereus,</hi> from which it differs chiefly by its increased size. Although
                    domesticated since the time of the Romans, it has not been subject to much
                    variation. The most important breeds are the large grey variety known as the
                    Toulouse, the white breed known as the Embden, and the common variety frequently
                    marked with dark feathers on the back, and hence termed “saddlebacks.” There has
                    also been introduced from the Crimea since the Russian war a variety in which
                    the feathers are singularly elongated, and even curled and twisted; this breed,
                    which is termed the Sebastopol, is of small size and more important as a
                    fanciers’ breed than from a practical point of view. In some countries a second
                    species is domesticated; it is usually termed the Chinese, knob-fronted, or swan
                    goose, <hi rend="italic">Anser</hi><hi rend="italic">cygnoides.</hi> Though
                    perfectly distinct as a species, having a different number of vertebrae in the
                    neck and a loud clanging voice, it breeds freely with the common goose, and the
                    hybrids produced are perfectly fertile, the late Mr Blyth asserting that over a
                    large tract of country in the East no other geese except these cross-breds are
                    ever seen. Geese are much more exclusively vegetable-feeders than ducks, and can
                    only be kept to profit where they can obtain a large proportion of their food by
                    grazing. The old birds should not be killed off, as they continue fertile to a
                    great age. Geese are readily fattened on oats thrown into water, and the young,
                    when brought rapidly forward for the markets, afford a very good profit. The
                    Chinese, if well fed, lay at a much earlier date than the common species, and,
                    if their eggs are hatched under large Cochin hens, giving three or four to each
                    bird, the young are ready for the table at a very early period. The nest, as in
                    all cases of ground-nesting birds, should be made on the earth and not in boxes,
                    which become too dry and over-heated. In breeding for the market or for the sake
                    of profit, the very large exhibition birds should be avoided, as many are barren
                    from over-fatness, and none <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> are so prolific as
                    birds of fair average size.</p>
                <p>In this article the Pea-fowl (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Peacock,</hi> vol. xviii.
                    p. 443) has not been included, as, although long since domesticated, it is to be
                    regarded rather as an ornamental than as a useful bird, and in congenial
                    localities in which it can avail itself of the shelter of trees it requires no
                    management whatever beyond feeding, nor should the slightest interference with
                    the sitting hen be practised.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pigeons.—</hi> All the different breeds of pigeons which are
                    known to the fancier have descended from the wild blue Rock-dove, <hi
                    rend="italic">Columba livia,</hi> and return to the coloration and form of the
                    wild original if allowed to interbreed without interference. When reared as
                    articles of food pigeons are generally treated most disadvantageously; with due
                    care and proper management six or seven couples of young can be raised from each
                    old pair during the year, and a continuous supply of young birds for the table
                    can be depended on. The ordinary pigeons’ houses are most objectionable, the
                    birds being exposed to rain and extremes of temperature at all seasons. To be
                    reared successfully pigeons should be housed in a room or loft, with shelves 9
                    or 10 inches in width running round the walls about 10 inches apart; each shelf
                    should be divided into compartments not less than 16 inches long; this
                    arrangement gives room for a nest at each end and enables the old birds to go to
                    nest again before the young are able to fly. If coarse earthen saucers or
                    nest-pans are used the young will be kept out of the dung, which is ejected over
                    the sides and can be easily removed. They are first fed with a secretion from
                    the crops of the parents, and afterwards with disgorged corn; when required for
                    the table they should be killed before the old birds cease to feed them, as when
                    they begin to feed themselves they lose weight, become thin, and are much less
                    marketable. To obtain a continuous supply of young pigeons the old birds must be
                    well fed with grain and pulse; clean water and a supply of old mortar rubbish
                    mixed with salt should be always accessible; the loft and nest should be kept
                    clean and well ventilated, and the birds have free access to the open air. The
                    breed should be of fair size, the blue rocks being too small to be of full
                    market value as dead birds, though in great request for pigeon-shooting, and,
                    unless a considerable number are kept so as to prevent close interbreeding, some
                    birds from other lofts should be introduced occasionally<pb break="no"
