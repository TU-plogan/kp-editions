                <p>IN modern criticism the word poetry is used sometimes to denote any expression
                    (artistic or other) of imaginative feeling, sometimes to designate one of the
                    fine arts.</p>
                <p>As an expression of imaginative feeling, as the movement of an energy, as one of
                    those great primal human forces which go to the development of the race, poetry
                    in the wide sense has played as important a part as science. In some literatures
                    (such as that of England) poetic energy and in others (such as that of Rome)
                    poetic art is the dominant quality. It is the same with individual writers. In
                    classical literature Pindar may perhaps be taken as a type of the poets of
                    energy; Virgil of the poets of art. With all his wealth of poetic art Pindar’s
                    mastery over symmetrical methods never taught him to “sow with the hand,” as
                    Corinna declared, while his poetic energy always impelled him to “sow with the
                    whole sack.” In English poetical literature Elizabeth Barrett Browning typifies,
                    perhaps, the poets of energy; while Keats (notwithstanding<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n266/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0266-0257"/> all his unquestionable inspiration) is mostly
                    taken as a type of the poets of art. In French literature Hugo, notwithstanding
                    all his mastery over poetic methods, represents the poets of energy.</p>
                <p>In some writers, and these the very greatest—in Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles,
                    Dante; Shakespeare, Milton, and perhaps Goethe—poetic energy and poetic art are
                    seen in something like equipoise. It is of poetry as an art, however, that we
                    have mainly to speak here; and all we have to say upon poetry as an energy is
                    that the critic who, like Aristotle, takes this wide view of poetry—the critic
                    who, like him, recognizes the importance of poetry in its relations to man’s
                    other expressions of spiritual force, claims a place in point of true critical
                    sagacity above that of a critic who, like Plato, fails to recognize that
                    importance. And assuredly no philosophy of history can be other than inadequate
                    should it ignore the fact that poetry has had as much effect upon human destiny
                    as that other great human energy by aid of which, from the discovery of the use
                    of fire to that of the electric light, the useful arts have been developed.</p>
                <p>With regard to poetry as an art, in the present work most of the great poems of
                    the world have been or will be examined either in connexion with the names of
                    the writers or with the various literatures to which they belong; consequently
                    these remarks must be confined to general principles. To treat historically so
                    vast a subject as poetry would be obviously impossible here.</p>
                <p>All that can be attempted is to inquire briefly—(1) What is poetry? (2) What is
                    the position it takes up in relation to the other arts? (3) What is its value
                    and degree of expressional power in relation to these? and, finally, (4) What
                    varieties of poetic art are the outcome of the two great kinds of poetic
                    impulse, dramatic imagination and lyric or egoistic imagination?</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">What is Poetry?—</hi> Definitions are for the most part
                    alike unsatisfactory and treacherous; but definitions of poetry are proverbially
                    so. Is it possible to lay down invariable principles of poetry, such as those
                    famous “invariable principles” of the Rev. Mr Bowles, which in the earlier part
                    of the century awoke the admiration of Southey and the wrath of Byron? Is it
                    possible for a critic to say of any metrical phrase, stanza, or verse, “This is
                    poetry,” or “This is not poetry”? Can he, with anything like the authority with
                    which the man of science pronounces upon the natural objects brought before him,
                    pronounce upon the qualities of a poem? These are questions that have engaged
                    the attention of critics ever since the time of Aristotle.</p>
                <p>Byron, in his rough and ready way, has answered them in one of those letters to
                    the late John Murray, which, rich as they are in nonsense, are almost as rich in
                    sense. “So far are principles of poetry from being invariable,” says he, “that
                    they never were nor ever will be settled. These principles mean nothing more
                    than the predilections of a particular age, and every age has its own and a
                    different from its predecessor. It is now Homer and now Virgil; once Dryden and
                    since Sir Walter Scott; now Corneille and now Racine; now Crébillon and now
                    Voltaire.” This is putting the case very strongly—perhaps too strongly. But if
                    we remember that Sophocles lost the first prize for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oedipus</hi><hi rend="italic">Tyrannus</hi>; if we remember what in Dante’s
                    time (owing partly, no doubt, to the universal ignorance of Greek) were the
                    relative positions of Homer and Virgil, what in the time of Milton were the
                    relative positions of Milton himself, of Shakespeare, and of Beaumont and
                    Fletcher; again, if we remember Jeffrey’s famous classification of the poets of
                    his day, we shall be driven to pause over Byron’s words before dismissing them.
                    Yet some definition, for the purpose of this essay, must be here attempted; and,
                    using the phrase “absolute poetry” as the musical critics use the phrase
                    “absolute music,” we may, perhaps, without too great presumption submit the
                    following :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Absolute poetry is the concrete and artistic expression of the
                    human mind in emotional and rhythmical language.</hi></p>
                <p>This at least will be granted, that no literary expression can properly speaking
                    be called poetry that is not in a certain deep sense emotional, whatever may be
                    its subject matter, concrete in its method and its diction, rhythmical in
                    movement, and artistic in form.</p>
                <p>That the expression of all real poetry must be concrete in method and diction is
                    obvious, and yet this dictum would exclude from the definition much of what is
                    called didactic poetry. With abstractions the poet has nothing to do, save to
                    take them and turn them into concretions; for, as artist, he is simply the man
                    who by instinct embodies in concrete forms that “universal idea” which Gravina
                    speaks of —that which is essential and elemental in nature and in man; as poetic
                    artist he is simply the man who by instinct chooses for his concrete forms
                    metrical language. And the questions to be asked concerning any work of art are
                    simply these—</p>
                <p>Is that which is here embodied really permanent, universal, and elemental? and Is
                    the concrete form embodying it really beautiful—acknowledged as beautiful by the
                    soul of man in its highest moods? Any other question is an impertinence.</p>
                <p>Examples are always useful in discussions such as this.</p>
                <p>As an example of the absence of concrete form in verse take the following lines
                    from George Eliot’s <hi rend="italic">Spanish Gypsy</hi></p>
                <p>“Speech is but broken light upon the depth Of the unspoken; even your loved words
                    Float in the larger meaning of your voice As something dimmer.”</p>
                <p>Without discussing the question of blank verse cadence and the weakness of a line
                    where the main accent falls upon a positive hiatus, “of the unspoken,” we would
                    point out that this powerful passage shows the spirit of poetry without its
                    concrete form. The abstract method is substituted for the concrete. Such an
                    abstract phrase as “the unspoken” belongs entirely to prose.</p>
                <p>As to what is called ratiocinative poetry, it might perhaps be shown that it does
                    not exist at all. Not by syllogism, but <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">saltum,</hi> must the poet reach in every case his conclusions. We
                    listen to the poet—we allow him to address us in rhythm or in rhyme—we allow him
                    to sing to us while other men are only allowed to talk, not because he argues
                    more logically than they, but because he feels more deeply and perhaps more
                    truly. It is for his listeners to be knowing and ratiocinative; it is for him to
                    be gnomic and divinely wise.</p>
                <p>That poetry must be metrical or even rhythmical in movement, however, is what
                    some have denied. Here we touch at once the very root of the subject. The
                    difference between all literature and mere “word-kneading” is that, while
                    literature is alive, word-kneading is without life. This literary life, while it
                    is only bipartite in prose, seems to be tripartite in poetry; that is to say,
                    while prose requires intellectual life and emotional life, poetry seems to
                    require not only intellectual life and emotional life but rhythmic life, this
                    last being the most important of all according to many critics, though Aristotle
                    is not among these. Here indeed is the “fork” between the old critics and the
                    new. Unless the rhythm of any metrical passage is so vigorous, so natural, and
                    so free that it seems as though it could live, if need were, by its rhythm
                    alone, has that passage any right to exist? and should it not, if the substance
                    is good, be forthwith <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0267-0258"/> demetricized and turned into prose? Thoreau has
                    affirmed that prose, at its best, has high qualities of its own beyond the ken
                    of poetry; to compensate for the sacrifice of these, should not the metrical
                    gains of any passage be beyond all cavil?</p>
                <p>But this argument might be pressed further still. It might seem bold to assert
                    that, in many cases, the mental value of poetry may actually depend upon form
                    and colour, but would it not be true? The mental value of poetry must be judged
                    by a standard not applicable to prose; but, even with regard to the different
                    kinds of poetry, we must not compare poetry whose mental value consists in a
                    distinct and logical enunciation of ideas, such as that of Lucretius and
                    Wordsworth, and poetry whose mental value consists partly in the suggestive
                    richness of passion or symbol latent in rhythm (such as that of Sappho
                    sometimes, Pindar often, Shelley always), or latent in colour, such as that of
                    some of the Persian poets. To discuss the question, Which of these two kinds of
                    poetry is the more precious? would be idle, but are we not driven to admit that
                    certain poems whose strength is rhythm, and certain other poems whose strength
                    is colour, while devoid of any logical statement of thought, may be as fruitful
                    of thoughts and emotions too deep for words as a shaken prism is fruitful of
                    tinted lights? The mental forces at work in the production of a poem like the
                    <hi rend="italic">Excursion</hi> are of a very different kind from the mental
                    forces at work in the production of a poem like Shelley’s “Ode to the West
                    Wind.” In the one case the poet’s artistic methods, like those of the Greek
                    architect, show, and are intended to show, the solid strength of the structure.
                    In the other, the poet’s artistic methods, like those of the Arabian architect,
                    contradict the idea of solid strength—make the structure appear to hang over our
                    heads like the cloud pageantry of heaven. But, in both cases, the solid strength
                    is, and must be, there, at the base. Before the poet begins to write he should
                    ask himself which of these artistic methods is natural to him; he should ask
                    himself whether his natural impulse is towards the weighty iambic movement whose
                    primary function is to state, or towards those lighter movements which we still
                    call, for want of more convenient words, anapaestic and dactylic, whose primary
                    function is to suggest. Whenever Wordsworth and Keats pass from the former to
                    the latter they pass at once into doggerel. Nor is it difficult to see why
                    English anapaestic and dactylic verse must suggest and not state, as even so
                    comparatively successful a <hi rend="italic">tour de force</hi> as Shelley’s
                    “Sensitive Plant” shows. Conciseness is a primary virtue of all statement. The
                    moment the English poet tries to “pack” his anapaestic or dactylic line, as he
                    can pack his iambic line, his versification becomes rugged, harsh,
                    pebbly—becomes so of necessity. Nor is this all: anapaestic and dactylic verse
                    must in English be obtrusively alliterative, or the same pebbly effect begins to
                    be felt. The anapaestic line is so full of syllables that in a language where
                    the consonants dominate the vowels (as in English), these syllables grate
                    against each other, unless their corners are artfully bevelled by one of the
                    only two smoothing processes at the command of an English versifier—obtrusive
                    alliteration, or an obtrusive use of liquids. Now these demands of form may be
                    turned by the perfect artist to good account if his appeal to the listener’s
                    soul is primarily that of suggestion by sound or symbol, but if his appeal is
                    that of direct and logical statement the diffuseness inseparable from good
                    anapaestic and dactylic verse is a source of weakness such as the true artist
                    should find intolerable.</p>
                <p>But enough has been said to show that in discussing poetry questions of
                    versification touch, as we have said, the very root of the subject.</p>
                <p>Using the word “form” in a wider sense still, a sense that includes
                    “composition,” it can be shown that poetry to be entitled to the name must be
                    artistic in form. Whether a poem be a Welsh <hi rend="italic">triban</hi> or a
                    <hi rend="italic">stomello</hi> improvised by an Italian peasant girl, whether
                    it be an ode by Keats or a tragedy by Sophocles, it is equally a work of art.
                    The artist’s command over form may be shown in the peasant girl’s power of
                    spontaneously rendering in simple verse, in her <hi rend="italic">stomello</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">rispetto,</hi> her emotions through nature’s symbols; it
                    may be shown by Keats in that perfect fusion of all poetic elements of which he
                    was such a master, in the manipulation of language so beautiful both for form
                    and colour that thought and words seem but one blended loveliness; or it may be
                    shown by Sophocles in a mastery over what in painting is called composition, in
                    the exercise of that wise vision of the artist which, looking before and after,
                    sees the thing of beauty as a whole, and enables him to grasp the eternal laws
                    of cause and effect in art and bend them to his own wizard will. In every case,
                    indeed, form is an essential part of poetry; and, although George Sand’s saying
                    that “L’art est une forme” applies perhaps more strictly to the plastic arts
                    (where the soul is reached partly through mechanical means), its application to
                    poetry can hardly be exaggerated.</p>
                <p>Owing, however, to the fact that the word 7roι7n7ς (first used to designate the
                    poetic artist by Herodotus) means maker, Aristotle seems to have assumed that
                    the indispensable basis of poetry is invention. He appears to have thought that
                    a poet is a poet more on account of the composition of the action than on
                    account of the composition of his verses. Indeed he said as much as this. Of
                    epic poetry he declared emphatically that it produces its imitations either by
                    mere articulate words or by metre superadded. This is to widen the definition of
                    poetry so as to include all imaginative literature, and Plato seems to have
                    given an equally wide meaning to the word <hi rend="italic">πoLησus.</hi> Only,
                    while Aristotle considered <hi rend="italic">τrotησ^</hi> to be an imitation of
                    the facts of nature, Plato considered it to be an imitation of the dreams of
                    man. Aristotle ignored, and Plato slighted, the importance of versification
                    (though Plato on one occasion admitted that he who did not know rhythm could be
                    called neither musician nor poet). It is impossible to discuss here the question
                    whether an imaginative work in which the method is entirely concrete and the
                    expression entirely emotional, while the form is unmetrical, is or is not
                    entitled to be called a poem. That there may be a kind of unmetrical narrative
                    so poetic in motive, so concrete in diction, so emotional in treatment, as to
                    escape altogether from those critical canons usually applied to prose, we shall
                    see when, in discussing the epic, we come to touch upon the Northern sagas.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the first critic who tacitly revolted against the dictum that substance,
                    and not form, is the indispensable basis of poetry was Dionysius of
                    Halicarnassus, whose treatise upon the arrangement of words is really a very
                    fine piece of literary criticism. In his acute remarks upon the arrangement of
                    the words in the sixteenth book of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> as
                    compared with that in the story of Gyges by Herodotus, was perhaps first
                    enunciated clearly the doctrine that poetry is fundamentally a matter of style.
                    The Aristotelian theory as to invention, however, dominated all criticism after
                    as well as before Dionysius. When Bacon came to discuss the subject (and
                    afterwards) the only division between the poetical critics was perhaps between
                    the followers of Aristotle and those of Plato as to what poetry should, and what
                    it should not, imitate. It is curious to speculate as to what would have been
                    the result had the poets followed the critics in this matter. Had not the
                    instinct of the poet been too strong for the schools, would poetry as an art
                    have been lost and merged in such imaginative<pb break="no"

                    metre was always considered to be the one indispensable requisite of a poem,
                    though, as regards criticism, so recently as the time of the appearance of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Waverley Novels,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly
                    Review</hi> would sometimes speak of them as “poems and perhaps even now there
                    are critics of a very high rank who would do the same with regard to romances so
                    concrete in method and diction, and so full of poetic energy, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Wuthering</hi><hi rend="italic">Heights</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jane Eyre,</hi> where we get absolutely all that Aristotle requires for a poem.
                    On the whole, however, the theory that versification is not an indispensable
                    requisite of a poem seems to have become nearly obsolete in our time. Perhaps,
                    indeed, many critics would now go so far in the contrary direction as to say
                    with Hegel <hi rend="italic">{Aesthetik,</hi> iii. p. 289) that “metre is the
                    first and only condition absolutely demanded by poetry, yea even more necessary
                    than a figurative picturesque diction.” At all events this at least may be said
                    that in our own time the division between poetical critics is not between
                    Aristotelians and Baconians; it is now of a different kind altogether. While one
                    group of critics may still perhaps say with Dryden that “a poet is a maker, as
                    the name signifies,” and that “he who cannot make, that is, invent, has his name
                    for nothing,” another group contends that it is not the invention but the
                    artistic treatment, the form, which determines whether an imaginative writer is
                    a poet or a writer of prose,—contends, in short, that emotion is the basis of
                    all true poetic expression, whatever be the subject matter, that thoughts must
                    be expressed in an emotional manner before they can be brought into poetry, and
                    that this emotive expression demands even yet something else, viz., style and
                    form.</p>
                <p>But, although many critics are now agreed that “L’art est une forme,” that
                    without metre and without form there can be no poetry, there are few who would
                    contend that poetry can exist by virtue of any one of these alone, or even by
                    virtue of all these combined. Quite independent of verbal melody, though mostly
                    accompanying it, and quite independent of “composition,” there is an atmosphere
                    floating around the poet through which he sees everything, an atmosphere which
                    stamps his utterances as poetry; for instance, among all the versifiers
                    contemporary with Donne there was none so rugged as he occasionally was, and yet
                    such songs as “Sweetest love, I do not go for weariness of thee” prove how true
                    a poet he was whenever he could master those technicalities which far inferior
                    poets find comparatively easy. While rhythm may to a very considerable degree be
                    acquired (though, of course, the highest rhythmical effects never can), the
                    power of looking at the world through the atmosphere that floats before the
                    poet’s eyes is not to be learned and not to be taught. This atmosphere is what
                    we call <hi rend="italic">poetic imagination,</hi> a subject which will have to
                    be fully discussed further on. But first it seems necessary to say a word or two
                    upon that high temper of the soul which in truly great poetry gives birth to
                    this poetic imagination.</p>
                <p>The “message” of poetry must be more unequivocal, more thoroughly accentuated,
                    than that of any of the other fine arts. With regard to modern poetry, indeed,
                    it may almost be said that if any writer’s verse embodies a message, true,
                    direct, and pathetic, we in modern Europe cannot stay to inquire too curiously
                    about the degree of artistic perfection with which it is delivered, for
                    Wordsworth’s saying “That which comes from the heart goes to the heart” applies
                    very closely indeed to modern poetry. The most truly passionate poet in Greece
                    was no doubt in a deep sense the most artistic poet; but in her case art and
                    passion were one, and that is why she has been so cruelly misunderstood. The
                    most truly passionate nature, and perhaps the greatest soul, that in our time
                    has expressed itself in English verse is Elizabeth Barrett Browning; at least it
                    is certain that, with the single exception of Hood in the “Song of the Shirt,”
                    no writer of the century has really touched our hearts with a hand so powerful
                    as hers,—and this notwithstanding violations of poetic form, notwithstanding
                    defective rhymes, such as would appal some of the contemporary versifiers of
                    England and France “who lisp in numbers for the numbers [and nothing else]
                    come.” The truth is that in order to produce poetry the soul must for the time
                    being have reached that state of exaltation, that state of freedom from
                    self-consciousness, depicted in the lines—</p>
                <p>“I started once, or seemed to start, in pain, Resolved on noble things, and
                    strove to speak, As when a great thought strikes along the brain, And flushes
                    all the cheek.”</p>
                <p>Whatsoever may be the poet’s <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> knowledge of his
                    art,” into this mood he must always pass before he can write a truly poetic
                    line. For, notwithstanding all that we have said and are going to say upon
                    poetry as a fine art, it is in the deepest sense of the word an “inspiration”
                    indeed. No man can write a line of genuine poetry without having been “born
                    again” (or, as the true rendering of the text says, “born from above ”); and
                    then the mastery over those highest reaches of form which are beyond the ken of
                    the mere versifier comes to him as a result of the change. Hence, with all Mrs
                    Browning’s metrical blemishes, the splendour of her metrical triumphs at her
                    best.</p>
                <p>For what is the deep distinction between poet and proseman? A writer may be many
                    things besides a poet; he may be a warrior like Aeschylus, a man of business
                    like Shakespeare, a courtier like Chaucer, or a cosmopolitan philosopher like
                    Goethe; but the moment the poetic mood is upon him all the trappings of the
                    world with which for years he may perhaps have been clothing his soul—the
                    world’s knowingness, its cynicism, its self-seeking, its ambition—fall away, and
                    the man becomes an inspired child again, with ears attuned to nothing but the
                    whispers of those spirits from the Golden Age, who, according to Hesiod, haunt
                    and bless the degenerate earth. What such a man produces may greatly delight and
                    astonish his readers, yet not so greatly as it delights and astonishes himself.
                    His passages of pathos draw no tears so deep or so sweet as those that fall from
                    his own eyes while he writes; his sublime passages overawe no soul so
                    imperiously as his own; his humour draws no laughter so rich or so deep as that
                    stirred within his own breast.</p>
                <p>It might almost be said, indeed, that Sincerity and Conscience, the two angels
                    that bring to the poet the wonders of the poetic dream, bring him also the
                    deepest, truest delight of form. It might almost be said that by aid of
                    sincerity and conscience the poet is enabled to see more clearly than other men
                    the eternal limits of his own art— to see with Sophocles that nothing, not even
                    poetry itself, is of any worth to man, invested as he is by the whole army of
                    evil, unless it is in the deepest and highest sense good, unless it comes
                    linking us all together by closer bonds of sympathy and pity, strengthening us
                    to fight the foes with whom fate and even nature, the mother who bore us,
                    sometimes seem in league—to see with Milton that the high quality of man’s soul
                    which in English is expressed by the word virtue is greater than even the great
                    poem he prized, greater than all the rhythms of all the tongues that have been
                    spoken since Babel—and to see with Shakespeare and with Shelley that the high
                    passion which in English is called love is lovelier than all art, lovelier than
                    all the marble Mercuries that “await the chisel of the sculptor” in all the
                    marble hills. So much for our first inquiry—“What is poetry <hi rend="italic"

                    take up in Relation to the other Arts I—</hi> Notwithstanding the labours of
                    Lessing and his followers, the position accorded by criticism to poetry in
                    relation to the other arts was never so uncertain and anomalous as at the
                    present moment. On the one hand there is a class of critics who, judging from
                    their perpetual comparison of poems to pictures, claim her as a sort of handmaid
                    of painting and sculpture. On the other hand the disciples of Wagner, while
                    professing to do homage to poetry, claim her as the handmaid of music. To find
                    her proper place is therefore the most important task the critic can undertake
                    at this time, though it is one far beyond the scope of a paper so brief as this.
                    With regard to the relations of poetry to painting and sculpture, however, it
                    seems necessary to glance for a moment at the saying of Simonides, as recorded
                    by Plutarch, that poetry is a speaking picture and that painting is a mute
                    poetry. It appears to have had upon modern criticism as much influence since the
                    publication of Lessing’s <hi rend="italic">Laocoon</hi> as it had before.
                    Perhaps it is in some measure answerable for the modern vice of excessive
                    word-painting. Beyond this one saying, there is little or nothing in Greek
                    literature to show that the Greeks recognized between poetry and the plastic and
                    pictorial arts an affinity closer than that which exists between poetry and
                    music and dancing. Understanding artistic methods more profoundly than the
                    moderns, and far too profoundly to suppose that there is any special and
                    peculiar affinity between an art whose medium of expression is marble and an art
                    whose medium of expression is a growth of oral symbols, the Greeks seem to have
                    studied poetry not so much in its relation to painting and sculpture as in its
                    relation to music and dancing. It is matter of familiar knowledge, for instance,
                    that at the Dionysian festival it was to the poet as “teacher of the chorus”
                    (χοροδιδάσκαλος) that the prize was awarded, even though the “teacher of the
                    chorus” were Aeschylus himself or Sophocles. And this recognition of the
                    relation of poetry to music is perhaps one of the many causes of the superiority
                    of Greek to all other poetry in adapting artistic means to artistic ends. In
                    Greek poetry, even in Homer’s description of the shield of Achilles, even in the
                    famous description by Sophocles of his native woods in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oedipus</hi><hi rend="italic">Coloneus,</hi> such word-painting as occurs
                    seems, if not inevitable and unconscious, so alive with imaginative feeling as
                    to become part and parcel of the dramatic or lyric movement itself. And whenever
                    description is so introduced the reader of Greek poetry need not be told that
                    the scenery itself rises before the listener’s imagination with a clearness of
                    outline and a vigour of colour such as no amount of detailed word-painting in
                    the modern fashion can achieve. The picture even in the glorious verses at the
                    end of the eighth book of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> rises before our
                    eyes—seems actually to act upon our bodily senses— simply because the poet’s
                    eagerness to use the picture for merely illustrating the solemnity and
                    importance of his story lends to the picture that very authenticity which the
                    work of the modern word-painter lacks.</p>
                <p>That the true place of poetry lies between music on the one hand and prose, or
                    loosened speech, on the other, was, we say, taken for granted by the one people
                    in whom the artistic instinct was fully developed.</p>
                <p>No doubt they used the word music in a very wide sense, in a sense that might
                    include several arts. But it is a suggestive fact that, in the Greek language,
                    long before poetic art was called “making” it was called “singing.” The poet was
                    not πoo7n7ς but doιδoς. And as regards the Romans it is curious to see how every
                    now and then the old idea that poetry is singing rather than making will
                    disclose itself. It will be remembered for instance how Terence, in the prologue
                    of <hi rend="italic">Phormio,</hi> alludes to poets as musicians. That the
                    ancients were right in this we should be able to show did our scheme permit an
                    historical treatment of poetry: we should be able to show that music and the
                    lyrical function of the poet began together, but that here, as in other things,
                    the progress of art from the implicit to the explicit has separated the two.
                    Every art has its special function, has a certain work which it can do better
                    than any one of its sister arts. Hence its right of existence. For instance,
                    before the “sea of emotion” within the soul has become “curdled into thoughts,”
                    it can be expressed in inarticulate tone. Hence, among the fine arts, music is
                    specially adapted for rendering it. It was perhaps a perception of this fact
                    which made the Syrian Gnostics define life to be “moving music.” When this sea
                    of emotion has “curdled into thoughts,” articulate language rhythmically
                    arranged— words steeped in music and colour, but at the same time embodying
                    ideas—can do what no mere wordless music is able to achieve in giving it
                    expression, just as unrhythmical language, language mortised in a foundation of
                    logic, that is to say prose, can best express these ideas as soon as they have
                    cooled and settled and cleared themselves of emotion altogether. Yet every art
                    can in some degree invade the domain of her sisters, and the nearer these
                    sisters stand to each other the more easily and completely can this invasion be
                    accomplished. Prose, for instance, can sometimes, as in the case of Plato, do
                    some of the work of poetry (however imperfectly, and however trammelled by heavy
                    conditions); and sometimes poetry, as in Pindar’s odes and the waves of the
                    Greek chorus, can do, though in the same imperfect way, the work of music. The
                    poems of Sappho, however, are perhaps the best case in point. Here the poet’s
                    passion is expressed so completely by the mere sound of her verses that a good
                    recitation of them to a person ignorant of Greek would convey something of that
                    passion to the listener; and similar examples almost as felicitous might be
                    culled from Homer, from Aeschylus, and from Sophocles. Nor is this power
                    confined to the Greek poets. The students of Virgil have often and with justice
                    commented on such lines as <hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> v. 481 (where the sudden
                    sinking of a stricken ox is rendered by means of rhythm), and such lines as <hi
                    rend="italic">Georg,</hi> ii. 441, where, by means of verbal sounds, the gusts
                    of wind about a tree are rendered as completely as though the voice were that of
                    the wind itself. In the case of Sappho the effect is produced by the intensity
                    of her passion, in the case of Homer by the intensity of the dramatic vision, in
                    the case of Virgil by a supreme poetic art. But it can also be produced by the
                    mere ingenuity of the artist, as in Edgar Poe’s “Ulalume.” The poet’s object in
                    that remarkable <hi rend="italic">tour de force</hi> was to express dull and
                    hopeless gloom in the same way that the mere musician would have expressed
                    it,—that is to say, by monotonous reiterations, by hollow and dreadful
                    reverberations of gloomy sounds—though as an artist whose vehicle was articulate
                    speech he was obliged to add gloomy ideas, in order to give to his work the
                    intellectual coherence necessary for its existence as a poem. He evidently set
                    out to do this, and he did it, and “Ulalume” properly intoned would produce
                    something like the same effect upon a listener knowing no word of English that
                    it produces upon us.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, music can trench very far upon the domain of articulate
                    speech, as we perceive in the wonderful instrumentation of Wagner. Yet, while it
                    can be shown that the,place of poetry is scarcely so close to sculpture and
                    painting as to music on the one side and loosened speech on the other, the
                    affinity of poetry to music must not be exaggerated. We must be cautious how we
                    follow the canons of Wagner and the more enthusiastic of his disciples, who
                    almost seem to think that <pb break="no"

                    express them—can give voice to the <hi rend="italic">Verstand,</hi> in short, as
                    well as to the <hi rend="italic">Vernunft</hi> of man. Even the Greeks drew a
                    fundamental distinction between melic poetry (poetry written to be sung) and
                    poetry that was written to be recited. It is a pity that, while modern critics
                    of poetry have understood or at least have given attention to painting and
                    sculpture, so few have possessed any knowledge of music—a fact which makes
                    Dante’s treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Vulgari Eloquio</hi>
                    so important. Dante was a musician, and seems to have had a considerable
                    knowledge of the relations between musical and metrical laws. But he did not, we
                    think, assume that these laws are identical.</p>
                <p>If it is indeed possible to establish the identity of musical and metrical laws,
                    it can only be done by a purely scientific investigation; it can only be done by
                    a most searching inquiry into the subtle relations that we know must exist
                    throughout the universe between all the laws of undulation. And it is curious to
                    remember that some of the greatest masters of verbal melody have had no
                    knowledge of music, while some have not even shown any love of it. All Greek
                    boys were taught music, but whether Pindar’s unusual musical skill was born of
                    natural instinct and inevitable passion, or came from the accidental
                    circumstance that his father was, as has been alleged, a musician, and that he
                    was as a boy elaborately taught musical science by Lasus of Hermione, we have no
                    means of knowing. Nor can we now learn how much of Milton’s musical knowledge
                    resulted from a like exceptional “environment,” or from the fact that his father
                    was a musician. But when we find that Shelley seems to have been without the
                    real passion for music, that Rossetti disliked it, and that Coleridge’s
                    apprehension of musical effects was of the ordinary nebulous kind, we must
                    hesitate before accepting the theory of Wagner.</p>
                <p>The question cannot be pursued here; but if it should on inquiry be found that,
                    although poetry is more closely related to music than to any of the other arts,
                    yet the power over verbal melody at its very highest is so all-sufficing to its
                    possessor as in the case of Shelley and Coleridge that absolute music becomes a
                    superfluity, this would only be another illustration of that intense egoism and
                    concentration of force—the impulse of all high artistic energy—which is required
                    in order to achieve the rarest miracles of art.</p>
                <p>With regard to the relation of poetry to prose, Coleridge once asserted in
                    conversation that the real antithesis of poetry was not prose but science. And
                    if he was right the difference in kind lies, not between the poet and the prose
                    writer, but between the literary artist (the man whose instinct is to manipulate
                    language) and the man of facts and of action whose instinct impels him to act,
                    or, if not to act, to inquire.</p>
                <p>One thing is at least certain, that prose, however fervid and emotional it may
                    become, must always be directed, or seem to be directed, by the reins of logic.
                    Or, to vary the metaphor, like a captive balloon it can never really leave the
                    earth.</p>
                <p>Indeed, with the literature of knowledge as opposed to the literature of power
                    poetry has nothing to do. Facts have no place in poetry until they are brought
                    into relation with the human soul. But a mere catalogue of ships may become
                    poetical if it tends to show the strength and pride and glory of the warriors
                    who invested Troy; a detailed description of the designs upon a shield, however
                    beautiful and poetical in itself, becomes still more so if it tends to show the
                    skill of the divine artificer and the invincible splendour of a hero like
                    Achilles. But mere dry exactitude of imitation is not for poetry but for
                    loosened speech. Hence, most of the so-called poetry of Hesiod is not poetry at
                    all. The Muses who spoke to him about “truth” on Mount Helicon made the common
                    mistake of confounding fact with truth. And here we touch upon a very important
                    matter. The reason why in prose speech is loosened is that, untrammelled by the
                    laws of metre, language is able with more exactitude to imitate nature, though
                    of course speech, even when “loosened,” cannot, when actual sensible objects are
                    to be depicted, compete in any real degree with the plastic arts in accuracy of
                    imitation, for the simple reason that its media are not colours nor solids but
                    symbols—arbitrary symbols which can be made to indicate, but never to reproduce,
                    colours and solids. Accuracy of imitation is the first requisite of prose. But
                    the moment language has to be governed by the laws of metre—the moment the
                    conflict begins between the claims of verbal music and the claims of colour and
                    form—then prosaic accuracy has to yield; sharpness of outline, mere fidelity of
                    imitation, such as is within the compass of prose, have in some degree to be
                    sacrificed. But, just as with regard to the relations between poetry and music
                    the greatest master is he who borrows the most that can be borrowed from music,
                    and loses the least that can be lost from metre, so with regard to the relations
                    between poetry and prose the greatest master is he who borrows the most that can
                    be borrowed from prose and loses the least that can be lost from verse. No doubt
                    this is what every poet tries to do by instinct; but some sacrifice on either
                    side there must be, and, with regard to poetry and prose, modern poets at least
                    might be divided into those who make picturesqueness yield to verbal melody, and
                    those who make verbal melody yield to picturesqueness.</p>
                <p>With one class of poets, fine as is perhaps the melody, it is made subservient to
                    outline or to colour; with the other class colour and outline both yield to
                    metre. The chief aim of the first class is to paint a picture; the chief aim of
                    the second is to sing a song. Weber, in driving through a beautiful country,
                    could only enjoy its beauty by translating it into music. The same may be said
                    of some poets with regard to verbal melody. The supreme artist, however, is he
                    whose pictorial and musical power are so interfused that each seems born of the
                    other, as is the case with Sappho, Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and indeed most
                    of the great Greek poets. Among our own poets (leaving the two supreme masters
                    undiscussed) Keats and Coleridge have certainly done this. The colour seems born
                    of the music and the music born of the colour. In French poetry the same triumph
                    has been achieved in Victor Hugo’s magnificent poem “En Marchant la Nuit dans un
                    Bois,” which, as a rendering through verbal music of the witchery of nature,
                    stands alone in the poetry of France. For there the poet conquers that crowning
                    difficulty we have been alluding to, the difficulty of stealing from prose as
                    much distinctness of colour and clearness of outline as can be imported into
                    verse with as little sacrifice as possible of melody.</p>
                <p>But to return to the general relations of poetry to prose. If poetry can in some
                    degree invade the domain of prose, so on the other hand prose can at times
                    invade the domain of poetry, and no doubt the prose of Plato— what is called
                    poetical prose—is a legitimate form of art. Poetry, the earliest form of
                    literature, is also the final and ideal form of all pure literature; and, when
                    Landor insists that poetry and poetical prose are antagonistic, we must remember
                    that Landor’s judgments are mostly based on feeling, and that his hatred of
                    Plato would be quite sufficient basis with him for an entire system of criticism
                    upon poetical prose. As with Carlyle, there was a time in his life when Plato
                    (who of course is the great figure standing between the two arts of metre and
                    loosened speech) had serious thoughts of becoming a poet. And <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n271/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0271-0262"/> perhaps, like Carlyle, having the good sense to
                    see his true function, he himself desisted from writing, and strictly forbade
                    other men to write, in verse. If we consider this, and if we consider that
                    certain of the great English masters of poetic prose in the 17 th century were
                    as incapable of writing in metre as their followers Richter and Carlyle, we
                    shall hardly escape the conclusion on the one hand that the faculty of writing
                    poetry is quite another faculty than that of producing work in the arts most
                    closely allied to it, music and prose, but that on the other hand there is
                    nothing antagonistic between these faculties. So much for poetry’s mere place
                    among the other arts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Importance of Poetry in Relation to other Arts.—As&gt;</hi> to
                    the comparative importance and value of poetry among the other arts, this is a
                    subject upon which much discussion, of a more or less idle kind, has been
                    wasted. We do not feel called to dwell at any length upon it here. Yet a word or
                    two upon the question is necessary in order that we may understand what is the
                    scope and what are the limits of poetry with regard to the other arts,
                    especially with regard to music and to prose.</p>
                <p>There is one great point of superiority that musical art exhibits over metrical
                    art. This consists, not in the capacity for melody, but in the capacity for
                    harmony in the musician' <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi> sense. The finest music of
                    Aeschylus, of Pindar, of Sh 'ιespeare, of Milton, is after all only a succession
                    of melodi <hi rend="smallcaps">jus</hi> notes, and, in endeavouring to catch the
                    harmonic intent of strophe, antistrophe, and epode in the Greek chorus and in
                    the true ode (that of Pindar), we can only succeed by pressing memory into our
                    service. We have to recall by memory the waves that have gone before, and then
                    to imagine their harmonic power in relation to the waves at present occupying
                    the ear. Counterpoint, therefore, is not to be achieved by the metricist, even
                    though he be Pindar himself; but in music this perfect ideal harmony was
                    foreshadowed perhaps in the earliest writing. We know at least that as early as
                    the 12th century counterpoint began to show a vigorous life, and the study of it
                    is now a familiar branch of musical science. Now, inasmuch as “Nature’s own
                    hymn” is and must be the harmonic blending of apparently independent and
                    apparently discordant notes, among the arts whose appeal is through the ear that
                    which can achieve counterpoint must perhaps rank as a pure art above one which
                    cannot achieve it. We are of course speaking here of metre only. We have not
                    time to inquire whether the counterpoint of absolute poetry is the harmony
                    underlying apparently discordant emotions—the emotion produced by a word being
                    more persistent than the emotion produced by an inarticulate sound.</p>
                <p>But if poetry falls behind music in rhythmic scope, it is capable of rendering
                    emotion after emotion has become disintegrated into thoughts, and here, as we
                    have seen, it enters into direct competition with the art of prose. It can use
                    the emphasis of sound, not for its own sake merely, but to strengthen the
                    emphasis of sense, and can thus give a fuller and more adequate expression to
                    the soul of man than music at its highest can give. With regard to prose, no
                    doubt such writing as Plato’s description of the chariot of the soul, his
                    description of the island of Atlantis, or of Er’s visit to the place of departed
                    souls, comes but a short way behind poetry in imaginative and even in rhythmic
                    appeal. It is impossible, however, here to do more than touch upon the subject
                    of the rhythm of prose in its relation to the rhythm of poetry; for in this
                    matter the genius of each individual language has to be taken into account.</p>
                <p>Perhaps it may be said that deeper than all the rhythms of art is that rhythm
                    which art would fain catch, the rhythm of nature; for the rhythm of nature is
                    the rhythm of life itself. This rhythm can be caught by prose as well as by
                    poetry, such prose, for instance, as that of the English Bible. Certainly the
                    rhythm of verse at its highest, such, for instance, as that of Shakespeare’s
                    greatest writings, is nothing more and nothing less than the metre of that
                    energy of the spirit which surges within the bosom of him who speaks, whether he
                    speak in verse or in impassioned prose. Being rhythm, it is of course governed
                    by law, but it is a law which transcends in subtlety the conscious art of the
                    metricist, and is only caught by the poet in his most inspired moods, a law
                    which, being part of nature’s own sanctions, can of course never be formulated
                    but only expressed, as it is expressed in the melody of the bird, in the
                    inscrutable harmony of the entire bird-chorus of a thicket, in the whisper of
                    the leaves of the tree, and in the song or wail of wind and sea. Now is not this
                    rhythm of nature represented by that “sense rhythm” which prose can catch as
                    well as poetry, that sense rhythm whose finest expressions are to be found in
                    the Bible, Hebrew and English, and in the Biblical movements of the English
                    Prayer Book, and in the dramatic prose of Shakespeare at its best? Whether it is
                    caught by prose or by verse, one of the virtues of the rhythm of nature is that
                    it is translatable. Hamlet’s peroration about man and Raleigh’s apostrophe to
                    death are as translatable into other languages as are the Hebrew psalms, or as
                    is Manu’s magnificent passage about the singleness of man (we quote from memory)
                    :—</p>
                <p>“Single is each man born into the world; single he dies; single he receives the
                    reward of his good deeds, and single the punishment of his evil deeds. When he
                    dies his body lies like a fallen tree upon the earth, but his virtue accompanies
                    his soul. Wherefore let man harvest and garner virtue, so that he may have an
                    inseparable companion in traversing that gloom which is so hard to be
                    traversed.”</p>
                <p>Here the rhythm, being the inevitable movement of emotion and “sense,” can be
                    caught and translated by every literature under the sun. While, however, the
                    great goal before the poet is to compel the listener to expect his caesuric
                    effects, the great goal before the writer of poetic prose is in the very
                    opposite direction; it is to make use of the concrete figures and impassioned
                    diction of the poet, but at the same time to avoid the recognized and expected
                    metrical bars upon which the poet depends. The moment the prose poet passes from
                    the rhythm of prose to the rhythm of metre the apparent sincerity of his writing
                    is destroyed.</p>
                <p>And now how stands poetry with regard to the plastic arts <hi rend="italic"
                    >1</hi> This is in truth a vast subject, and has given birth to an infinitude of
                    eloquent criticism in the present century. It cannot be expected that we should
                    be able to discuss it adequately here. Yet this, too, must be glanced at. On the
                    one side poetry is inferior to the plastic arts; on another side it is superior
                    to them.</p>
                <p>As compared with sculpture and painting the great infirmity of poetry, as an
                    “imitation” of nature, is of course that the medium is always and of necessity
                    words—even when no words could, in the dramatic situation, have been spoken. It
                    is not only Homer who is obliged sometimes to forget that passion when at white
                    heat is never voluble, is scarcely even articulate; the dramatists also are
                    obliged to forget that in love and in hate, at their tensest, words seem weak
                    and foolish when compared with the silent and satisfying triumph and glory of
                    deeds, such as the plastic arts can render. This becomes manifest enough when we
                    compare the Niobe group or the Laocoon group, or the great dramatic paintings of
                    the modern world, with even the finest efforts of dramatic poetry, such as the
                    speech of Andromache to Hector, or the speech of Priam to Achilles, nay such as
                    even the cries of Cassandra in the <hi rend="italic">Agamemnon,</hi> or the
                    wailings of Lear over the dead Cordelia. Even when writing the words uttered by
                    Oedipus, as the terrible truth <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0272-0263"/> breaks in upon his soul, Sophocles must have felt
                    that, in the holiest chambers of sorrow and in the highest agonies of suffering
                    reigns that awful silence which not poetry, but painting sometimes, and
                    sculpture always, can render. What human sounds could render the agony of Niobe,
                    or the agony of Laocoon, as we see them in the sculptor’s rendering? Not
                    articulate speech at all; not words but wails. It is the same with hate; it is
                    the same with love. We are not speaking merely of the unpacking of the heart in
                    which the angry warriors of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> indulge. Even such
                    subtle writing as that of Aeschylus and Sophocles falls below the work of the
                    painter. Hate, though voluble perhaps, as Clytsemnestra’s when hate is at that
                    red-heat glow which the poet can render, changes in a moment whenever that
                    redness has been fanned to hatred’s own last complexion—whiteness as of iron at
                    the melting-point,·—when the heart has grown far too big to be “unpacked” at
                    all, and even the bitter epigrams of hate’s own rhetoric, though brief as the
                    terrier’s snap before he fleshes his teeth, or as the short snarl of the tigress
                    as she springs before her cubs in danger, are all too slow and sluggish for a
                    soul to which language at its tensest has become idle play. But this is just
                    what cannot be rendered by an art whose medium consists solely of words.</p>
                <p>It is in giving voice, not to emotion at its tensest, but to the variations of
                    emotion, it is in expressing the countless shifting movements of the soul from
                    passion to passion, that poetry shows in spite of all her infirmities her
                    superiority to the plastic arts. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Agamemnon,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oedipus</hi><hi rend="italic">Tyrannus,</hi> are adequate to the
                    entire breadth and depth of man’s soul.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Poetic Imagination.—</hi> We have now reached our last general
                    inquiry—What varieties of poetic art are the outcome of the two kinds of poetic
                    impulse, dramatic imagination and lyric or egoistic imagination? It would of
                    course be impossible within tue space at our command to examine fully the
                    subject of poetic imagination. For in order to do so we should have to enter
                    upon the vast question of the effect of artistic environment upon the
                    development of man’s poetic imagination; we should have to inquire how the
                    instinctive methods of each poet and of each group of poets have been modified
                    and often governed by the methods characteristic of their own time and country.
                    We should have to inquire, for instance, how far such landscape as that of
                    Sophocles in the <hi rend="italic">Oedipus</hi><hi rend="italic">Coloneus</hi>
                    and such landscape as that of Wordsworth depends upon difference of individual
                    temperament, and how far upon difference of artistic environment. That, in any
                    thorough and exhaustive discussion of poetic imagination, the question of
                    artistic environment must be taken into account, the case of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> is alone sufficient to show—a case that will at once
                    occur to the reader. Ages before Phrynichus, ages before an acted drama was
                    dreamed of, a dramatic poet of the first order arose, and, though he was obliged
                    to express his splendid dramatic imagination through epic forms, he expressed it
                    almost as fully as if he had inherited the method and the stage of Sophocles.
                    And if Homer never lived at all, then an entire group of dramatic poets arose in
                    remote times whose method was epic instead of dramatic simply because there was
                    then no stage.</p>
                <p>This, contrasted with the fact that in a single half-century the tragic art of
                    Greece arose with Aeschylus, culminated with Sophocles, and decayed with
                    Euripides, and contrasted also with the fact that in England at one time, and in
                    Spain at one time, almost the entire poetic imagination of the country found
                    expression in the acted drama alone, is sufficient to show that a poet’s
                    artistic methods are very largely influenced by the artistic environments of his
                    country and time. So vast a subject as this, however, is, as we say, quite
                    beyond the scope of any essay like this, and we can only point to the familiar
                    instance of the troubadours and the trouvères and then pass on.</p>
                <p>With the trouvère (the poet of the <hi rend="italic">langue (Toil),</hi> the
                    story or situation is always the end of which the musical language is the means;
                    with the troubadour (the poet of the <hi rend="italic">langue d’oc),</hi> the
                    form is so beloved, the musical language so enthralling, that, however beautiful
                    may be the story or situation, it is felt to be no more than the means to a more
                    beloved and beautiful end. But then nature makes her own troubadours and her own
                    trouvères irrespective of fashion and of time—irrespective of <hi rend="italic"
                    >langue d’oc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">langue d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">dU.</hi> And, in comparing the troubadours
                    with the trouvères, this is what strikes us at once— there are certain
                    troubadours who by temperament, by original endowment of nature, ought to have
                    been trouvères, and there are certain trouvères who by temperament ought to have
                    been troubadours. Surrounding conditions alone have made them what they are.
                    There are those whose impulse (though writing in obedience to contemporary
                    fashions lyrics in the <hi rend="italic">langue d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">oc)</hi> is manifestly to narrate, and
                    there are those whose impulse (though writing in obedience to contemporary
                    fashions <hi rend="italic">fabliaux</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">langue</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d’oïl)</hi> is simply to sing. In other words, there are those
                    who, though writing after the fashion of their brother-troubadours, are more
                    impressed with the romance and wonderfulness of the human life outside them than
                    with the romance and wonderfulness of their own passions, and who delight in
                    depicting the external world in any form that may be the popular form of their
                    time; and there are those who, though writing after the fashion of their
                    brother-trouvères, are far more occupied with the life within them than with
                    that outer life which the taste of their time and country calls upon them to
                    paint—born rhythmists who must sing, who translate everything external as well
                    as internal into verbal melody. Of the former class Pierre Vidal, of the latter
                    class the author of “Le Lay de 1’Oiselet,” may be taken as the respective
                    types.</p>
                <p>That the same forces are seen at work in all literatures few students of poetry
                    will deny,—though in some poetical groups these forces are no doubt more potent
                    than in others, as, for instance, with the great parable poets of Persia, in
                    some of whom there is perpetually apparent a conflict between the dominance of
                    the Oriental taste for allegory and subtle suggestion, as expressed in the
                    Zoroastrian definition of poetry,—“apparent pictures of un-apparent
                    realities,”—and the opposite yearning to represent human life with the freshness
                    and natural freedom characteristic of Western poetry.</p>
                <p>Allowing, however, for all the potency of external influences, we shall not be
                    wrong in saying that of poetic imagination there are two distinct kinds—(1) the
                    kind of poetic imagination seen at its highest in Aeschylus, Sophocles,
                    Shakespeare, and Homer, and (2) the kind of poetic imagination seen at its
                    highest in Pindar, Dante, and Milton, or else in Sappho, Heine, and Shelley. The
                    former, being in its highest dramatic exercise unconditioned by the personal or
                    lyrical impulse of the poet, might perhaps be called absolute dramatic vision;
                    the latter, being more or less conditioned by the personal or lyrical impulse of
                    the poet, might be called relative dramatic vision. It seems impossible to
                    classify poets, or to classify the different varieties of poetry, without
                    drawing some such distinction as this, whatever words of definition we may
                    choose to adopt.</p>
                <p>For the achievement of all pure lyric poetry, such as the ode, the song, the
                    elegy, the idyl, the sonnet, the stornello, it is evident that the imaginative
                    force we have called relative vision will suffice. And if we consider the matter
                    thoroughly, in many other forms of poetic art—forms <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n273/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0273-0264"/> which at first sight might seem to require
                    absolute vision —we shall find nothing but relative vision at work.</p>
                <p>Even in Dante, and even in Milton and Virgil, it might be difficult to trace the
                    working of any other than relative vision. And as to the entire body of Asiatic
                    poets it might perhaps be found (even in view of the Indian drama) that relative
                    vision suffices to do all their work. Indeed the temper which produces true
                    drama is, it might almost be said, a growth of the Western mind. For, unless it
                    be Semitic as seen in the dramatic narratives of the Bible, or Chinese as seen
                    in that remarkable prose story, <hi rend="italic">The Two Fair Cousins,</hi>
                    translated by Rémusat, absolute vision seems to have but small place in the
                    literatures of Asia. The wonderfulness of the world and the romantic
                    possibilities of fate, or circumstance, or chance—not the wonderfulness of the
                    character to whom these possibilities befall—are ever present to the mind of the
                    Asiatic poet. Even in so late a writer as the poet of the <hi rend="italic">Shäh
                    Nämeh,</hi> the hero Irij, the hero Zal, and the hero Zohreb are in character
                    the same person, the virtuous young man who combines the courage of youth with
                    the wisdom and forbearance of age. And, as regards the earlier poets of Asia, it
                    was not till the shadowy demigods and heroes of the Asiatic races crossed the
                    Caucasus, and breathed a more bracing air, that they became really individual
                    characters. But among the many qualities of man’s mind that were invigorated and
                    rejuvenated by that great exodus from the dreamy plains of Asia is to be
                    counted, above all others, his poetic imagination. The mere sense of wonder,
                    which had formerly been an all-sufficing source of pleasure to him, was
                    all-sufficing no longer. The wonderful adventure must now be connected with a
                    real and interesting individual character. It was left for the poets of Europe
                    to show that, given the interesting character, given the Achilles, the Odysseus,
                    the Helen, the Priam, any adventure happening to such a character becomes
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>What then is this absolute vision, this true dramatic imagination which can
                    hardly be found in Asia—which even in Europe cannot be found except in rare
                    cases? Between relative and absolute vision the difference seems to be this,
                    that the former only enables the poet, even in its very highest exercise, to
                    make his own individuality, or else humanity as represented by his own
                    individuality, live in the imagined situation; the latter enables him in its
                    highest exercise to make special individual characters other than the poet’s own
                    live in the imagined situation.</p>
                <p>“That which exists in nature,” says Hegel, “is a something purely individual and
                    particular. Art on the contrary is essentially destined to manifest the
                    general.” And no doubt this is true as regards the plastic arts, and true also
                    as regards literary art, save in the very highest reaches of pure drama and pure
                    lyric, when it seems to become art no longer—when it seems to become the very
                    voice of Nature herself. The cry of Priam when he puts to his lips the hand that
                    slew his son is not merely the cry of a bereaved and aged parent; it is the cry
                    of the individual king of Troy, and expresses above everything else that most
                    naif, pathetic, and winsome character. Put the words into the mouth of the
                    irascible and passionate Lear and they would be entirely out of keeping.</p>
                <p>It may be said then that, while the poet of relative vision, even in its very
                    highest exercise, can only, when depicting the external world, deal with the
                    general, the poet of absolute vision can compete with Nature herself and deal
                    with both general and particular. Now if this is really so we may perhaps find a
                    basis for a classification of poetry and of poets. That all poets must be
                    singers has already been maintained. But singers seem to be divisible into three
                    classes :—first the pure lyrists, each of whom can with his one voice sing only
                    one tune; secondly the epic poets, save Homer, the bulk of the narrative poets,
                    and the quasi-dramatists, each of whom can with his one voice sing several
                    tunes; and thirdly the true dramatists, who, having, like the nightingale of
                    Gongora, many tongues, can sing all tunes.</p>
                <p>It is to the first-named of these classes that most poets belong. With regard to
                    the second class, there are not of course many poets left for it: the first
                    absorbs so many. But, when we come to consider that among those who, with each
                    his one voice, can sing many tunes, are Pindar, Firdausi, Jami, Virgil, Dante,
                    Milton, Spenser, Goethe, Byron, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, Schiller, Victor
                    Hugo, the second class is so various that no generalization save such a broad
                    one as ours could embrace its members. And now we come to class three, and must
                    pause. The third class is necessarily very small. In it can only be placed such
                    names as Shakespeare, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Homer, and (hardly) Chaucer.</p>
                <p>These three kinds of poets represent three totally different kinds of poetic
                    activity.</p>
                <p>With regard to the first, the pure lyrists, the impulse is pure egoism. Many of
                    them have less of even relative vision at its highest than the mass of mankind.
                    They are often too much engaged with the emotions within to have any deep
                    sympathy with the life around them. Of every poet of this class it may be said
                    that his mind to him “a kingdom is,” and that the smaller the poet the bigger to
                    him is that kingdom. To make use of a homely image—like the chaffinch whose eyes
                    have been pricked by the bird-fancier, the pure lyrtst is sometimes a warbler
                    because he is blind. Still he feels that the Muse loves him éxceedingly. She
                    takes away his eyesight, but she gives him sweet song. And his song is very
                    sweet, very sad, and very beautiful; but it is all about the world within his
                    own soul—its sorrows, joys, fears, and aspirations.</p>
                <p>With regard to the second class the impulse here is no doubt a kind of egoism
                    too; yet the poets of this class are all of a different temper from the pure
                    lyrists. They have a wide imagination; but it is still relative, still egoistic.
                    They have splendid eyes, but eyes that never get beyond seeing general,
                    universal humanity (typified by themselves) in the imagined situation. Not even
                    to these is it given to break through that law of centrality by which every “me”
                    feels itself to be the central “me ”—the only “me” of the universe, round which
                    all other spurious “mes” revolve. This “me” of theirs they can transmute into
                    many shapes, but they cannot create other “mes,”— nay, for egoism, some of them
                    scarcely would perhaps if they could.</p>
                <p>The third class, the true dramatists, whose impulse is the simple yearning to
                    create akin to that which made “the great Vishnu yearn to create a world,” are
                    “of imagination all compact,”—so much so that when at work “the divinity” which
                    Iamblichus speaks of “seizes for the time the soul and guides it as he
                    will.”</p>
                <p>The distinction between the pure lyrists and the other two classes of poets is
                    obvious enough. But the distinction between the quasi-dramatists and the pure
                    dramatists requires a word of explanation before we proceed to touch upon the
                    various kinds of poetry that spring from the exercise of relative and absolute
                    vision. Sometimes, to be sure, the vision of the true dramatists—the greatest
                    dramatists —will suddenly become narrowed and obscured, as in that part of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Oedipus</hi><hi rend="italic">Tyrannus</hi> where Sophocles
                    makes Oedipus ignorant of what every one in Thebes must have known, the murder
                    of Laius. And again, finely as Sophocles has conceived the character of Electra,
                    he makes her, in her dispute with Chrysothemis, give expression to sentiments
                    that, in another play of his own, come far more <pb break="no"

                    Antigone in a parallel dispute with Ismene. And, on the other hand, examples of
                    relative vision, in its furthest reaches, can be found in abundance everywhere,
                    especially in Virgil, Dante, Calderon, and Milton; but in our limited space we
                    can give but two or three. Some of the most remarkable examples of that high
                    kind of relative vision which may easily be mistaken for absolute vision may be
                    found in those great prose epics of the North which Aristotle would have called
                    poems. Here is one from the <hi rend="italic">Volsunga Saga.</hi> While the
                    brothers of Gudrun are about their treacherous business of murdering Sigurd, her
                    husband, as he lies asleep in her arms, Brynhild, Sigurd’s former love, who in
                    the frenzy of “love turned to hate” has instigated the murderers to the deed,
                    hovers outside the chamber with Gunnar, her husband, and listens to the wail of
                    her rival who is weltering in Sigurd’s blood. At the sound of that wail Brynhild
                    laughs</p>
                <p>“Then said Gunnar to her, Thou laughest not because thy heart roots are gladded,
                    <hi rend="italic">or else why doth thy visage wax so wan ?”</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Translation of Morris and
                    Magnusson.</p></note> This is of course very fine; but, as any two characters in
                    that dramatic situation might have done that dramatic business, fine as it
                    is,—as the sagaman gives us the general and not the particular,—the vision at
                    work is not absolute but relative at its very highest exercise. But our examples
                    will be more interesting if taken from English poets. In Coleridge’s “Ancient
                    Mariner” we find an immense amount of relative vision of so high a kind that at
                    first it seems absolute vision. When the ancient mariner, in his narrative to
                    the wedding guest, reaches the slaying of the albatross, he stops, he can
                    proceed no further, and the wedding guest exclaims —</p>
                <p>“God save thee, Ancient Mariner, From the fiends that plague thee thus!</p>
                <p>Why look’st thou so ?” “With my cross-bow I shot the albatross.”</p>
                <p>But there are instances of relative vision—especially in the great master of
                    absolute vision, Shakespeare—which are higher still,—so high indeed that not to
                    relegate them to absolute vision seems at first sight pedantic. Such an example
                    is the famous speech of Lady Macbeth in the second act, where she says—</p>
                <p>“Had he not resembled My father as he slept, I had done ’t.”</p>
                <p>Marvellously subtle as is this speech, it will be found, if analysed, that it
                    expresses the general human soul rather than any one special human soul. Indeed
                    Leigh Hunt records the case of a bargeman who, charged with robbing a sleeping
                    traveller in his barge, used in his confession almost identical words—“Had he
                    not looked like my father as he slept, I should have killed as well as robbed
                    him.” Again, the thousand and one cases (to be found in every literature) where
                    a character, overwhelmed by some sudden surprise or terror, asks whether the
                    action going on is that of a dream or of real life, must all, on severe
                    analysis, be classed under relative rather than under absolute vision, —even
                    such a fine speech, for instance, as that where Pericles, on discovering Marina,
                    exclaims—</p>
                <p>“This is the rarest dream that e’er dull sleep Did mock sad fools withal or as
                    that in the third act of <hi rend="italic">Titus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Andronicus,</hi> where Titus, beholding his mutilated and ruined daughter,
                    asks—</p>
                <p>“When will this fearful slumber have an end ?”</p>
                <p>even here, we say, the humanity rendered is general and not particular, the
                    vision at work is relative and not absolute. The poet, as representing the whole
                    human race, throwing himself into the imagined situation, gives us what general
                    humanity would have thought, felt, said, or done in that situation, not what one
                    particular individual and he alone would have thought, felt, said, or done.</p>
                <p>Now what we have called absolute vision operates in a very different way. So
                    vividly is the poet’s mere creative instinct at work that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ego</hi> sinks into passivity—becomes insensitive to all impressions other than
                    those dictated by the vision—by the “divinity” which has “seized the soul.”</p>
                <p>We have left ourselves little room for examples; but Shakespeare is full of
                    them.</p>
                <p>Take the scene in the first act of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> where Hamlet
                    hears for the first time, from Horatio, that his father’s ghost haunts the
                    castle. Having by short sharp questions elicited the salient facts attending the
                    apparition, Hamlet says, “I would I had been there.” To this Horatio makes the
                    very commonplace reply, “It would have much amazed you.” Note the marvellously
                    dramatic reply of Hamlet—“Very like, very like! Stayed it long <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ?” Suppose that this dialogue had been attempted by
                    any other poet than a true dramatist, or by a true dramatist in any other mood
                    than his very highest, Hamlet, on hearing Horatio’s commonplace remarks upon
                    phenomena which to Hamlet were more subversive of the very order of the universe
                    than if a dozen stars had fallen from their courses, would have burst out
                    with—“Amazed me !” and then would have followed an eloquent declamation about
                    the “amazing” nature of the phenomena and their effect upon him. But so entirely
                    has the poet become Hamlet, so completely has “the divinity seized his soul,”
                    that all language seems equally weak for expressing the turbulence within the
                    soul of the character, and Hamlet exclaims in a sort of meditative irony, “Very
                    like, very like!” It is exactly this one man Hamlet, and no other man, who in
                    this situation would have so expressed himself. Charles Knight has some
                    pertinent remarks upon this speech of Hamlet; yet he misses its true value, and
                    treats it from the general rafher than from the particular side. Instances of
                    absolute vision in Shakspeare crowd upon us; but we can find room for only one
                    other. In the pathetic speech of Othello, just before he kills himself, he
                    declares himself to be—</p>
                <p>“One not easily jealous, but, being <hi rend="italic">wrought,</hi> Perplexed in
                    the extreme.”</p>
                <p>Consider the marvellous <hi rend="italic">timbre</hi> of the word “wrought,” as
                    coming from a character like Othello. When writing this passage, especially when
                    writing this word, the poet had become entirely the simple English soldier-hero,
                    as the Moor really is—he had become Othello, looking upon himself “as not easily
                    jealous,” whereas he was “wrought” and “perplexed in the extreme” by tricks
                    which Hamlet would have seen through in a moment.</p>
                <p>While all other forms of poetic art can be vitalized by relative vision, there
                    are two forms (and these the greatest) in which absolute vision is demanded,
                    viz., the drama, and in a lesser degree the Greek epic, especially the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> This will be seen more plainly perhaps if we now vary
                    our definitions and call relative vision egoistic imagination, absolute vision
                    dramatic imagination.</p>
                <p>Drama has been already fully treated in the present work (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Drama).</hi> But it follows from what has been here said that
                    very much of the dramatist’s work can be, and in fact is, effected by egoistic
                    imagination, while true dramatic imagination is only called into play on
                    comparatively rare occasions. Not only fine but sublime dramatic poems have been
                    written, however, where the vitalizing power has been entirely that of lyrical
                    imagination. We need only instance the <hi rend="italic">Prometheus Bound</hi>
                    of Aeschylus, the most sublime poem in the world. The dramas of Shelley too,
                    like those of Victor Hugo and Calderon, are informed entirely by egoistic
                    imagination. In all these <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n275/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0275-0266"/> splendid poems the dramatist places himself in
                    the imagined situation, or at most he places there some typical conception of
                    universal humanity. There is not in all Calderon any such display of dramatic
                    imagination as we get in that wonderful speech of Priam’s in the last book of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> to which we have before alluded. There is not
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Cenci</hi> such a display of dramatic imagination as we
                    get in the sudden burst of anger from the spoilt child of gods and men, Achilles
                    (anger which alarms the hero himself as much as it alarms Priam), when the
                    prattle of the old man has carried him too far. It may seem bold to say that the
                    drama of Goethe is informed by egoistic imagination only,—assuredly the
                    prison-scene in <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> is unsurpassed in the literatures
                    of the world. Yet, perhaps, it could be shown of the passion and the pathos of
                    Gretchen throughout the entire play that it betrays a female character general
                    and typical rather than individual and particular.</p>
                <p>The nature of this absolute vision or true dramatic imagination is easily seen if
                    we compare the dramatic work of writers without absolute vision, such as
                    Calderon, Goethe, Ben Jonson, Fletcher, and others, with the dramatic work of
                    Aeschylus and of Shakespeare. While of the former group it may be said that each
                    poet skilfully works his imagination, of Aeschylus and Shakespeare it must be
                    said that each in his highest dramatic mood does not work, but is worked <hi
                    rend="italic">by</hi> his imagination. Note, for instance, how the character of
                    Clytaemnestra grows and glows under the hand of Aeschylus. The poet of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> had distinctly said that Aegisthus, her paramour, had
                    struck the blow, but the dramatist, having imagined the greatest tragic female
                    in all poetry, finds it impossible to let a man like Aegisthus assist such a
                    woman in a homicide so daring and so momentous. And when in that terrible speech
                    of hers she justifies her crime (ostensibly to the outer world, but really to
                    her own conscience), the way in which, by the sheer magnetism of irresistible
                    personality, she draws our sympathy to herself and her crime is unrivalled out
                    of Shakespeare and not surpassed even there. In the Great Drama, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Agamemnon,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Macbeth,</hi> there is an
                    imagination at work whose laws are inexorable, are inevitable, as the laws by
                    the operation of which the planets move around the sun. But in this essay our
                    business with drama is confined entirely to its relations to epic.</p>
                <p>Considering how large and on the whole how good is the body of modem criticism
                    upon drama, it is surprising how poor is the modern criticism upon epic.
                    Aristotle, comparing tragedy with epic, gives the palm to tragedy as being the
                    more perfect art, and nothing can be more ingenious than the way in which he has
                    marshalled his reasons. He tells us that tragedy as well as epic is capable of
                    producing its effect even without action; we can judge of it perfectly, says he,
                    by reading. He goes so far as to say that, even in reading as well as in
                    representation, tragedy has an advantage over the epic, the advantage of greater
                    clearness and distinctness of impression. And in some measure this was perhaps
                    true of Greek tragedy, for as Müller in his <hi rend="italic">Dissertations on
                    the Eumenides</hi> has well said, the ancients always remained and wished to
                    remain conscious that the whole was a Dionysian entertainment; the quest of a
                    common-place <hi rend="italic">απάτη</hi> came afterwards. And even of Romantic
                    Drama it may be said that in the time of Shakespeare, and indeed down through
                    the 18th century, it never lost entirely its character of a recitation as well
                    as a drama. It was not till melodrama began to be recognized as a legitimate
                    form of dramatic art that the dialogue had to be struck from the dramatic action
                    “at full speed” —struck like sparks from the roadster’s shoes. The truth is,
                    however, that it was idle for Aristotle to inquire which is the more important
                    branch of poetry, epic or tragedy.</p>
                <p>Equally idle would it be for the modern critic to inquire how much romantic drama
                    gained and how much it lost by abandoning the chorus. Much has been said as to
                    the scope and the limits of epic and dramatic poetry. If in epic the poet has
                    the power to take the imagination of his audience away from the dramatic centre
                    and show what is going on at the other end of the great web of the world, he can
                    do the same thing in drama by the chorus, and also by the introduction into the
                    dramatic circle of messengers and others from the outside world.</p>
                <p>But, as regards epic poetry, is it right that we should hear, as we sometimes do
                    hear, the voice of the poet himself as chorus bidding us contrast the present
                    picture with other pictures afar off, in order to enforce its teaching and
                    illustrate its pathos? This is a favourite method with modern poets and a still
                    more favourite one with prose narrators. Does it not give an air of
                    self-consciousness to poetry? Does it not disturb the intensity of the poetic
                    vision? Yet it has the sanction of Homer; and who shall dare to challenge the
                    methods of the great father of epic? An instance occurs in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> v. 158, where, in the midst of all the stress of fight, the poet
                    leaves the dramatic action to tell us what became of the inheritance of
                    Phaenops, after his two sons had been slain by Diomedes. Another instance occurs
                    in iii. 243-4, where the poet, after Helen’s pathetic mention of her brothers,
                    comments on the causes of their absence, “criticizes life” in the approved
                    modern way, generalizes upon the impotence of human intelligence— the impotence
                    even of human love—to pierce the darkness in which the web of human fate is
                    woven. Thus she spoke (the poet tells us); but the life-giving earth already
                    possessed them, there in Lacedaemon, in their dear native land :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">&amp;s φdτo∙ robs</hi> δ’ ⅛δη <hi rend="italic">κdτeχev
                    φυσiζoos ala tv Λ,aκeδaiμovι aδθι, φlλτ) tv ∙κaτpiSι yalτ).</hi></p>
                <p>This of course is “beautiful exceedingly,” but, inasmuch as the imagination at
                    work is egoistic or lyrical, not dramatic, inasmuch as the vision is relative
                    not absolute, it does not represent that epic strength at its very highest which
                    we call specially “Homeric,” unless indeed we remember that with Homer the Muses
                    are omniscient: this certainly may give the passage a deep dramatic value it
                    otherwise seems to lack.</p>
                <p>The deepest of all the distinctions between dramatic and epic methods has
                    relation, however, to the nature of the dialogue. Aristotle failed to point it
                    out, and this is remarkable until we remember that his work is but a fragment of
                    a great system of criticism. In epic poetry, and in all poetry that narrates,
                    whether the poet be Homer, Chaucer, Thomas the Rhymer, Gottfried von Strasburg,
                    or Turoldus, the action, of course, moves by aid partly of narrative and partly
                    by aid of dialogue, but in drama the dialogue has a quality of suggestiveness
                    and subtle inference which we do not expect to find in any other poetic form
                    save perhaps that of the purely dramatic ballad. In ancient drama this quality
                    of suggestiveness and subtle inference is seen not only in the dialogue, but in
                    the choral odes. The third ode of the <hi rend="italic">Agamemnon</hi> is an
                    extreme case in point, where, by a kind of <hi rend="italic">double
                    entendre,</hi> the relations of Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus are darkly alluded
                    to under cover of allusions to Paris and Helen. Of this dramatic subtlety
                    Sophocles is perhaps the greatest master; and certain critics have been led to
                    speak as though irony were heart-thought of Sophoclean drama. But the
                    suggestiveness of Sophocles is pathetic (as Prof. Lewis Campbell has well
                    pointed out) not ironical. This is one reason why drama more than epic seems to
                    satisfy the mere intellect<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0276-0267"/> of the reader, though this may be counterbalanced
                    by the hardness of mechanical structure which sometimes disturbs the reader’s
                    imagination in tragedy.</p>
                <p>When, for instance, a dramatist pays so much attention to the evolution of the
                    plot as Sophocles does, it is inevitable that his characters should be more or
                    less plot-ridden; they have to say and do now and then certain things which they
                    would not say and do but for the exigencies of the plot. Indeed one of the
                    advantages which epic certainly has over drama is that the story can be made to
                    move as rapidly as the poet may desire without these mechanical modifications of
                    character.</p>
                <p>The only kind of epic for Aristotle to consider was Greek epic, between which and
                    all other epic the difference is one of kind, if the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> alone is taken to represent Greek epic. In speaking of the effect
                    that surrounding conditions seem to have upon the form in which the poetic
                    energy of any time or country should express itself, we instanced the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> as a typical case. The imagination vivifying it is
                    mainly dramatic. The characters represent much more than the mere variety of
                    mood of the delineator. Notwithstanding all the splendid works of Calderon,
                    Marlowe, Webster, and Goethe, it is doubtful whether as a born dramatist the
                    poet of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> does not come nearer to Aeschylus and
                    Shakespeare than does any other poet. His passion for making the heroes speak
                    for themselves is almost a fault in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> considered
                    as pure epic, and the unconscious way in which each actor is made to depict his
                    own character is in the highest spirit of drama. It is owing to this speciality
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> that it stands apart from all other epic
                    save that of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> where, however, the dramatic
                    vision is less vivid. It is owing to the dramatic imagination displayed in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> that it is impossible to say, from internal
                    evidence, whether the poem is to be classified with the epics of growth or with
                    the epics of art. All epics are clearly divisible into two classes, first those
                    which are a mere accretion of poems or traditionary ballads, and second, those
                    which, though based indeed on tradition or history, have become so fused in the
                    mind of one great poet, so stained, therefore, with the colour and temper of
                    that mind, as to become new crystallizations —inventions, in short, as we
                    understand that word. Each kind of epic has excellencies peculiar to itself,
                    accompanied by peculiar and indeed necessary defects. In the one we get the
                    freedom—apparently schemeless and motiveless— of nature, but, as a consequence,
                    miss that “hard acorn of thought” (to use the picturesque definition in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Volsunga Saga</hi> of the heart of a man) which the mind asks for
                    as the core of every work of art. In the other this great requisite of an
                    adequate central thought is found, but accompanied by a constriction, a lack of
                    freedom, a cold artificiality, the obtrusion of a pedantic scheme, which would
                    be intolerable to the natural mind unsophisticated by literary study. The flow
                    of the one is as that of a river, the flow of the other as that of a canal. Yet,
                    as has been already hinted, though the great charm of Nature herself is that she
                    never teases us with any obtrusive exhibitions of scheme, she doubtless has a
                    scheme somewhere, she does somewhere hide a “hard acorn of thought <hi
                    rend="italic">” of</hi> which the poem of the universe is the expanded
                    expression. And, this being so, art should have a scheme too; but in such a
                    dilemma is she placed in this matter that the epic poet, unless he is evidently
                    telling the story for its own sake, scornful of purposes ethic or aesthetic,
                    must sacrifice illusion.</p>
                <p>Among the former class of epics are to be placed the great epics of growth, such
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata,</hi> the Niblung story, &lt;fcc.; among
                    the latter the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aeneid,</hi><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gerusalemme</hi><hi rend="italic">Liberata,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lusiadas.</hi></p>
                <p>But where in this classification are we to find a place for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad 1</hi> The heart-thought of the greatest epic in all literature is simply
                    that Achilles was vexed and that the fortunes of the world depended upon the
                    whim of a sulky hero. Yet, notwithstanding all the acute criticisms of Wolff, it
                    remains difficult for us to find a place for the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>
                    among the epics of growth. And why? Because throughout the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> the dramatic imagination shown is of the first order; and, if we are
                    to suppose a multiplicity of authors for the poem, we must also suppose that
                    ages before the time of Pericles there existed a group of dramatists more nearly
                    akin to the masters of the great drama, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and · Shakespeare
                    than any group that has ever existed since. Yet it is equally difficult to find
                    a place for it amongst the epics of art. In the matter of <hi rend="italic"
                    >artistic</hi> motive the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> stands alone among the
                    epics of art of the world, as we are going to see.</p>
                <p>It is manifest that, as the pleasure derived from the epic of art is that of
                    recognizing a conscious scheme, if the epic of art fails through confusion of
                    scheme it fails altogether. What is demanded of the epic of art (as some kind of
                    compensation for that natural freedom of evolution which it can never achieve,
                    that sweet <hi rend="italic">abandon</hi> which belongs to nature and to the
                    epic of growth alike) is unity of impression, harmonious and symmetrical
                    development of a conscious heart-thought, or motive. This being so, where are we
                    to place the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> and where are we to place the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shäh Nämeh</hi><hi rend="italic">1</hi> Starting with the
                    intention, as it seems, of fusing into one harmonious whole the myths and
                    legends upon which the Roman story is based, Virgil, by the time he reaches the
                    middle of his epic, forgets all about this primary intent, and gives us his own
                    thoughts and reflexions on things in general. Fine as is the speech · of
                    Anchises to Aeneas in Elysium <hi rend="italic">(Aen.</hi> vi. 724-755), its
                    incongruity with the general scheme of the poem as developed in the previous
                    books shows how entirely Virgil lacked that artistic power shown in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> of making a story become the natural and inevitable
                    outcome of an artistic idea.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Shah</hi><hi rend="italic">Nämeh</hi> there is the
                    artistic redaction of Virgil, but with even less attention to a central thought
                    than Virgil exhibits. Firdausi relies for his effects upon the very qualities
                    which characterize not the epic of art but the epic of growth—a natural and not
                    an artificial flow of the story; so much so indeed that, if the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shah</hi><hi rend="italic">Nämeh</hi><hi rend="italic">vfvcQ</hi>
                    studied in connexion with the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> on the one hand and
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Kalevala</hi> on the other, it might throw a light
                    upon the way in which an epic may be at one and the same time an aggregation of
                    the national ballad poems and the work of a single artificer. That Firdausi was
                    capable of working from a centre not only artistic but philosophic his <hi
                    rend="italic">Yusuf and Zuleikha</hi> shows; and if we consider what was the
                    artistic temper of the Persians in Firdausi’s time, what indeed has been that
                    temper during the whole of the Mohammedan period, the subtle temper of the
                    parable poet,—the <hi rend="italic">Shäh Nämeh,</hi> with its direct appeal to
                    popular sympathies, is a standing wonder in poetic literature.</p>
                <p>With regard, however, to Virgil’s defective power of working from an artistic
                    motive, as compared with the poet of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> this is
                    an infirmity he shares with all the poets of the Western world. Certainly he
                    shares it with the writer of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> who, setting
                    out to “justify the ways of God to man,” forgets occasionally the original
                    worker of the evil, as where, for instance, he substitutes chance as soon as he
                    comes (at the end of the second book) to the point upon which the entire epic
                    movement turns, the escape of Satan from hell and his journey to earth for the
                    ruin of man :—</p>

                <p>“At last his sail-broad vans</p>
                <p>He spreads for flight, and, in the surging smoke Uplifted, spurns the ground;
                    thence many a league, As in a cloudy chair, ascending rides Audacious; but, that
                    seat soon failing, meets A vast vacuity; all unawares, Fluttering his pinions
                    vain, plumb down he drops Ten thousand fathoms deep, and to this hour Down had
                    been falling, had not, by <hi rend="smallcaps">ill chance,</hi> The strong
                    rebuff of some tumultuous cloud, Instinct with fire and nitre, hurried him As
                    many miles aloft.”</p>
                <p>In Milton’s case, however, the truth is that he made the mistake of trying to
                    disturb the motive of a story for artistic purposes,—a fatal mistake as we shall
                    see when we come to speak of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> in
                    relation to the old Norse epic cycle.</p>
                <p>Though Vondel’s mystery play of <hi rend="italic">Lucifer</hi> is, in its
                    execution, rhetorical more than poetical, it did, beyond all question, influence
                    Milton when he came to write <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost.</hi> The famous
                    line which is generally quoted as the key-note of Satan’s character—</p>
                <p>“Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven ”— seems to have been taken bodily
                    from Vondel’s play, and Milton’s entire epic shows a study of it. While
                    Marlowe’s majestic movements alone are traceable in Satan’s speech (written some
                    years before the rest of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> when the dramatic
                    and not the epic form had been selected), Milton’s Satan became afterwards a
                    splendid amalgam not of the Mephistopheles but of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Faustus</hi> of Marlowe and the <hi rend="italic">Lucifer</hi> ofVondel.
                    Vondel’s play must have possessed a peculiar attraction for a poet of Milton’s
                    views of human progress. Defective as the play is in execution, it is far
                    otherwise in motive. This motive, if we consider it aright, is nothing less than
                    an explanation of man’s anomalous condition on the earth—spirit incarnate in
                    matter, created by God, a little lower than the angels—in order that he may
                    advance by means of these very manacles which imprison him, in order that he may
                    ascend by the staircase of the world, the ladder of fleshly conditions, above
                    those cherubim and seraphim who, lacking the education of sense, have not the
                    knowledge wide and deep which brings man close to God.</p>
                <p>Here Mil ton found his own favourite doctrine of human development and
                    self-education in a concrete and vividly artistic form. Much, however, as such a
                    motive must have struck a man of Milton’s instincts, his intellect was too much
                    chained by Calvinism to permit of his treating the subject with Vondel’s
                    philosophic breadth. The cause of Lucifer’s wrath had to be changed from
                    jealousy of human progress to jealousy of the Son’s proclaimed superiority. And
                    the history of poetry shows that once begin to tamper with the central thought
                    around which any group of incidents has crystallized and the entire story
                    becomes thereby re-written, as we have seen in the case of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agamemnon</hi> of Aeschylus. Of the motive of his own epic, after he had
                    abandoned the motive of Vondel, Milton had as little permanent grasp as Virgil
                    had of his. As regards the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> however, we need
                    scarcely say that its motive is merely artistic, not philosophic. And now we
                    come to philosophic motive.</p>
                <p>The artist’s power of thought is properly shown not in the direct enunciation of
                    ideas but in mastery over motive. Here Aeschylus is by far the greatest figure
                    in Western poetry,—a proof perhaps among many proofs of the Oriental strain of
                    his genius. (As regards pure drama, however, important as is motive, freedom,
                    organic vitality in every part, is of more importance than even motive, and in
                    this freedom and easy abandonment the concluding part of the Oresteia is
                    deficient as compared with such a play as <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Lear.)</hi> Notwithstanding the splendid exception of Aeschylus,
                    the truth seems to be that the faculty of developing a poetical narrative from a
                    philosophic thought is Oriental, and on the whole foreign to the genius of the
                    Western mind. Neither in Western drama nor in western epic do we find, save in
                    such rare cases as that of Vondel, anything like that power of developing a
                    story from an idea which not only Jami but all the parable poets of Persia
                    show.</p>
                <p>In recent English poetry, the motive of Shelley’s dramatic poem <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prometheus Unbound</hi> is a notable illustration of what is here contended.
                    Starting with the full intent of developing a drama from a motive—starting with
                    a universalism, a belief that good shall be the final goal of ill—Shelley cannot
                    finish his first three hundred lines without shifting (in the curse of
                    Prometheus) into a Manichaeism as pure as that of Manes himself :—</p>
                <p>“Heap on thy soul, by virtue of this curse, Ill deeds, then be thou damned,
                    beholding good; <hi rend="italic">Both</hi> infinite as is the universe.”</p>
                <p>According to the central thought of the poem human nature, through the heroic
                    protest and struggle of the human mind typified by Prometheus, can at last
                    dethrone that supernatural terror and tyranny (Jupiter) which the human mind had
                    itself installed. But, after its dethronement (when human nature becomes
                    infinitely perfectible), how can the supernatural tyranny exist apart from the
                    human mind that imagined it? How can it be as “infinite as the universe”?</p>
                <p>The motive of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> is assailed with much vigour
                    by Victor Hugo in his poem <hi rend="italic">Religions</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">Religion.</hi> But when Μ. Hugo, in the after parts of
                    the poem, having destroyed Milton’s “God,” sets up an entirely French “Dieu” of
                    his own and tries “to justify” him, we perceive how pardonable was Milton’s
                    failure after all. Compare such defect of mental grip and such nebulosity of
                    thought as is displayed by Milton, Shelley, and Μ. Hugo with the strength of
                    hand shown in the “Sâlâmân” and “Absal” of Jami, and indeed by the Sufi poets
                    generally.</p>
                <p>There is, however, one exception to this rule that Western poetry is nebulous as
                    to motive. There is, besides the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> one epic that
                    refuses to be classified, though for entirely different reasons. This is the
                    Niblung story, where we find unity of purpose and also entire freedom of
                    movement. We find combined here beauties which are nowhere else combined—which
                    are, in fact, at war with each other everywhere else. We find a scheme, a real
                    “acorn of thought,” in an epic which is not the self-conscious work of a single
                    poetic artificer, but is as much the slow growth of various times and various
                    minds as is the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata,</hi> in which the heart-thought
                    is merely that the Kauravas defeated their relatives at dice and refused to
                    disgorge their winnings.</p>
                <p>This Northern epic-tree, as we find it in the Icelandic sagas, the Norns
                    themselves must have watered; for it combines the virtues of the epic of growth
                    with those of the epic of art. Though not written in metre, it may usefully be
                    compared with the epics of Greece and of India and Persia. Free in movement as
                    the wind, which “bloweth where it listeth,” it listeth to move by law. Its
                    action is that of free-will, but free will at play within a ring of necessity.
                    Within this ring there throbs all the warm and passionate life of the world
                    outside, and all the freedom apparently. Yet from that world it is enisled by a
                    cordon of curses—by a zone of defiant flames more impregnable than that which
                    girdled the beautiful Brynhild at Hindfell. Natural laws, familiar emotions, are
                    at work everywhere in the story; yet the “Ring of Andvari,” whose circumference
                    is but that of a woman’s finger, encircles the whole mimic world of the sagaman
                    as the Midgard snake encircles the earth. For this artistic perfection in an
                    epic of growth there are.</p>

                <p>of course, many causes, some of them traceable and some of them beyond all
                    discovery,—causes no doubt akin to those which gave birth to many of the
                    beauties of other epics of growth. Originally Sinfiotli and Sigurd were the same
                    person, and note how vast has been the artistic effect of the separation of the
                    two! Again, there were several different versions of the story of Brynhild. The
                    sagamen, finding all these versions too interesting and too much beloved to be
                    discarded, adopted them all—worked them up into one legend, so that, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Völsunga</hi><hi rend="italic">Saga</hi> we have a heroine
                    possessing all the charms of goddess, demigoddess, earthly princess, and
                    amazon—a heroine surpassing perhaps in fascination all other heroines that have
                    ever figured in poetry.</p>
                <p>It is when we come to consider such imaginative work as this that we are
                    compelled to pause before challenging the Aristotelian doctrine that metrical
                    structure is but an accidental quality of epic; and it will now be seen why, in
                    the early part of this essay, this doctrine was examined so carefully.</p>
                <p>In speaking of the Niblung story we do not, of course, speak of the German
                    version, the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied,</hi> a fine epic still, though a
                    degradation of the elder form. Between the two the differences are fundamental
                    in the artistic sense, and form an excellent illustration of what has just been
                    said upon the disturbance of motive in epic, and indeed in all poetic art. It is
                    not merely that the endings of the three principal characters Sigurd
                    (Siegfried), Gudrun (Kriemhilt), and Brynhild are entirely different; it is not
                    merely that the Icelandic version, by missing the bloodbath at Fafiiir’s lair,
                    loses the pathetic situation of Gudrun’s becoming afterwards an unwilling
                    instrument of her husband’s death; it is not merely that, on the other hand, the
                    German version, by omitting the early love passages between Brynhild and Sigurd
                    at Hindfell, misses entirely the tragic meaning of her story and the terrible
                    hate that is love resulting from the breaking of the troth; but the conclusion
                    of each version is so exactly the opposite of that of the other that, while the
                    German story is called (and very properly) <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi>
                    Kriemhilt’s Revenge” the story of the <hi rend="italic">Völsunga</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Saga</hi> might, with equal propriety, be called Gudrun’s
                    Forgiveness.</p>
                <p>If it be said that, in both cases, the motive shows the same Titanic temper, that
                    is because the Titanic temper is the special characteristic of the North-Western
                    mind. The temper of revolt against authority seems indeed to belong to that
                    energy which succeeds in the modern development of the great racial struggle for
                    life. Although no epic, Eastern or Western, can exist without a struggle between
                    good and evil—and a struggle upon apparently equal terms —it must not be
                    supposed that the warring of conflicting forces which is the motive of Eastern
                    epic has much real relation to the warring of conflicting forces which is the
                    motive of Western epic.</p>
                <p>And, as regards the machinery of epic, there is, we suspect, a deeper
                    significance than is commonly apprehended in the fact that the Satan or Shaitan
                    of the Eastern world becomes in Vondel and Milton a sublime Titan who attracts
                    to himself the admiration which in Eastern poetry belongs entirely to the
                    authority of heaven. In Asia, save perhaps among the pure Arabs of the desert,
                    underlying all religious forms, there is apparent a temper of resignation to the
                    irresistible authority of heaven. And as regards the Aryans it is probable that
                    the Titanic temper—the temper of revolt against authority—did not begin to show
                    itself till they had moved across the Caucasus. But what concerns us here is the
                    fact that the farther they moved to the north-west the more vigorously this
                    temper asserted itself, the prouder grew man in his attitude towards the gods,
                    till at last in the Scandinavian cycle he became their equal and struggled
                    alongside them, shoulder to shoulder, in the defence of heaven against the
                    assaults of hell. Therefore, as we say, the student of epic poetry must not
                    suppose that there is any real parallel between the attitude of Vishnu (as Rama)
                    towards Ravana and the attitude of Prometheus towards Zeus, or the attitude of
                    the human heroes towards Odin in Scandinavian poetry. Had Ravana been clothed
                    with a properly constituted authority, had he been a legitimate god instead of a
                    demon, the Eastern doctrine of recognition of authority would most likely have
                    come in and the world would have been spared one at least of its enormous epics.
                    Indeed, the Ravana of the <hi rend="italic">Rârnâyana</hi> answers somewhat to
                    the Fafnir of the <hi rend="italic">Völsunga</hi><hi rend="italic">Saga</hi>;
                    and to plot against demons is not to rebel against authority. The vast field of
                    Indian epic, however, is quite beyond us here.</p>
                <p>Nor can we do more than glance at the <hi rend="italic">Kalevala.</hi> From one
                    point of view that group of ballads might be taken, no doubt, as a simple record
                    of how the men of Kalevala were skilful in capturing the sisters of the Pojohla
                    men. But from another point of view the universal struggle of the male for the
                    female seems typified in this so-called epic of the Finns by the picture of the
                    “Lady of the Rainbow” sitting upon her glowing arc and weaving her golden
                    threads, while the hero is doing battle with the malevolent forces of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>But it is in the Niblung story that the temper of Western epic is at its best—the
                    temper of the simple fighter whose business it is to fight. The ideal Western
                    fighter was not known in Greece till ages after Homer, when in the pass of
                    Thermopylae the companions of Leonidas combed their long hair in the sun. The
                    business of the fighter in Scandinavian epic is to yield to no power whatsoever,
                    whether of earth or heaven or hell—to take a buffet from the Allfather himself,
                    and to return it; to look Destiny herself in the face, crying out for quarter
                    neither to gods nor demons nor Norns. This is the true temper of pure “heroic
                    poetry” as it has hitherto flourished on this side the Caucasus—the temper of
                    the fighter who is invincible because he feels that Fate herself falters when
                    the hero of the true strain defies—the fighter who feels that the very Norns
                    themselves must cringe at last before the simple courage of man standing naked
                    and bare of hope against all assaults whether of heaven or hell or doom. The
                    proud heroes of the <hi rend="italic">Völsunga</hi><hi rend="italic">Saga</hi>
                    utter no moans and shed no Homeric tears, knowing as they know that the day
                    prophesied is sure when, shoulder to shoulder, gods and men shall stand up to
                    fight the entire brood of night and evil, storming the very gates of Asgard.</p>
                <p>That this temper is not the highest from the ethical point of view is no doubt
                    true. Against the beautiful resignation of Buddhism it may seem barbaric, and if
                    moral suasion could supplant physical force in epic—if Siddartha could take the
                    place of Achilles or Sigurd—it might be better for the human race.</p>
                <p>But it would be difficult even to glance at the countless points of interest that
                    suggest themselves in connexion with epic poetry. Returning now to the general
                    subject of egoistic or lyrical and dramatic imagination,—as might be expected,
                    we occasionally meet imagination of a purely dramatic kind in narrative poetry,
                    such for instance as that of Gottfried von Strasburg, of Chaucer, and of the
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Chanson de Roland.</hi></p>
                <p>But we must now give undivided attention to pure egoistic or lyric imagination.
                    This, as has been said, is sufficient to vitalize all forms of poetic art save
                    drama and the Greek epic. Many of these forms have been or will be treated in
                    this work under separate heads.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible to discuss adequately here the Hebrew poets, who have
                    produced a lyric so different in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n279/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0279-0270"/> kind from all other lyrics as to stand in a class
                    by itself. As it is equal in importance to the Great Drama of Shakespeare,
                    Aeschylus, and Sophocles, we may perhaps be allowed to call it the “Great
                    Lyric.” The Great Lyric must be religious—it must, it would seem, be an
                    outpouring of the soul, not towards man but towards God, like that of the
                    God-intoxicated prophets and psalmists of Scripture. Even the lyric fire of
                    Pindar owes much to the fact that he had a child-like belief in the myths to
                    which so many of his contemporaries had begun to give a languid assent. But
                    there is nothing in Pindar, or indeed elsewhere in Greek poetry, like the
                    rapturous song, combining unconscious power with unconscious grace, which we
                    have called the Great Lyric. It might perhaps be said indeed that the Great
                    Lyric is purely Hebrew.</p>
                <p>But, although we could hardly expect to find it among those whose language,
                    complex of syntax and alive with self-conscious inflexions, bespeaks the
                    scientific knowingness of the Western mind, to call the temper of the Great
                    Lyric broadly “Asiatic” would be rash. It seems to belong as a birthright to
                    those descendants of Shem who, yearning always to look straight into the face of
                    God and live, could (when the Great Lyric was sung) see not much else.</p>
                <p>Though two of the artistic elements of the Great Lyric, unconsciousness and
                    power, are no doubt plentiful enough in India, the element of grace is lacking
                    for the most part. The Vedic hymns are both nebulous and unemotional, as
                    compared with Semitic hymns. And as to the Persians, they, it would seem, have
                    the grace always, the power often, but the unconsciousness almost never. This is
                    inevitable if we consider for a moment the chief characteristic of the Persian
                    imagination—an imagination whose wings are not so much “bright with beauty” as
                    heavy with it—heavy as the wings of a golden pheasant—steeped in beauty like the
                    “tiger-moth’s deep damasked wings.” Now beauty of this kind does not go to the
                    making of the Great Lyric.</p>
                <p>Then there comes that poetry which, being ethnologically Semitic, might be
                    supposed to exhibit something at least of the Hebrew temper—the Arabian. But,
                    whatever may be said of the oldest Arabic poetry, with its deep sense of fate
                    and pain, it would seem that nothing can be more unlike than the Hebrew temper
                    and the Arabian temper as seen in later poets. It is not with Hebrew but with
                    Persian poetry that Arabian poetry can be usefully compared. If the wings of the
                    Persian imagination are heavy with beauty, those of the later Arabian
                    imagination are bright with beauty—brilliant as an Eastern butterfly, quick and
                    agile as a dragon-fly or a humming-bird. To the eye of the Persian poet the hues
                    of earth are (as Firdausi says of the garden of Afrasiab) “like the tapestry of
                    the kings of Ormuz, the air is perfumed with musk, and the waters of the brooks
                    are the essence of roses.” And to the later Arabian no less than to the Persian
                    the earth is beautiful; but it is the clear and sparkling beauty of the earth as
                    she “wakes up to life, greeting the Sabaean morning”: we feel the light more
                    than the colour.</p>
                <p>But it is neither the Persian’s instinct for beauty nor the Arabian’s quenchless
                    wit and exhaustless animal spirits that go to the making of the Great Lyric; far
                    from it. In a word, the Great Lyric, as we have said, cannot be assigned to the
                    Asiatic temper generally any more than it can be assigned to the European
                    temper.</p>
                <p>In the poetry of Europe, if we cannot say of Pindar, devout as he is, that he
                    produced the Great Lyric, what can we say of any other European poet? The truth
                    is that, like the Great Drama, so straight and so warm does it seem to come from
                    the heart of man in its highest moods that we scarcely feel it to be literature
                    at all. Passing, however, from this supreme expression of lyrical imagination,
                    we come to the artistic ode, upon which subject the present writer can only
                    reiterate here what he has more fully said upon a former occasion. Whatever may
                    have been said to the contrary, enthusiasm is, in the nature of things, the very
                    basis of the ode; for the ode is a mono-drama, the actor in which is the poet
                    himself; and, as Marmontel has well pointed out, if the actor in the mono-drama
                    is not affected by the sentiments he expresses, the ode must be cold and
                    lifeless. But, although the ode is a natural poetic method of the poet
                    considered as prophet—although it is the voice of poetry as a fine frenzy—it
                    must not be supposed that there is anything lawless in its structure. “Pindar,”
                    says the Italian critic Gravina, “launches his verses upon the bosom of the sea;
                    he spreads out all his sails; he confronts the tempest and the rocks; the waves
                    arise and are ready to engulf him; already he has disappeared from the
                    spectator’s view; when suddenly he springs up in the midst of the waters, and
                    reaches happily the shore.” Now it is this Pindaric discursiveness, this
                    Pindaric unrestraint as to the matter, which has led poets to attempt to imitate
                    him by adopting an unrestraint as to form. Although no two odes of Pindar
                    exhibit the same metrical structure (the Aeolian and Lydian rhythms being
                    mingled with the Doric in different proportions), yet each ode is in itself
                    obedient, severely obedient, to structural law. This we feel; but what the law
                    is no metricist has perhaps ever yet been able to explain.</p>
                <p>It was a strange misconception that led people for centuries to use the word
                    “Pindaric” and irregular as synonymous terms; whereas the very essence of the
                    odes of Pindar (of the few, alas! which survive to us) is their regularity.
                    There is no more difficult form of poetry than this, and for this reason: when
                    in any poetical composition the metres are varied, there must, as the present
                    writer has before pointed out, be a reason for such freedom, and that reason is
                    properly subjective—the varying form must embody and express the varying
                    emotions of the singer. But when these metrical variations are governed by no
                    subjective law at all, but by arbitrary rules supposed to be evolved from the
                    practice of Pindar, then that very variety which should aid the poet in
                    expressing his emotion crystallizes it and makes the ode the most frigid of all
                    compositions. Great as Pindar undoubtedly is, it is deeply to be regretted that
                    no other poet survives to represent the triumphal ode of Greece,—the digressions
                    of his subject-matter are so wide, and his volubility is so great.</p>
                <p>In modern literature the ode has been ruined by theories and experiments. A poet
                    like La Mothe, for instance, writes execrable odes, and then writes a treatise
                    to prove that all odes should be written on the same model.</p>
                <p>There is much confusion of mind prevalent among poets as to what is and what is
                    not an ode. All odes are, no doubt, divisible into two great classes :—those
                    which, following an arrangement in stanzas, are commonly called regular, and
                    those which, following no such arrangement, are commonly called irregular.</p>
                <p>We do not agree with those who assert that irregular metres are of necessity
                    inimical to poetic art. On the contrary, we believe that in modern prosody the
                    arrangement of the rhymes and the length of the lines in any rhymed metrical
                    passage may be determined either by a fixed stanzaic law or by a law infinitely
                    deeper—by the law which impels the soul, in a state of poetic exaltation, to
                    seize hold of every kind of metrical aid, such as rhyme, caesura, &amp;c., for
                    the purpose of accentuating and marking off each shade of emotion as it arises,
                    regardless of any demands of stanza. But between the irregularity of makeshift,
                    such as we find it in Cowley and his imitators, and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0280-0271"/> the irregularity of the “fine frenzy” of such a
                    poem, for instance, as Coleridge’s <hi rend="italic">Kubla Khan,</hi> there is a
                    difference in kind. Strange that it is not in an ode at all but in this unique
                    lyric <hi rend="italic">Kubla Khan,</hi> descriptive of imaginative landscape,
                    that an English poet has at last conquered the crowning difficulty of writing in
                    irregular metres. Having broken away from all restraints of couplet and
                    stanza,—having caused his rhymes and pauses to fall just where and just when the
                    emotion demands that they should fall, scorning the exigencies of makeshift no
                    less than the exigencies of stanza,—he has found what every writer of irregular
                    English odes has sought in vain, a music as entrancing, as natural, and at the
                    same time as inscrutable, as the music of the winds or of the sea.</p>
                <p>The prearranged effects of sharp contrasts and antiphonal movements, such as some
                    poets have been able to compass, do not of course come under the present
                    definition of irregular metres at all. If a metrical passage does not gain
                    immensely by being written independently of stanzaic law, it loses immensely;
                    and for this reason, perhaps, that the great charm of the music of all verse, as
                    distinguished from the music of prose, is inevitableness of cadence. In regular
                    metres we enjoy the pleasure of feeling that the rhymes will inevitably fall
                    under a recognized law of couplet or stanza. But if the passage flows
                    independently of these, it must still flow inevitably—it must, in short, show
                    that it is governed by another and a yet deeper force, the inevitableness of
                    emotional expression. The lines must be long or short, the rhymes must be
                    arranged after this or after that interval, not because it is convenient so to
                    arrange them, but because the emotion of the poet inexorably demands these and
                    no other arrangements. When, however, Coleridge came to try his hand at
                    irregular odes, such as the odes “To the Departing Year” and “To the Duchess of
                    Devonshire,” he certainly did not succeed.</p>
                <p>As to Wordsworth’s magnificent “Ode on Intimations of Immortality,” the sole
                    impeachment of it, but it is a grave one, is that the length of the lines and
                    the arrangement of the rhymes are not always inevitable; they are, except on
                    rare occasions, governed neither by stanzaic nor by emotional law. For instance,
                    what emotional necessity was there for the following rhyme-arrangement?</p>
                <p>“My heart is at your festival, My head hath its coronal, The fulness of your
                    bliss I feel—I feel it all.</p>
                <p>Oh, evil day! if I were sullen While earth herself is adorning, This sweet May
                    morning;</p>
                <p>And the children are culling,</p>
                <p>On every side,</p>
                <p>In a thousand valleys far and wide, Fresh flowers.”</p>
                <p>Beautiful as is the substance of this entire passage, so far from gaining, it
                    loses by rhyme—loses, not in perspicuity, for Wordsworth like all his
                    contemporaries (except Shelley) is mostly perspicuous, but in that metrical
                    emphasis the quest of which is one of the impulses that leads a poet to write in
                    rhyme. In spite, however, of its metrical defects, this famous ode of
                    Wordsworth’s is the finest irregular ode in the language; for, although
                    Coleridge’s “Ode to the Departing Year” excels it in Pindaric fire, it is below
                    Wordsworth’s masterpiece in almost every other quality save rhythm. Among the
                    writers of English irregular odes, next to Wordsworth, stands Dryden. The second
                    stanza of the “Ode for St Cecilia’s Day” is a great triumph.</p>
                <p>&gt; . Leaving the irregular and turning to the regular ode, it is natural to
                    divide these into two classes :—(1) those which are really Pindaric in so far as
                    they consist of strophes, antistrophes, and epodes, variously arranged and
                    contrasted; and (2) those which consist of a regular succession of regular
                    stanzas. Perhaps all Pindaric odes tend to show that this form of art is in
                    English a mistake. It is easy enough to write one stanza and call it a strophe,
                    another in a different movement and call it an antistrophe, a third in a
                    different movement still and call it an epode. But in modern prosody,
                    disconnected as it is from musical and from terpsichorean science, what are
                    these <hi rend="italic">1 No</hi> poet and no critic can say.</p>
                <p>What is requisite is that the ear of the reader should catch a great metrical
                    scheme, of which these three varieties of movement are necessary parts,—should
                    catch, in short, that inevitableness of structure upon which we have already
                    touched. In order to justify a poet in writing a poem in three different kinds
                    of movement, governed by no musical and no terpsichorean necessity, a necessity
                    of another kind should make itself apparent; that is, the metrical wave moving
                    in the strophe should be metrically answered by the counter-wave moving in the
                    antistrophe, while the epode—which, as originally conceived by Stesichorus, was
                    merely a standing still after the balanced movements of the strophe and
                    antistrophe—should clearly, in a language like ours, be a blended echo of these
                    two. A mere metrical contrast such as some poets labour to effect is not a
                    metrical answer. And if the reply to this criticism be that in Pindar himself no
                    such metrical scheme is apparent, that is the strongest possible argument in
                    support of our position. If indeed the metrical scheme of Pindar is not
                    apparent, that is because, having been written for chanting, it was subordinate
                    to the lost musical scheme of the musician. It has been contended, and is likely
                    enough, that this musical scheme was simple—as simple, perhaps, as the scheme of
                    a cathedral chant; but to it, whatever it was, the metrical scheme of the poet
                    was subordinated. It need scarcely be said that the phrase “metrical scheme” is
                    used here not in the narrow sense as indicating the position and movement of
                    strophe and antistrophe by way of simple contrast, but in the deep metrical
                    sense as indicating the value of each of these component parts of the ode, as a
                    counter-wave balancing and explaining the other waves in the harmony of the
                    entire composition. We touch upon this matter in order to show that the moment
                    odes ceased to be chanted, the words strophe, antistrophe, and epode lost the
                    musical value they had among the Greeks, and pretended to a complex metrical
                    value which their actual metrical structure does not appear to justify. It does
                    not follow from this that odes should not be so arranged, but it does follow
                    that the poet’s arrangement should justify itself by disclosing an entire
                    metrical scheme in place of the musical scheme to which the Greek choral lyric
                    was evidently subordinated. But even if the poet were a sufficiently skilled
                    metricist to compass a scheme embracing a wave, an answering wave, and an echo
                    gathering up the tones of each, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the strophe, the
                    antistrophe, and the epode, the ear of the reader, unaided by the musical
                    emphasis which supported the rhythms of the old choral lyric, is, it should
                    seem, incapable of gathering up and remembering the sounds further than the
                    strophe and the antistrophe, after which it demands not an epode but a return to
                    the strophe. That is to say, an epode, as alternating in the body of the modern
                    ode, is a mistake; a single epode at the end of a group of strophes and
                    antistrophes (as in some of the Greek odes) has, of course, a different function
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>The great difficulty of the English ode is that of preventing the apparent
                    spontaneity of the impulse from being marred by the apparent artifice of the
                    form; for, assuredly, no writer subsequent to Coleridge and to Keats would dream
                    of writing an ode on the cold Horatian principles <pb break="no"

                    beautiful “Ode to Evening.”</p>
                <p>Of the second kind of regular odes, those consisting of a regular succession of
                    regular stanzas, the so-called odes of Sappho are, of course, so transcendent
                    that no other amatory lyrics can be compared with them. Never before these songs
                    were sung and never since did the human soul, in the grip of a fiery passion,
                    utter a cry like hers; and, from the executive point of view, in directness, in
                    lucidity, in that high imperious verbal economy which only Nature herself can
                    teach the artist, she has no equal, and none worthy to take the place of
                    second—not even in Heine, not even in Burns. Turning, however, to modern poetry,
                    there are some magnificent examples of this simple form of ode in English
                    poetry—Spenser’s immortal “Epithal-amion” leading the way in point of time, and
                    probably also in point of excellence.</p>
                <p>Fervour being absolutely essential, we think, to a great English ode, fluidity of
                    metrical movement can never be dispensed with. The more billowy the metrical
                    waves the better suited are they to render the emotions expressed by the ode, as
                    the reader will see by referring to Coleridge’s “Ode to France” (the finest ode
                    in the English language, according to Shelley), and giving special attention to
                    the first stanza—to the way in which the first metrical wave, after it had
                    gently fallen at the end of the first quatrain, leaps up again on the double
                    rhymes (which are expressly introduced for this effect), and goes bounding on,
                    billow after billow, to the end of the stanza. Not that this fine ode is quite
                    free from the great vice of the English ode, rhetoric. If we except Spenser and,
                    in one instance, Collins, it can hardly be said that any English writer before
                    Shelley and Keats produced odes independent of rhetoric and supported by pure
                    poetry alone. But fervid as are Shelley’s “Ode to the West Wind,” and Keats’s
                    Odes “To a Nightingale” and “On a Grecian Urn,” they are entirely free from
                    rhetorical flavour. Notwithstanding that in the “Ode on a Grecian Urn” the first
                    stanza does not match in rhyme arrangement with the others, while the second
                    stanza of the “Ode to a Nightingale” varies from the rest by running on four
                    rhyme-sounds instead of five, vexing the ear at first by disappointed
                    expectation, these two odes are, after Coleridge’s “France,” the finest regular
                    odes perhaps in the English language.</p>
                <p>With regard to the French ode, Malherbe was the first writer who brought it to
                    perfection. Malherbe showed also more variety of mood than it is the fashion
                    just now to credit him with. This may be especially noted in his “Ode to Louis
                    XIII.” His disciple Racan is not of much account. There is certainly much vigour
                    in the odes of Rousseau, but it is not till we reach Victor Hugo that we realize
                    what French poetry can achieve in this line; and contemporary poetry can hardly
                    be examined here. We may say, however, that some of Hugo’s odes are truly
                    magnificent. As a pure lyrist his place among the greatest poets of the world is
                    very high. Here, though writing in an inferior language, he ranks with the
                    greatest masters of Greece, of England, and of Germany. Had he attempted no
                    other kind of poetry than lyrical, his would still have been the first name in
                    French poetry. Whatever is defective in his work arises, as in the case of
                    Euripides, from the importation of lyrical force where dramatic force is mainly
                    needed.</p>
                <p>As most of the other varieties of lyrical poetry, such as the idyl, the satire,
                    the ballad, the sonnet, &lt;fcc., have been or will be treated under different
                    heads, or under the names of the various masters of poetic art, it would be
                    superfluous to discuss them here.</p>
                <p>A word or two, however, must be said about the song and the elegy. To write a
                    good song requires that simplicity of grammatical structure which is foreign to
                    many natures—that mastery over direct and simple speech which only true passion
                    and feeling can give, and which “coming from the heart goes to the heart.”
                    Without going so far as to say that no man is a poet who cannot write a good
                    song, it may certainly be said that no man can write a good song who is not a
                    good poet.</p>
                <p>In modern times we have, of course, nothing in any way representing those choral
                    dance-songs of the Greeks, which, originating in the primitive Cretan
                    war-dances, became, in Pindar’s time, a splendid blending of song and ballet.
                    Nor have we anything exactly representing the Greek scolia, those short drinking
                    songs of which Terpander is said to have been the inventor. That these scolia
                    were written, not only by poets like Alcaeus, Anacreon, Praxilla, Simonides, but
                    also by Sappho and by Pindar, shows in what high esteem they were held by the
                    Greeks. These songs seem to have been as brief as the stornelli of the Italian
                    peasant. They were accompanied by the lyre, which was handed from singer to
                    singer as the time for each scolion came round.</p>
                <p>With regard to the stornello, many critics seem to confound it with the rispetto,
                    a very different kind of song. The Italian <hi rend="italic">rispetto</hi>
                    consists of a stanza of inter-rhyming lines ranging from six to ten in number,
                    but often not exceeding eight. The Tuscan and Umbrian <hi rend="italic"
                    >stornello</hi> is much shorter, consisting, indeed, of a hemistich naming some
                    natural object which suggests the motive of the little poem.</p>
                <p>The nearest approach to the Italian stornello appears to be, not the rispetto,
                    but the Welsh triban.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the mere difficulty of rhyming in English and the facility of rhyming in
                    Italian must be taken into account when we inquire why there is nothing in
                    Scotland—of course there could be nothing in England— answering to the
                    nature-poetry of the Italian peasant. Most of the Italian rispetti and stornelli
                    seem to be improvisations; and to improvise in English is as difficult as tc
                    improvise is easy in Italian. Nothing indeed is more interesting than the
                    improvisatorial poetry of the Italian peasants, such as the canzone. If the
                    peasantry discover who is the composer of a canzone, they will not sing it. The
                    speciality of Italian peasant poetry is that the symbol which is mostly erotic
                    is of the purest and most tender kind. A peasant girl will improvise a song as
                    impassioned as “Come into the Garden, Maud,” and as free from unwholesome
                    taint.</p>
                <p>With regard to English songs, the critic cannot but ask—Wherein lies the lost
                    ring and charm of the Elizabethan song-writers <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi> Since
                    the Jacobean period at least, few have succeeded in the art of writing real
                    songs as distinguished from mere book lyrics. Between songs to be sung and songs
                    to be read there is in our time a difference as wide as that which exists
                    between plays for the closet and plays for the boards.</p>
                <p>Heartiness and melody—the two requisites of a song which can never be dispensed
                    with—can rarely be compassed, it seems, by one and the same individual. In both
                    these qualities the Elizabethan poets stand preeminent, though even with them
                    the melody is not so singable as it might be made. Since their time heartiness
                    has, perhaps, been a Scottish rather than an English endowment of the
                    song-writer. It is difficult to imagine an Englishman writing a song like
                    “Tullochgorum” or a song like “Maggie Lauder,” where the heartiness and impulse
                    of the poet’s mood conquer all impediments of close vowels and rugged
                    consonantal combinations. Of Scottish songwriters Burns is, of course, the head;
                    for the songs of John Skinner, the heartiest song-writer that has appeared in
                    Great Britain (not excluding Herrick), are too few in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n282/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0282-0273"/> number to entitle him to be placed beside a poet
                    so prolific in heartiness and melody as Burns. With regard to Campbell’s
                    heartiness, this is quite a different quality from the heartiness of Burns and
                    Skinner, and is in quality English rather than Scottish, though, no doubt, it is
                    of a fine and rare strain, especially in “The Battle of the Baltic.” His songs
                    illustrate an infirmity which even the Scottish song-writers share with the
                    English—a defective sense of that true song-warble which we get in the stornelli
                    and rispetti of the Italian peasants. A poet may have heartiness in plenty, but
                    if he has that love of consonantal effects which Donne displays he will never
                    write a first-rate song. Here, indeed, is the crowning difficulty of
                    song-writing. An extreme simplicity of structure and of diction must be
                    accompanied by an instinctive apprehension of the melodic capabilities of verbal
                    sounds, and of what Samuel Lover, the Irish song-writer, called “singing” words,
                    which is rare in this country, and seems to belong to the Celtic rather than to
                    the Saxon ear. “The song-writer,” says Lover, “must frame his song of open
                    vowels with as few guttural or hissing sounds as possible, and he must be
                    content sometimes to sacrifice grandeur and vigour to the necessity of selecting
                    singing words and not reading words.” And he exemplifies the distinction between
                    singing words and reading words by a line from one of Shelley’s songs—</p>
                <p>“ ‘The fresh earth in new leaves drest, ’</p>
                <p>“where nearly every word shuts up the mouth instead of opening it.” But closeness
                    of vowel sounds is by no means the only thing to be avoided in song-writing. A
                    phrase may be absolutely unsingable, though the vowels be open enough, if it is
                    loaded with consonants. The truth is that in song-writing it is quite as
                    important, in a consonantal language like ours, to attend to the consonants as
                    to the vowels; and perhaps the first thing to avoid in writing English songs is
                    the frequent recurrence of the sibilant. But this applies to all the brief and
                    quintessential forms of poetry, such as the sonnet, the elegy, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>As to the elegy—a form of poetic art which has more relation to the objects of
                    the external world than the song, but less relation to these than the
                    stornello—its scope seems to be wide indeed, as practised by such various
                    writers as Tyrtaeus, Theognis, Catullus, Tibullus, and our own Gray. It may
                    almost be said that perfection of form is more necessary here and in the sonnet
                    than in the song, inasmuch as the artistic pretensions are more pronounced.
                    Hence even such apparent minutiae as those we have hinted at above must not be
                    neglected here.</p>
                <p>We have quoted Dionysius of Halicarnassus in relation to the arrangement of words
                    in poetry. His remarks on sibilants are equally deserving of attention. He goes
                    so far as to say that <hi rend="italic">σ</hi> is entirely disagreeable, and,
                    when it often recurs, insupportable. The hiss seems to him to be more
                    appropriate to the beast than to man. Hence certain writers, he says, often
                    avoid it, and employ it with regret. Some, he tells us, have composed entire
                    odes without it. But if sibilation is a defect in Greek odes, where the
                    softening effect of the vowel sounds is so potent, it is much more so in English
                    poetry, where the consonants dominate, though it will be only specially
                    noticeable in the brief and quintessential forms such as the song, the sonnet,
                    the elegy. Many poets only attend to their sibilants when these clog the rhythm.
                    To write even the briefest song without a sibilant would be a <hi rend="italic"
                    >tour de force</hi>; to write a good one would no doubt be next to impossible.
                    It is singular that the only metricist who ever attempted it was John Thelwall,
                    the famous “Citizen John,” friend of Lamb and Coleridge, and editor of the
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Champion</hi> newspaper where many of Lamb’s epigrams
                    appeared. Thelwall gave much attention to metrical questions, and tried his hand
                    at various metres. Though “Citizen John’s” sapphics might certainly have been
                    better, he had a very remarkable critical insight into the rationale of metrical
                    effects, and his “Song without a Sibilant” is extremely neat and ingenious. Of
                    course, however, it would be mere pedantry to exaggerate this objection to
                    sibilants even in these brief forms of poetry.</p>
                <p>As a fine art English poetry is receiving much attention in our time. Defective
                    rhymes once allowable, and makeshift work in general, are no longer tolerated.
                    And we believe the time is not far distant when even such a subject as vowel
                    composition (the arrangement of one vowel sound with regard to another) will
                    have to be studied with the care which the Greeks evidently bestowed upon it.
