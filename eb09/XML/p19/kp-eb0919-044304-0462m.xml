                    >Normant</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">d’Étioles, Marquise de</hi> (1721-1764), the
                    most famous of all the mistresses of Louis XV., was born in Paris on 29th
                    December 1721, and was baptized as the legitimate daughter of François Poisson,
                    an officer in the household of the duke of Orleans, and his wife Madeleine de la
                    Motte, in the church of St Eustache, but she was suspected, as well as her
                    brother, afterwards marquis of Marigny, to be the child of a very wealthy
                    financier, and farmer-general of the revenues, Le Normant de Tourne-hem. He at
                    any rate took upon himself the charge of her education; and, as from the beauty
                    and wit she showe I from childhood she seemed to be born for some uncommon·
                    destiny, he declared her “un morceau de roi,” and specially educated her to be a
                    king’s mistress. This idea was confirmed in her childish mind by the prophecy of
                    an old woman, whom in after days she pensioned for the correctness, of her
                    prediction. In 1741 she was married to a nephew of her protector and guardian,
                    Le Normant d’Étioles, who was passionately in love with her, and soon became a
                    queen of fashion. Y’et the world of the financiers at Paris was far apart from
                    the court world, where she wished to reign; she could get no introduction at
                    court, and could only try to catch the king’s eye when he went out hunting. But
                    Louis XV. was then under the influence of Madame de· Mailly, who carefully
                    prevented any further intimacy with “la petite L·tioles,” and it was not until
                    after her death that the king met the fair qιieen of the financial world of
                    Paris at a ball given by the city to the dauphin in 1744, and he was immediately
                    subjugated. She at once gave up· her husband, and in 1745 was established at
                    Versailles as. “maîtresse en titre.” Louis XV. bought her the estate of
                    Pompadour, from which she took her title of marquise. She was hardly established
                    firmly in power before she showed that ambition rather than love had guided her,
                    and began to mix in politics. Knowing that the French people of that time were
                    ruled by the literary kings of the time, she paid court to them, and tried to
                    play the part of a Maecenas. Voltaire was her poet in chief, and the founder of
                    the physiocrats, Quesnay, was her physician. In the arts she was even more
                    successful; she was herself no mean etcher and engraver, and she encouraged and
                    protected Vanloo, Boucher, Vien, Greuze, and the engraver Jacques Guay. Yet this
                    policy did not prevent her from being lampooned, and the famous Poissardes
                    against her contributed to the ruin of many wits suspected of being among the
                    authors, and notably of the Comte de Maurepas. The command of the political
                    situation passed entirely into her hands; she it was who brought Belle-Isle into
                    office with his vigorous policy; she corresponded regularly with the generals of
                    the armies in the field, as her recently published letters to the Comte de
                    Clermont prove; and she introduced the Abbé de Bernis into the ministry in order
                    to-effect a very great alteration of French politics in 1756. The continuous
                    policy of France since the days of Richelieu had been to weaken the house of
                    Austria by alliances in Germany; but Madame de Pompadour changed this hereditary
                    policy because Frederick the Great wrote scandalous verses on her; and because
                    Maria Theresa wrote her a friendly letter she entered into an alliance with
                    Austria. This alliance brought on the Seven Years’ War with all its disasters,
                    the battle of Rosbach and the loss of Canada; but Madame de Pompadour persisted
                    in her policy, and when Bernis failed her, brought Choiseul into office, and
                    supported him in all his great plans, the Pacte de Famille, the suppression of
                    the Jesuits, and the peace of Versailles. But it was to internal politics that
                    this remarkable woman paid most attention; no one obtained office except through
                    her; in imitation of Madame de Maintenon she prepared all business for the
                    king’s eye with the ministers, and contrived that they should meet in her room;
                    and she daily examined the letters sent through the post office with Janelie,
                    the director of the post office. By this continuous labour she made herself
                    indispensable to Louis. Y <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> et, when she had lost
                    the heart of her lover after a year or two, she had a difficult task before her;
                    to maintain her influence she had not only to save the king as much trouble as
                    possible, but to find him fresh pleasures. When he first <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n463/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0463-0444"/> began to weary of her, she remembered her talent
                    for acting and her private theatricals at Etioles, and established the “théâtre
                    des petits cabinets,” in which she acted with the greatest lords about the court
                    for the king’s pleasure in tragedies and comedies, operas and ballets. By this
                    means and the “concerts spirituels” she kept in favour for a time; but at last
                    she found a surer way, by encouraging the king in his debaucheries, and Louis
                    wept over her kindness to his various mistresses. Only once, when the king was
                    wounded by Damiens in 1757, did she receive a serious shock, and momentarily
                    left the court; but on his recovery she returned more powerful than ever. She
                    even ingratiated herself with the queen, after the example of Madame de
                    Maintenon, and was made a lady-in-waiting; but the end was soon to come. “Ma vie
                    est un combat,” she said, and so it was, with business and pleasure; she
                    gradually grew weaker and weaker, and when told that death was at hand she
                    dressed herself in full court costume, and met it bravely on 15th April 1764 at
                    the age of forty-two.</p>
