                <p>HE word ‘ pottery” (Fr. <hi rend="italic">poterne')</hi> in its widest sense
                    includes all objects made of clay, moulded into form while in a moist plastic
                    state, and then hardened by fire. Clay, the most widely spread and abundant of
                    all mineral substances, consists essentially of a hydrated silicate of alumina
                    (see vol. x. p. 237), admixed, however, in almost all cases with various
                    impurities. Thus it usually contains a considerable proportion of free silica,
                    lime, and oxides of iron, its colour chiefly depending on the last ingredient.
                    The white kaolin clays (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Kaolin)</hi> used in the
                    manufacture of porcelain are the purest; they consist of silicate of alumina,
                    with 5 to 7 per cent, of potash, and only traces of lime, iron, and
                    magnesia.</p>
                <p>The making of pottery depends on the chemical change that takes place when clay
                    is heated in the fire; the hydrated silicate of alumina becomes anhydrous, and,
                    though the baked vessel can absorb mechanically a large quantity of water, the
                    chemical state, and with it the hardness of the vessel, remains unaltered. A
                    well-baked piece of clay is the most durable of all manufactured substances. In
                    preparing clay for the potter it is above all things necessary that it should be
                    worked and beaten, with sufficient water to make it plastic, into a perfectly
                    homogeneous mass. Any inequalities cause an irregular expansion during the
                    firing, and the pot cracks or flies to pieces. In early times the clay was
                    prepared by being kneaded by the hands or trampled by the feet (see Isa. xli.
                    25); modern manufacturers prepare it on a larger scale by grinding it between
                    mill-stones, and mixing it in a fluid state with an additional quantity of
                    silica, lime, and other substances.</p>
                <p>During the process of firing all clays shrink in volume, partly through the loss
                    of water and partly on account of increase of density. What are called “fat”
                    clays—those, that is to say, which are very plastic and unctuous—shrink very
                    much, losing from one-third to one-fourth of their bulk; they are also very
                    liable to crack or twist during the firing. “Lean” clays—those that have a large
                    percentage of free silica—shrink but little, and keep their form unaltered under
                    the heat of the kiln; they are not, however, so easy to mould into the required
                    shape, and thus a certain compromise is frequently required. Lean and fat clays
                    are mixed together, or silica (sand or ground and calcined flints) is added to a
                    fat clay in sufficient quantity to enable it to stand the firing. The same
                    result may be attained <pb break="no"

                <p>This classification is necessarily imperfect, some pottery coming under two
                    heads, as, for instance, much of the Italian majolica, which is both enamelled
                    and glazed. For this reason in the following article pottery will be treated
                    according to its age and country, not according to its method of manufacture.
                    Porcelain differs from pottery in being whiter, harder, less fusible, and (most
                    essential difference) in being slightly translucent. The paste of which it is
                    formed is a purer silicate of alumina than the clay of which pottery is made. It
                    will therefore be described under separate heads (p. 633 <hi rend="italic">sq.,
                    infra').</hi></p>
                <p>For the sake of clearness it will be well to define the sense in which technical
                    words relating to pottery are used in this article. <hi rend="italic">Body</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">paste</hi> is the clay of which the main bulk of a pot is
                    made. <hi rend="italic">Slip</hi> is clay finely ground and mixed with water to
                    the consistency of cream. It is usually applied over the whole surface of a
                    vessel in order to give it a finer face or a different colour from that of the
                    body of the pot. It is also sometimes applied partially, forming ornaments in
                    relief, as in the case of some Roman ware and the coarse 17th-century pottery of
                    Staffordshire described below. <hi rend="italic">Glaze</hi> is a thin coating of
                    glass, evenly fused over the surface of a clay vessel to make it harder, and
                    also to render it impervious to water. Clay simply baked without a vitreous
                    coating is called <hi rend="italic">biscuit·,</hi> its surface is dull, and it
                    is more or less porous. The simplest and oldest form of glaze is a pure silicate
                    of soda; the addition of oxide of lead makes the glaze more fusible, but less
                    hard and durable. F or decorative purposes glazes may be coloured by various
                    metallic oxides without losing their transparency. <hi rend="italic">Enamel</hi>
                    is a glaze with the addition of some substance to render it opaque. Binoxide of
                    tin has the peculiar property that when even a small quantity is added to a
                    transparent glass it renders it opaque and white without otherwise altering its
                    character. Great confusion has been caused in various works on pottery by a
                    careless use of the terms “glaze’’and “enamel”; they are both of the nature of
                    glass, but the best distinction to make is to apply the word “enamel” to a
                    vitreous coating that is <hi rend="italic">opaque,</hi> and the word “glaze” to
                    one that is <hi rend="italic">transparent</hi>; both may be coloured. The method
                    of applying vitreous coatings to clay, whether enamel or glaze, is this. The
                    materials are ground fine and mixed with water to the consistency of cream. The
                    pot is dipped in the mixture, or the fluid is applied with a brush; it is then
                    set to dry, and finally fired in the kiln, which must be heated sufficiently to
                    fuse the component parts of the glaze or enamel into one smooth vitreous
                    coating, while on the other hand it must not be hot enough to soften or melt the
                    clay body of the vessel. The use of oxide of lead enables a glaze to be applied
                    to a clay body which would not stand the high temperature necessary to combine
                    and fuse a pure silico-alkaline glaze. In order to prevent the glaze or enamel
                    from blistering or cracking off there must be a certain similarity of substance
                    between the clay body and the vitreous coating. A fine silicious glaze or enamel
                    will not adhere to a soft fat clay unless the proportion of silica in the latter
                    is increased either by admixture of a harder, more silicious clay, or by the
                    addition of pure silica either in the form of sand or of ground flint.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Potter's Wheel.—</hi> All pottery, except the rudest and
                    most primitive sorts, is moulded or “thrown” by the aid of a very simple
                    contrivance, a small round table fixed on a revolving pivot. Fig. 1, from a
                    tomb-painting at Thebes, shows its simplest form. The potter at intervals gives
                    a spin to the table, which continues to revolve for some time without a fresh
                    impulse. This form of wheel, used by the Egyptians (as is shown by existing
                    fragments of pottery) about 4000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> is still
                    employed without any alteration by the potters of many parts of India. A later
                    improvement introduced in Egypt under the Ptolemies was to have another larger
                    circular table, fixed lower down on the same axis, which the potter set in
                    movement with his feet, and thus was able to keep up a regular speed and leave
                    his hands free for the manipulation of the clay (see fig. 2). No process in any
                    handicraft is more beautiful than that of a potter moulding a vessel on the
                    wheel. The ease with which the plastic clay answers to the touch of the hand,
                    and rises or falls, taking a whole succession of symmetrical shapes, and
                    seeming, as it were, instinct with the life and thought of the potter, makes
                    this art beautiful and striking beyond all others, in which the desired form can
                    only be at-, tained by comparatively slow and laborious methods. Ancient poetry
                    is full of allusions to this. Homer <hi rend="italic">(Il.,</hi> xviii. 600)
                    compares the rhythm of a dance to the measured spin of a potter’s wheel; and the
                    rapid ease with which a clay vessel is made and remade in a new form is
                    described by Jeremiah (xviii. 3-4) in one of his most forcible similes (compare
                    Horace, <hi rend="italic">A. P.,</hi> 21-22). Among the Egyptians of the
                    Ptolemaic period the potter was used as a type of the Creator. Nouf or Knoum,
                    the divine spirit, and Pthah, the creator of the mundane egg, are symbolized by
                    human figures moulding clay on the potter’s wheel.<note anchored="true"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Kilns for firing Pottery.—</hi> The earliest form of kiln, as
                    represented in Egyptian wall-paintings, is a tall circular chamber of brick,
                    with a perforated floor near the bottom. The fuel was introduced from an opening
                    on one side, and raked in under the brick floor. The pottery to be baked was
                    piled up in the upper part of the chamber. Fig. 3, from a potter’s votive tablet
                    from Corinth, shows an early Greek form of kiln, with a place for the fuel on
                    one side, and a door in the side of the upper chamber through which the pottery
                    could be put in and withdrawn. The Corinthian kiln differs from the Egyptian
                    kiln in being domed over, but it is the same in principle.</p>
                <p>Even at the present day kilns shaped almost exactly like this early Greek one are
                    still largely used.</p>

                <p>The art of making pottery is one of the most extreme antiquity; with the
                    exception of the cave-dwellers of the Drift or Palaeolithic period it was
                    practised by all known prehistoric races from the Neolithic age downwards. The
                    sepulchral barrows of Britain and other European countries have supplied vast
                    stores of this earliest kind of pottery. It is mostly formed of coarse clay,
                    generally brown in colour, though sometimes grey or reddish; some few specimens
                    are fine in texture and have a slightly glossy surface. The clay, while moist,
                    has been kneaded with some care, and is often mixed with a proportion of gravel,
                    coarse sand, quartz crystals, or pounded pottery. The more carefully made
                    specimens, chiefly those of the bronze and iron ages, are frequently covered
                    with a smooth slip, made of the same clay as the body, but finely pounded and
                    thoroughly mixed. All are alike “hand-made,” without any assistance from the
                    potter’s wheel; some of the smaller ones are scooped out of a solid ball of
                    clay, while in some cases great skill has been shown in the building up, by the
                    unaided hand, of the thin walls of larger vessels, some of which are so round
                    and neatly formed as to appear at first sight to be wheel-made. This, however,
                    is never the case with the pottery of the three great prehistoric periods.</p>
                <p>The shapes found in the sepulchral barrows of Britain, France, Scandinavia, and
                    other countries are usually classified thus—(1) cinerary urns, (2) food vessels,
                    (3) drinking-cups, and (4) the so-called “incense cups” (see fig. 4).</p>
                <p>(1) Cinerary urns, usually found full of burned bones, are the largest, varying
                    from 12 to 18 inches in height. They are mostly less ornamented and less
                    carefully made than the smaller vessels. Most have their decoration confined to
                    a band round the upper part of the pot, or often only a projecting flange lapped
                    round the whole rim. A few have small handles, formed of pierced knobs of clay,
                    and sometimes projecting rolls of clay looped, as it were, all round the urn.
                    (2) Food-vessels vary considerably in size and form. Some are shaped like a
                    tea-cup, with a handle on one side; others are like small cinerary urns, either
                    quite plain or with pierced knobhandles and bands of ornaments incised or
                    impressed. (3) Drinking-cups, mostly from 6 to 8 inches high, vary but little in
                    form, and are usually completely covered with ornament. They are often made with
                    considerable care and skill, and are not ungraceful in shape. The names given to
                    the preceding three classes possibly express their real use, but the name of the
                    fourth class, “incense cups,” is purely imaginary. Under this head are comprised
                    a number of small vessels of very varied shape, some with their sides pierced
                    through with square or lozenge - shaped openings, while others, almost globular
                    in shape, have several pierced knob-handles, as if for suspension. Some are
                    quite plain, and others are covered with ornament. Their use is unknown; one
                    possible suggestion is that they were intended to carry fire from some sacred
                    source to light the funeral pyre. Canon Greenwell, probably the best authority
                    on this subject, believes, contrary to the opinion of many antiquaries, that
                    none of the above classes of barrow-pottery were intended for domestic use, but
                    that they were made solely to be buried with the dead. He considers that a fifth
                    class of pottery, chiefly in the form of bowls, which has occasionally been
                    found, not in barrows but in dwellings, is the only kind that was actually used
                    for domestic purposes by prehistoric man (see Greenwell, <hi rend="italic"
                    >British Barrows,</hi> 1877).</p>
                <p>The ornament whieh is often lavishly applied on prehistoric pottery is of
                    especial interest. It frequently consists of lines of small dots impressed from
                    a notched niece of wood or meta), arranged in various patterns—crosses,
                    chevrons, or zigzags. All the patterns were stamped into the body of the pot
                    before it was hardened by fire. The lines were frequently made by pressing a
                    twisted thong of skin against the moist clay, so that a sort of spiral sunk line
                    was produced. Other bands of ornament were made by wooden stamps; the end of a
                    hollow round stick was used to form a row of small circles, or a round stick was
                    used sideways to produce semicircular depressions. In some cases the incised
                    lines or dots have been filled up with a white slip of pipeclay. Considerable
                    taste and invention are shown by many of these combined ornaments, and a certain
                    richness of decorative effect is produced on some of the best drinking-cups; but
                    one thing is to be noted: all the main lines are straight, no wavy lines or
                    circles appearing, except in very rare instances—a fact which points to the very
                    limited artistic development attained by the prehistoric races.</p>
                <p>Prehistoric pottery has sometimes been described as “sun-baked,” but this is not
                    the case; however imperfectly baked, the pieces have all been permanently
                    hardened by fire, otherwise they would certainly not have lasted to our time.
                    This was done in a very rough and imperfect manner, not in a kiln but in an open
                    fire, so that in some cases the pots have received a superficial black colour
                    from the smoke of the fuel. Great quantities of this pottery have been found in
                    the sepulchral barrows of Great Britain and Ireland; those from the latter
                    country are usually very superior in neatness of execution to the British
                    specimens. The British Museum is specially rich in this class of pottery,
                    chiefly the result of excavations made in British barrows by Canon
                    Greenwell.</p>

                    Egyptian.</hi></p>
                <p>But few examples remain which date from the time of the earlier dynasties of
                    Egypt, though from the XVIIIth Dynasty downwards a great quantity of specimens
                    exist. Broken fragments, embedded in the clay bricks of which some of the oldest
                    pyramids are built, supply us with a few imperfect samples whose date can be
                    fixed. The early pottery of Egypt is of many varieties of quality: some is
                    formed of coarse brown clay moulded by hand without the aid of the wheel; other
                    specimens, thin and carefully wheel-made, are of fine red clay, with a slight
                    surface gloss, something like the “Samian’’pottery of the Romans. Some fragments
                    of brown clay have been found, covered with a smooth slip made of a creamy white
                    or yellowish clay. The early use of fine coloured enamels, afterwards brought to
                    such perfection in Egypt, is shown by the enamelled clay plaques in black,
                    white, and greenish blue which decorated the doorway of the great step-pyramid
                    at Sakkàra. Each plaque has a pierced projection at the back, so that it could
                    be firmly fixed by means of a wood or metal dowel.</p>
                <p>Egypt is rich in materials for pottery, both glazed and enamelled. The finest of
                    clays is washed down and deposited by the Nile; the sandy deserts supply pure
                    silica; and a great part of the soil is saturated with the alkali necessary for
                    the composition of vitreous enamels and glazes. In spite, however, of this
                    abundance of materials the Egyptians never learned to apply either their enamels
                    or their glazes, both of great beauty, to their larger works in pottery made of
                    the fine Nile clay. The reason probably was that the clay was too fat, and
                    therefore a vitreous coating would have flaked off during the firing, while they
                    had not discovered the simple expedient of mixing with the native clay an
                    addition of sand (silica), which would have enabled both glazes and enamels to
                    form a firm coating over the body of the vessel. The colours used for Egyptian
                    enamels and glazes are very varied, and of great beauty and brilliance. The
                    glazes themselves are pure alkaline silicates, free from lead. The enamels are
                    the same, with the addition of oxide of tin. The metallic oxides used to give
                    the colours are these,— various shades of blue and green, protoxide of copper,
                    or more rarely cobalt; purple and violet, oxide of manganese; yellow, iron or
                    antimoniate of lead; red, sub-oxide of copper or iron; black, magnetic oxide of
                    iron or manganese. The white enamel is simply silicate of soda with oxide of
                    tin. The blues and greens, whether used in transparent glazes or opaque enamels,
                    are often of extreme magnificence of colour, in an endless variety of
                    tints,—turquoise, ultramarine, deep indigo, and all shades of blue passing into
                    green. The most remarkable specimens of Egyptian enamel work are some clay
                    plaques or slabs, about 10 inches high, which were used to decorate the walls of
                    Ranieses II.’s palace at Tel al-Yâhùdiya, in the Delta (14th cent, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> These have figures of men and animals executed in
                    many different colours in the most complicated and ingenious manner. They are
                    partly modelled in slight relief, and then covered with coloured enamels; in
                    other parts a sort of mosaic has been made by mixing fine clay and enamels into
                    soft pastes, the design being fitted together and modelled in these coloured
                    pastes while moist. The slab was then fired, and the enamel pastes were at once
                    vitrified and fixed in their places by the heat. A third process applied to
                    these elaborate slabs was to fit into cavities left for them certain small
                    pieces of coloured glass or brilliant enamels, giving the effect of precious
                    stones, which were fused into their places by a second firing. The chief figures
                    on the plaques are processions of captives, about 8 inches high; the enamel
                    flesh is varied according to the nationality of the prisoners: negroes are
                    black, others white, red, or yellow. Some of the dresses are represented with
                    great richness: various embroidered or textile patterns of the most minute scale
                    are shown by enamel inlay of many colours, and even jewel ornaments are shown by
                    the inserted bits of glass; the dress of some Assyrian captives has patterns of
                    great beauty and richness, —the sacred tree between the guardian beasts, and
                    other figures. Besides these elaborate figure-reliefs an enormous number of
                    smaller pieces of clay inlaid with different-coloured pastes were used to form a
                    sort of mosaic wall-decoration in this wonderful palace, the ruins of which have
                    supplied a perfect museum of all kinds and methods of enamelled work as applied
                    to pottery. The British Museum and the Louvre have the finest specimens of these
                    wall-slabs (see Birch, <hi rend="italic">Ancient Pottery,</hi> p. 51, 1873).</p>
                <p>The term “Egyptian porcelain” has sometimes been given to the small mummy-figures
                    in brilliant blues and greens. This is a misnomer. The little figures, about 3
                    to 6 inches high, of which immense numbers have been found, mostly dating from
                    about the XXth Dynasty downwards, are simply formed of sand (silica) with a
                    little alkali, and only sufficient clay to cement them together, so that they
                    could retain the form given them by the mould into which they were pressed. The
                    result of analysis is silica 92, alumina 4, and a slight but varying proportion
                    of soda. They are covered with a silicious glaze, brilliantly coloured with
                    copper oxide, and are sometimes painted under the glaze with manganese, a deep
                    purple-violet. A few of these figures, and also small statuettes of deities,
                    have had oxide of tin mixed with the paste; the figure has then been exposed to
                    sufficient heat to fuse the whole into one homogeneous vitreous mass, and thus
                    the statuette has become a solid body of fine blue enamel. A few small
                    objects—such as libation cups, bowls, and chalice-like goblets—were also made of
                    the same sandy paste, covered with blue-green glaze. They are thick and clumsy
                    owing to the very unplastic nature of their paste, which necessitated their
                    being pressed in a mould, not wheel-made. The splendour of their colour,
                    however, makes them objects of great beauty; they usually have a little
                    painting, lightly executed in outline with manganese purple, generally a circle
                    of fishes swimming or designs taken from the lotus-plant (see fig. 5).</p>
                <p>During the XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties and later pottery was used in many ways
                    for wall-decoration. Bricks or tiles of coarse brown clay were covered with a
                    fine white slip and glazed with brilliant colours. Another method was a sort of
                    inlay, formed by stamping incised patterns into slabs of clay and filling up the
                    sinkings with a semi-fluid clay of some other colour, exactly like the
                    16th-century Oiron ware. A number of brilliant wall-tiles covered with deep blue
                    glaze, and painted in black outline with figures and hieroglyphs, have been
                    found in many places in-Lower Egypt; the painting is very simple and decorative
                    in effect, drawn with much skill and precision of touch.</p>
                <p>The Canopic vases are an important class and great quantities have been found in
                    Egyptian tombs. They are generally made of plain brown-red clay, and have a lid
                    in <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n627/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0627-0604"/> the shape of a human head. On them hieroglyphs
                    are coarsely painted in black or colours (see fig. 6). They contained parts of
                    the viscera of the corpse. The mummies themselves are frequently decked out with
                    pectoral plates, necklaces, and other ornaments, made of clay covered with blue
                    and other coloured enamels. Some of the pectoral plates are very elaborate works
                    of the same class as the figure-reliefs from Tel al-Y&lt;4hιidiya, richly
                    decorated with inlay of different-coloured pastes and enamels.</p>
                <p>During the Ptolemaic period a quantity of graceful and well-executed pottery was
                    made in fine red and brown clay, mostly without any painted decoration. Some of
                    the vases are of good form, owing to the influence of Greek taste (see fig. 7);
                    others are coarsely decorated with rude painting in blue, green, red, yellow,
                    and brown, either in simple bands or with lotus and ether flower-patterns (see
                    fig.</p>
                <p>8). Both the body of the vases and the colours are usually quite devoid of any
                    gloss. The duller colours are various earths, ochre, and white chalk, while the
                    bright blues and greens are produced by mixing powdered enamel of the required
                    colour with light-coloured clay, the depth of the tint depending on the
                    proportion of the clay or chalk.</p>
                <p>Certain very gaudy and ugly pots were made to imi-täte granite and steatite
                    vessels (see fig. 8). They are of brown clay, rudely dabbed and speckled with
                    brown, red, yellow, and grey colours to represent the markings of the stone;
                    others are yellow, with grey streaks — imitations of marble; most have a painted
                    white tablet, on which are hieroglyphs in black. The pigments are very shiny in
                    texture, and appear to be unfired. Among the most delicate and carefully made
                    kinds of Egyptian pottery are the round flat flasks shaped rather like the
                    mediaeval “pilgrim-bottle” (see fig. 9). They are sometimes made of blue paste,
                    fine clay coloured with oxide of copper, and are delicately enriched with
                    impressed ornaments, stamped from a mould, in low relief or slightly incised.
                    The ornament is often designed like a gold necklace hung round the bottle;
                    others have tablets with inscriptions. The surface is biscuit; and the flasks
                    range in colour from light turquoise to deep ultramarine, the colour not being
                    superficial but of equal strength all through the paste. Small vases of other
                    forms, made of this same material, also occur, but they are rare.</p>

                    but none are specially devoted to the subject. The most valuable contribution to
                    the chronological arrangement of Egyptian pottery is contained in an article by

                <p>But little remains to us of the pottery of the primitive Accadian races of
                    Babylonia and Assyria. It was all extremely simple and undecorated, partly
                    hand-made and partly wheel-made, mostly graceful and natural in form, owing its
                    beauty chiefly to the simple elegance of its shape and the fine material of
                    which it was made,—the close-grained light yellow and brown clays in which the
                    country between the Tigris and the Euphrates is so rich. The great city of
                    Babylon—“figulis munitam urbem,” as Juvenal (x. 171) calls it—was essentially a
                    brick city, and depended for its magnificence to a great extent on such
                    decoration as the potter could supply. Herodotus and Ctesias describe its lofty
                    circuits of brick walls, the two inner walls lined with bricks enamelled in
                    various colours, with figure-subjects, scenes of war and hunting (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Babylon).</hi> The technical methods and enamel pigments used
                    in Assyria and Babylonia were for the most part the same as those used in Egypt;
                    but the Assyrian potters understood the use of oxide of lead as a flux to mix
                    both with glazes and enamels,—an admixture which, though it to some extent
                    injures the durability of the vitreous surface, enables it to be applied with
                    greater ease, and to less silicious clays, without fear of its cracking off or
                    blistering in the kiln.</p>
                <p>The ruined palaces of Babylon and Nineveh have supplied great quantities of
                    bricks painted in various colours, some as early as the 12th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The colours applied are of two distinct classes,—(1)
                    thoroughly <hi rend="italic">vitrified enamels,</hi> often coarse and bubbly in
                    texture, and applied in considerable body, which are mostly brilliant though
                    harmonious in tint, with a hard vitreous surface; (2) <hi rend="italic">earth
                    colours,</hi> chiefly ochres in various shades of quiet yellows and browns,
                    owing their colours to different iron oxides and a pure white made of lime. The
                    earth colours are very thinly applied, and have no surface gloss. Paintings
                    executed in this manner were neither so hard nor so durable as those in the
                    vitrified enamels, and were probably used mainly for panels of ceilings and the
                    upper parts of walls, which were out of the reach of ordinary wear or injury. In
                    a few paintings both methods are combined. The bricks themselves are of light
                    brown or yellowish clay, with which a considerable quantity of straw was mixed.
                    This was burned out in the firing, and so cavities were left, making the bricks
                    light and porous. Many of the enamelled bricks are moulded in relief, with
                    simple patterns of leaves, interlacing bands, waves, and the like, and were used
                    to form cornices and running bands above and below the flat friezes or dados
                    painted with human figures. The reliefs are picked out in colours with enamel,
                    white, yellow, deep orange, soft red, brown, green, and blue, the enamel being
                    sometimes nearly one-eighth of an inch thick. A common size for the bricks is 12
                    to 14 inches long by 6 to 7 wide, and about 4 inches thick. Sometimes two or
                    three courses go to make a single moulded band. The British Museum and the
                    Louvre possess the best specimens of these enamelled architectural features. The
                    finest examples of pictured bricks were found in the great palace at Nimrùd;
                    they appear, judging from the imperfect fragments that remain, to illustrate a
                    victorious expedition by the Assyrians against a foreign nation. The paintings
                    represent long lines of captives, and processions of the conquering Assyrians on
                    foot, on horseback, and in chariots. They are executed, on grounds of different
                    colours—dull green, yellow, and blue—and show a strong feeling for harmony of
                    colour and great skill in decorative arrangement; the figures are about 9 inches
                    high. Some complete paintings were executed on one slab or panel. A fine one,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n628/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0628-0605"/> about 9 inches by 12, also found at Nimrùd, and
                    now in the British Museum, has a picture of the Assyrian king under a fringed
                    canopy giving audience to an officer. The king is followed by an attendant
                    eunuch.</p>
                <p>In addition to figure-subjects and ornaments, large wallsurfaces were covered
                    with cuneiform inscriptions, having letters about 1∣ inches high painted in
                    white and yellow on blue or green grounds; these are executed on large slabs of
                    coarse brown clay, to which a smooth surface, fit for painting, has been given
                    by a thin coating or slip of fine-ground yellowish clay. Large slabs with
                    pendants for ceilings, painted in the same way with very graceful patterns, have
                    been found, all in simple earth colours. Another even more magnificent
                    application of the potter’s art to wall-decoration was by the use of coloured
                    enamel pastes, like those described under the pottery of Egypt. These are
                    reliefs modelled by hand, or pressed into clay moulds and then touched up by a
                    modelling tool. The smaller ones, with delicately-executed figures in low
                    relief, are all in paste of one colour—blue—with sufficient enamel added to the
                    clay to give it a brilliant tint, but not sufficient for complete vitrification.
                    Other fragments exist of life-size or even colossal figures, both in the round
                    and in high relief, worked in pastes of many colours in a kind of mosaic
                    fashion, extremely brilliant and striking in effect.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable application of pottery in Assyria and Babylonia was its use
                    for literary records. Tablets, cylinders, and polygonal prisms were impressed
                    with cuneiform characters in the moist clay, and then baked, thus forming the
                    most imperishable of all kinds of MSS. (cp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Babylonia,</hi>
                    vol. iii. p. 191). The large inscribed cylinders and prisms were made hollow,
                    and turned on the potter’s wheel. The prisms were first moulded in a circular
                    shape, the sides being afterwards made flat by slicing. All are <hi
                    rend="italic">circular</hi> inside, and bear distinct ring-like marks, showing
                    the movement of the wheel as they were scooped out by the potter’s thumb.</p>
                <p>The vases and domestic vessels of Assyria may be divided into four classes,—(1)
                    plain biscuit clay, undecorated; (2) biscuit clay with painted decorations; (3)
                    fine clay stamped with minute reliefs; (4) clay glazed or enamelled.</p>
                <p>(1) By far the greater proportion of the pottery belongs to the first class. It
                    is frequently graceful in shape, is well made and baked, and is of a fine close
                    clay, generally light in colour. Fig. 10 shows some of the commonest forms. Some
                    specimens have cuneiform inscriptions incised with a pointed tool in the same
                    way as the cylinder letters. The coarser clays are usually covered with a fine
                    whitish slip, and a rather rare variety of the pottery is made throughout of a
                    close-grained almost white clay. One sort of pottery, of which very few
                    specimens have been found, has simple patterns incised on the grey body of the
                    vessel; these patterns were then made conspicuous by being filled in with white
                    clay, a method of inlay like that used in Egypt. (2) Very few examples of the
                    second class are known. Some vases of brown clay, covered with white slip, have
                    rude paintings of human figures, bowmen and other soldiers, executed in brown
                    outline, with rapid and skilful touch. Others have cuneiform inscriptions and
                    geometrical floral patterns painted in silica and lime-white with yellow and
                    brown ochres. They appear to belong to the 9th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Both the clay body and the earth pigments are quite free from any
                    vitreous gloss in all this class of ware. A few fragments have been found of a
                    coarse brown pottery, decorated with simple patterns in gold leaf, applied after
                    the ware was fired. (3) A very fine sort of Assyrian pottery, of which examples
                    exist dating from the 10th to the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> is
                    made of a close-grained ivory-white clay, or else a hard greyish black clay; the
                    surface is biscuit, and is ornamented with bands of human figures in relief,
                    —soldiers, captives, royal personages, and others, with representations of
                    cities, all most minutely executed, the figures scarcely an inch high. Other
                    bands have cuneiform inscriptions, also in delicate relief. The bands appear to
                    have been formed by rolling a cylinder die or mould over the surface of the clay
                    while soft and moist. The few specimens of this pottery that have been found are
                    mostly in the form of cylindrical drinking-cups. This method of decoration is
                    one largely used in the earliest variety of Etruscan pottery. (4) Glazed and
                    enamelled pottery (see fig. 11) is more abundant; it consists chiefly of small
                    articles of fine clay, bottles, two-handled jugs, miniature amphorae, and
                    pilgrim - flasks, very carefully made, and apparently articles of luxury. Some
                    are of white clay, covered with a colourless glaze of silicate of soda, rendered
                    more fusible by the addition of oxide of lead. Partly owing to this addition the
                    glaze is generally in a very decomposed state, often presenting the most
                    brilliant iridescent colours. Other examples are coated in a similar way, except
                    that the transparent glaze is tinted a brilliant blue or green with oxides of
                    copper, very like the blue glaze so much used in Egypt, but usually less hard
                    and bright in colour. A few small specimens have been discovered coated with a
                    white tin enamel. Both the glazed and the enamelled pottery is undecorated by
                    any painting.</p>
                <p>At Warka (the Chaldaean Erech) a large number of very curious clay coffins were
                    found in cave-tombs stacked closely one upon another. They are made of coarse
                    clay, and bear outside patterns rudely stamped in blunt relief; the whole is
                    covered with a plumbo-silicious green glaze. They are about 7 feet long and very
                    peculiar in form; the body was introduced through an oval opening at the head,
                    over which a similarly glazed clay lid fitted closely. These coffins are
                    probably not earlier than the Sasanian period. Clay coffins of much greater
                    antiquity have been found in Babylonia, but they are of plain biscuit clay.</p>

                <p>The discoveries of recent years have opened out a new field in the history of the
                    origin and growth of Hellenic art, especially as relating to pottery.
                    Excavations in Cyprus, Rhodes, Thera (Santorin), the plains of Troy, Mycenae,
                    Attica, and the coasts of southern Italy have revealed the existence of an
                    abundant class of pottery of great antiquity, a large part of which, in its
                    forms and decoration, appears to have been due, directly or indirectly, to the
                    Phoenicians. The designs are of a curiously complex character. Purely Assyrian
                    motives, such as the sacred tree with its guardian “cherubs,” are mingled with
                    figures and ornaments peculiar to Egypt; other characteristics which modify and
                    blend these two styles seem due to the Phoenicians themselves; while, lastly,
                    various local influences are shown in the representations of such plants and
                    animals as were commonest in the special place where the pottery happened to be
                    made. Possibly some of the designs, such as the sacred tree of Assyria, might be
                    traced farther back still, to the distant Asiatic home of the Indo-European
                    races; but any derivation of this kind would, in our present state of knowledge,
                    be purely conjectural.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0629-0606"/>
                <p>The islands of Thera, Rhodes, and Cyprus, which were colonized by the Phoenicians
                    at a very early period (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Phoenicia,</hi> vol. xviii. p.
                    804 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> have supplied large quantities of archaic
                    pottery, ornamented with characteristically Phoenician patterns and figures. The
                    equally rich finds of pottery from Mycenae and the Troad, though not free from
                    Phoenician influence, have mostly a more native style of decoration. Though in
                    some few cases the finding of Egyptian objects with dated hieroglyphs suggests a
                    probable age for the pottery they were found with, yet in the main it is
                    impossible to give even an approximate date to this large class of archaic
                    pottery. Its production evidently extended over many centuries, and little or no
                    help towards a chronological classification is given by any clearly-defined
                    stages of artistic development. Some of the earlier specimens may possibly be as
                    old as the 18th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (scarabs of Amenhotep
                    III. were found with pottery in Rhodes), while later ones, not very different in
                    style, were probably made as late as the 8th century.<note anchored="true"

                    rend="italic">Forms and Materials of Archaic Pottery.—</hi> There is a special
                    charm about this early pottery. Graceful as the Greek vases of the best period
                    of art are, there is something rigid and slightly mechanical in their
                    highly-finished beauty, their polished surface, and their shape, accurately
                    produced after some fixed model, from which but little deviation was permitted.
                    Endless varieties of form occur in archaic pottery, changing with the mood and
                    individuality of each potter; full of spirit and life, in their easy grace and
                    the multiplicity of their flowing lines, these simple clay vessels give one—more
                    perhaps than any other works of art—that keen aesthetic pleasure which consists
                    in a retrospective sympathy with the joy that the artist took in his own
                    handiwork. Extreme fertility of invention, as well as the utmost freedom of
                    touch in the manipulation of the revolving mass of clay, are its chief
                    characteristics. Fig. 12 gives some of the many forms.</p>
                <p>It is usually thin, light, and well baked, formed either of pale buff, whitish,
                    or straw-coloured clay; or, if a darker clay is used, the surface is generally
                    covered with a fine white slip composed of silica, lime, and a little alumina.
                    This forms a ground for the painting, which is executed in ochre earths, browns,
                    and reds of different shades, the colours of which are due to oxides of iron.
                    Most of the pottery is biscuit, clay ground and painted ornament being alike
                    free from any gloss; but in some cases silica and an alkali (probably carbonate
                    of soda) have been added to the ochre pigment, which has thus become vitrified
                    in the kiln and acquired a glossy surface. This does not occur among the earlier
                    specimens.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Enamelled Pottery.—</hi> In some of the tombs in Aegina and
                    Rhodes a quantity of small vases, statuettes, and other objects have been found,
                    executed under Egyptian influence, with decoration of various coloured enamels.
                    The colours used and the methods of manipulation resemble the enamel work of
                    Egypt so closely as to need no special description. Some fine pilgrim-flasks of
                    blue and green have blundered copies of hieroglyphs and representations of
                    Egyptian deities incised in the moist clay. Less purely Egyptian in style are
                    certain small vases (see fig. 13), coarsely ornamented with bands and chevrons
                    in various enamels—white, blue, green, purple-brown, and yellow. The Louvre and
                    the British Museum have the best specimens of these. Small vases, exactly
                    similar in design and execution to those from Aegina and Rhodes, have been found
                    in the tombs of Vulci and other places in Etruria, probably brought there by
                    Phoenician traders, to whose intercourse with Egypt and knowledge of the
                    Egyptian designs and mechanical processes the existence of the enamelled pottery
                    of Rhodes is probably due. Other specimens have been found in the recently
                    discovered Etruscan necropolis on the Esquiline in Rome.<note anchored="true"

                    p. 2.</p></note> One curious variety of early pottery is of a fine glossy red
                    like the later Samian ware. Its smooth surface of rich red is due to the
                    application of a thin finely-ground mixture of silica, soda, and some alumina,
                    forming a vitreous enamel to which the opaque red colour was given by a large
                    proportion of oxide of iron (see fig. 14). Some of this red pottery is of
                    extreme anti quity; it is either smooth and undecorated, or has rudely-incised
                    hatchings and zig-zags, scratched down to the clay body of the vessel through
                    the red enamel. Another variety of very early pottery from Mycenae and the Troad
                    is of a hard black clay, with glossy surface (see fig. 15).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Painted Ornament on Archaic Vases.—</hi> This may be divided
                    roughly into four classes. (1) Hatchings, concentric circles, chevrons, and
                    other simple combinations of lines, arranged frequently in designs obviously
                    suggested by matting or textile fabrics, and also various arrangements of
                    spirals, apparently taken from patterns used in metal-work. Some of the designs
                    of this class seem <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0630-0607"/> common to all races of men in an elementary stage
                    of progress, and occur on the earliest known pottery, that of the Neolithic age
                    (see fig. 16). (2) Representations of plants (often seaweeds) and marine
                    animals, such as cuttlefishes, medusae, and star-fishes, or occasionally aquatic
                    birds. This class of ornament appears to be more native in character—derived,
                    that is, from various objects with which the potter was familiar—and not to have
                    been a Phoenician import (see fig. 17). (3) Conventional ornament, a decorative
                    arrangement in bands or scrolls of certain plants, such as the lotus or papyrus
                    and the palm-tree. This class of ornament is distinctly Phoenician, and shows a
                    predominance, sometimes of Assyrian, sometimes of Egyptian influence (see fig.
                    18).</p>
                <p>(4) Very rude and badly-drawn figures of men and animals. They are mostly purely
                    decorative and meaningless, are often merely drawn in outline, and have little
                    or no help from incised lines, which became so important in the next stage of
                    the development of pottery. Some of the figures are strongly Assyrian in
                    character, while others of the rudest execution seem to be native.</p>
                <p>It appears at first sight as if there was a distinct chronological order of
                    development in these four classes of ornament—growing from simple line -
                    patterns to the copying of easily represented natural objects, then to the
                    invention of regular geometrical floral patterns, and lastly arriving at the
                    rude depiction of human figures. Various points, however, combine to contradict
                    such a theory of arrangement, such as the combinations in which these vessels
                    have been found, the manner in which the various classes of ornament are mingled
                    on the same vase, and lastly the fact that some elaborate and highly-finished
                    vases, obviously of later date, are decorated solely with the straight-line and
                    hatched patterns of the first of the four classes of ornament. Again, the
                    ornament of the second class, which appears to be native and local, can hardly
                    be so altogether. Pottery found at places so far distant as Rhodes and Mycenae
                    has in some cases exactly similar painting of this sort, showing that a common
                    artistic influence was at work in both places. The whole subject is a very
                    difficult one, and little that is really definite can be asserted about it with
                    safety—at least as yet.</p>
                <p>Fig. 19 gives two vases of great interest. One shows the common decoration with
                    wheel-applied circles, and also the Assyrian altar-like object between two
                    beasts; the other, from Cyprus, has the Assyrian sacred tree, with similar
                    guardian animals. One of the most striking characteristics of archaic pottery of
                    all classes, and especially of the earliest, is the great use made of the
                    potter’s wheel in applying the painted ornaments. Very many of the vessels are
                    decorated with a number of encircling bands or lines, or on their sides with a
                    number of concentric circles. These were easily applied, and very true circles
                    were obtained by setting the pot (after it was dried in the sun) for a second
                    time on the wheel, in the required position, either on its side or upright as it
                    was originally turned. A brush held against the revolving vessel marked out the
                    bands or circles. A very interesting votive tablet from Corinth (now in the
                    Louvre), probably 700-600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> shows a potter at work
                    in his shop, applying painted bands in this way. He sets the wheel in motion
                    with one hand, while with the other he holds the brush against the revolving
                    pot. The wheel here shown (see fig. 20) is one of the earliest form, without the
                    lower foot-turned disk.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The writer of the article in <hi rend="italic">Ann. Inst.</hi> (1882) on
                    this painting has missed the chief point of interest, which is that the potter
                    is using his wheel, not to mould the vase, but to apply the bands of colour
                    round it.</p></note> The smaller circles were struck out with compasses, the
                    central point of which has usually left a deep mark. The patterns used on the
                    first class of pottery consist mostly of straight lines, hatched and crossed,
                    arranged in squares, chevrons, triangles, and other simple figures, combined
                    with concentric circles or, more rarely, wavy bands, the whole arranged
                    frequently in very complicated and effective patterns. The second class has
                    frequently varieties of seaweed and many marine creatures, all treated very
                    simply, but drawn with great skill and appreciation of the characteristics of
                    each object and its decorative capabilities. The third class—that of geometrical
                    floral patterns—has but little variety. Some of the lotus patterns are almost
                    identical with those used in Egypt and Assyria, and continued in use for vase
                    decoration down to the most flourishing period of Greek art, though latterly in
                    a stiff and rather lifeless form. The fourth class—that of figurepaintings—is of
                    great, interest; the earlier patterns are merely drawn in outline. Fig.*21 shows
                    an cenochoe from Cyprus, now in the British Museum, of rather coarse red clay
                    with yellow slip, on which is pencilled in outline a one-horse chariot driven at
                    full speed by a slave; behind him stands a bowman shooting an arrow; the whole
                    is strikingly Assyrian in style. Another cenochoe, found in Attica, of more
                    primitive style, has a central band <pb break="no"

                    shields, all alike, most rudely executed; almost exactly similar
                    figure-paintings occur on some of the Mycenae pottery, and also on a large
                    amphora from Cyprus (now in the British Museum), which has many bands, on which
                    are painted in red ochre lines of men with crested heads (looking like North -
                    American Indians) riding long weasel-shaped horses. Other bands on the same vase
                    have centaurs, foot - soldiers, and various beasts, the latter, especially some
                    stags, rather better drawn. They are painted in coarse dabs, and, except for a
                    few of the eyes, have no incised lines. Smaller ornaments, such as the svas-tica
                    ⅛ and simple forms of rosettes, are often used to decorate the backgrounds and
                    fill up spaces, but not to so great an extent as in the succeeding class of
                    pottery.</p>
                <p>Among the earlier pottery from Mycenae and the Troad are several very strange
                    vases in coarse clay rudely modelled to indicate a human form. Some have the
                    upper part formed like a head, very like the Egyptian Canopic vases. A great
                    number of “pithi” <hi rend="italic">(πίθοι),</hi> enormous vases shaped
                    something like amphorae, have been discovered in Rhodes, the Troad, and other
                    places, some as much as 7 feet high. Such vessels are often decorated with
                    patterns in relief, chiefly combinations of spirals and the like, some closely
                    resembling the designs on the sculptured architrave from the “Treasury of
                    Atreus” at Mycenae.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vases with Bands or Friezes of Animals on Grounds sprinkled
                    with Flowers.—</hi> This is a very large and important class, and very numerous
                    specimens have been found widely scattered over the shores of the Mediterranean
                    (see fig. 22). The production of vases of this style appears to have lasted for
                    many centuries; the earlier ones are rudely executed in dull ochre colours on
                    biscuit clay, like most archaic pottery, while the later ones have paintings in
                    brilliant black enamel on a ground of red clay, thinly covered with a true
                    vitreous glaze. This class of vase-painting, though mostly the work of Greek
                    potters, is distinctly Oriental in character, probably Assyro-Phoenician.</p>
                <p>It is of extreme decorative richness: the surfaces of the vases are well covered,
                    and the designs, though simply treated, are very effective, in many ways far
                    more successful as works of decorative art than the elaborate and exquisitely
                    drawn figure-pictures on later Greek vases. The ground is thickly covered with
                    small decorative patterns; fig. 23 shows those used on more archaic vases. The
                    animals that occur most frequently on the bands are lions, leopards, bulls,
                    goats, deer, with various birds, such as cocks and swans, and also griffins,
                    sphinxes, and sirens. A favourite motive of design is the sacred tree or a sort
                    of column, each with a guardian beast at the sides. This is one of the most
                    interesting of all designs in the history of ornament; it dates from an
                    extremely early period, was used in ancient Chaldaean art, and was handed on by
                    the Sasanians to the Moslem conquerors of Persia; it survived, though altered
                    and after its meaning was long forgotten, till even the 15th century in the
                    textile fabrics worked in Italy after Oriental designs. The column between the
                    beasts occurs on the Lion Gate of Mycenae. In the later art of the Persians a
                    fire-altar takes the place of the column.</p>

                    it will be convenient to give a list of the technical methods employed in all
                    classes of pottery found in Hellenic sites, and also some account of the
                    inscriptions and various forms of letters which are found on Greek vases.</p>

                    of this pottery was made without the wheel; but some was so skilfully modelled

                    slip as class 1; a quite white slip was also used, made of a natural sort of
                    pipeclay, or in some cases of a mixture of lime and silica with a little clay to
                    bind it together. <hi rend="italic">Pigments</hi>: earth-colours, made of brown

                    and free silica. <hi rend="italic">Methods</hi>: the white or yellow slip was
                    usually applied while the vase was revolving on the wheel, either with a brush
                    or by the potter dipping his hands into a bowl of fluid slip just before
                    finishing the final modelling or throwing of the vase; in some cases it has been
                    applied by dipping the pot into the slip. The method of applying the painted
                    bands is shown above in fig. 20. As a rule these vases were not fired at a
                    sufficient heat to give them a vitreous gloss, though in some cases the heat has
                    been enough to partly vitrify those of the ochre colours which contained a
                    proportion of free silica and alkali.</p>

                    finely ground, and sometimes tinged a deeper red with additional red oxide of
                    iron,—the white slip is like that in class 2; (c) glaze, of almost imperceptible
                    thickness, a silicate of soda; (d) black pigment,—a true vitreous enamel, which
                    owes its deep black to the magnetic oxide of iron (composition—soda 17, silica
                    46, alumina 12, black peroxide of iron 17, lime 6 per cent.); (e) chocolate-red
                    pigment, an ochre red sometimes mixed with finely-ground fragments of red
                    pottery; (∕) white pigment, like the white slip of class 2,—various analyses,
                    silica 54 to 62, alumina 34 to 43, lime ⅜ to 3⅜ per cent. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Methods</hi>: the vase was first turned on the wheel, and, in order to give the
                    pot a surface of deeper red, the slip was applied by a brush or by the hands of
                    the potter while it was still revolving. The outline of the design was next
                    roughly sketched, either with a point or in light-red ochre with a brush. After
                    the vase had dried sufficiently in the sun so as to become firm, it was again
                    put on the wheel, and the glaze, finely powdered and mixed with water, was
                    applied to it with a brush as it revolved. The vase then appears, at least in
                    some cases, to have been for the first time fired in the kiln in order to get a
                    smooth almost nonabsorbent surface for the use of the painter. In other cases
                    the materials of the red slip and the silicate glaze were mixed, and the two
                    applied together, as was done in the case of the Roman Samian ware. The painter
                    next set to work and put on the black enamel <pb break="no"

                    the vase round its whole circumference was to be black, such as the foot and
                    neck, the vase was again set on the wheel and the black enamel put on as it
                    revolved. This repeated use of the wheel for the application of slip, glaze, and
                    black enamel was in order to secure an even coating with uniform grain, far more
                    difficult to get with the unaided brush. The grain thus produced can usually be
                    distinctly traced in each of the three coatings. The firing of the black enamel
                    must have been done with great care and skill, as a very slight chemical change
                    in the black oxide of iron converts it into the red oxide. Thus the same stroke
                    of a brush is often (in the earlier vases of this class) half black and half
                    vermilion-red, or one side of a vase is red and the other black, according as it
                    has been played upon by oxidizing or deoxidizing products of combustion in the
                    kiln. In the finest vases the black enamel is of great beauty, with wonderful
                    rich softness of texture, which no modern skill has been able to approach. The
                    tombs of Nola, Capua, and other places in Magna Graecia have supplied the most
                    technically perfect vases, both for the fineness of their clay and the
                    brilliance of their black enamel. After the firing of the enamel the details
                    λvere drawn in by incised lines, cutting through the enamel down to thé clay
                    body of the vase. The clear and slightly-chipped edges of the lines show that
                    they were done <hi rend="italic">after</hi> firing, when the black enamel was in
                    a hard vitreous state. This must have been done with some very sharp and hard
                    point, probably a natural crystal of diamond or corundum, such as was used for
                    engraving gems; the incised details on some vases are of almost microscopic
                    minuteness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A very
                    remarkable early vase, in the collection of Countess Dzialinska in Pans, is
                    decorated with incised lines only, the whole being covered with the black
                    enamel.</p></note> The “non-vitreous” colours, red and white, were sometimes put
                    on before, sometimes after the incised lines. They were fixed in their place by
                    a slight firing, not enough to vitrify them or to soften the edges of the
                    incised lines in the enamel. Both these changes have been shown to take place
                    under a not very violent heat, by experiments made by the present writer on
                    fragments of such vases. The white was used to depict the flesh of females and
                    of some of the gods, such as Eros, or for the bodies of horses and the hair of
                    old men. Chocolate-red was mostly used for ornamental touches on dress, armour,
                    harness, and the like. Both are used in painting the heraldic beasts or
                    ornaments which so often occur on the round shields of Greek warriors. Both the
                    white and red are applied <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the black. Thus the female
                    figures are first completely painted in black, and the white afterwards applied
                    over the face, hands, or other nude parts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Vases with Red Figures.—</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >materials</hi> employed and the first stages in the manufacture of this class
                    are the same as those of class 3; but, instead of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >figures</hi> being painted in black, the <hi rend="italic">ground</hi> is
                    covered with black enamel, and the figures left, showing the glazed red slip
                    which covers the whole vase. This method produced a great artistic advance in
                    the beauty of the figures, the details and inner lines of which could be
                    executed with freedom and ease by brush-marked lines instead of by the laborious
                    process of cutting incised lines through the very hard black enamel. The outline
                    of the figures was drawn, with wonderful precision and rapidity, with a brush
                    fully charged with fluid enamel, boldly applied so as to make a broad line or
                    band about one-eighth of an inch wide all round each figure, one edge of the
                    band giving the boundary of the required form. Details and inner markings were
                    then added with a fine-pointed brush capable of making the thinnest and most
                    delicate strokes. On many of the finest vases the contourlines of muscles and
                    other markings intended to be less salient were painted in pale brown instead of
                    black. Last of all, the main part of the ground between the black outline bands
                    was filled in. The greater thickness of the enamel, where it was more
                    concentrated in the bands, is generally visible; the enamel used for filling in
                    was thinner because it spread over a larger space as it flowed from the brush.
                    In some cases a face or other part has had a thin black outline before the wider
                    band was put on; and then <hi rend="italic">three</hi> distinct thicknesses of
                    enamel can be seen, the thin outline standing out perceptibly more than the
                    rest. It is evident that the fluid black enamel was applied in a somewhat thick
                    viscid state, and thus a slight degree of relief was often produced, enabling
                    black <hi rend="italic">lines</hi> to show over the black <hi rend="italic"
                    >ground,</hi> as is the case sometimes with the strings of lyres. This slight
                    relief often gives additional effect to the treatment of curly hair, represented
                    by a series of dots or globules, as in the transitional amphora described below
                    (p. 612). This method recalls the free use of the drill in the representation of
                    hair on early engraved gems. Touches of white and red were occasionally used, as
                    in the preceding class of vases, but to a much more limited extent. Some of the
                    finest black and red vases, especially specimens from Nola, Vulci, and Capua,
                    have enrichments in gold applied in relief.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Polychromatic Vases.—Materials:</hi> the same as in the
                    nreced-</p>
                <p>ιng class with the addition of bright red, blue, green, and gold. The red used on
                    some vases is an oxide of iron; but a very brilliant minium crimson also occurs,
                    which appears to have been added after the final firing, and is not therefore,
                    properly speaking, a “ceramic” pigment. The blue and green are different oxides
                    of copper, fused with silica and soda to make a bright vitreous enamel, which
                    was then finely powdered and mixed with a proportion of white pigment (silica
                    and lime) according to the strength of the tint required. This powdered enamel
                    pigment is the “smalto” of mediaeval Italian painters. The gold was applied in
                    leaf, not on the flat surface of the vase, but on a ground modelled in slight
                    relief with semi-fluid slip of ordinary fine red clay, thus very much enhancing
                    the effect produced by the gold leaf. Necklaces, bracelets, and other gold
                    ornaments are always modelled in perceptible relief, producing a rich effect
                    which no merely flat application of gold could give. Polychromatic vases may be
                    divided into four main classes, (a) Vases in which the colours are used as <hi
                    rend="italic">additional</hi> decoration to the ordinary red figures, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the celebrated amphora from Camirus (Rhodes), with the
                    scene of Peleus winning Thetis as his bride (see Plate V.). (&amp;) Vases
                    painted in brown outline, on a fine white slip, with the addition of red and
                    yellow ochre colours, and occasionally a little gold, <hi rend="italic"
                    >c.g.,</hi> the cylix in the British Museum with Aphrodite seated on a flying
                    swan (see Plate V. ); this is a rare and usually very beautiful variety, and is
                    more fully described below (p. 613). (c) Attic funeral lecythi, which have the
                    neck and foot in brilliant black (wheel-applied) enamel and the main body of the
                    vase covered with a non-vitreous white slip. The design was sketched in rough
                    outline and the red pigment put on with a small brush over the white ground. The
                    drawing is generally careless and rapid, but often shows great skill and beauty
                    of touch. The colours, generally red, blue, or green, were then thickly and
                    often clumsily applied over parts of the red outline drawing, mostly over the
                    draperies. These vases were not meant to be handled, as their colours rub off
                    very easily: they were simply intended for sepulchral purposes, either to hang
                    <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the stele or <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the tomb,
                    (d) Vases, especially from Magna Graecia, such as rhytons, small oenochoae, and
                    others, moulded skilfully in a variety of fanciful shapes, heads of animals or
                    deities, sphinxes, and other figures, either grotesque or beautiful. They are
                    decorated partly with the usual red figures, and with the most brilliant black
                    enamel, while other parts are painted in white and brilliant crimson with
                    further enrichments in gold leaf. These bright colours seem to have been applied
                    <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the last firing, and not to be true ceramic
                    colours.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Black Vases of Metal-like Designs.—</hi> These vases often
                    have the finest sort of black enamel, especially the large amphorae from Capua
                    and other places in Magna Graecia, covered all over with fluting or gadroons.
                    Some have wreaths of vine, olive, and other plants, or imitations of gold
                    necklaces modelled in slip, slightly in relief, and afterwards covered with gold
                    leaf. A number of “phialae omphalae” (saucer-shaped vessels), of about 200 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> were made by being pressed into a mould, and were
                    thus stamped with figures in relief, such as processions of deities driving
                    chariots. Some of these, made in Magna Graecia after its conquest by the Romans,
                    have Latin inscriptions. One made at Cales is inscribed with the potter’s name
                    C. CANOLEIOS. L. F. FECIT. CALENOS (see <hi rend="italic">Ann. Inst.,</hi> 1883,
                    p. 66). Small asci were decorated with highly-finished figure-subjects, stamped
                    on emblemata or tablets of clay, which were embedded in the vase while it was
                    soft. Such elaborate and metal-like pieces of pottery are entirely covered with
                    black enamel. They are often of great beauty, both in the composition of the
                    relief figures and in their delicate execution. Vases of this class have been
                    found entirely covered with gold or silver leaf, copies of metal plate.<note

                <p>7. Vases, such as large asci, many from Magna Graecia, made of simple yellowish
                    biscuit clay, and modelled into shapes of female heads, or covered with a number
                    of statuettes of female figures. They are generally painted simply in distemper
                    in “non-ceramic” colours; but they fall rather under the head of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Terra-cotta</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >).</hi> Some are of very great beauty, and are covered with statuettes very
                    like those found at Tanagra.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Greek Vases of Debased Style, last period.—</hi> These have
                    the usual red figures on a black enamel ground, of the same materials, and
                    applied in the same way as on the earlier vases, except that the black enamel is
                    much thinner and very inferior in quality, frequently having a hard metallic
                    gloss instead of the soft richness of the earlier vases. A great part of the
                    figures and ornaments is executed in white, red, brown, and yellow pigments,
                    with shading and gradations of colour, used to produce an effect of relief,
                    which is unsuited to vase-painting, and, especially in the later examples, is
                    executed with extreme rudeness and clumsiness of drawing. Vase-painting became
                    degraded in style at a period when the other arts of Greece showed but little
                    signs of decadence, and ceased altogether to be practised nearly a century
                    before the Christian era. No painted vases were found in the buried cities of
                    Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae; and Suetonius <hi rend="italic">{Julius
                    Cεesar,</hi> c. 81) mentions the easemess with which certain Greek vases found
                    in tombs near <pb break="no"

                    these later vases are very elaborate and realistic compared with those of the
                    earlier period. Bands of graceful scroll-work with growing foliage are much
                    used, often, in spite of their attempted relief, very beautiful and much
                    superior to the figure-subjects which accompany them. Some strikingly resemble
                    in style the painted friezes on Pompeian walls, and have lost all purely ceramic
                    character.</p>
                <p>Two abnormal and comparatively rare methods of vase-painting must be mentioned.
                    One occurs on a number of Corinthian vases mostly now in the Louvre,
                    pseudo-archaic in style, but apparently of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Such were first covered with white slip, which was in turn completely
                    covered over with black enamel. The design was then made by the awkward process
                    of cutting away the black in parts so as to leave black figures on a white
                    ground— a kind of “sgraffiato.” Another strange method was practised in southern
                    Italy during the extreme decadence of vase-painting. The whole surface was
                    covered with black enamel, and the figures were afterwards painted in red <hi
                    rend="italic">over</hi> the black so as to imitate the ordinary Greek vases with
                    red figures and a black enamel painted <hi rend="italic">round</hi> them. Most
                    specimens are mere feeble imitations of the works of an earlier period; but a
                    cylix in the British Museum is painted in this style with a graceful seated
                    figure of Adonis or Meleager,—a very remarkable work, executed in warm browns
                    and yellows, giving the effect of flesh, and shaded and touched with high lights
                    in a thoroughly pictorial manner, which, though on a miniature scale, recalls
                    the best wall-paintings of Pompeii or Rome.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inscriptions on Vases.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    Inscriptions are very numerous during the middle period of Greek art, while on
                    the most archaic vases and those of the decadence they are mostly absent. They
                    are of great interest in the history of Greek palaeography, but are not always a
                    safe guide as to the dates of vases, because archaic forms of letters were often
                    used by vase-painters long after other forms of letters had come into general
                    use. Vase-inscriptions may be divided roughly under two heads—Ionian and Dorian,
                    the latter occurring mostly on the numerous vases from Corinth and her colonies.

                <p>One of the earliest vase-inscriptions known is that mentioned below (see fig. 24,
                    p. 611) as occurring on a “pinax,” or large flat platter, with archaic painting
                    in brown, found at Camirus in Rhodes and now in the British Museum. Each figure
                    has its name thus—</p>
                <p>t <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> *Γ ’ E.ΛΛD <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi>)</p>
                <p>S∕ΦOpBθ(<hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> ∖</p>
                <p>for MENEΛAΣ, EKTOP (retrograde), and EYΦOPBOΣ. This curious inscription has the
                    Ionian form of E, the Dorian Μ (san) for Σ. and a common archaic form of Θ for
                    Φ, a very strange and exceptional combination of characters. The Burgon
                    Panathenaic amphora (see fig. 25) has a very curious Old-Attic inscription,
                    written downwards—</p>
                <p>for TON AΘENEΘ[E]N AΘΛON E[I]MI, “I am one of the prizes from Athens,” the usual
                    inscription on prize vases. Vaseinscriptions are usually <hi rend="italic"
                    >painted,</hi> if on a red ground in black or brown, if on a black ground in red
                    or white. Some are <hi rend="italic">incised,</hi> scratched after the vase was
                    fired; but such occur less often. They are written both retrograde and from left
                    to right, apparently without any fixed rule. Both methods frequently occur in
                    the same inscription. A fine early Corinthian crater, found at Caere and now in
                    the Louvre, with black figures representing Heracles feasting with Eurytius, has
                    the names of the persons represented inscribed in the characteristic early
                    Dorian manner—</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">∕√oia</hi> MsnxAflaa for EYPYTIOΣ, TIΦITOΣ, fIOΛA (Viola, a
                    lady present at the feast), and HEPAKΛEΣ. On the handle of the crater is
                    scratched 90, for Corinth, the place where it was made.<note anchored="true"

                    clay tablet dedicated to Poseidon, about 4 by 2⅜ inches, now in the Louvre.
                    Poseidon is represented at full length, holding a trident and a wreath, in black
                    with incised lines; at each corner is a hole for fixing the tablet to the temple
                    wall. It is inscribed—</p>

                <p>for ΠOTEIΔAN . . . ON ΜΆΝΕΘΗΚΕ, “—on dedicated me to Poseidon.” This curious
                    tablet was found at Corinth; the letters aie very archaic in form, though the
                    painting can hardly be earlier than the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> j</p>
                <p>The great majority of vases have inscriptions in Old-Attic characters, such as
                    are shown in the two following examples. The subjects of the inscriptions may be
                    divided into five heads, though other miscellaneous ones also occur.</p>
                <p>(1) On early vases rudely scratched trade-marks, or potters’ marks, indicating
                    the number of vases in a special batch and their prices. (2) Potters’ and
                    artists’ names. The majority have only one name, possibly that of the
                    master-potter, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi></p>
                <p>∣&gt;vχS∣ΘEoi Ero∣E∙iE^</p>
                <p>for Eι⅛i0eos <hi rend="italic">iτroiησev.</hi> In other cases, mostly on the
                    finest vases, the name of the painter occurs as well as that of the potter, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi></p>
                <p>MAKPON EΛPAφSEN</p>
                <p>for <hi rend="italic">~MΛκρωv typaψev.</hi> Some artists, probably distinguished
                    for their skill, painted the vases of several potters; other painters’ names
                    chiefly occur on the vase of one special potter. (3) Names of people, animals,
                    and even things represented on the vases. A large proportion of the earlier
                    vases have a name by the side of each figure, or at least by the side of the
                    most important ones. Names of horses and dogs occasionally occur, and in a few
                    instances even inanimate objects are designated by a name, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the balance on the cylix of Arcesilaus in the Paris Bibliothèque and
                    Zeus’s throne on an early amphora in the Louvre. (4) Speeches uttered by the
                    vase figures, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in a scene representing a game at
                    ball one of the players says XPHΣAN MOI TAN ΣΦ[A]IPAN, “Throw me the ball.”
                    Other vases have words of compliment or greeting, such as XAIPE, “Hail!” or
                    words relating to their contents, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> HΔYΣ ΟΙΝΟΣ, “The
                    wine is sweet.” (5) Names of owners, often with the ad jective ΚΑΛΟΣ or ΚΑΛΕ (if
                    a lady), possibly intended for gifts, like the majolica plates inscribed with a
                    lady’s name followed<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n634/mode/1up"

                    a very curious inscription has recently been found at Orvieto, in early Attic
                    characters—ZHAIΘ3MIAΗ0VHH0YΔ (retrograde) —meaning <hi rend="italic">δυ δβeλω
                    κal μe θiyes,</hi> “Two obols, and you have me.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Ann. Inst.,</hi> 1882,
                    p. 58.</p></note></p>
                <p>A quite different species of inscriptions occurs on vases of the latest class.
                    Artists’ and potters’ names cease to appear with the rapidly-increasing
                    decadence of the art. A black crater in the British Museum has a dedicatory
                    inscription painted in white round the neck, ΔIOΣ Σ∩THPOΣ, “Zeus the Saviour.” A
                    fine black fluted amphora has the owner’s name, APICTAPXO APICT∩NOΣ, in which
                    the late C form of Σ occurs. On a small black ascus in the British Museum is
                    scratched rudely ΠΡΟΠΙΝΕ MH KATΘHIΣ, “Drink, do not set me down.” And some plain
                    black measures have their capacity incised on them, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    HEMI-KOTVΛION, “Half a cotylion,” on a cup-shaped vessel from Corcyra. One of
                    the earliest known instances of Greek cursive writing occurs on a covered pyxis
                    divided into four compartments (in the British Museum). It appears to have been
                    used to contain the ashes of a Roman called Sergius. Under the foot is rudely
                    scratched—</p>
                <p>“My beloved Sergius, farewell.” The last word is blundered And on the inside of
                    the lid is a similar incised inscription—</p>
                <p>“It is the second interment.” The pyxis is apparently much older than the
                    inscription, a supposition which is confirmed by the note as to its being a
                    later burial.</p>
                <p>One sort of inscription, used more largely by the Romans than the Greeks, was
                    impressed from incuse stamps, a method chiefly used for large amphorae and other
                    vessels of plain biscuit clay, especially those made in Rhodes and Cnidus. These
                    inscriptions, which date from the time of Alexander the Great down to the 1st
                    century after Christ, usually give the name of an eponymous magistrate or chief
                    priest, and have frequently in addition one of the thirteen months of the Doric
                    calendar. Some of the stamps are circular, copied from current Rhodian coins,
                    and have the legend round a front face of Helios, or the rose-blossom <hi
                    rend="italic">ρόδον,</hi> which was the badge of the island. Other stamps are
                    square or lozengeshaped; they are usually impressed on the neck or handle of
                    jars.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Dumont, <hi

                <p>Having considered the technical methods employed in the manufacture of Greek
                    vases and the various classes of inscriptions which occur upon them, we will now
                    return to the styles of vase-paintings and the subjects which are most
                    frequently represented.</p>

                    the term “Hellenic” can be given to the archaic vessels. The presence of Greek
                    inscriptions makes, however, a convenient starting-point.</p>
                <p>Probably the earliest known Greek ceramic inscription occurs on the Rhodian pinax
                    mentioned above (see fig. 24). The painting on this, though rudely executed in
                    brown and red ochres on a pale yellow slip-covered clay, the same in method as
                    the earlier non-Hellenic paintings, shows a marked artistic advance by the fact
                    that it represents a definite historical scene taken from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad.</hi> No incised lines are used except for the feathers of the heraldic
                    eagle on Hector’s shield. A large number of other pinaces were found at Camirus,
                    of the same date, but without inscriptions and with purely decorative paintings,
                    such as geometrical lotus-patterns, and spirited figures of bulls, sheep, and
                    other animals, or sphinxes and gorgons’ heads. Some large clay coffins, also
                    found at Camirus, and others at Clazomenae, belong to this class of
                    pottery.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Journal of Hellenic Studies,</hi> 1883.</p></note> One of those
                    from Camirus is in the British Museum. The top is decorated with painting in red
                    and brown ochre colours.</p>
                <p>At the head is a bull between two lions, and below them two curious helmeted
                    heads of warriors drawn in profile, both unfortunately much injured by
                    restoration. Other parts are decorated with figures of beasts on a ground
                    studded with rosettes and other small designs, in which some antiquaries see
                    varieties of solar symbols; but, whatever their original meaning may have been,
                    they appear on this pottery to be used merely as decoration. Other vases of a
                    very early period with figure-subjects and inscriptions, probably of the 7th and
                    βth centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> have been found at Corinth, such
                    as the “Dodwell pyxis,” now at Munich, on the lid of which is painted the scene
                    of the Calydonian boar hunted by various heroes in the presence of Agamemnon;
                    each figure has an inscribed name. At Corinth also curious votive tablets have
                    recently been found, some inscribed, with painted figures either of the god or
                    of the donor; one of these is shown in fig. 20. It is very early in date.</p>
                <p>The “Burgon amphora,” so called from its finder, now in the British Museum (see
                    fig. 25), is a very interesting specimen of this early class; it is one of the
                    prize amphorae which, filled with sacred olive oil, were given to the victors at
                    the games held during the Panathenaic festival. It was found at Athens, filled
                    with the ashes of its owner, and is no doubt the work of an Athenian potter. On
                    one side is the usual figure of Athene Promachos in black, except the goddess’s
                    flesh, which is white, and the inscription and touches on the dress, which are
                    in crimson. On the reverse side is the winner of the vase driving a biga,
                    apparently in the act of winning the race which gained him the prize. On the
                    neck of the vase is the owl sacred to Athene. The drawing of the figures is very
                    rude, probably dating from the 6th century B.c.</p>
                <p>The “François crater,” found at Chiusi, now in the Etruscan Museum in Florence,
                    is another important example of this early class. It is signed as the work of
                    the potter Ergotimus and the painter Clitias, and is painted with a long series
                    of subjects, all relating to the life and death of Achilles. It has no less than
                    115 explanatory inscriptions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the Paris Bibliothèque. It is painted in black and red on a creamwhite slip, and
                    represents Arcesilaus, one of the Cyrenian kings of this name, superintending
                    the weighing of a number of bags of the silphium plant. All the figures and even
                    the scales have their names painted by their side. It is executed with great
                    neatness and technical skill, but the drawing is stiff and awkward. The scene,
                    which is represented with great dramatic vigour, appears to be on board a ship,
                    judging from the complicated cordage overhead and the yard-arm from which the
                    large balance is suspended.</p>
                <p>It is at present impossible to fix with any certainty the dates of this early
                    Hellenic pottery, as is also the case with the still older pottery of Rhodes and
                    Mycenae, but the increase of our knowledge on the subject tends to give a much
                    more remote period to its production than has been hitherto assigned to it by
                    the majority of writers on the subject. The foregoing class of pottery forms a
                    link, with various stages of development, from the glossless vases painted in
                    dull ochre browns and reds to that large and important class of Greek pottery
                    which has figures painted in glossy black enamel, on a red, slightly glazed,
                    clay ground, or less frequently on a cream-white ground. The vases of this
                    class, found in large quantities over a wide area in Greece, Italy, and Sicily,
                    include paintings of the most different kinds, from the rudest almost shapeless
                    daubs to the most carefully-executed pictures, drawn with great beauty of
                    composition and firm accuracy of form, though always retaining some amount of
                    archaic stiffness and conventionalism. Though the faces are nearly always
                    represented in profile, the eyes are shown front-wise, a method of treatment
                    which continued in use even on the earlier vases of the next period, those with
                    red figures on a black ground. Fig. 26 shows the progressive treatment of the
                    human eye by vase-painters, from the earliest introduction of figures down to
                    the end of the 4th century B.c.</p>
                <p>Many of the floral ornaments of this period still retain clear signs of their
                    Oriental origin. The sacred tree of Assyria, in an elaborate and highly
                    conventionalized form, very frequently occurs, or, worked into a running
                    pattern, it forms a continuous band of decoration, out of which the Greek
                    so-called “honeysuckle pattern” seems to have been developed. These vases have
                    far greater variety and richness in their decorative patterns than those with
                    the black ground, the natural result of the great ease and freedom of hand with
                    which delicate floral designs could be touched in with the brush in black, while
                    in the later manner the red patterns had to be laboriously left out by working
                    the black ground all round them. Hence the stiffness and poverty of invention
                    which are so remarkable in the decorative patterns on the vases of the “best
                    period.” Many of the black figures of men and animals are executed with
                    extraordinary minuteness, owing largely to the engraved gem-like treatment with
                    which the incised lines are applied, especially in the representation of the
                    hair of men or animals, and also in the rich textile patterns with which the
                    draperies are often covered. Some of the vases, judging from their general form
                    and thin band-like handles, were evidently copied from metal vessels, as, for
                    example, a number of small amphorae found in various places, executed in the
                    workshop of Nicosthenes, a rather inartistic potter, who appears to have turned
                    out a large number of vases with little or no variety in shape or ornament.</p>
                <p>The later vases, with black figures, were produced simultaneously with the
                    earlier ones decorated with red figures; and during this transitional period
                    (about the middle of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) some
                    vase-painters worked in both styles, both kinds of painting sometimes occurring
                    even on the same vase. The British Museum possesses one of the finest specimens
                    of these, a large amphora with nobly-designed paintings. On one side are two
                    seated figures of Greek warriors, probably Ajax and Achilles, playing at a game
                    like draughts. They are painted in black with chocolate-red touches, and minute
                    details, such as the drapery over their armour and their wavy hair, executed in
                    incised lines of extreme fineness and gem-like treatment. The other side of the
                    vase has <hi rend="italic">red</hi> figures on a <hi rend="italic">black</hi>
                    ground, a most powerfully drawn group of Heracles strangling the Nemaean lion in
                    the presence of Iolaus, and an archaic statue-like figure of Athene. As in the
                    painting with black figures, some touches of red are used. The treatment of
                    Heracles’s hair is peculiar and again recalls gem-engraver’s work, in which hair
                    is represented by a series of drilled holes; in this painting the stiff curls
                    are given by a number of round dots of the black enamel, applied in considerable
                    body so as to stand out in relief. This treatment frequently occurs on the fine
                    vases of this and later periods, and the same method is occasionally used in a
                    very effective way to represent bunches of grapes and the like.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vases with Black Ground and Red Figures.—</hi> After about the
                    middle of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> this method superseded
                    that with the black figures, and to this class belong the finest vases of all.
                    The drawing of the earlier specimens is strongly sculpturesque in style,
                    sometimes recalling the noble though slightly archaic pediment figures from
                    Aegina, while the vase-paintings of a few years later seem to belong to the
                    Phidian school; the forms are noble and massive, treated with great breadth and
                    simplicity, and kept strictly to one plane; faces are nearly always drawm in
                    profile, and all violent foreshortening of limbs is avoided. Some
                    vase-painters-of this period (c. 450-400) retain a slight touch of Oriental
                    feeling in their drawing, as, for instance, the beautiful amphora by Euxitheus
                    in the British Museum, which has single figures of Achilles and Briseis, one on
                    each side (see fig. 27).</p>

                <p>It should be remarked that the style of vase-paintings is generally rather
                    archaic as compared with other branches of contemporary art, as was the case
                    with their inscriptions, and a certain conventionalism of treatment, such as
                    would not be found in sculpture, lingers till quite the end of the 5th century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Fig. 28 shows a painting from the inside of a
                    cylix, remarkable for the severe beauty and simple grace of its drawing and
                    composition. The scene represents the moment when Peleus has won Thetis for his
                    bride, and is leading her away in triumph, gently overcoming her modest
                    reluctance; her shrinking and yet yielding attitude is drawn in the most refined
                    and masterly manner possible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The same design, though with inferior execution, is repeated

                <p>In the succeeding centurv both d rawin σ and eomn∩sit,i∩n began to gain in
                    softness and grace, while losing something of their old vigour. Vase-paintings
                    become more pictorial, and the compositions more elaborate and crowded; the
                    British Museum has an amphora from Camirus (Rhodes), one of the most beautiful
                    of this later class, elaborately decorated on one side with various coloured
                    pigments and gold applied over the finished black and red figures. As in the
                    earlier cylix of fig. 28 the scene represents the final triumph of Peleus in his
                    pursuit of Thetis; in order to fill up the space some of the figures are placed,
                    as it were, in the air, a method of composition peculiar to the later
                    vase-paintings. Though not highly finished in details, such as the hands and
                    feet, this picture is a perfect marvel of skilful touches rapidly applied, and
                    of extreme beauty of form and general composition (see Plate V.). The funeral
                    lecythi from tombs in the neighbourhood of Athens are a remarkable class of
                    vases, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 350-300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (see
                    fig. 29). On these, over a white ground, are painted scenes representing
                    mourners visiting sepulchral stelae with offerings in their hands. They are
                    drawn carelessly, but with great skill, in red outline and then coarsely filled
                    in with colours. Some of the seated females are designed with wonderful grace
                    and pathos, the whole pose full of a tender longing for the departed one.
                    Besides the funeral lecythi a few pieces of pottery have been found, dating from
                    about the same period, which have paintings executed on a ground of white slip.
                    Some of them are of most extraordinary beauty; perhaps the finest of all is a
                    cylix from a Rhodian tomb, now in the British Museum, on the inside of which is
                    a drawing, chiefly in outline, representing Aphrodite seated on the back of a
                    flying swan. For delicacy of touch and re fined beauty of drawing this painting
                    is quite unrivalled. The exquisite loveliness of Aphrodite’s head and the pure
                    grace of her profile, touched in with simple brush-formed lines, are quite
                    indescribable, and show a combination of mechanical skill united to imaginative
                    power and realization of the most perfect and ideal beauty such as no people but
                    the Greeks can ever have so completely possessed (see Plate V.).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vases of the Decadence.—</hi> The vases of this class are often
                    of enormous size, covered with very numerous figures, often possessing much
                    graceful beauty in form, but very inferior in execution and purity of drawing to
                    the earlier paintings. The figures, especially in the later specimens, are
                    thoroughly pictorial in treatment; many of them are painted in creamwhite, with
                    shaded modelling in yellows and browns. Effects of perspective are introduced in
                    some of the architectural features, particularly in the bands of rich floral
                    scroll-work. In the 2d century, till about 100 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    when painted vases ceased to be made, the paintings became extremely coarse and
                    devoid of any merit whatever, though even at this time moulded vases, either
                    decorated with reliefs all over or with small inserted emblemata, continued to
                    be made of great artistic beauty. The extreme degradation to which vase-painting
                    of this period fell seems to be due not so much to the general decay of the <pb

                    vases were no longer made by able artists, but were turned out in large
                    quantities from the hands of an uneducated class of artisans. This was probably
                    partly owing to increasing wealth and love of display, which created a demand
                    for gold and silver plate rather than for the cheaper but more artistic beauty
                    of painted clay.The dates of Greek vases are difficult to fix, partly from a
                    natural tendency to archaism, which varies with the productions of different
                    places, and partly because in some cases there was an artificial reproduction of
                    old styles and methods. The following chronological classification, which is
                    commonly accepted, is only very roughly correct, and is not applicable in all
                    instances: (1) black figures on red ground, about 8th century to 440 B.c.; (2)
                    red figures on black ground, of the best period, c. 440-300 B.C.; (3) period of

                    vases with polychromatic paintings of good style, were made towards the end of

                    frequently have paintings of wonderful delicacy and beauty; the later Athenian
                    lecythi are remarkable for their polychromatic decoration. The uses of the
                    painted vases is a very difficult question; few show any signs of wear, though
                    they are made of soft clay easily scratched, and most of those which are
                    represented in use on vase-pictures are plain black without any paintings. A
                    beautiful little pyxis, or perfume-box, in the British Museum, shows in its
                    pictured scene of a lady’s toilet several painted vases, which are set about the
                    room as ornaments, and nave flowers or olive-branches in them (see fig. 31).
                    Many vasesare blank on one side, or have on the reverse side a painting of
                    inferior execution, apparently because they remained set against a wall or in a
                    niche. Nearly all those now existing came from tombs, and it is probable that
                    the ornamental vases were selected for sepulchral purposes, while a plainer and
                    less decorated class was employed for actual domestic use.</p>

                    accurately determined. A number found at Benghazi and Teuchira in the Cyrenaica
                    are now in the British Museum and the Louvre. Some of the archons’ names on them
                    are these—Nicocrates (333 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), Nicetes (332 B.C.),
                    Euthy-critus (328 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), Cephisodorus (323 <hi

                    Theophrastus (313 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). The figure of Athene on all
                    of them is rudely painted in pseudo-archaic style—the figure in black and white,
                    with incised lines, on a red ground; the other side is painted in the same way,
                    but is not archaic in drawing. Long vowels occur in the archons’ names, but
                    sometimes the same amphora has the obverse inscription written in the old way.
                    They are all poor as works of art. One in the British Museum is of special
                    interest from the design painted in white on Athene’s shield. This is the
                    celebrated sculptured group of Harmodius and Aristogiton by Critias and
                    Nesiotes, of which an ancient copy exists in the Naples Museum, though the

                    and, with so wide a range, any classification is necessarily imperfect. The
                    following list includes the majority of subjects. (1) Stories of the gods,
                    scenes such as the Gigantomachia or the birth of Athene. (2) Scenes from the
                    heroic age, as the achievements of Theseus and Heracles, the wars of Thebes, the
                    battles with the Amazons, the voyage of the Argonauts, the Trojan War, the
                    return of the Greeks from Troy, and the like. (3) Dionysiae subjects, such as
                    orgies of Dionysus and dances of satyrs. (4) Scenes from real life, such as the
                    vintage, olive-gathering, marriages, feasts, dancing, hunting, sacrifices, and
                    theatrical subjects. (5) Funeral subjects, as mourners bewailing the dead or
                    bringing offerings to a tomb. (6) Scenes from the gymnasium and various athletic
                    exercises. (7) Allegorical subjects, with figures of happiness, wealth, youth,
                    and the like. (8) Historical subjects, which, however, are rare: a very fine
                    vase in the Louvre, of the best period, has Croesus on his funeral pyre; the
                    cylix of Arcesilaus has been mentioned above; Anacreon playing on his lyre, and
                    followed by his pet dog, occurs on several fine vases; the meeting of Sappho and
                    Alcaeus is also represented; other portrait - figures appear, chiefly of poets
                    and philosophers, many with inscribed names which are now unknown. (9) Humorous
                    subjects: these are common on the vases of the latest period and are usually
                    very coarsely painted; caricatures of mythological subjects frequently occur in
                    which the gods are represented as dwarfs or hunchbacks.<note anchored="true"

                    years most were discovered in the tombs of Magna Graecia, Sicily, and Etruria.
                    Capua, Nola, and Vulci supplied a very large quantity of vases of the finest
                    sort with the most rich and brilliant enamel. Special characteristics of style
                    and technique can be traced in the production of special localities, but these
                    differences are not very important. Of late years Attica, the isthmus of
                    Corinth, and other places on Hellenic soil have yielded a great many fine vases;
                    the islands of the Aegean Sea and the western shores of Asia Minor are rich in
                    sepulchral stores of these and all branches of Greek art. Athens possesses a
                    fine and rapidly-increasing collection chiefly from Attica. The British Museum
                    collection is on the whole the finest for Greek vases of all periods, though it
                    is very poor in Etruscan pottery. The other chief collections of Europe are in
                    the Louvre, at Naples, in the Vatican, at Florence, and Turin; Munich, Vienna,
                    Berlin, and St Petersburg also have very fine collections; and there is a small

                    slightly ornamented with ridges of clay modelled in relief. One curious variety

                    remarkable that the Etruscan race, though so extraordinarily skilful in most of
                    the handicrafts, did not excel at any period in their pottery. They were
                    especially famed for their skill in metal-work, and hence perhaps this largest
                    and most numerous class of their fictile ware is mostly shaped after metal forms
                    and decorated with designs not specially suited to clay. The clay of which this
                    black ware is composed consists (taking the average of many analyses) of the
                    following ingredients,—silica 63, alumina 15, peroxide of iron 8, lime 3∣,
                    magnesia 2, and carbon 2. It is hard and metallic in appearance, generally of a
                    glossy black, but sometimes grey. Its black is partly due to the superficial
                    presence of free carbon, showing that the vases were fired in a close kiln,
                    under the direct contact of the carbonaceous smoke from the fuel, a process
                    called in modern times “the smother kiln.” If heated to a bright red in an open
                    fire the ware loses its black colour and becomes greyish white or brown. Its
                    forms and the figures stamped in blunt relief all suggest that they were copied
                    from metal originals, a supposition strongly borne out by the fact that many of
                    them are completely covered with gold or silver leaf (see fig.</p>
                <p>33). The reliefs upon them consist of lions and other animals, sphinxes,
                    chimaerae, human figures, or geometrical patterns, all coarsely executed, and
                    very blunt in their forms, nartlv from want of sharpness in the moulds they are
                    stamped from, and partly through the shrinkage of the clay in the kiln. Some of
                    the shapes are graceful, especially those undecorated by reliefs (see fig. 34).
                    Others are very fanciful, worked into forms most unsuited for clay, such as
                    “situlae” or buckets, with movable ring handles; incense cups supported on thin
                    bands of clay stamped with reliefs; and jugs shaped like hollow rings. A few
                    have their shapes copied from Greek vases, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a number
                    of small amphorae of exactly the same form as those made by the Greek potter
                    Nicosthenes. A common form of Etruscan vase has a lid shaped like a human head,
                    copied apparently from Egyptian Canopic vases. Some have human arms rudely
                    modelled in clay and fastened on by pegs. Besides the black vases of this form,
                    there exist many made of red clay covered with yellow slip.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Etruscan Painted Vases.—</hi> A number of very strange large
                    covered jars have been found at Caere (see fig. 35), more than 3 feet high, and
                    rudely painted in dull colours (black, red, and white) with large figures of
                    animals,—lions, wolves, horses, various birds, and some almost shapeless figures
                    of men. There is considerable spirit in the drawing of the animals, as is often
                    the case even when there was no power to delineate human beings. The finest of
                    these vases are in the Louvre and at Orvieto. Some have only geometrical
                    patterns,—bands of simple leaf-ornament, platbands, or chequers.</p>
                <p>Others are shaped like large round boxes on a foot, with lids, nearly 2 feet
                    high. One of those in the Louvre, of red clay blackened by smoke, has a very
                    curious drawing in white pigment, coarsely executed. It represents a
                    merchant-ship under full sail being attacked by a war-ship impelled only by
                    oars; the latter is crowded with soldiers bearing round shields, each with an
                    heraldic device. The other vessel has only one combatant, a bowman, who, mounted
                    on the yard-arm, discharges an atrow at the enemy. This appears to be a pirate
                    scene, and, though very rudely painted, it is not without strong dramatic
                    force.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A similar vase is

                    —These are mostly large pithi (see fig. 36) about 3 feet high, or thick pinaces
                    (platters) 1 to 2 feet across. Some are of dull red clay, covered with bright
                    red slip; others are yellow. The clay is coarse, mixed with crushed granite,
                    sand, or pounded pottery, to which the coating of fine clayslip gives a smooth
                    surface. Their chief peculiarity consists in the bands of figures in relief with
                    which they are decorated, and which were impressed on the soft clay by rolling
                    along it wheels about 1 inch thick and 7 or 8 inches in circumference. Incuse
                    figures were cut on the edges <pb break="no"

                    printed (like seals) rows of figures, and they were of course repeated every 7
                    or 8 inches, according to the size of the wheels. These stamped reliefs, mostly
                    about an inch high, represent processions of animals,—lions, leopards, boars,
                    ibexes, deer, horses, or griffins. Some have human figures, horsemen fighting
                    with chimaerae. One in the Louvre has a curious hunting-scene, a man, with two
                    dogs, throwing short knobbed sticks to drive hares into a net. The bands are
                    arranged, singly or double, round the rims of the pinaces and the shoulders of
                    the pithi; the latter are also ornamented with rude fluting or “reeding” below
                    the bands, or have occasionally reliefs,</p>
                <p>2 to 3 inches square, stamped at intervals all round them instead of the
                    continuous lines of figures.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Later Vases until Imitations of Greek Paintings.—</hi> These
                    are mostly copies of Greek forms, but very inferior, both in drawing and
                    technical execution, to the real Greek vases, the black enamel especially being
                    thin, and hard in texture. In appearance they resemble Greek vases of various
                    periods, but are distinguishable by having paintings that are not Hellenic in
                    subject or treatment, or by their Etruscan inscriptions. An amphora, now in the
                    British Museum (see fig. 37), of early style, with black figures and incised
                    lines, has a painting of a scene which belongs specially to Latin mythology,
                    viz., the contest at Pylus between Hercules and Juno Sospita; Minerva stands
                    behind Hercules and Poseidon behind Juno. On each side of Juno is a caldron full
                    of snakes, probably an allusion to the sacred serpent which was kept in the
                    grove of Juno at Lanuvium. Another amphora in the Paris Bibliothèque has a
                    painting of the scene where Admetus takes leave of Alcestis before her descent
                    to Hades (see fig. 38). Two hideous demons are depicted, waiting to seize their
                    prey: one, Charun, with winged feet, brandishes a massive hammer; the other,
                    Mantus, with great white wings, holds a serpent in each hand; both have a
                    fiendish aspect, with grinning teeth, like the devils in mediaeval pictures of
                    hell, and thoroughly unGreek in spirit. This vase is in the style of the

                    and about 1 inch thick. The upper part sometimes has a moulded cornice and a
                    painted frieze with geometrical ornament. The lower part is covered with
                    chequered squares or some other simple pattern. On the intermediate space are
                    painted pictures with figures, about 2 feet high, representing sacrificial
                    scenes, religious processions, and other subjects. The drawing shows Greek
                    influence, but the costumes are Etruscan. The pigments are mostly simple
                    earth-colours, red, brown, and yellow ochres, with black, white, and bluish
                    grey; but bright greens and blues also occur, the latter made from oxides of
                    copper, like the smalto on the Attic lecythi. The colours are all applied quite
                    flatly; the female flesh is white, the male red; and the whole painting is
                    emphasized by strong black outlines. The costumes are interesting; many of the
                    garments fit tightly to the body, and the men mostly wear a peculiar sort of
                    high boot turned up at the tip. It is doubtful whether they are executed in true
                    ceramic colours fired in the kiln. They may possibly be only tempera paintings,
                    like those on the tuff-walls of some of the excavated tombs. The great size of
                    the well-baked clay slabs on which they are painted shows that the Etruscans
                    must have constructed pottery-kilns of considerable dimensions.<note

                <p>Some specimens of very peculiar glazed pottery have been found at Gyrene, Cyme,
                    Pergamum, Smyrna, Tarsus, and other Roman colonies in Asia Minor. It is very
                    delicate and often graceful in shape (see fig. 39), with very thin handles,
                    fashioned more like glass than pottery. It is remarkable for being covered with
                    a thick vitreous glaze, usually coloured either green, orange, or purple-brown,
                    with oxide of copper, antimoniate of lead, or manganese, quite unlike the thin
                    almost imperceptible glaze of Greek vases. This pottery is mostly small; some
                    pieces are in the shapes of oenochoae, two-handed cups, or asci, the latter
                    covered with graceful patterns of vines or other plants moulded in slight
                    relief. Statuettes and delicate reliefs, parti-coloured with different glazes or
                    enamels, have been found at several of the above places, and also larger
                    vessels, craters, and bottle-shaped vases, decorated with moulded clay
                    emblemata, wholly covered with a fine blue glaze. The Louvre and the British
                    Museum have the best specimens of this rare ware, which probably dates from the
                    1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> downwards.</p>
                <p>“Samian” ware, the characteristics of which are described below, was made in
                    Italy during the first period of Graeco-Roman art. In 1883 some moulds for cups
                    and bowls were found at Arezzo, all of the most wonderful beauty and gem-like
                    delicacy of execution. The figures on them are from about 3 to 4 inches high,
                    but are large and sculpturesque in their breadth of treatment. Some of the
                    exquisite reliefs represent dancing fauns and bacchanals, with flowing drapery,
                    on a background enriched with vine plants in slight relief. Another has a love
                    scene of extraordinary grace and refined beauty. The modelling of the nude
                    throughout is most masterly. The treatment of these reliefs recalls the school
                    of Praxiteles, though they are probably not earlier than the 1st or 2d century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><hi rend="italic">Roman Pottery, 1st
                    Century</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><hi rend="italic">to 5th
                    Century</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">—</hi> Throughout
                    Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Britain, and other countries occupied by the
                    Romans great quantities of pottery have been found, varying but little in design
                    or manner of execution. The principal varieties of this large and widely-spread
                    species of ware may be classified thus—(1) Samian ware; (2) plain biscuit clay;
                    (3) pottery decorated with slip in relief; (4) black ware; (5) glazed ware.</p>
                <p>1. The first class is a fine glossy red ware called “Samian” from its resemblance
                    to the red pottery produced in the Greek island of Samos. The name is a
                    convenient one, and as it is used by Pliny (7Z. <hi rend="italic">N.,</hi> xxxv.
                    46) and other early writers it is well not to discard it, though probably the
                    real Greek Samian pottery bore little resemblance to that made by the Romans
                    except in colour and glossy surface. It is of a fine red sealing-wax-like
                    colour, of pleasant texture, and is generally decorated with moulded reliefs.
                    <hi rend="italic">Materials</hi>: the clay body usually consists of silica 50-64
                    parts, alumina 18-25, red oxide of iron 7-10, and lime 2-9 parts; these
                    proportions vary in different specimens. The red vitreous glaze, or rather
                    enamel, which gives the ware its fine glossy surface consists of silica 64
                    parts, soda 20, and red oxide of iron 11 (average analysis). <hi rend="italic"
                    >Method of manufacture</hi>: the bowls, cups, and other vessels, richly
                    decorated outside with reliefs, were made thus. In the case of a bowl, a mould
                    was first prepared, of hard well-burned clay, covered <hi rend="italic"
                    >inside</hi> with incuse designs; these sunk patterns were made either by
                    hand-modelling or, more usually, with the aid of stamps modelled in relief. Thus
                    the <hi rend="italic">inside</hi> of the bowl-mould corresponded to the <hi
                    rend="italic">outside</hi> of the future Samian bowl, which was first turned on
                    the wheel quite plain, but of the right size to fit into the mould. Then, while
                    it was still soft it was pressed into the mould, and afterwards both were put
                    upon the wheel together. As the wheel revolved, the potter could at the same
                    time press the clay into the sunk ornaments of the mould and finish neatly the
                    inside of the vessel. In some cases he raised the walls of the bowl high above
                    the mould by adding clay, and thus with the same mould could produce a variety
                    of forms, though the lower or decorated portion always remained the same. A fine
                    crater in the Louvre was made in this way. The vessel was then removed from the
                    mould and the reliefs touched up by hand (in the finer specimens) with bone or
                    wooden modellingtools. The reliefs thus produced are often very graceful in
                    design, but are mostly wanting in sharpness, many being blunted by the touch of
                    the potter’s fingers in handling the pot after it was removed from the
                    mould.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In some rare
                    cases the reliefs were moulded separately and then applied to the plain
                    wheel-turned vessel while yet soft, but this was exceptional.</p></note> It was
                    next covered with the materials for the red enamel, very finely ground and fired
                    in the usual way. Fig. 40 shows a design of typical character. The outer reliefs
                    consist generally of graceful flowing scroll-work of vines, ivy, or other
                    ornaments, mixed occasionally with human figures and animals. The finest sorts
                    of Samian ware were made at Arezzo (Aretium) in Italy<note anchored="true"

                    Germany, and the discovery of a Samian bowl-mould at York makes it appear
                    probable that it was made in Britain,where great quantities of it have been
                    found. This ware is of great beauty, both in colour and in its delicate surface
                    reliefs; it is the most artistic sort of pottery that the Romans produced. It
                    appears to have been highly valued, as many Samian bowls have been found
                    carefully mended with bronze or lead rivets. In addition to the moulded ware
                    many vessels of the same class were made plain from the wheel; others have a
                    peculiar scale ornament in relief applied by the potter’s thumb, a form of
                    decoration common in other varieties of Roman pottery.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Plain Biscuit Pottery</hi> is made of simple unglazed clay,
                    without decoration, of a soft body and quite porous. The clay is mostly composed
                    thus: silica 48-69 per cent., alumina 10-22, oxide of iron 8-13, lime 1⅜-18 per
                    cent., but it, of course, varies according to the locality where the pottery was
                    made. Fig. 41 shows some of the forms of this simple ware. It was specially used
                    for amphorae, often nearly 2 feet high, sepulchral urns, and vessels for common
                    domestic use. The forms are mostly graceful and natural. The clay is of many
                    colours, including all shades of red, grey, brown, yellow, and (rarely) almost
                    pure white. Some of this pottery has the grain which had been produced by the
                    wheel carefully smoothed out by a tool or the potter’s hand, or in some cases by
                    dipping the piece into a bath of thin fluid slip, but it is more commonly left
                    without any attempt at smoothness or high finish.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Pottery with Reliefs applied in Slip.—</hi> This is a very
                    remarkable kind of decoration, in which great skill was shown by the Roman
                    potters. The slip, finely-ground clay, was mixed with water to about the
                    consistency of very thick cream, and was allowed to run slowly or drop off a
                    wooden point or flat spatula upon the outside of ordinary wheel-made pottery.
                    Very spirited figures of animals (see fig. 42)—hares pursued by dogs, lions,
                    goats, horses, deer, or even complicated subjects with human figures such as
                    gladiators’ combats—and a great variety of graceful scroll-ornaments of vine,
                    ivy, or convolvulus were produced in this -way with wonderful ingenuity. Both
                    the outline and the modelling were given with curious precision by the quantity
                    of semi-fluid slip which was allowed to flow off the tool. The body, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> of a dog would be poured off a sort of small
                    palette-knife, and its thinner legs formed by trailing along a point dipped in
                    the slip. Tools for this purpose have been found near Roman kilns. One of the
                    most elaborate specimens of this kind of pottery is a cup in the Colchester
                    Museum, covered with reliefs of chariot-races and gladiators’ combats, done with
                    great vigour and even minuteness of detail considering the difficulties of the
                    process. In some cases, especially when the designs are simple scroll or
                    geometrical ornaments, additional effect is produced by the use of a slip
                    coloured differently from the body of the pot. Frequently the relief-patterns
                    are white, made of pipeclay, applied to a red or dark coloured vessel. The
                    vessels with this class of decoration are mostly small bowls, cups, or
                    bottle-like vases. Some few are made of the Samian ware, but more commonly they
                    are grey or blackish with body and slip both of the same clay. A great deal of
                    coarse Roman pottery is rudely decorated with a thin slip of red, white, or
                    yellow clay, put on with a brush in coarse bands or scroll-patterns. The slip in
                    this case is treated as a pigment of the simplest kind, and does not stand out
                    in relief. With this trifling exception, nothing in the form of painted vases
                    was produced by the potters of Roman times.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Black Pottery</hi> is usually made from a very silicious or
                    sandy clay, composed thus—(average of several analyses) silica 76 parts, alumina
                    10, oxide of iron 9, lime 2. It owes its black colour and rather metallic gloss
                    to the direct contact of smoke in a close or smother kiln. If heated in an open
                    fire it burns out usually to a greyish white. A great deal of this ware belongs
                    also to class 3, as it is frequently decorated with simple patterns in white
                    slip; the presence of the white clay on the black body implies a second firing,
                    free from the contact of smoke, and not high enough in temperature to burn the
                    black out of the body of the pot. This ware was largely made at many places in
                    Germany along the Rhine, in France, and especially at Castor in
                    Northamptonshire, where remains of many Roman kilns have been found. It varies
                    very much in shape and in method of decoration. Some of the numerous specimens
                    from Bonn and Rheinzabern are treated in a manner different from the British
                    varieties. A few are coated with a black similar to that used by the Greeks, but
                    very thin and poor in quality. Others have a mechanical polish applied after
                    firing, whilst the pot ·was again set on the wheel, by rubbing it with black
                    lead, occasionally applied in bands of alternately dull and bright black all
                    round the pot. A fine specimen from Coblentz, now in the Sèvres Museum, has a
                    curious combination of stamped work and reliefs formed in fluid slip. The design
                    represents a lion running through vine-branches. The body of the lion and the
                    grapes are stamped from a mould, the rest being done in slip. Cups and small
                    jars of this ware are frequently modelled into strange shapes by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n642/mode/1up"

                    potter’s fingers while they were fresh from the wheel. Others are decorated with
                    groups of dots, made of semi-fluid slip, apparently applied through a pierced
                    stencil-plate (see fig. 43). The dots are arranged in close rows, forming
                    rectangular patches, arranged round the body of the vessel,—a very dull kind of
                    ornament, which may, however, have had a practical use in making the pottery
                    less liable to slip from the holder’s fingers.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Glazed Pottery.—</hi> This is rare, but has been found in
                    most of the countries once occupied by the Bomans. Some of the best specimens
                    resemble that described above as Graeco-Roman glazed ware. Most are, however,
                    very inferior, both in execution and in the quality of the glaze, which is a
                    true glass, usually coloured light green or brownish yellow. A cake of
                    semi-fused greenish glass, apparently intended for this purpose, was found in
                    the ruins of a kiln in Britain. This glazed pottery is small, and is decorated
                    in various ways, by incised lines, or groups of dots in relief, or by
                    brush-applied stripes of red or white clay.</p>
                <p>In addition to the forms of Roman domestic pottery shown in the above figures one
                    peculiar shape occurs very frequently, namely, the “mortarium,” a large shallow
                    dish, made of thick clay, with a spout at one side, used for triturating cooked
                    vegetables or other soft substances. The inside of these mortar-like dishes is
                    often roughened by being sprinkled, while in a soft state, with crushed quartz
                    or pottery, apparently to aid the process of pounding. They are made of various
                    kinds of ware, especially red Samian and yellow biscuit clay.</p>
                <p>Clay lamps were very largely used by the Romans, mostly made of plain biscuit
                    clay, but the finest specimens are in the red Samian ware. A few have been found
                    with a thick vitreous glaze, coloured like the rest of the Roman glazed wares
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lamp,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 247).</p>
                <p>An extensive use of baked clay was made by the Romans in the manufacture of
                    bricks, roofing-tiles, flue-tiles, drain-pipes, baths, and even coffins. The
                    bricks are generally very large and thin, some 15 to 18 inches long, and only 1⅜
                    inches thick, and walls were entirely built of them. They were also used to form
                    alternating bands in stone walls, the brick bands usually consisting of from
                    three to five courses. In Rome bricks were merely used as a facing to concrete
                    walls. They are always triangular in shape, except such as were set at the
                    angles of walls and used as facing to arches. Those used for the latter purpose
                    are generally two Roman feet square (about 1 foot 11⅜ inches English). See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rome.</hi> The system of heating employed by the Romans in
                    their houses and baths was very ingenious and complete. Sometimes the whole
                    walls of a room were lined with clay flue-pipes, square in section, which, being
                    connected at the bottom with the hypocaust, carried the hot air over the whole
                    wall-surface as well as under the floor (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bath),</hi>
                    the mosaic and concrete area of which (the “suspensura ”) was supported on large
                    clay slabs carried on short brick pillars. Flanged tiles, similar to those used
                    for roofing, were often built up on edge, with others set across the top, to
                    form graves, and to protect the sepulchral urns and other buried objects from
                    being crushed by the weight of earth upon them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roman Pottery-kilns. —</hi> Great numbers of Roman kilns have
                    been found in various countries, but none quite perfect. They are small, round,
                    or Oval structures of brick, with a place for the fuel at one side, and a floor
                    made of pierced slabs of clay, on which the pots were piled, the flames and hot
                    air passing through the holes in the clay floor. Most kilns were probably
                    covered by a brick dome with a central opening, exactly the same in principle as
                    the early Corinthian kiln shown in fig. 3. The smother kilns may, however, have
                    been arranged rather differently, so as to fire the pots in an atmosphere of
                    heated smoke; or this may have been done by partly closing the aperture at the
                    top, in order to half smother the fire, and prevent its burning with a hot clear
                    flame. Fig. 44 shows the remains of one of the Castor kilns, about 7 feet in
                    diameter, with an arched opening for the insertion of the fuel, and a pierced
                    floor, made of large clay slabs radiating to a central point, where they were
                    supported by a brick pillar. Other kilns have been found in the Upchurch marshes
                    (Kent), along the Severn banks in Shropshire, at Ashdon (Essex), Colchester,
                    London, York, and many other Romano-British towns. Though varying in shape, yet
                    in general principle Roman kilns, in whatever country they are found, are
                    practically the same.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inscriptions on Roman Pottery.—</hi> Potters’ names, impressed
                    from oblong or circular incuse stamps, occur very frequently on many varieties
                    of Roman pottery, especially on the plain biscuit and</p>
                <p>Samian wares. Teutonic and Gaulish names sometimes appear, showing that in
                    certain cases native potters worked at the Roman potteries. When the potter’s
                    name is in the nominative, it is followed by F. or FECIT; if in the genitive, by
                    MANV or OFFICINA, usually in some contracted form. In addition to the potter’s
                    name those of the owner of the workshop and of the estate from which the clay
                    came occasionally occur, as, for example, OP(US) DOL(IARE) L. IVLI THEOD(OTI)
                    E(QVITIS) R(OMANI) FIG(LINAE) SAL(ARIAE) EX PR(AEDIS) FL(AVII) TITIANI C. V.
                    (clarissimi viri), “Pot-work from the salariai! manufactory belonging to L.
                    Julius Theodotus, a Roman knight, (the clay taken) from the estate of Flavius
                    Titianus, a most distinguished person,” this last being a title used like the
                    English “esquire.” This brick stamp is from a house built against the ancient
                    wall round the Capitoline hill, and dates from the middle of the 2d century A.n.
                    Few brick stamps found in Rome are older than the end of the 1st century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.i&gt;.</hi>; but some have been found at Yelia in Cisalpine

                    Others have also the name of the ruling emperor. Roman soldiers were often
                    employed to make bricks and tiles; and many such are stamped with the mark or
                    number of a Roman legion, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> LEG. VI. for “legio
                    sexta.” Amphorae were occasionally inscribed, in rudely-painted ochre colours,
                    with words to indicate the quality of wine they contained or their measure of
                    capacity, but such inscriptions were probably added when the amphorae were in
                    their owner’s cellar, and were simply painted in tempera. Numbers of large
                    amphorae were frequently embedded in the concrete of which Roman vaults were
                    made, especially during the 3d and 4th centuries A. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    strength. The circus of Maxentius and the mausoleum of the empress Helena, both
                    outside the walls of Rome, are examples of this curious use of pottery.</p>

                    which were the work of Moslem races. In all this pottery, with the exception of
                    that included under the head “Hispano-Moorish” (see p. 622), there is a great
                    similarity in character of design and in methods of execution, both of which
                    appear to a great extent to have been originated and brought to highest

                <p><hi rend="italic">Materials used by Persian Potters.—</hi> In most cases the clay
                    body of Persian pottery is completely covered either with a white enamel or with
                    slip, and therefore any sort of clay sufficiently plastic for the wheel suited
                    the purpose, whatever its colour. The enamel was much the same as that used by
                    the ancient Assyrians, except that it contained a much larger proportion of
                    oxide of lead, of which there were often three parts to one of oxide of tin and
                    five of silicate of soda. The white slip is silicate of alumina with some
                    alkali. The glaze is either a pure silicate of soda, or has in addition a little
                    oxide of lead to increase its fusibility. The pigments are oxides of cobalt and
                    copper for the blues and greens, manganese for the purples, oxides of copper and
                    iron for the reds, magnetic oxide of iron for the black, and antimony for the
                    yellow; a rich warm orange was produced by a mixture of antimony and red oxide
                    of iron. It is not always possible without actual analysis to tell whether the
                    white ground of Persian pottery is a tin enamel or a glazed slip, especially as
                    in many cases a glaze is applied <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the enamel; but
                    this is not a point of great importance, as the decorative treatment of the
                    white ground was in either case much the same.</p>
                <p>The following are the chief varieties of Persian pottery.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Lustred Ware.—</hi> The application of lustre colours
                    requires a special process of firing. The following description applies equally
                    to the other two classes of pottery in which lustre pigments were largely used,
                    namely, Hispano-Moorish and Italian majolica. The special beauty of the lustre
                    depends on the decomposition of a metallic salt, usually silver or copper; the
                    required design was painted in a pigment composed mainly of this salt over the
                    surface of the smooth enamel or glaze <hi rend="italic">after</hi> it had been
                    fired. The vessel with the lustre pigments was then fired again in a kiln
                    specially so arranged that the heated gases and smoke should come into contact
                    with the metallic pigments; the minute and heated particles of carbon in the
                    smoke combined with the oxygen of the salt, setting free the metal, which was
                    left, in a finely-divided state, fixed on the surface of the enamel. In this way
                    a beautiful prismatic effect was produced like the colours of mother-of-pearl.
                    The lustre colours when looked at from one point of view are simply various
                    shades of browns and yellows, but when seen at an angle they appear shot with
                    the most brilliant violets, blues, purples, and red. They were used generally,
                    and with best effect, over a white ground (see fig. 45), but also over deep-blue
                    or green enamels. Lustre colours were specially used by the Persians for
                    wall-decoration (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tiles),</hi> but they also used them
                    on both white and blue enamel grounds to ornament hookahbottles, bowls, plates,
                    ewers, and tall rose-water bottles. The lustre is generally used alone, and not,
                    as in the Italian majolica, combined with other non-lustre pigments. Its use is
                    very early in Persia: dated specimens exist of the 10th century; and its
                    manufacture has continued down to the present time, though that now made is of a
                    very inferior quality.</p>
                <p>2. Coarse pottery covered with a fine white silicious slip, on which arabesques
                    and other simple patterns are painted in black, the whole then covered by a
                    transparent green glaze. This is a very ancient sort of ware, made in Egypt
                    during the XVIIIth Dynasty and many centuries after by Moslem potters, from the
                    early years of their occupation of Egypt down to a very recent period. To this
                    class belong the “bacini” or large dishes with which some of the 12th-century
                    churches in Pisa and other towns in Italy were decorated. They were built in on
                    the outside walls of the campanili, or used in rows to form friezes. In design
                    and method of execution they have nothing in common with Italian majolica, and
                    the oft-repeated story of their being the models from which the Italians learned
                    to make their majolica appears to be a baseless fable.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Sgraffiato Ware.—</hi> These are certain large bowls or jars
                    decorated in a peculiar way, being covered first with a coating of white enamel
                    and then with a complete coating of brown or deep-blue enamel. The pattern,
                    usually graceful branches of plants with pointed leaves, is formed by cutting
                    through the upper coloured layer down to the white enamel underneath before
                    firing in the kiln. Thus the design appears in white with a coloured ground. The
                    white is, of course, slightly sunk below the coloured layer. Bowls thus
                    decorated are mostly white inside, with a little simple painting in blue, the
                    sgraffiato or incised work being only on the outside.</p>
                <p>4. The next class is the reverse of the incised ware in treatment: the whole
                    vessel is covered with brown or blue enamel, and the design, either arabesques
                    geometrically treated or natural sprays of foliage, is painted over it in white
                    enamel, thickly applied so as to stand out in slight relief. This and the
                    preceding class are usually glazed <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the enamels, a
                    common Persian practice, to gain additional richness and brilliance of surface.
                    Somewhat akin to this ware in style is a very beautiful sort of pottery with
                    most graceful and delicate designs touched on with a fine brush over a white
                    enamel ground. The pigments are blue, green, grey, and a very rich orange
                    tending to red, and are all thickly but very delicately put on; these pieces are
                    of extreme beauty both in colours and in design. Tall jars, bottles, bowls,
                    plates, and hookah-jars are the vessels usually decorated in this way. Some of
                    the large plates are perfect marvels of decorative beauty of the most refined
                    and graceful kind.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Damascus Ware.—</hi> Under this head is generally included a
                    good deal of Persian pottery made at other places besides Damascus, but of
                    similar style and colouring. It is mostly remarkable for the fineness of its
                    white enamel or slip, its rich glaze, and the beauty of the designs and colours.
                    One class is painted wholly in various tints <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n644/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0644-0621"/> of blue, the design being often regular and
                    treated with some geometrical stiffness. Other sorts have in addition a soft
                    olive green, and purple-brown made of manganese <hi rend="italic">(see</hi> fig.
                    46). One of the finest specimens of the ware is a lamp taken from the Dome of
                    the Rock at Jerusalem, and now in the possession of Mr Drury Fortnum, F.S.A.
                    (see fig. 47). It is inscribed in large blue letters with pious sayings of
                    Mohammed, and in small black characters round the lower rim, “In the year 956,
                    in the month Jumâdâ Ί-ùla. The painter is the poor, the humble Mustafa.”
                    According to our reckoning this date is June 1549 A.D., the year when the Dome
                    was restored by Sultan Suleiman, who was probably the donor of this beautiful
                    lamp. One class of painted decoration used in Damascus ware has flowers treated
                    in a simple way, yet with much natural beauty, such as the rose, hyacinth,
                    tulip, carnation, and others, arranged on large plates and bowls with the most
                    perfect skill and good taste. The plate shown above (fig. 46) is a good example
                    of this sort of design.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Rhodian ware,</hi> so called because it was largely
                    manufactured by Oriental potters in the island of Rhodes, is made of rather
                    coarse clay, covered with a fine white silicious slip, on which the decorations
                    are painted, the whole being then covered with a thick glaze formed of silica,
                    oxide of lead, and soda. Its chief characteristic is the use of a fine red
                    pigment, which owes its colour to the red oxide of iron. This pigment was
                    applied in very thick body, so that it stands out in actual relief like drops of
                    sealing-wax. Plates, tall bottles, jars, mugs, and pitchers with handles are the
                    usual forms. They are all decorated with patterns of great beauty and splendour
                    of colour, brilliant blues, greens, and the peculiar red being the chief (see
                    fig. 48). The designs are mostly flowers, exactly the same in drawing and
                    arrangement as those on the last-men-!</p>
                <p>tioned sort of Damascus ware. Other more geometrical patterns are also used, but
                    mostly for wall-decoration. The finest specimens of Rhodian ware date from the
                    16th and first half of the 17th centuries. Other pieces of this pottery, which
                    appear to have been made for European buyers, have coats of arms or human
                    figures, the latter very coarsely executed, and probably later in date than the
                    purely Oriental designs. The town of Lindus, where ruined kilns yet remain, was
                    one of the chief places in Rhodes for the production of this kind of pottery.
                    With other Oriental wares it was imported into western Europe during the 16th
                    century. Some specimens exist with English silver mounts of the time of
                    Elizabeth, very elaborately wrought. It was probably included under the title of
                    “Damas ware,” a name which often occurs in mediaeval inventories, and appears to
                    include many varieties of Oriental pottery, all of which were very highly valued
                    in France, Italy, and England during the long period when the native pottery in
                    those countries was of a very rude description. The South Kensington Museum and
                    the Hôtel Cluny in Paris have the finest collections of this magnificent class
                    of Oriental pottery; some very choice specimens are in the British Museum and
                    the Louvre.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Pottery made in Persia under Chinese Influence.—</hi> This
                    includes several varieties more or less strongly Chinese in method of execution
                    or in design. It is recorded that Shâh 'Abbâs I., a great patron of all the
                    arts, about the year 1600, invited a number of Chinese potters to establish
                    themselves at Ispahan for the sake of introducing improvements in the
                    manufacture of pottery. Though no hard porcelain like that of China appears to
                    have been made in Persia, several new methods of work were introduced, and a new
                    style of decoration, half-Chinese and half-Persian, was largely used for a long
                    period after the arrival of the Chinese potters</p>
                <p>The main varieties of this Perso-Chinese ware are the following. (1) A sort of
                    semi-porcelain, called by English dealers, quite without reason, “Gombroon
                    ware,” which is pure white and semi-transparent, but, unlike Chinese porcelain,
                    is soft and friable where not protected by the glaze. It is composed of silicate
                    of alumina, with free silica, and an alkaline flux; in the heat of an ordinary
                    porcelain furnace it fuses into a transparent glass. It is very fragile, but is
                    of an extremely pleasant texture and slightly creamy tint. It is frequently
                    decorated with simple patterns pierced through the sides of the vessel; the
                    holes are filled up by the transparent glaze which covers the whole, thus
                    forming, as it were, little windows of clear glass. It is also often decorated
                    with painted flowers or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n645/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0645-0622"/> arabesques in cobalt blue and manganese purple.
                    The forms of the ware are small and delicate, mostly cups, plates, bowls, and
                    flower-vases with many necks; these were made from the 17th down to the 19th
                    century. (2) Celadon, very like that made in China, but greyer in tint, is
                    common earthenware covered with a green enamel.’ It was much valued by the
                    Persians and other nations on account of the belief that a cup of this ware
                    betrayed the presence of poison either by breaking or by changing colour. The
                    Persians call it “jachmi” (jade), from its resemblance to that valuable stone.
                    (3) Pottery of coarse clay, modelled with blunt reliefs, and the whole covered
                    with green enamel. Another variety is covered with a bright blue enamel, chiefly
                    used for ewers, hookah-bottles, and tall jars. Tire moulded reliefs are either
                    flowers or human figures, poor both in design and execution. This kind of
                    decoration was much used for heavy square bottles or tall jars; it has little or
                    no trace of the usual Persian tastefulness of design, and the colour is harsh.
                    Most of this ware is not older than the 18th and 19th centuries. It is very
                    largely Chinese in style. (4) Pottery painted in cobalt blues on a white ground,
                    with some black, used chiefly for outlines. This is the largest class of
                    Perso-Chinese pottery, and of it were made large dishes, bowls, bottles, ewers,
                    and almost all forms of domestic and ornamental vessels. In some the design is
                    purely Persian, in others almost purely Chinese, while in others the two styles
                    are mingled. The Chinese grotesque dragons and mannered treatment of fir trees
                    and even human figures frequently occur, but the more graceful designs have
                    flowers and foliage arranged with that great decorative skill and good taste for
                    which the Persians are so remarkable. Fig. 49 shows a dish from the South
                    Kensington Museum in which there is little or no Chinese influence in the
                    design; it is painted only in blues, and dates from the 17th century. Some few
                    pieces have figures and flowers moulded in low relief, merely indicating the
                    form, and then painted in blues and black lines. On the whole this class of
                    pottery is very decorative in effect; the glaze is thick, and the blues
                    frequently softened by having run a little in the firing; the different shades
                    of blue are very varied and harmonious, ranging from indigo to a deep
                    ultramarine.</p>

                    period of Oriental rule in south-west Europe no existing specimens of pottery
                    can be attributed, though there are sufficient records to show that the Arab
                    potters of Spain, as of other parts of the world, were highly distinguished for
                    their skill and the artistic beauty of their wares. The existing specimens of
                    Hispano-Moorish pottery, which are very numerous, date from the early years of
                    the Moorish occupation, towards the end of the 13th century, and continue down
                    to the 17th century. During this long period three stages were passed through,
                    each with characteristics of its own, but passing imperceptibly one into
                    another,—(1) pottery made by the Moors for their own use; (2) pottery made by
                    them for the use of their Christian conquerors; (3) pottery made by Spanish
                    potters who imitated the technical methods of the Moors, and to some extent
                    their designs and style of decoration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Technical Methods, Colours,</hi> &lt;fr.—The technical methods
                    remained the same throughout all three periods. The process was this. After the
                    pot had been thrown on the wheel, a rather coarse red or yellowish clay being
                    used, it was dipped into a cream-like mixture of the materials for its white
                    enamel coat. This, like the white enamel of Persian pottery, was simply a glass
                    rendered white and opaque by the addition of oxide of tin. When fired, the
                    vessel was covered with a smooth coat of enamel, slightly creamy in colour and
                    very pleasant in texture. Only two colours were used for decoration, and very
                    often only one. The chief of these was a lustre, made with oxides of copper or
                    silver, and varying in tint from a pale lemon yellow to a deep coppery red. The
                    peculiar application of lustre-colour has been described above under the head of
                    “lustred ware” (p. 620). The other colour is a deep indigo blue, varying in
                    tint, and produced sometimes with copper and sometimes with cobalt oxides. The
                    blue was applied before the lustre, which always required a special and final
                    firing under different conditions from those necessary for the fusion of the
                    white enamel and the blue pigment. The chief towns in which the ware was
                    manufactured were Malaga, Valencia, and Manises (in the province of Valencia);
                    the celebrated amphora-shaped vase found in the Alhambra was probably from the
                    first of these places. Ibn Batuta (14th century) describes the beauty of the
                    “gold-coloured pottery” of Malaga, and says that it was largely exported into
                    distant countries. Marineo <hi rend="italic">(Cosas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >memorabies de Espana,</hi> 1517) and Ercolano <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">de Valencia,</hi> 1610) both praise highly the
                    “gilt pottery” made at Valencia and Manises. The term “gilt” refers to the
                    metallic golden colour of the lustre. Pieces of Valencia ware occur with the
                    accompanying mark (No. 1). The usual forms of this pottery chiefly consist of
                    deep dishes and bowls, jars, drug-pots, goblets, and large bucket-shaped
                    vessels. The early ones, such as the Alhambra amphora, dating from the early
                    part of the 14th century, are decorated with delicate and graceful arabesque
                    patterns, or branches of a plant like the briony, the leaves of which are often
                    alternately in blue and in yellow lustre. A few have Arabic inscriptions. The
                    designs are most masterly, drawn with great freedom of touch, and very
                    decorative in effect. The delicacy and minuteness of the painting are often
                    increased by white lines on the yellow lustre, done with a wooden point by
                    wiping out the lines through the lustre pigment before it was fired; this could
                    be done easily, because the lustre was painted on the hard smooth enamel <hi
                    rend="italic">after</hi> it was fired, not on an absorbent biscuit surface.</p>
                <p>The pottery of the earlier period has mostly a lustre of pale almost lemon yellow
                    made with oxide of silver, while the later and coarser varieties have a deep-red
                    lustre made from copper, which is rather harsh and too metallic in appearance.
                    The decorations of the second period are very frequently heraldic in character.
                    A favourite design for large dishes is a lion rampant or a displayed eagle, the
                    latter used as the emblem of St John the Evangelist, the patron saint of
                    Valencia; others have shields with the arms of Castile and Aragon or of royal
                    personages. Many of the grandly-decorated dishes are not only ornamented on the
                    front but also have their backs elaborately covered with rich and graceful
                    arabesques. Some of this ware is moulded in slight relief; plates have slightly
                    projecting ribs, and goblet-shaped cups have swelling gadroons, a form copied
                    from metal originals. Fig. 50 shows a fine dish, now in the British Museum,
                    painted in copper lustre and blue; though Moorish in style, it has a Spanish
                    inscription, SENTA CATALINA GVARDA NOS. The pottery of the third class is very
                    inferior in all respects to the work of the Moorish potters. Not only is the
                    lustre harsh in quality but the designs are very coarse and often rudely
                    executed, though still for the most part retaining strong traces of their
                    Oriental origin. The <pb break="no"

                    manufactory of Manises, which was very productive in the 17th century.</p>
                <p>In addition to the lustred pottery of this sort made in Spain ware of similar
                    design and execution was produced in the Balearic Islands. Many pieces exist
                    bearing the arms of Inca in Majorca. The beauty of Balearic pottery is mentioned
                    by Giovanni da Uzzano, who wrote a treatise on trade and navigation in 1442. It
                    was also alluded to by J. C. Scaliger <hi rend="italic">{Exercitationes,</hi>
                    xcii.) in the 16th century. This pottery was largely imported into Italy, where
                    it no doubt influenced the design of some of the so-called “majolica,” though it
                    can hardly have originated its manufacture, as has so often been asserted.</p>
                <p>Another class of pottery has been attributed to the</p>
                <p>Moslem conquerors of Sicily, though without much distinct evidence. It is very
                    similar to the Hispano-Moorish ware, except that the lustre is painted over a
                    ground of <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> not <hi rend="italic">white</hi> enamel.
                    Some other pottery, with paintings in blue with black outlines, on a white
                    silicious slip, and covered by a thick vitreous glaze, may be the work of
                    Siculo-Moorish potters. The designs are very bold and effective, often with
                    inscriptions in large Arabic characters, or grotesque horses and other animals,
                    boldly drawn. The attribution of Moslem pottery to special localities is always
                    difficult and uncertain, owing to the great similarity in design and in methods
                    of execution that is always common to Moslem races wherever they may have
                    chanced to settle.</p>
                <p>The Kensington Museum and the Hôtel Cluny have the best collections of Persian
                    and Hispano-Moorish wares. The British Museum, the Louvre, and the
                    Archaeological Museum of Madrid have many very choice specimens. Others are
                    scattered through the various museums of Europe.</p>
                <p>In other parts of the world, especially among the Moslem people of India, Persia,
                    and northern Africa, very graceful pottery is now made, especially the plain
                    biscuit varieties, in accordance with traditional forms and methods. The common
                    pottery of Egypt is very beautiful in shape and often pleasant in colour and
                    texture; at several places on the banks of the Nile a fine red ware, very like
                    the Roman “Samian,” is still largely manufactured, and the waterjars made of the
                    common brown clay are generally fashioned in shapes of almost Hellenic beauty,
                    which seem to have been continually used since the time of the Ptolemies.</p>

                <p>Great quantities of sepulchral urns have been found dating from the departure of
                    the Romans from Britain to the 10th century, but almost no specimens exist of
                    the domestic pottery of this period. The shapes, the character of the clay, and
                    the ornamental patterns on the cinerary urns are very much the same whether they
                    are found in Germany, Scandinavia, Britain, or France: they mostly show traces
                    of Roman influence; some are even coarsely-executed copies of red Samian ware,
                    and are skilfully wheel-made and well fired. Others are very rude, hand-made,
                    and scarcely to be distinguished from the pottery of the early iron age. In the
                    main, however, the urns are much neater, more glossy, and more elaborately
                    ornamented than the prehistoric pottery. They are made of hard well-burned clay,
                    generally grey, brown, or blackish in colour. The decoration is often very
                    elaborate, with incised lines, some arranged in wavy bands, others in wheel-made
                    rings. The most characteristic ornaments are simple geometrical patterns, stars,
                    crosses, the svastika, and others, impressed in the soft clay from wooden stamps
                    (see fig. 51).</p>
                <p>Many urns have a ring of bosses pressed out from the inside by the potter’s
                    thumb, and some few have bands or stripes in coarse ochre colours or white. The
                    surface of the urns is frequently glossy, partly from the hard silicious quality
                    of the clay, but often because it has been mechanically polished. A black
                    shining surface was sometimes given with graphite (plumbago), as was the case
                    with some of the Roman black pottery. A lump of graphite was found with
                    blackened urns in a tomb at Hogelberg.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    made during this period it was extremely fragile, and, being of very coarse
                    ware, without artistic beauty, few specimens have been preserved to our times.
                    It consisted mostly of tall jugs, globular pitchers, bowls, dishes, and
                    drinking-cups, all of which were made for some centuries with but little
                    variation in shape or quality. Fig. 52 shows a selection of common forms,
                    usually made of coarse red or yellow clay, often covered with white slip, and
                    partly glazed with a green or yellow vitreous glaze, rendered more fusible by
                    the presence of a large proportion of oxide of lead. Some have coarse painted
                    stripes in coloured ochres; others have heraldic badges or fanciful ornaments,
                    rudely modelled, and fastened to the body of the pot; and some grotesque jugs

                    most graceful in shape were pilgrim-bottles, flattened globes, very like one of
                    the forms common in Egyptian and Assyrian pottery. The common domestic pottery
                    of the Middle Ages was made and used in enormous quantities. Though it was
                    wonderfully cheap, yet the ease with which it was broken made it a serious and
                    often-recurring item in the household expenses of rich or royal personages. The
                    list of expenses of a feast on the anniversary of Queen Eleanor’s death (wife of
                    Edward I.) contains this item, <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> p <hi

                    a vessel of red clay with a coating of white slip made of some natural white
                    earth like pipeclay. This was done by dipping or by pouring the fluid slip over
                    the red vessel. When the white coating was dry the design was formed by cutting
                    it away so as to expose the red body underneath. In this way bowls, dishes,
                    ewers, and other vessels were decorated with human figures, or with graceful
                    scroll-patterns of foliage and flowers. The patterns were then picked out with
                    bright colours,—yellow, blue, and green; and finally the whole was glazed with a
                    very fusible lead glaze (see fig. 53). This is probably a very early method for
                    the decoration of pottery in various parts of Italy; but only few existing
                    specimens are older than the second half of the 15th century. Some of the
                    earlier specimens have very graceful designs, of almost Gothic style, executed
                    with great spirit, and very decorative in effect. Sgraffiato ware continued to
                    be made during the 16th and 17th centuries, especially in the neighbourhood of
                    Pavia; it was, however, but little esteemed owing to the greater popularity of
                    painted majolica. Rude imitations of it were made in Germany and France.</p>

                    sense to include non-lustred pottery.</p></note><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    history of this ware in its early stages of development is almost unknown.
                    According to popular tradition, it was first copied from certain plates brought
                    by the Pisans from the island of Majolica (or Majorca) in the 12th century. This
                    is extremely improbable; the fabrication and use of a white tin enamel were
                    known to Italian potters long before they found out the secret of lustre
                    colours, a discovery not made in Italy till the 15th century. We know from
                    various sources that lustred pottery from the Balearic Islands was largely
                    imported into Italy during the 15th century (see above), and it is quite
                    possible that the sight of the brilliant lustre on the imported Moorish ware set
                    the potters of Italy to work, and led them to find out, either by experiments or
                    from some traveller who had visited the Balearic kilns, how to compose and fire
                    the metallic salts required to produce the lustre; but this occurred long after
                    the Pisan victory at Majorca. It was to the lustred ware only that the Italians
                    gave the name of “majolica,” though now it is commonly applied to all the
                    Italian enamelled pottery of the 15th and 16th centuries. It was the lustre only
                    that was a fresh discovery in the 15th century; enamelled ware had been made by
                    Italian potters many years before. This is an important point, and it should be
                    noted that the accounts given by Vasari and several other old Italian writers on
                    the subject are quite misleading. “Mezza-majolica” is a word of rather uncertain
                    meaning which occurs in early writers on Italian pottery. It has been used to
                    mean pottery covered not with a tin enamel but with a white slip, made of a
                    white clay like that found at Vicenza; and in many museums the earlier and ruder
                    sorts of majolica have been arranged under this name. The fact, however, seems
                    to be that even the rudest and earliest specimens of majolica in the various
                    museums of Europe are covered with a true tin enamel. Curious specimens of
                    pottery, covered with a rude enamel made of the white kaolinic <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ii</hi> terra di Vicenza” mixed with an alkaline silicate,
                    have recently been found in tombs of the 11th and 12th centuries in various
                    parts of Italy. These earliest attempts at what we now call majolica are
                    coarsely decorated in green, yellow, and blue, on a white ground, with patterns
                    of semi-Oriental style. The pigments used appear in some cases to be simply
                    coloured glass reduced to powder,—a kind of <hi rend="italic">smalto.</hi> This
                    style of pottery is probably the mezza-majolica of Vasari. It is evidently the
                    first step towards the production of the true majolica, in which the kaolinic
                    clay of Vicenza is replaced by a tin enamel. This discovery is of great
                    importance as regards the early history of Italian pottery. The few pieces yet
                    known are mostly preserved in the office of public instruction in Rome, and are
                    not yet exhibited in any museum.</p>
                <p>Very few early examples of developed Italian majolica are now known. One of the
                    most important is a small jug, 5 inches high, in the Sèvres Museum, which is
                    made of reddish clay covered with a white tin enamel, and painted with a shield
                    and simple ornaments in manganese purple and bright green (oxide of copper). It
                    is supposed to have been made at Rimini, and dates from the 13th or 14th century
                    (see fig. 54). It was not, however, till the second half of the 15th century
                    that Italian majolica began to be largely produced.</p>
                <p>Owing to the great difficulty of determining the special towns where the earlier
                    varieties were made, it will be convenient to treat this ware according to style
                    and date rather than under the heads of the different potteries. During the
                    earlier and more important period the production of majolica was confined to a
                    very small part of Italy. Bologna on the north, Perugia on the south, Siena on
                    the west, and the Adriatic on the east roughly indicate the limits within which
                    the chief majolica-producing towns were situated; these were Forli, Faenza,
                    Rimini, Cafaggiolo, Pesaro, Urbino, Castel Durante, Gubbio, Γerugia, and Siena.

                <p><hi rend="italic">Materials.—</hi> Fortunately ample information on this subject
                    has been preserved to us. A potter of Castel Durante occupied himself for some
                    time in writing a full description of the materials, the methods of using them,
                    the “throwingwheels,” the kilns, and all the varied processes of his craft. His
                    original MS., copiously illustrated with clever pensketches, is in the library
                    of the South Kensington Museum, and the work was printed, with facsimiles of the
                    drawings, at Pesaro in 1879. It is called <hi rend="italic">I tre</hi><hi

                    Piccolpasso of Castel Durante, and is dated 1548.</p>
                <p>Piccolpasso himself did not produce lustred ware, but he describes the process
                    and the special kiln it required; his description of materials and methods,
                    though not written till 1548, applies in all important points to the majolica of
                    the second half of the previous century. Various receipts differing in the
                    proportions of their ingredients are given; the following examples are selected
                    as typical instances.</p>
                <p>1. The clay body, “terra,” was to be, if possible, clay deposited by a river. It
                    was carefully prepared for use by being beaten, ground in a mill, and passed
                    through a sieve, so as to bring it into a smooth homogeneous plastic state, fit
                    for being moulded on the wheel. It was all the better for being dug out a long
                    time before it was used.</p>
                <p>2. The white enamel, “bianco,” was composed of thirty parts of “marzacotto” to
                    twelve of oxide of tin. The marzacotto was simple powdered glass, a pure
                    silicate of potash, made from clean sand and the alkaline tartar deposited by
                    wine. According to Piccolpasso the decorations were painted on the enamel ground
                    sometimes <hi rend="italic">before</hi> it was fired, and sometimes <hi
                    rend="italic">after.</hi> This was an important difference. The enamel <hi
                    rend="italic">before</hi> firing formed a slightly granular and very absorbent
                    ground, like clay in the biscuit state; and the paintings on it had to be bold
                    and broadly decorative, not delicate and miniature-like; the touch of the brush
                    had to be rapid and certain; little or no alteration could be made, as the
                    unfired enamel sucked the pigment out of the brush and absorbed it below the
                    surface. The earlier and more boldly decorative sorts of majolica appear to have
                    been painted in this way on the <hi rend="italic">unfired</hi> enamel, and owe
                    much of their richness of effect to the fact that the different pigments have
                    sunk below the surface of the ground. This process may be compared to that of
                    painting in true fresco, while the painting on the fired enamel resembles the
                    more deliberate method of the painter in oil. After passing through the kiln the
                    whole character of the enamel was completely changed; it formed then a hard,
                    smooth, non-absorbent, vitreous surface, on which the finest lines and the most
                    minute paintings could be executed, and any part of it could easily be altered
                    or wiped out. It was in great part owing to this change of method that the later
                    majolica paintings became more pictorial and more minute in execution, the
                    almost inevitable result of painting on a hard glassy ground. In some instances
                    it is not easy to decide which method of painting has been adopted, though in
                    most cases there is a distinct difference in the quality of the lines. One
                    peculiarity is a sure test: when delicate patterns in white have been formed by
                    covering the enamel ground with some colour, and then <hi rend="italic">wiping
                    out</hi> the pattern by using a pointed piece of stick or ivory on thé soft
                    pigment, in that case the enamel certainly was fired first. The colour could not
                    be wiped cleanly out from an absorbent biscuit surface. Much of the delicate
                    beauty of the Persian lustre paintings, especially those on wall-tiles, is due
                    to this method of getting minute patterns in white. It was also, practised,
                    though in a much more limited way, on some of the Italian majolica. The
                    difference of handling between “under-glaze” and “over-glaze” painting
                    corresponds exactly to that of the unfired and fired enamel; but in the latter
                    case another important difference is introduced: underglaze pigments require
                    much greater heat than those over the glaze and are consequently very limited in
                    range of colour, while in majolica painting the same pigments were used in
                    either case.</p>
                <p>3. The glaze, “coperta,” an ordinary glass, made more fusible by the presence of
                    lead, consisted of oxide of lead 17 parts, silica (sand) 20, alkali 12, and
                    common salt 8 parts.</p>
                <p>4. Pigments, “colori,” all owe their colour to a metallic oxide, yellow being
                    derived from oxides of iron and antimony, green from oxides of copper and
                    antimony, blue from oxide of copper, red from Spanish oxide of iron, Armenian
                    bole, and red ochre, and black from black oxide of copper and manganese. Most of
                    these had a certain proportion of oxide of lead, not to affect the colour but to
                    make them more fusible. Other tints were produced by combinations of these
                    pigments, and different gradations of tone were obtained by adding more or less
                    of the ingredients of the white enamel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Methods of Manufacture.—</hi> Piccolpasso gives sketches of the
                    potters at work throwing vessels on the wheel. The wheel itself: (“torno”)
                    consists of a vertical axle, with a large lower wooden 1 disk for the potter’s
                    foot to keep it revolving, and a smaller upper disk on which the clay was
                    moulded by the potter’s hands,—an apparatus which differs in no respect from
                    that used in Egypt under the Ptolemies, and is still employed in the great
                    porcelain factory at Sèvres. The potter to the right of fig. 55 is working with
                    a wheel like that drawn by Piccolpasso. The earlier kind of majolica is almost
                    wholly wheel-moulded, but during the 16th century a good many plates and vases
                    were formed after shapes copied from silver-work, with sunk bosses or gadroons.
                    These were formed by pressing thin disks of soft clay into moulds made of
                    plaster ( “gesso ”), bone-ash, and pounded marble. An elaborate description of
                    the method is given in Piccolpasso’s MS. Another practice also had arisen in his
                    time, that of finishing the pottery on a joiner’s lathe when it was dry, but
                    before it was enamelled or fired,—a practice unfortunately common at the present
                    day, which makes the form of the vessel more mathematically correct, but greatly
                    injures the freedom and spirit of touch given by the potter’s hand. After the
                    pottery was brought to the required shape it was dipped into a bath of the
                    materials for the white enamel, finely ground and mixed with water; and, after
                    being allowed to dry, it was fired for the first time. The painted decoration
                    was applied on the white enamel with brushes of various sizes, and the vessel
                    was then dipped into a second bath of the glaze materials, finely ground and
                    mixed with water like the enamel. It was afterwards fired a second time. If it
                    had lustre colours, they were put on over the glaze, and a third firing in a
                    different kiln was necessary for the reasons explained above under the head of
                    “Persian pottery.” The application of the transparent glaze over the enamel was
                    not absolutely necessary, and was occasionally omitted, but the finer sorts of
                    majolica usually had it for the sake of the increased brilliance which it gave
                    to the non-lustre colours. The kiln for the ordinary colours and first two
                    firings, as drawn by Piccolpasso, is exactly the same in principle as that used
                    by the potters of ancient Greece and Rome,—that is, an arched chamber in two
                    stories, with a perforated floor between—the lower compartment for the fire, the
                    upper for the pottery. A sketch is also given in Piccolpasso’s MS. of the
                    lustre-kiln, in which the pottery is enveloped in flames and heated smoke. Fig.
                    55, from a Venetian woodcut of the middle of the 16th century, shows majolica
                    potters at work throwing pots on the wheel. Two different wheels are being used;
                    the man on the left keeps his going by giving it a succession of spins with one
                    hand, the other works his wheel by the help of a lower foot-turned disk. To the
                    extreme left a small kiln is shown; the lower arched opening is for the
                    insertion of the fuel, the upper for the pottery; the holes at the top are for
                    the escape of the heated air and smoke.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Styles of Decoration.—In</hi> general character the painted
                    •decoration on the majolica of the latter part of the 15th and beginning of the
                    16th century is very different from that of a few years later. The first retains
                    much of mediaeval purity and simplicity of design, while the later sort follows
                    the richer and more florid style brought into fashion by the rapidly-approaching
                    decadence of art. The principal variety of the early class is the ware painted
                    in blues with a yellow lustre, manufactured chiefly in the workshops of Pesaro,
                    Gubbio, and Deruta. With these two simple colours effects of the greatest
                    decorative beauty were produced, far more truly artistic and suited to their
                    special purpose than the elaborate pictures in many colours painted some years
                    later in the workshops of Urbino and Durante. In the firm precision of the
                    drawing and extreme skilfulness of touch in the blue outlines one is reminded of
                    the paintings on Greek vases of the best period. Some of the large plates of
                    this ware have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n649/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0649-0626"/> ligure-subjects, usually sacred scenes. A very
                    beautiful one in the Louvre has a Madonna and Child enthroned, drawn and
                    composed with the simple grace of Raphael’s early manner. Most, however, have
                    portraits of ladies drawn in profile, the background filled up with simple
                    flowers, and an inscribed scroll, often with the lady’s name and the word
                    “bella” or “diva,” or with epigrammatic mottoes (see fig. 56). The design is
                    first drawn in blue outline, with a little delicate blue shading over the white
                    flesh and a blue edging on the ground round the outline. The dress and the
                    ornaments on the ground and rim of the plate were finally filled in with the
                    yellow lustre, which was sufficiently transparent to let all the blue line
                    details over which it was painted show through. Another rarer sort of early
                    majolica, similar in style, has a deep ruby lustre, employed instead of the
                    golden yellow. Fig. 57 shows a fine example of it, probably produced at Gubbio,
                    which had almost a monopoly of this special lustre, afterwards used so largely
                    in the workshop of Maestro Giorgio. Other early varieties of majolica, painted
                    in a simple and unpictorial way, have no lustre colours, but are remarkable for
                    their brilliant and rather harsh green, with a good deal of manganese purple.
                    Plates of this sort with female portraits, not generally in profile, and
                    heraldic animals, frequently occur, as well as slabs or plaques intended for
                    wall-decoration. Faenza and Forli appear to have been the chief places for their
                    production. The Cluny Museum is very rich in specimens. Cafaggiolo and Faenza
                    also produced, during the early period, some very beautiful and
                    highly-decorative plates, painted without lustre, but with a variety of colours
                    arranged with a most complete harmony of tint. Some have patterns ingeniously
                    devised after a motive suggested by peacocks’ feathers (see fig. 58). The chief
                    colours are yellow and orange, various blues, and occasionally a rich deep red.
                    Amatory plates (“amatorii”), with ladies’ portraits, are also painted in this
                    way, with more elaboration and detail but not greater decorative beauty than the
                    simple blue and yellow lustre of the early Pesaro and Gubbio ware. Specimens of
                    the later Cafaggiolo ware bear the accompanying mark (see No. 3). Forli was one
                    of the earliest towns to produce a fine class of majolica; specimens exist dated
                    1470, of very noble design and firm outline. A fine set of plates and vases was
                    made there (c. 1480-85) for Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary. The flesh of the
                    figures, like that on the early Pesaro and Deruta ware, is white, delicately
                    shaded with blue; but the early Forli potters used a greater variety of colours
                    than were employed at most other towns: in addition to the blues they had
                    yellow, bright green, and purple-brown, all non-lustre colours. To Forli or
                    Faenza must be attributed a very curious and rudely painted plate in the Sèvres
                    Museum, decorated with a youth on horseback in blue outline; it has a date which
                    appears to read 1448; if so, this is the earliest dated specimen of majolica.
                    The enamel is coarse and crackled all over, but the method of execution is that
                    of true majolica.</p>

                    was one of the largest and most important of his time. Its productions, as well
                    as those with the signature “Μ? G? da Ugubio,” or as in No. 4, are very unequal
                    in merit, and even the best of them are very inferior as specimens of true
                    decorative art Compared with the majolica of the earlier classes described

                <p>The mark used most frequently by Giorgio is shown in No. 5. A somewhat similar
                    monogram was used by an earlier potter; an example dated 1491 is shown in No. 6.
                    Though not the inventor of the ruby lustre, which was then so much admired,
                    Giorgio appears to have been the chief potter of his time who used it. The fact
                    is, the process was a difficult one and required special skill, not in the
                    preparation of the oxide of copper pigment but in the firing, so as to expose
                    the colour to actual contact with the reducing flame without the pottery itself
                    being shattered to pieces. Even with the best skill of the Gubbio potters a
                    large proportion of the lustred ware perished in the kiln. The majolica potters
                    of many other towns were in the habit of sending their otherwise finished wares
                    to Gubbio for the sake of having the additional brilliance derived from lustre
                    colours. In some cases a space for the lustres was left white; in others rude
                    dabs and splashes of ruby and yellow lustre were applied over completely
                    finished paintings of landscapes or figure-subjects, often in a very coarse and
                    tasteless fashion. Some delicately painted plates are quite spoiled and
                    vulgarized by the heavy touches of lustre that have been put over them. The ruby
                    is in fact rather strong and hard in tone, and needed very careful application
                    to make it harmonize with the quieter non-lustre colours; it is far more salient
                    and metallic-looking than the fine yellow lustre of the early ware. In addition
                    to the ruby, “gold” and “silver” lustres were used at Gubbio. The latter are a
                    deep and a pale yellow. The pale silver lustre was made from oxide of silver;
                    the gold was a mixture of copper and silver oxides. A great deal of the produce
                    of Giorgio’s workshop is very rude and of no artistic merit, while the best and
                    most carefully painted wares usually err, in accordance with the rapidly
                    declining taste of his time, in being far too pictorial. Copies of pictures
                    crowded with figures, arranged without regard to the shape of the vessel they
                    were meant to decorate, and painted with all the colours of the potter’s
                    palette, were most highly esteemed. Many of them are from designs by Raphael and
                    other great painters, but are really quite unsuited for ceramic decoration.
                    Giorgio’s earlier works are, on the whole, in better taste, and some later
                    portrait heads are very good. Fig. 59 shows a fine tazza in the Louvre signed at

                    majolica of Gubbio and elsewhere are scenes from Roman mythology, especially
                    Ovid’s <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses,</hi> and stories from classical his
                    tory. Unluckily contemporary history is rare; the British Museum has a good
                    specimen, a plate painted with the defeat of Francis I. at the battle of
                    Pavia.</p>
                <p>It was at Urbino and Castel Durante that the production of elaborate pictured
                    majolica was mostly carried on, especially between the years 1530 and 1560,
                    under the patronage of the reigning dukes of the Della Rovere family. Francesco
                    Xanto Avelli, Guido Fontana, and Niccola da Urbino were specially celebrated for
                    this class of work, and often used Marc Antonio Raimondi’s engravings from
                    Raphael’s designs to decorate their plates and vases.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A namesake and relation of Raphael’s was a
                    skilful painter of <hi rend="italic">istoτiati</hi> pieces; and hence has arisen
                    the tradition that the great painter occasionally decorated majolica (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Raphael).</hi></p></note> Many of these are painted with great
                    delicacy and richness of effect in spite of their unsuitability for their
                    special purpose and the comparative poverty of the potter’s palette, which was,
                    of course, limited to colours that would stand the severe heat of the kiln. The
                    pictured wares of Urbino sometimes have the Gubbio lustre colours, but the best
                    are without them. Another class of design was also used at Urbino with much
                    better decorative effect. It consisted of fanciful and graceful arabesques or
                    floral scrollwork mingled with grotesque figures or Cupids, all skilfully
                    arranged to emphasize the main contours of the plate or vase. Branches of the
                    oak tree in flowing and slightly geometrical lines are a frequent motive of
                    design, chosen in compliment to the Della Rovere dukes, who bore an oak on their
                    coat of arms. All these, but especially the pictured wares, were highly paid
                    for, and sometimes were valued as much as silver plate. They were mostly</p>
                <p>“piatti di pompa,”—meant, that is, to hang on walls or ornament sideboards rather
                    than for actual use. Some of the early productions of one of the Urbino
                    potteries are marked with the graceful monogram No. 7.</p>
                <p>In a short sketch like this it is impossible to give even an outline of the many
                    varieties of majolica produced in such profusion during the 16th century, but a
                    few others of the more important kinds may be mentioned. The Faenza potteries
                    produced one of the most beautiful of the later varieties, chiefly plates with
                    wide flat rims and deep centres, called “tondini,” the borders decorated with
                    delicate and minute arabesques, painted in several tints of a deep ultramarine
                    blue of wonderful richness and decorative effect. In the centre is usually a
                    coat of arms or a single figure, with a brilliant jewel-like touch of orange or
                    deep red, which sets off to the utmost the blues of the border (see fig. 60).
                    One of the most remarkable specimens of majolica painting, treated with the
                    delicate minuteness of an illuminated MS., is on a plate in the British Museum
                    from the Faenza workshops. It is a scene of the death of the Virgin, surrounded
                    by the apostles, copied with slight adaptations from an engraving by the German
                    master Martin Schongauer. The</p>
                <p>Italian ceramic painter has slightly but skilfully altered the composition to fit
                    it to the circular form of the plate, and has also given a more graceful cast to
                    the mannered German faces of the original. The execution is wonderfully delicate
                    and miniaturelike, almost wholly done in different tints of blue, with a little
                    yellow to suggest flesh colour, and high lights touched in with pure white
                    enamel, the main enamel ground being white slightly tinged with pink. It is
                    evi-dentlv the work of a verv able artist, and is a little picture of
                    gem-like<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n651/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0651-0628"/> beauty, though in no way specially suited to the
                    requirements of ceramic art, for which a bolder and less realistic style of
                    treatment is really the most suitable.</p>
                <p>Some fine early plates of Faenza make are signed with No. 8 mark; a common later
                    mark is the monogram FA(enza)—see No. 9. Another plate, also in the British
                    Museum, has a painting copied from a design by Albert Durer, the Scourging of
                    Christ. This highly - laboured and minute style of painting was largely
                    practised in the potteries of Siena, which produced plates of great beauty, with
                    borders of graceful scroll-work and grotesques in white and different tints of
                    blue, with usually a rich russet-brown or orange ground. Tondini from Siena are
                    often decorated in this way with a central medallion containing a minute
                    landscape, painted with wonderful minuteness and finish. The landscapes are very
                    delicate in colour, and, though often not more than an inch and a half in
                    diameter, have a wonderful suggestion of atmosphere and distance which recalls
                    the lovely sunset-lit backgrounds of Perugino’s pictures. A very beautiful plate
                    in the British Museum, painted in this minute style with the scene of Scaevola
                    before Porsena, is signed on the back, “fata i Siena da Μ? Benedetto.” Other
                    plates by the same very clever and refined painter are decorated only in blue,
                    with touches of pure white on the creamy enamel ground. The Kensington Museum
                    has a good specimen, with a central painting of a hermit and landscape
                    background, surrounded by a delicate border of arabesques. Little is known of
                    the artist. Another signature which occurs on Siena ware is No. 10, in one case
                    conjoined with the date 1542. Majolica with plain blue enamel is a rare variety,
                    and has been attributed to Luca or Andrea della Robbia, some pieces being marked
                    as in No. 11, apparently for “Luca della Robbia, Florentia.” It has no painting,
                    but was partly gilt; in colour the enamel resembles the plain blue pottery of
                    Persia mentioned above. It consists mostly of vases moulded with flutings and
                    bosses after a metal design; very few pieces exist. The beautiful sculpture in
                    enamelled terra-cotta made by the Della Robbia family will be treated of under
                    the head of <hi rend="smallcaps">Robbia.</hi></p>
                <p>Venetian majolica was not largely produced till towards the second half of the
                    16th century. In the earlier part of that century the few potters of Venice
                    appear to have chiefly occupied themselves with attempts to produce true
                    porcelain. The earliest dated specimen of Venetian majolica is of the year 1540.
                    Some of this ware is veιy decorative in effect, and has paintings of graceful
                    and elaborate foliage, scroll-work, and arabesques, designed with great
                    intricacy. It is in blue and white, the main enamel ground being a very pale
                    blue, and the design in deeper shades of blue with high lights in pure white.
                    Others have landscapes in blue and white, with graceful, but too realistic
                    borders of fruit and flowers in yellow, green, and blue, somewhat later in
                    style. Mark No. 12 occurs on some of the finest Venetian majolica. Towards the
                    end of the 16th century there was a rapid falling off in the artistic beauty of
                    majolica paintings, and not solely in the execution: the pigments also became
                    thin and poor, with very often a disagreeable “granular” look. Some effective
                    pottery was produced at Venice, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1590-1620, with a deep
                    ultramarine blue enamel ground, on which designs were painted in white, a style
                    of ware which was largely manufactured at Nevers in France a few years later
                    (see fig. 62 below).</p>
                <p>All through the 17th and 18th centuries majolica in a degraded form was produced
                    at many places in Italy; but most of the old kilns, such as those of Deruta,
                    Gubbio, and Faenza, fell into disuse. The latest kind of majolica, decorated
                    with coarse paintings in blues and yellows of rather harsh tint, was largely
                    produced at Turin, Genoa, Venice, Savona, Castello, Naples, Montelupo, and other
                    cities. The older potteries at Pesaro and Urbino still continued in work, but
                    produced nothing of real merit. A common mark on Turin ware is No. 13; and on
                    Savona majolica one of the two forms in No. 14 often occurs. In the beginning of
                    the 17th century spirited copies were made of the magnificent Rhodian pottery,
                    such as that shown in fig. 48 above, but with pigments very inferior to those of
                    the originals. At Capo di Monte, near Naples, a manufactory of pottery and
                    porcelain was started under royal patronage in 1736; but it was more celebrated
                    for the production of porcelain than of enamelled wares. Of late years clever
                    imitations of the old majolica have been produced in Italy, especially from the
                    workshop of the marquis Ginori. Even the old lustre colours are successfully
                    reproduced; but most of the modern majolica is maιτed by a want of spirit and
                    freedom, the natural result of its being a too servile copy of a bygone
                    style.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shapes of Majolica.—</hi> The most carefully finished and
                    finest paintings are as a rule on plates, which were of various forms, from
                    almost flat disks to the tondini with wide flat rims and deep bowl-like centres.
                    Many of the jugs, vases, and ewers are extremely graceful in form, some
                    suggested by the bronze vessels of ancient Rome, others taken from Greek vases.
                    Piccolpasso gives sketches of the principal shapes, and a long list of special
                    names, not now of much importance, as they varied in different manufactories and
                    even workshops in the same town. The character of the non-pictorial decorations
                    combines many different elements of style. In some of the patterns we see a
                    survival of earlier mediaeval and native Italian taste and invention. Others,
                    especially the large ewers of Cafaggiolo and Faenza, have flowers taken from
                    Persian pottery, but treated in a thoroughly original way. Some plates, painted
                    in the silver lustre only, are almost imitations of Hispano-Moorish ware or
                    actual majolica made in the Balearic Islands. In all the scroll - patterns,
                    mingled with grotesques, it is easy to trace the influence of the ancient wall -
                    decorations from the baths of Titus and other buried buildings, the discovery of
                    which at the beginning of the 16th century did so much to destroy the lingering
                    mediaeval spirit and substitute a pseudo-classical style, which finally had so
                    fatal an effect on all branches of art in Italy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Collections.</hi> — The chief collections of the majolica of
                    Italy are those of the South Kensington Museum (perhaps the most completely
                    representative of all), the Bargello in Florence, the museums of Milan, Venice,
                    Turin, Pesaro, Urbino, and other places in Italy. The Hôtel Cluny and the Louvre
                    in Paris, the Ceramic Museum at Sèvres, as well as Limoges, Berlin, Vienna,
                    Munich, and St Petersburg, have good collections. The British Museum collection
                    is not large, but it is one of the most important, from the number of “signed”
                    pieces that it contains, and from the fact that nearly all its specimens are
                    remarkable for their exceptional beauty or some point of special interest.<note

                    Spanish pottery is for the most part a coarse imitation of Italian majolica,
                    chiefly made at Valencia, Triana (Seville), and Talavera. Some of the enamelled
                    ware made at the last-named town is elaborately painted with figure-subjects in
                    blues, yellow, green, and manganese purple, of extremely bad taste and
                    feebleness of drawing.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the year 1700, though rudely painted, is very decorative in effect. Large plates
                    often have conventional flowers or profile heads, somewhat after the style of
                    some of the earliest majolica of Italy, and are coarsely painted in blue and
                    yellow. In the 18th century good enamelled pottery <pb break="no"

                    in the Chinese style. Some large vases of Moorish shape have very effective blue

                    of enamelled pottery was made at Puente del Arzobispo in the 16th or 17th
                    century. Specimens are rare; they consist chiefly of plates decorated in a very
                    skilful and effective way, somewhat after the fashion of Moorish wall-tiles,

                    design was scratched down to the red body. The spaces between the incised lines
                    were filled in with coloured enamels, rich blue, green, and orange, and the
                    whole glazed with a very fusible lead glaze. The simple and mosaic-like patterns
                    thus formed, either conventional flowers or heraldic animals, are extremely
                    decorative and telling.</p>

                    now existing of Spanish pottery without either enamel or glaze are chiefly large
                    wine-jars, <hi rend="superscript"> li</hi> tinajas,” about 3 or 4 feet high, of
                    graceful amphora-like shape, stamped with simple patterns in relief. Some of
                    them date from the time of the Moorish occupation. Both Spain and Portugal have
                    always been remarkable for the fineness and beauty of their potter’s clays, and
                    consequently have for long excelled in the production of simple biscuit wares,
                    uncovered by either enamel or glaze. Very graceful pottery of this sort is
                    manufactured even at the present day, the shapes being traditional, handed down
                    from century to century with but little change, many vessels being still
                    modelled after the old Roman forms. Some of this ware is of a white porous clay,
                    like pipeclay, and some is of a fine red, close in texture, with slight surface
                    gloss, almost like the Roman “Samian.” One common kind is decorated in a very
                    fanciful and ingenious fashion by the application of simple but rich surface
                    ornaments, modelled by hand in relief, or applied in the state of semi-fluid
                    slip. Other curious water-jars are made double, the outer vessel being pierced
                    with patterns of open-work. A third variety has sparkling particles of quartz
                    stuck on its surface while moist, a very old method of decoration, which was
                    even practised by the potters of prehistoric times. On the whole, the modern
                    biscuit wares of Spain and Portugal are among the most truly artistic and
                    interesting of any that are now made in Europe. It is still a living art, with
                    simple beauty both in material and shape, not a laboured revival of a dead
                    style, or dull copy of the artistic productions of a far-off time when fitness
                    linked with grace came naturally to the humblest workman.</p>

                <p>During the 16th century two very different but equally remarkable sorts of
                    pottery, decorated with great elaboration, were made in France. One was that
                    invented and manufactured by Bernard Palissy, which was a fine earthenware,
                    usually modelled in relief, covered with a white tin enamel, and painted with
                    manv briσht ml∩∏rs <hi rend="smallcaps">App</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Palissy).</hi> The other, Oiron pottery, popularly called “faience Henri deux,”
                    is very different both in design and execution. This rare and curious ware, of
                    which only about forty pieces are known, was made by a potter called François
                    Cherpentier for his patron, a rich and artistic widow lady, named Hélène de
                    Hangest, who established a workshop and kiln at her Chateau d’Oiron, in the
                    province of Thouars, between the years 1524 and 1537. The manufacture was
                    carried on by Hélène de Hangest’s son for some years after her death, but the
                    pieces then produced are inferior in quality, and soon ceased to be made at all.
                    This ware is not enamelled; it is simply a fine white pipeclay, to which a
                    delicate cream-tint is given by a very slight tinge of yellow in the lead glaze.
                    Its forms are very elaborate, sometimes extremely graceful, but occasionally too
                    fanciful, and overloaded with ornament. It consists of plates, tazze, holy-water
                    pots, ewers, salt-cellars, and other varieties of shape, generally forms more
                    suited to metal than to clay, ornamented with very graceful interlaced
                    strap-work and arabesques, such as were much used by the great Augsburg and
                    Nuremberg workers in silver. The method in which many of the ornaments are
                    executed is the chief peculiarity of the ware: they are first incised or stamped
                    into the soft clay of the vessel, and then the sunk patterns are filled up with
                    different clay pastes, tinted with dark brown, soft yellow, or buff. Many of the
                    delicate leafornaments appear to have been formed with a metal stamp; <hi
                    rend="italic">some</hi> are exactly the same as those used by contemporary
                    bookbinders. The ornaments are not all done in this laborious manner; some are
                    simply painted under the glaze, especially on the later productions of Oiron.
                    Monograms and emblems occur frequently, the salamander of Francis I.,the “H. D.”
                    for Henri deux, the royal inter laced crescents, or coats of arms (see No. 15).
                    Fig. 61 shows a beautiful covered tazza in the Louvre, made during the reign of
                    Francis I.</p>
                <p>There are eleven pieces of this ware in the Louvre; the Kensington Museum has
                    five; but the greater number of known specimens are in the possession of members
                    of the Rothschildfamily. It whs at one time thought to be the production of a
                    pottery under the patronage of Henry II., and hence the name by which it was
                    formerly known; but its real origin was established from clear documentary
                    evidence published in Μ. Fillon’s valuable monograph on the subject.</p>
                <p>Throughout the period we are now considering enamelled pottery was produced at a
                    very large number of French towns, often with the help of potters from Italy;
                    and the introduction of the tin enamel soon superseded the earlier sort of ware
                    with a bright green or blue glaze, which at the end of the 15th and beginning of
                    the 16th century was the chief and most artistic kind of pottery that was made
                    in France. The change was not wholly a gain, as pieces of the older ware were
                    moulded in relief with designs of great beauty <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n653/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0653-0630"/> mostly Gothic in feeling—especially those made at
                    Avignon, Savigny, and Beauvais; the reliefs on the older French ware are very
                    delicate and sharp, and often of great decorative effect. Nevers was one of the
                    chief manufactories of enamelled ware; from about 1570 to the end of the 17th
                    century it produced mostly poor copies of the later sort of Italian majolica.
                    After that a strong Oriental influence set in, and a peculiar ware with a
                    deep-blue enamel ground was made, very like that produced by the Venetian
                    potters. Some of this, painted in white enamel only, with Persian designs, is
                    effective and pleasant in colour (see fig. 62). Other pieces have flowers,
                    treated in a more realistic way, painted in harsh yellow, green, and red, quite
                    out of harmony with the rich blue ground. J. Bourdu, a potter working at Nevers
                    from 1602 to 1620, signed his ware with mark No.</p>
                <p>16; another, named H. Borne, used No. 17. During the 18th century Nevers chiefly
                    produced pottery of Chinese forms, painted in blue with Chinese figures and
                    flowers, and also a large quantity of pottery painted in many colours with
                    coarse designs, somewhat after the Delft style. The 17 th-century enamelled
                    }&gt;ottery of Rouen is the finest of the ater French wares. It is mostly
                    painted in rich red and blue only, with very minute and well-designed arabesques
                    of geometrical form, adapted, not copied, with great skill and taste from
                    Oriental designs (see fig. 63). Very large plates, wine-coolers, hanging
                    cisterns, and ewers are made of it.</p>
                <p>One very rare variety has the blue and red pattern on a deep orange ground, but
                    it is very inferior in artistic effect to that on the white ground. The finest
                    specimens were made before 1700; after that time the painting became coarser.
                    Copies of Chinese wares were also made at Rouen in the 18th century, all gaudy
                    in colour, and mostly poor in execution. The Rouen Museum has the best
                    collection of its native ware; there are very fine specimens also in the South
                    Kensington Museum. During the 18th century Moustiers produced some very
                    decorative pottery, painted in various shades of blue, with delicate wreaths,
                    masks, and arabesques, somewhat after the Rouen fashion. Other colours were also
                    used in very minute patterns, but the simple blue and white is the best. Blue
                    and white pottery with fairly good designs was also manufactured at St Cloud,
                    Sceaux, and Saint Amand, as well as many other French towns, during the first
                    half of the 18th century. Most, however, of the French wares of this date are
                    little better than imitations of porcelain, and their decoration feeble copies
                    of Chinese or Japanese designs.</p>

                <p>Though little is known of the early ceramic history of Germany, it is certain
                    that the application of a tin enamel and enamel colours was known to the potters
                    of that country even in the 13th century. Some plaques, with heads in relief,
                    painted in various colours over a white enamel ground, still exist at Leipsic;
                    they were made for wall-decoration, and are said to be of the year 1207. At
                    Breslau there is a monument of enamelled clay to Henry IV. of Silesia, made
                    about 1300. According to one story, the use of a white tin enamel was perfected
                    at Schelestadt by an Alsacian potter who died in 1283. Other examples exist,
                    though few in number, at various places in Germany, sufficient to show an early
                    acquaintance λvith the method of producing enamelled ware, which, however, seems
                    to have fallen into disuse, and during the 15th and 16 th centuries to have been
                    superseded by the fine sorts of stoneware, in the manufacture of which the
                    German potters were so widely celebrated.</p>
                <p>Grey stoneware, richly decorated with delicate stamped patterns in relief, and
                    generally, though not always, covered with a lead glaze, was produced in great
                    quantities in Germany, Flanders, and Holland from the end of the 14th century
                    till quite modern times, and was very largely imported into England and France.
                    Much of this stoneware (called by the French “grès de Flandres ”) is decorated
                    with great delicacy and taste; its tint, grey, brown, or cream-white, is very
                    soft and agreeable. The earlier specimens have reliefs of a Gothic character,
                    always stamped with great crispness and sharpness, not the least blunted by the
                    process of firing; many have elaborate coats of arms, or branches of simple
                    foliage, which spread gracefully over the surface of the vessel; others have
                    bands of figures, very minutely treated in slight relief. Another method of
                    decoration was by incised patterns, impressed from relief-stamps; sometimes, as
                    was the case with the Oiron ware, bookbinders’ dies were used for forming such
                    patterns in the soft clay. Some of the cream-white ware is left unglazed, but
                    most kinds have a vitreous lead glaze, either colourless or mixed with oxide of
                    cobalt or manganese. These two colours, indigoblue and purple-brown, are often
                    used to pick out the relief-patterns, thus making the design more effective.
                    Owing to the use of old stamps and traditional designs much of this pottery has
                    patterns considerably older than the ware itself, the date being frequently
                    introduced among ornaments which look very much earlier than they really are.
                    Fig. 64 shows a common form of jug, called a “greybeard” from the grotesque head
                    modelled on the neck. The body of the jug is covered with very graceful
                    scroll-work of oak branches in low relief.</p>
                <p>Another curious variety of German pottery, consisting chiefly of tankards and
                    jugs, made to imitate enamelled metal-work, was manufactured mostly at Kreussen
                    in Bavaria. The body is of hard red clay, covered with a dark-brown enamel, the
                    designs in slight relief being taken from the Augsburg or Briot style of
                    metal-work, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n654/mode/1up"

                    figures. A favourite design has reliefs of the twelve Apostles, little more than
                    an inch high, under flat architectural canopies; a strong Gothic feeling in the
                    treatment of such figures occurs on tankards made as late as the end of the 17th
                    century. The coloured decoration of this ware is very brilliant; the minute
                    figures or ornaments are picked out in bright enamel colours—red, green, blue,
                    and yellow —altogether producing a very striking but thoroughly unceramic
                    effect. A quite plain stoneware, with surface slightly mottled with grey and
                    brown, appears to have been one of the most esteemed varieties during the 16th
                    century, judging from the beauty of the silver rims and lids with which
                    wine-jugs of this kind were usually mounted. The mottling was produced by the
                    brownish glaze running in the kiln into a granular surface, which formed a
                    pleasant texture, something like that on an ostrich’s egg. The best qualities
                    were made at Cologne, and largely imported into England under the name of
                    “Cologne” stoneware. A rude kind of sgraffiato ware was also made in Germany and
                    Holland during the 17th and 18th centuries. Coarse red-clay vessels were covered
                    with a slip of white pipeclay, and rude figures, often of saints or kings, were
                    scratched through the white down to the red body. The whole was then glazed with
                    a yellowish lead glaze. Böttger, the first maker of Meissen porcelain,
                    manufactured curious varieties of pottery at the beginning of the 18th
                    century,—especially a ware like red jasper, which was so hard that it was cut
                    and polished by the lapidary’s wheel. It is usually marked with No. 18.</p>
                <p>Good collections of German pottery are in the museums of Berlin, Dresden, Munich,

                    pottery covered with a fine white enamel. The early specimens date from the end
                    of the 16th century. Much of this ware is very soft and pleasant in tone, and
                    very decorative in effect, especially that in blue and white only. Designs of
                    great variety occur, some copied from Persian or Chinese originals, others with
                    coats of arms surrounded by graceful borders, formed of medallions and wreaths.
                    A clever arrangement of peacocks’ feathers is a common and very effective
                    motive, used especially for plates. Other sorts of very inferior artistic merit
                    have paintings of flowers or human figures, coarsely executed in rather harsh
                    colours—yellow, green, and red —mingled with the more harmonious cobalt blues
                    and manganese purple. Many pieces of Delft ware are marked with maker’s
                    initials, as No. 19 or No. 20, probably two members of the Kulick family, of
                    about the middle of the 17th century.</p>
                <p>But little pottery of any real artistic value was produced in any Western country
                    during the 18th century, with the exception of the commoner and cheaper sorts of
                    wares, with little or no ornament, which were still made after the old
                    traditions. The fact is that the increasing introduction of Chinese and Japanese
                    wares and the widely-spread manufacture of porcelain in the West gave the
                    death-blow to the production of pottery designed and decorated after simple and
                    natural methods. The enamelled pottery of the 18th century was mostly little
                    better than a bad imitation of porcelain, a material which has a beauty quite
                    its own, and requires forms and methods of decoration very different from those
                    that are suited even to the most finely-enamelled earthenware.</p>

                <p>The pottery of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden for the most part resembles that of
                    Germany. Sweden, especially during the 18th century, was very active in the
                    production of enamelled pottery, but little of it possesses any originality
                    either in form or design. Perhaps the best variety is a ware made at Stockholm,
                    covered with bluish white enamel, on which simple patterns are painted in white.

                    also turned out large quantities, painted mostly with very weak designs; some

                <p>Little except the commonest sort of domestic pottery was made in England during
                    the 16th century. The grey mottled stoneware described above, which was largely
                    used for sack-jugs and tankards, appears to have been wholly a foreign import,
                    mostly from Cologne. A common item in 16th-century inventories is—“a stone jugge
                    or pott, garnished with silver and double gylted.” The silvermounted lids were
                    often added by English silver-workers, and are frequently very elaborately
                    embossed and chased. It was not till quite the end of the century that certain
                    Dutch potters started in London the making of stoneware. This English-made ware
                    is hardly to be distinguished from that of Cologne or Holland, as it was
                    designed and manufactured in the foreign way. Large globular jugs, stamped in
                    relief with a grotesque bearded face and other ornaments, were one of the
                    favourite forms. Such were called “greybeards” or “bellarmines,” from the
                    unpopular cardinal of that name, of whom the bearded face was supposed to be a
                    caricature (see fig. 64 above). Great numbers were made in the Low Countries and
                    copied by the Dutch potters in London. In 1688 two German potters named Elers
                    settled in Staffordshire, and there produced hard stoneware of very fine
                    quality. Their process, however, soon became known to other potters.</p>
                <p>The common wares of this time were mainly produced in the Staffordshire
                    potteries; some were decorated in a very rude but effective way by dropping
                    fluid white slip through a quill on to the surface of vessels made of red <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n655/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0655-0632"/> clay. The whole was then covered with a coarse
                    lead glaze, made from powdered lead ore (sulphide of lead), sprinkled through a
                    sieve on to the soft clay. The process of firing produced a vitreous glaze,
                    composed of silicate of lead, the silica being taken up from the clay body.
                    Thomas and Ralph Toft made a number of large plates, drinking mugs or “tygs,”
                    and candlesticks, decorated in this way with rather elaborate designs (see fig.
                    65). The potter’s name and the date frequently occur among the slip ornaments,
                    which are sometimes in red and brown on a white ground, as well as white on red.
                    About the year 1680a new sort of glaze was invented, very useful for the common
                    kinds of hard stoneware, and extremely durable, namely, the “salt glaze,”
                    applied by throwing common salt (chloride of sodium) into the hot kiln when the
                    process of firing was nearly complete. The salt was volatilized and decomposed;
                    the soda combined with the free silica in the clay, and a coating of hard
                    silicate of soda was formed. A very high temperature is required for this
                    process, which is chiefly used for drain-pipes and vessels to hold corrosive
                    acids, the salt glaze being almost indestructible.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the 17th century a gentleman named John Dwight spent many
                    years in experiments to improve the manufacture of pottery, and also to discover
                    the secret of true transparent porcelain. He appears to have been an artist of
                    great ability, and not only made domestic pottery of Cologne ware but also
                    modelled figures and large busts in pale-grey glazed stoneware; the British
                    Museum possesses a fine portrait bust of Prince Rupert by him, modelled with
                    great truth and spirit, almost recalling the touch of the old Florentine
                    sculptors in terra-cotta. In 1671 John Dwight took out a patent for his special
                    methods of pottery and porcelain work, and set up kilns at Fulham. Many of his
                    receipts for porcelain exist, and have been published in Jewitt’s valuable work
                    on <hi rend="italic">The. Ceramic Art of Great Britain</hi> (1877), but no
                    specimens of this early English porcelain are now known.</p>
                <p>The Lambeth potteries were established at a very early period, but it was not
                    till the 17th century that they produced ware superior to the common biscuit or
                    lead-glazed varieties. Some pieces of about 1660 are marked with No. 21 mark.
                    Certain Dutch potters settled at Lambeth early in the century, and started the
                    manufacture of a finer sort of pottery, covered with a tin enamel. Most of this
                    is in the style of the Delft wares, painted either in cobalt blues alone or with
                    the coarse green, yellow, and manganese purple used in the more gaudy kind of
                    Delft. The Lambeth potters also imitated Palissy ware, with high reliefs of
                    human figures or plants and reptiles,—very poor copies of Palissy’s originals,
                    the modelling being extremely blunt. The enamel ground has a pink tinge, and the
                    reliefs are picked out in various colours. Some specimens of this Lambeth ware
                    are dated on the back in blue with various years during the reigns of Charles I.
                    and Charles II. Another variety has coarse imitations of late Italian majolica,
                    while other pieces have English designs,—coarse portraits of Charles II. and his
                    queen, with arabesque borders, all very rudely executed.</p>
                <p>The beginning of the 18th century in England saw a great increase of activity in
                    the production of many kinds of pottery. Numbers of patents were taken out and
                    new kilns set up at a great many different places. Though many improvements were
                    made in the preparation and combination of different clays and considerable
                    advances in technical skill were gained, yet little pottery of any artistic
                    value was made.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wedgwood Ware.—</hi> The Wedgwoods were an old Staffordshire
                    family, and one member at least was a potter in the 17th century. This was John
                    Wedgwood (1654-1705), the great-uncle of Josiah, who in the next century founded
                    the great pottery which he called “Etruria.” Only one piece signed by John
                    Wedgwood is known to exist; it is in the interesting historical collection of
                    ceramic wares in the Jermyn Street Museum of Geology, London. It is a “puzzle
                    jug” with three spouts and a hollow handle, made of coarse brown clay, covered
                    with the usual green lead glaze. The potter’s name and the date 1691 are incised
                    round the jug.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a
                    full account of the Wedgwood family and their ware, see Jewitt, <hi

                <p>In the middle of the 18th century, when Josiah Wedgwood was a young man, a great
                    impulse had been given to the study and appreciation of classical art, partly
                    through the discovery of the buried cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, and also
                    on account of the growing enthusiasm for the beautiful Greek painted vases,
                    which were then being sought for with great avidity in the tombs of Etruria and
                    Magna Graecia. Josiah Wedgwood devoted his life and great talents to an attempt
                    to reproduce the severe beauties of the Greek and Roman pottery. Unfortunately
                    in this not unpraiseworthy aim he neglected the special requirements of fictile
                    work. His productions, delicate and beautiful as they often are, have the
                    characteristics of anything rather than pottery. With great labour and expense
                    he turned out from his workshops imitations, necessarily unsuccessful, of
                    ancient engraved gems and camei, of jasper, basalt, or mottled marbles, of
                    gem-like cut glass, such as the Portland vase, and dull copies, feeble in
                    drawing and hard in texture, of beautiful painted Greek vases. Of natural
                    methods of decoration suitable to pottery, or of the life and freedom of the
                    plastic clay rising into graceful forms under the touch of the thrower’s hand
                    aided by the rhythmical movement of the wheel, he knew nothing. Nearly all his
                    pottery is dully scholastic and archaeological in style, and therefore must, on
                    the whole, be regarded as a failure, though often a very clever and even
                    beautiful failure.</p>
                <p>Wedgwood’s most characteristic ware, in the production of which he was aided by
                    Flaxman and other able artists, consists of plaques and vessels, vases, cups,
                    plates, and other forms moulded in clay, delicately tinted blue, brown, and
                    various colours, on which minute cameo reliefs in white paste were applied while
                    they were soft, and were then fixed by firing. Many of them have very beautiful
                    figures, some copied from Greek and Roman gems or vases, others being specially
                    designed for him · but all are classical in style. Some of his pieces are quite
                    astonishing for their microscopic delicacy of detail; others have wreaths,
                    foliage, and minute diaper ornaments applied in the same way. Wedgwood also
                    produced very fine and porcelain-like varieties of white enamelled pottery, some
                    even decorated with a metallic lustre, purple in colour, and mottled to imitate
                    marble; some are cleverly modelled to imitate large sea-shells. Indeed his
                    technical methods were varied with the utmost ingenuity, and would need a
                    treatise to themselves if even a rough outline were given of all the
                    varieties.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n656/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0656-0633"/>
                <p>Towards the end of the 18th century many imitations were made of the Wedgwood
                    cameo ware by different English manufacturers, and even at Sèvres it was copied
                    in porcelain, though with original French designs. None, however, are equal to
                    Wedgwood’s work, either in beauty of design or delicacy of execution.</p>
                <p>Until quite recently little or no pottery of any artistic merit has been produced
                    in England during the present century, partly owing to the absurd notion that
                    pottery is a sort of inferior porcelain, and should be made to resemble it as
                    much as possible, and also very largely on account of the invention in the 18th
                    century of a process (described below) for <hi rend="italic">printing</hi>
                    patterns under the glaze, so as to avoid the labour of painting them by hand.
                    Other modern so-called improvements of manufacture have done much to destroy all
                    true art in English pottery; such are the too finely ground and artificial
                    mixtures of different materials, the great use of the mould in preference to the
                    potter’s wheel, and, most fatal of all, the fact that, when the pottery <hi
                    rend="italic">is</hi> thrown on the wheel, it is afterwards handed over to a
                    workman who turns it on a lathe and rubs it down with glass-paper, as if it were
                    a block of wood, thus removing all the surface put on the vessel by the touch of
                    the thrower’s hand. Indeed, the great manufactory of Sèvres has now so
                    completely lost all sense of the natural and reasonable treatment of plastic
                    clay that the larger vases are <hi rend="italic">cast</hi> whole by being poured
                    in a fluid state into a mould, a method reasonable, enough for iron or bronze
                    but ludicrously inappropriate to plastic clay. Some few manufacturers have,
                    however, of late tried to produce pottery shaped and decorated in a more natural
                    way. The Lambeth pottery produces a good deal of excellent work, especially ware
                    covered (after the Japanese fashion) with one brilliant enamel colour. Mr
                    William De Morgan of Chelsea and Merton has perhaps made the greatest advances
                    of all, having rediscovered the way to make and use the beautiful thickly-glazed
                    blues and greens of the old Persian ware, and also the fine silver and copper
                    lustres of Gubbio and Spain. He uses these splendid colours in designs conceived
                    and drawn with the old spirit, but of sufficient originality to make them a real
                    stage in the development of ceramic art, not a mere archaeological revival of
                    styles and methods which have long ceased to have a significance and life of
                    their own.</p>
                <p>Sad though the confession is, it must be admitted that, to find a class of
                    pottery designed with lines of natural beauty and produced in accordance with
                    the simple requirements of plastic clay, it is, for the most part, necessary to
                    go, not to the centres of our boasted 19th-century civilization with its
                    countless devices for turning out work cheaply and rapidly, but rather to the
                    humble workshops of more primitive races, among whom the commercial spirit has
                    not yet destroyed all inborn feeling for true art and beauty.</p>

                <p>The pottery of ancient Mexico and Peru, certainly older than the Spanish
                    conquests in America, and possibly dating from a much more remote age, has many
                    points of interest. Large quantities in good preservation have been discovered
                    in the tombs of chiefs and other important persons of those once powerful and
                    (in a somewhat barbaric way) artistic races. Much of their pottery is grotesque
                    and even hideous in shape, modelled in the forms of semi-human monsters; it is
                    often made of a hard black clay, well burned, something like the early black
                    wares of Etruria. Another kind is graceful and natural in shape, formed with
                    great taste and skill on the potter’s wheel. Many of the forms seem to have been
                    suggested by vessels madeof gourds.</p>
                <p>The decoration is very curious; many of the simple painted patterns with
                    geometrical designs and hatched lines call to mind the earliest type of painted
                    decoration on the archaic pottery of Mycenae and the Greek islands. The clay is
                    fine in texture and has a slight surface-gloss, apparently the result of
                    mechanical polishing. Fig. 66 shows a typical form.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In the methods of treatment employed in China and Japan the usual distinctions
                    between pottery (earthenware) and porcelain (kaolinic ware) are not always
                    observed. In many cases these two different materials are treated in exactly the
                    same way and decorated after the same fashion. It will therefore be convenient
                    to describe them both together.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History of Chinese Porcelain.—</hi> The chronological
                    arrangement of Chinese wares is a matter of great difficulty. Many of the
                    professedly historical records of the Chinese themselves are quite
                    untrustworthy; as with all other arts, they have claimed for the manufacture of
                    porcelain an antiquity far beyond the actual facts of the case. This exaggerated
                    estimate of the antiquity of Chinese porcelain was for a long time supported by
                    the supposed discovery in Egypt of certain small bottles made of real porcelain,
                    and inscribed with Chinese characters, which were said to have been found in
                    tombs at Thebes dating as early as 1800 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The fact,
                    however, that they are inscribed with quotations from Chinese poets of the 8th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and have characters of a comparatively
                    modern form, shows that the whole story of their discovery is a fraud. The only
                    native work which gives trustworthy information on the development of Chinese
                    porcelain is a <hi rend="italic">History of the Manufactory of
                    King-te-chin,</hi> compiled from earlier records in 1815 by a native official,
                    which was translated into French by Μ. Julien, under the title <hi rend="italic"

                    of pottery is said to have commenced in 2697 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and
                    that of porcelain during the Han dynasty, 206 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to
                    25 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The Tsin dynasty (265-419 A.D.) was remarkable
                    for its blue porcelain, and the Suy dynasty (581-618 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.)</hi> for its fine green ware. One of the most celebrated kinds of
                    porcelain was that made about 954 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> deep sky-blue
                    in colour, very glossy in texture, extremely thin, and sounding musically when
                    struck. Even small fragments of it are treasured up by the Chinese, and set like
                    jewels. Most dynasties seem to have been famed for a special variety of
                    porcelain. The earlier sorts appear not to have been decorated with painting,
                    but were all of one rich colour. Decorative painting did not apparently come
                    into general use before the Yuen dynasty of Mongols (1260-1368), and was brought
                    to great perfection under the Mings (1368-1644). The porcelain of the last-named
                    dynasty is classified in periods, four of which (from 1426 to 1567) were greatly
                    esteemed. Probably few specimens of Chinese porcelain known in Europe are
                    earlier in date than the time of Kang-he, the second emperor of the Tsing
                    dynasty (1661-1722). During all periods Chinese potters were constantly in the
                    habit of copying earlier styles and of forging their marks, so that very little
                    reliance can be placed on internal evidence. Indeed, the forgeries often deceive
                    the Chinese collectors of old porcelain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufacture of Porcelain.—</hi> It is made from two substances,
                    “pe-tun-tse” and “kao-lin”; the latter is a white pasty substance derived from
                    the decomposition of felspathic rocks such as granite. It is a hydrated silicate
                    of alumina (A1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.2SiO.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0657-0634"/> exactly known, but it appears to resemble kaolin,
                    with the addition of a considerable proportion of free silica. The result of
                    their mixture is shown in the following analysis by Μ. Laurent of the body of
                    white Chinese porcelain—silica 70 ’ 5 per cent., alumina 20’7, potash 6, lime 0
                    ’ 5, protoxide of iron 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8 per cent., magnesia a
                    trace. The white pastes of which the porcelain is made are very carefully
                    washed, finely ground, and mixed in due proportion. The paste is “thrown” on the
                    potter’s wheel in the usual way and set to dry; its coloured decoration is then
                    applied, and over that the transparent glaze is laid. This is a very hard and
                    beautiful substance, which requires great heat to fuse it; it is made of almost
                    pure felspar with an alkaline flux. It is finely ground with -water, and either
                    blown with a pipe on to the vessel or the vessel is dipped into it. The
                    porcelain is next packed in clay boxes or “saggers,” piled one above another in
                    the kiln, in order to protect it from discoloration from the smoke. After the
                    kiln has been heated for a considerable time to a very high temperature, the
                    fire is withdrawn; and the porcelain is allowed to cool slowly in the clay
                    saggers before the kiln is opened and its contents removed. Additional
                    decoration is frequently added <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the glaze, generally
                    in enamel colours, applied thickly so as to stand out in perceptible relief;
                    gilding is also added over the glaze. The porcelain is afterwards fired a second
                    time in a more open kiln, and at a lower temperature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The methods of decoration</hi> on Chinese porcelain are
                    extremely varied, and are applied with the most skilful hand and wonderful
                    fertility of design; but they are always dainty and feebly pretty rather than
                    artistic, except when there is a Persian element present. The Chinaman is a born
                    maker of graceful toys, full of ingenuity and perfect deftness of touch, but
                    hardly worthy to be classed as a producer of serious works of art. The general
                    forms of the porcelain are mostly feeble, and often of extreme ugliness, while
                    the skill in drawing is mostly confined to representations of flowers, some of
                    -which, especially the chrysanthemum and the paeony, are painted with great
                    truth and enjoyment. With the beauties of the human form the Chinaman has no
                    acquaintance or sympathy, and he never possessed the -wonderful skill of the
                    Japanese in the delineation of animals and birds.</p>
                <p>Only a few chief examples among the many methods of decorative treatment can be
                    mentioned here. A useful classification has been adopted by Mr A. W. Franks in
                    his valuable catalogue of his own collection of porcelain, formerly exhibited at
                    Bethnal Green, and now (1885) in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Plain white,</hi> of a delicate ivory colour and a rich
                    satin-like glaze. Some of it is <hi rend="italic">crackled,</hi> not
                    accidentally, but by a careful process, one of the methods of which is this.
                    Powdered steatite is mixed with the materials of the felspathic glaze, and the
                    porcelain vessel or statuette, after the glaze is applied, but before firing, is
                    set in the rays of a hot sun, which causes it to be covered with a network of
                    fine cracks, going through the skin of glaze down to the porcelain body. Red
                    pigment or black Chinese ink is then rubbed into the minute cracks, which are
                    thus made more conspicuous, and prevented from quite closing up in the heat of
                    the kiln. Many specimens have two sets of crackle, first the coloured cracks
                    produced before firing, and secondly an intermediate uncoloured set, produced in
                    the glaze by the action of the kiln (see fig. 67). Most of this white ware is
                    decorated with delicate surface-reliefs of flowers or figures very sharply
                    moulded.</p>
                <p>Old specimens of it are now highly valued in China. It was frequently copied in
                    the early European porcelain manufactories, such as Saint Cloud, Meissen, and
                    Chelsea.</p>

                    >Enamel</hi><hi rend="italic">Colour.—</hi> Enamels of many varieties of tint
                    and great brilliance were used: the finest are blue, from copper or cobalt; deep
                    red, another oxide of copper; yellow, antimoniate of lead; and black, oxides of
                    iron and manganese. One of the most beautiful is that sea-green tint called
                    “céladon,” which was early exported into England, and highly valued in mediaeval
                    times from its supposed property of changing colour at the contact of poison.
                    New College, Oxford, possesses a bowl of this ware, mounted in silver richly
                    worked, of about 1500 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and presented to the
                    college by Archbishop Warham early in the 16th century. A specimen of this
                    céladon ware is probably referred to among the list of new-year’s gifts to Queen
                    Elizabeth as “a cup of grene pursselyne” given by Robert Cecil. The fine old
                    yellow porcelain was only made for the use of the emperor of China, and it is
                    consequently rare; it is very thin and transparent, almost like a vitreous
                    enamel. Some of the Chinese enamelled wares are made of pottery, not of
                    porcelain; earthenware, in many cases, was equally good for the purpose, as the
                    body of the vessel was hidden by the coloured enamel.</p>

                    different Colours.—</hi> This ware is frequently moulded in relief, with
                    dragons, flowers, or various animals, picked out in different colours, often
                    very harsh and gaudy in effect. Fig. 68 shows a pilgrim-bottle painted in enamel
                    colours. The beauty both of form and of decoration for which this piece is very
                    remarkable is mainly due to Persian influence.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Porcelain painted in White Enamel over a Ground of Coloured
                    Enamel. —</hi> This is a very decorative sort of ware; the designs, such as
                    flowers, birds, and insects, are applied thickly in the white pigment, and are
                    sometimes carefully modelled in low relief. The method was largely imitated by
                    the Persians (see p. 620 above).</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Porcelain painted only in Blue.—</hi> This is really the
                    most artistic and highly decorative of all the varieties of Chinese painted
                    wares. Some of the large plates and jars have very good designs, treated in a
                    not too realistic manner. Much of the finest porcelain of this class both in
                    form and decoration shows a strong Persian influence, the result of the
                    intercourse between China and Persia and the visit of Chinese potters to Ispahan
                    mentioned above in the account of Persian pottery. Nanking porcelain, painted
                    with the so-called “hawthorn pattern,” really a kind of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prunus</hi> which produces its blossoms before its leaves, was largely imported
                    into England during the last century, and now fetches very exorbitant prices.
                    Unluckily during the 18th century a great deal of the fine blue and white china
                    brought into England was painted over the glaze with harsh gaudy colours in
                    English and French porcelain manufactories, to please the degraded taste of the
                    time, and was thus completely spoiled. Other combinations of Chinese and
                    European work occur. Sets of porcelain were painted in China with French or
                    English designs to suit the European market; or plain white porcelain was sent
                    from China to be decorated at Chelsea or Bow. Very ludicrous results were
                    produced in some cases by this mixture of style; engravings were sent from
                    Europe to be copied on porcelain by the Chinese potters, who have in many cases
                    laboriously painted an exact facsimile of the copper-plate lines with all their
                    hatchings and scratchy look. Some of these were done for Jesuit missionaries in
                    China, and Chinese plates with Catholic sacred subjects and figures of saints
                    exist in considerable quantities. Statuettes of the Madonna were also made in
                    China for the missionaries, carefully modelled in white porcelain after European
                    originals; some appear to be copies from 14th-century French ivory figures, and
                    (even in the hands of the Chinese potter) have preserved a strong resemblance to
                    their mediaeval original. The type of the Holy Mother thus introduced appears to
                    have been adopted by the Chinese Buddhists as a fitting representation of their
                    goddess Kwan-lin, many figures of whom were made with but little alteration from
                    the statuettes of the Catholic Madonna.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    This very large class includes all varieties of form and decoration. The colours
                    are often harsh and inharmonious, and the more elaborate figure-subjects are
                    nearly always grotesque and ugly. Additional <pb break="no"

                    over-glaze colours, added by a second firing. Many other varieties might be
                    mentioned, but the student must be referred for further information to the list
                    of works on this subject given below.</p>
                <p>Both pottery and porcelain have been used on a large scale for architectural
                    purposes in China. The so-called “porcelain tower” of Nanking was the most
                    prominent example. It was a very elaborate structure (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Nanking),</hi> mostly constructed of pottery covered with enamels of different
                    colours. The usual name is misleading, as only the white portions were of real
                    porcelain. The Jermyn Street and British Museums have specimens of its bricks
                    and elaborate architectural features.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Japanese, Pottery and Porcelain.—</hi> In the main the
                    technical methods used in Japan and the styles of painted ornament were
                    introduced from China, and also to a less extent from the adjacent peninsula of
                    Corea. Glazed pottery was first made at Seto about 1230 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> by a potter who had visited China. Porcelain manufacture was
                    introduced in a similar way into the province of Hizen about 1513. On the whole
                    the Japanese are more remarkable for their skill and almost endless methods in
                    the production of pottery than of porcelain. No people ever approached them for
                    marvellous fertility of invention and skill in the manipulation of all sorts of
                    clay, pastes, enamels, and pigments. One of the most remarkable characteristics
                    of Japanese pottery is its wonderful success in the imitation of all kinds of
                    materials and texture of surface, one great object apparently being to make it
                    resemble anything rather than what it really is. Wood, with its varying colours
                    and delicate grain, ivory, bronze, lac, marble, basket-work, fruits, and
                    countless other substances are imitated in Japanese pottery with the most
                    perfectly deceptive effects. The utmost amount of labour and patience is often
                    spent with this one object, any notions of real artistic beauty being apparently
                    never even considered.</p>
                <p>A great deal of Japanese ceramic ware is simply copied from Chinese porcelain,
                    and often has forged Chinese marks. It is very difficult to find out what
                    notions the Japanese themselves really have as to what is admirable in pottery.
                    A purely archaeological interest in old sorts of ware appears to affect them
                    strongly, and they often put the highest value on what appears a very ordinary
                    and rudely-made kind of pottery. As Mr A. W. Franks has pointed out in his
                    introduction to a native report on Japanese pottery, published by the Science
                    and Art Department, 1880, the high value which they put on rude specimens of
                    glazed pottery is partly kept up by the existence of certain curious old
                    tea-drinking ceremonies, solemnly performed as if they were religious rites.
                    Everything used and every detail of the performance were strictly prescribed by
                    rule. The bowl or cup out of which the tea was drunk by the guests was to be an
                    archaeological curiosity remarkable for its age, not for any intrinsic merit.
                    Some of these cups which have been brought to Europe are of coarse clay,
                    ill-formed, thick, highly glazed, and quite without ornament. One in the Sèvres
                    Museum, said to be Seto ware of the 14th century, is made of mottled yellowish
                    brown clay, with a thick vitreous glaze. It looks quite worthless, but has
                    evidently been highly valued by its Japanese owner, for it has a beautifully
                    made ivory lid, and is protected by three cases,—first, fine white silk with
                    gold cord; second, a box of polished bamboo; and, outside of all, a case of
                    figured linen lined with silk. Others of these precious teabowls are red,
                    purple, black, or grey, all very thick and coarse, but highly glazed, and
                    carefully fitted into silk cases.</p>
                <p>Some of the Japanese methods for the decoration of pottery are simple and
                    effective, especially a ware made of grey clay with incised patterns—birds,
                    flowers, and the like—filled in with white paste, and the whole glazed,— similar
                    in method to the 16th-century Oiron ware.</p>
                <p>The most magnificent sort of pottery is the Satsuma ware, originally introduced
                    from Corea. It was at first manufactured in a private factory belonging to the
                    prince of Satsuma, but afterwards produced for public sale. The most
                    highly-decorated kinds with many colours were not made till the end of the 18th
                    century. In minute richness it is probably the most elaborate ware ever
                    produced. The body is a fine ivory-white clay, covered with a minutely crackled
                    glaze. Over this, miniature-like paintings of human figures or flowers are
                    executed in brilliant enamel colours, some of which stand out like jewelled
                    reliefs. It is further decorated with delicately moulded patterns in gold, and,
                    though very weak in real decorative effect, is a marvel of rich workmanship.
                    Most of the so-called Satsuma now sold is a poor imitation of <hi
                    rend="subscript"> χ</hi> the ware, and is made in great quantities at Awata and
                    Ota.</p>
                <p>It should be observed that nearly all the very elaborate and magnificent methods
                    of ceramic decoration now so much employed by the Japanese are of quite modern
                    origin; before the present century the simpler methods of China were almost
                    exclusively followed in Japan. During the last century great quantities of
                    porcelain, chiefly decorated in gold, green, and a rich red, were made expressly
                    for export, and largely brought into Europe, where they were frequently copied,
                    especially in the porcelain works of Dresden and the early china manufactories
                    of England.</p>
                <p>The Japanese have little or no sense of the best kind of decorative art; their
                    paintings of flowers or birds, beautiful as they are, are mostly, as it were,
                    flung across the vessel they are meant to ornament without any regard to its
                    shape or the space to be occupied. Like the Chinese, they have no feeling for
                    the beauty of the human form, or even of some of the nobler animals, such as the
                    horse. The figures most frequently represented on their ceramic wares—the seven
                    gods of good fortune—are all grotesquely hideous; and downright ugliness of the
                    most repulsive sort is often selected and treated with wonderful ingenuity. Many
                    of the paintings have a symbolical meaning; emblems of longevity (considered by
                    the Japanese the chief of all blessings) are perhaps the favourite, such as the
                    sacred tortoise, the crane, or the combination of three trees—the fir, the plum,
                    and the bamboo—all of which have this special meaning.</p>
                <p>Within the present century a new and elaborate method of decorating porcelain has
                    been practised in Japan, the chief object of which seems to be to make a
                    porcelain vessel look like a metal one. Brass cloisonné enamel is applied to the
                    outer surface of porcelain vases or bowls; the strips of brass set on edge which
                    form the outline of the design, instead of being soldered to a metal plate, are
                    fixed in some almost incomprehensible fashion to the surface of the porcelain,
                    and then the compartments are filled in with coloured enamels and fired in the
                    usual way,—a marvel of technical skill and wasted ingenuity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Collections of Chinese and Japanese Porcelain.—</hi> The
                    Dresden collection is the most important historically, having been formed
                    chiefly between 1694 and 1705. The British Museum is rich through the recent
                    munificence of Mr A. W. Franks, who has presented to it the whole of his fine
                    collection. The South Kensington Museum and the museums at Leyden, The Hague,
                    and Sèvres are rich in these wares, as are also those at Vienna, Berlin, and St

                <p>In various places in Europe, especially in Italy and France, attempts to produce
                    translucent porcelain like that produced by the Chinese were almost continually
                    being made from the end of the 15th century down to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n659/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0659-0636"/> beginning of the 18th. The word “porcelain” is
                    usually derived from the Italian “porcellana,” a white shell, to the smooth
                    polished surface of which the Chinese wares bear some resemblance. Hence it
                    should be observed that in mediaeval inventories “a cup of porcelain” often
                    means one made of shell or mother-of-pearl. In Italy the finer sorts of majolica
                    were often called “porcellana,” and a plate decorated “alia porcellana” meant
                    one with a special style of painting, and did not refer to its material. During
                    mediaeval times, when real Eastern porcelain is meant, some other word
                    expressing where it came from was frequently added, e.y., in French 15th-century
                    inventories “porcelaine de Sinant” is sometimes mentioned. From the 13th to the
                    15th century Chinese porcelain was very sparingly brought into Europe, and
                    generally occurs among royal possessions or gifts as an object of great value.
                    The name “china,” from the country where porcelain was made, was given to it not
                    later than the 16th century, and perhaps earlier, having been used by the Arabs
                    long before: “china dishes” are mentioned by Shakespeare (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Measure for Measure,</hi> act ii., scene i.) as being things of value.</p>
                <p>The main reason of the very slight success gained for so many years in the
                    attempts to make porcelain in Europe was the fact that it was regarded as a
                    highly artificial substance, something between pottery and glass; the many beds
                    of kaolinic clays which exist in Europe were never thought of as being the true
                    material of which to make it, or, if used at all, were only employed partially
                    and in an accidental way. The earliest attempts at the production of translucent
                    porcelain which had any practical success took place at Venice about 1470.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Davillier, <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Origines de la Porcelaine en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Europe,</hi> 1882.</p></note> An alchemist named Antuonio succeeded in making
                    and firing in a kiln at San Simone, near Venice, “porcelane trasparenti e
                    vaghissime,” described, in a document dated 1470, as being as beautiful in glaze
                    and colour as “the porcelain from barbarous countries.” Difficulties, however,
                    seem to have arisen, and the manufacture was not proceeded with till 1504, when
                    a few sample specimens were made in Venice, and others again in a spasmodic way
                    in 1518 and 1519. No specimens of the early Venetian porcelain are now known,
                    nor any pieces of the porcelain made at Ferrara for Duke Alphonse II. about
                    1565-67 by Giulio da Urbino, and mentioned with high praise by Vasari.<note

                    Artists,</hi> last section.</p></note> The composition of this earliest European
                    porcelain is not known, but it probably was partly made of the white clay of
                    Vicenza—a true kaolinic paste— often used by the majolica potters to give
                    whiteness and fine grain to their clay.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Medici Porcelain.—</hi> The earliest manufactory of porcelain
                    of which known specimens exist is that started in Florence, for Francesco I. de’
                    Medici, about the years 1575-80 by Bernardo Buontalenti (see Vasari). Francesco
                    de’ Medici took the greatest interest in the manufacture, and, as is recorded by
                    Galluzzi (7 <hi rend="italic">storia</hi><hi rend="italic">di Toscana,</hi>
                    1781), moulded some of the vessels with his own hands, as complimentary presents
                    to other princes. According to Galluzzi, Buontalenti did little more than
                    improve on the method invented a few years earlier by the majolica potters
                    Camillo da Urbino and Orazio Fontana, assisted by a Greek who had learned the
                    secret of true porcelain in China. The discovery of the existing specimens of
                    Medici porcelain is due to Alessandro Foresi, who observed its peculiar texture
                    and, in some cases, slight transparency, and found pieces marked at the back in
                    a way that quite confirmed his theory.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Foresi, <hi rend="italic">Sulle Porcellane Medicee,</hi>
                    1869.</p></note> These marks are the Medici arms, with its “palle” or balls,
                    inscribed with “F. Μ. Μ. E. D. II.” for “Franciscus Medici Magnus Etruriae
                    Dux</p>
                <p>II.” Some pieces have a rude representation of the great dome of the Florentine
                    cathedral, and the letter “F.” for “Florentia” (see No. 22). Scarcely forty
                    specimens of the ware are known, which are mostly in the possession of the
                    Rothschilds and Mr Drury Fortnum, in the royal collection at Lisbon, and the
                    museums of South Kensington and Sèvres. They are all of a slightly creamy white,
                    with a beautiful pearly texture, due to the rich glaze and the slight
                    transparency of their paste; the glaze varies in thickness, and in some
                    instances is slightly crackled. Nearly all are simply decorated in cobalt blue,
                    under the glaze; the designs are of various styles, some purely Italian, others
                    Persian or Chinese in character; a few have one flower painted in the middle of
                    the space in a graceful and almost realistic way. A plate at Lisbon has a figure
                    of St John with his eagle. Their forms are pilgrim-flasks, plates, ewers, and
                    vases of different shapes, some very graceful and original.</p>
                <p>The earliest dated example is among the five specimens in the Sèvres Museum; it
                    is a square bottle with the arms of Spain painted in blue and a few touches of
                    manganese purple; the date 1581 is introduced among the ornaments at a corner of
                    the bottle; it was probably a gift from Francesco I. to the king of Spain. The
                    composition of this porcelain has recently been discovered from a contemporary
                    MS. in the Magliabecchian Library at Florence. The paste consisted of 24 parts
                    of white sand, 16 of a crystalline frit (powdered rock-crystal 10, and soda 8),
                    and Faenza white earth 12 parts. To 12 parts of this mixture 3 of the kaolinic
                    clay of Vicenza were to be added. Probably to secure greater whiteness, the
                    vessels were covered, under the glaze, with a white enamel; but this addition
                    appears needless. They were then glazed with an ordinary silicious lead glaze.
                    Though the final result has the beauty and some of the special qualities of the
                    Chinese natural porcelain, yet it will be observed that this end was gained in a
                    very difficult and elaborate manner, which must have been very costly. This, no
                    doubt, is the reason why so few pieces were made, and why its manufacture ceased
                    altogether with the death of Francesco de’ Medici, in 1587.</p>
                <p>After the Medici ware ceased to be made there is a blank of nearly a century in
                    the history of European porcelain. In 1664 a patent was granted to Claude
                    Reverend, a citizen of Paris, which gave him the privilege of making “imitation
                    porcelain, as fine as that from the East Indies.” No known specimens can be
                    attributed with certainty to his workshop, though some pieces which bear mark
                    No. 23 may have come from his hands. In 1673 another patent was conceded to
                    Louis Poterat, who certainly did produce artificial porcelain at Rouen. Some
                    small pieces, salt-cellars and mustard-pots, in the museums of Rouen and Sèvres,
                    are attributed to him, and are therefore the earliest undoubted examples of
                    French porcelain. They are of a pearly white colour, with rich glaze, not unlike
                    the Medici porcelain in softness of texture. The ornaments, simple and delicate
                    arabesques, are painted under the glaze in cobalt blue only. Some pieces are
                    signed with No. 24.</p>
                <p>Saint Cloud was the next place in France where porcelain was produced, the
                    manufactory being carried on by the Chicanneau family, to whom a privilege was
                    granted in 1695. The patent mentions that they had made porcelain since 1693.
                    This early Saint-Cloud porcelain is fine in texture and glaze, and is decorated
                    in many different styles: it is pure white, moulded with slight reliefs copied
                    from the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n660/mode/1up"

                    gold with Chinese designs; or thirdly, with paintings in blues only of flowery
                    scroll-work and grotesques. It is marked either with a sun, or with “S. C.”
                    combined with “T.” (see No. 25), and other makers’ initials. Martin Lister,
                    physician to Queen Anne, in an account of his travels in France during 1698,
                    mentions a visit which he paid to the Saint-Cloud porcelain works, and speaks
                    with great admiration of their productions. The privilege was frequently renewed
                    during the first half of the 18th century, and the Saint-Cloud manufactory
                    continued to be the most important in France till the establishment of the royal
                    manufactory at Sèvres.</p>
                <p>Other places in France during this period, from 1700 to 1745, produced a certain
                    quantity of artificial porcelain. These were Lille, from 1711, marked with No.
                    26; Paris, 1722, a branch of the Saint-Cloud works; and Chantilly, from
                    1725.</p>
                <p>The porcelain of Chantilly was specially intended to imitate old Japanese ware.
                    Like the AIedici porcelain, it has a white tin enamel over the paste. It is
                    marked with a hunting-horn (see No. 27) and painter’s initials. Porcelain of
                    every variety of style was also made at Mennecy-Villeroy from 1735, under the
                    patronage of the duke of Villeroy, with whose initials, “D.V.,” all the
                    productions of the manufactory are marked. All these early varieties of
                    porcelain λvere of the artificial or soft kind, called by the French “porcelaine
                    à pâte tendre.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sèvres.</hi></p>
                <p>The increasing success and popularity of the porcelain produced in Germany and
                    England induced Louis XV. to establish a private royal manufactory of porcelain,
                    which was first started at Vincennes, with a privilege granted to Charles Adam
                    and others in 1745. In 1753 the king himself became a partner in the works, with
                    a third share in the property. The seat of the manufactory was then transferred
                    to Sèvres, and the official title was assumed of “manufacture royale de
                    porcelaine de France.” Before 1753 the royal porcelain was simply marked with
                    two crossed L’s for Louis, but from that year a date-letter was made
                    compulsory,—A for 1753 (see No. 28), B for 1754, and so on till 1777, after
                    which a new doubled alphabet was started AA (see No. 29), BB, &amp;c.; this
                    lasted down to RR (1793), and then a less regular series of marks came into use.
                    Till 1792 the date-letter was put between the crossed L’s, but in that year the
                    republic substituted the letter R. Later various royal monograms and marks were
                    used.</p>
                <p>Till about 1770 all French porcelain was artificial or “soft” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pâte tendre)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the discovery of kaolinic clays in
                    France then brought about the manufacture of natural hard porcelain <hi
                    rend="italic">(pâte duré)</hi> like that made in China and Japan. This gradually
                    superseded the soft kind, which ceased to be made at the end of the 18th
                    century. Its manufacture has recently been revived at Sèvres to some slight
                    extent. Μ. Brongniart, the director of the Sèvres porcelain works from 1800 to
                    1847, in his most valuable <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Arts</hi><hi rend="italic">Céramiques</hi> (1854), gives a full account of the
                    materials and methods used at Sèvres during all periods. The soft porcelain was
                    composed of white sand 60 per cent., nitre 22, common salt 7*2, alum 3'6, soda 3
                    ’ 6, and gypsum 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 per cent. This compound was
                    roasted at a high temperature, then ground to a fine powder, and washed with
                    boiling water. To nine parts of this mixture or frit two parts of white chalk
                    and one of a sort of pipeclay were added. The whole was again ground, and passed
                    several times through a fine silk sieve. Water was added to make the powder into
                    a paste, and it was then fit for the thrower on the wheel or the moulder. Owing
                    to the very unplastic nature of this elaborate mixture, black soap and size or
                    glue made from parchment were added to bind the paste together under the
                    moulder’s hands. The glaze used for the <hi rend="italic">pâte tendre</hi> was
                    an ordinary silico-alkaline glass, made fusible by oxide of lead. The coloured
                    decorations and gilding were added after the firing of the glaze. The hard
                    porcelain is made of natural kaolinic clays, and is glazed with almost pure
                    felspar,—both substances very hard and infusible. The superior softness and
                    richness of effect possessed by the <hi rend="italic">pâte tendre</hi> are due
                    to the fact that the paintings on the softer and more fusible glaze sink
                    slightly into it under the heat of the kiln, and are, though almost
                    imperceptibly, blended one with another. It is easy to distinguish the two
                    pastes and glazes: pieces of the one kind can be scratched by a knife, while
                    those of the other resist it. Nevertheless the difference in beauty between the
                    two kinds of porcelain has been much exaggerated, and the extravagant prices
                    which are given for the <hi rend="italic">pâte tendre</hi> are greatly due to
                    its rarity, and to its having been produced earlier than the other. The whole
                    question, in fact, of the value of Sèvres porcelain is a highly artificial and
                    conventional one, which can hardly be considered in accordance with the ordinary
                    rules or canons of art. Certain special qualities were aimed at, such as
                    brilliant colours, with absolute smoothness of surface, microscopic delicacy of
                    painting, and the most perfect accuracy and neatness of execution throughout;
                    and it must be admitted that the porcelain-makers gained their object with the
                    help of ingenuity, technical skill, and unwearied patience, which must command
                    our respect and even admiration, whatever may be our verdict as to the artistic
                    result of their labours. Still, with all possible allowances, there is no doubt
                    that rarity, the necessary result of the slow and laborious processes employed,
                    is the chief reason for the extraordinary value now set on this porcelain.</p>
                <p>The £10,000 which three flower-vases of <hi rend="italic">pâte tendre</hi>
                    fetched at a public auction a few years ago can be accounted for on no other
                    hypothesis. The colours of Sèvres porcelain are generally harsh, and out of
                    harmony with the pictures they surround; the forms of the various vessels too
                    are frequently very ungraceful, and utterly unsuited to any plastic
                    substance.</p>
                <p>The whole of this porcelain ware, in fact, labours under the serious artistic
                    disadvantage of being designed and decorated with no regard to suitability of
                    material or method; the elaborate picture-subjects would have been far more fit
                    for ivory miniature-work, and are quite without breadth of decorative effect,
                    while the shapes of the more elaborate vases are often deliberate imitations of
                    gold and “or moulu,” which in no way suggest the special properties<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n661/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0661-0638"/> of a fictile material (see fig. 69). It is
                    difficult to realize the amount of thought and labour that was spent on the
                    production of Sèvres porcelain. The chief chemists of France devoted their
                    energies to the invention of brilliant and varied pigments which would stand the
                    severe test of the kiln. The works of the best painters were used for
                    reproduction among the painted decorations of the porcelain, and many artists of
                    real talent spent their lives in painting these gaudy toys—on the whole a sad
                    waste of labour and skill.</p>
                <p>Sèvres porcelain made for actual use, such as tea-sets and dessert-services, are
                    usually painted with flowers or figure-subjects, often in many tints, and
                    enriched with gilding, but on a plain white ground. It is the purely decorative
                    pieces, such as vases and flower-vessels, that are ornamented with the greatest
                    splendour. They generally have panels with pictures on a white ground surrounded
                    by frames of gold scroll-work; the main body of the piece is covered with one
                    deep or brilliant colour. The chief colours are <hi rend="italic">gros</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bleu,</hi> a very dark blue; <hi rend="italic">bleu du roi,</hi> a
                    deep ultramarine; a brilliant turquoise blue; a bright pink, the favourite
                    colour of Madame Pompadour, but generally called “rose Du Barry”; a bright
                    yellow, a violet, and three shades of green were also used. These brilliant
                    colours are often further decorated with gold; a ground with circular groups of
                    gold spots scattered over it is called “ceil de perdrix”; other kinds of diaper
                    were also used. The most gorgeous variety of all is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >jewelled</hi><hi rend="italic">Sèvres,</hi> not made till about 1780, and
                    generally having a ground of <hi rend="italic">bleu du</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >roi</hi> or ultramarine. It is richly set with imitation jewels, chiefly
                    turquoises, pearls, and transparent rubies, made of coloured enamel pastes,
                    hardly to be distinguished in effect from real stones. They are set in gold,
                    slightly modelled in actual relief, like the gilt ornaments on the richest sort
                    of Japanese Satsuma ware.</p>
                <p>The forms of Sèvres procelain are very varied, and, in spite of the great use of
                    plaster moulds, many reproductions of the same design were rarely produced.
                    Clocks, barometers, and various other objects were made of porcelain and richly
                    decorated, and also painted panels or plaques used for furniture,—always,
                    however, with most discordant effect. Beautifully modelled statuettes in white
                    biscuit porcelain were made by some of the ablest sculptors of the 18th century;
                    these usually have pedestals elaborately gilt and painted. Perhaps the worst
                    taste of all is shown in some of the vases which have scrolls and sham
                    metal-work moulded and gilded to produce the effect of a porcelain vase set in
                    or moulu mounts,—a method of so-called decoration which was much imitated at
                    Chelsea and other porcelain works. The recent “Jones bequest” to the South
                    Kensington Museum contains a large variety of the most costly specimens of the
                    <hi rend="italic">pâte tendre</hi> of Sèvres.</p>

                    Franco-Prussian war a large new building has been constructed for this
                    manufacture, with improved kilns, arranged in the most commodious way. It is
                    near the Seine, at the entrance to the park of Saint Cloud. In the same building
                    is the important Ceramic Museum, which contains the finest collection of French
                    porcelain of all periods, and also a large series of showrooms for the
                    exhibition of the modern productions of the manufactory. About 250 hands (men
                    and women) are employed in the work; many of the painters and modellers are, as
                    of old, artists of real ability.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pâte</hi><hi rend="italic">dare,</hi> now mainly used, is
                    composed of kaolinic clay, mostly from Limousin, but also imported from
                    Cornwall; with it is mixed a proportion of white chalk and fine sand (silica).
                    Each material is finely ground between mill-stones, and carefully washed by
                    being agitated with water. The powder is allowed to settle, and the lighter
                    impurities are carried off by decantation. The various ingredients are then
                    mixed thoroughly together with enough water to bring them to the consistence of
                    cream. When the mixing process is complete the cream-like fluid is run off into
                    absorbent plaster troughs, which take up the superfluous water and leave the
                    compound in a pasty state. The paste is next turned over frequently on a floor
                    so as to expose the whole of it to the air, and it is thoroughly kneaded like
                    baker’s dough by men’s feet and hands to make it more plastic for the wheel or
                    mould. The wheel turned by the thrower’s foot is exactly like that used in Egypt
                    under the Ptolemies, or by the majolica potters, as shown in fig. 55. While
                    moulding his vessel the thrower keeps dipping his hands into a basin of fluid
                    paste (“barbotine” or slip). He also increases the smoothness of surface on the
                    revolving vessel by holding a sponge soaked in the slip between his fingers.
                    Vessels of which a number are required all exactly alike, such as a set of
                    plates, are partly shaped in a mould and partly formed by a steel “template” or
                    gauge. The thrower forces a thin disk of paste over a convex mould shaped to
                    give the inside of the plate; he then sets it, mould and all, on the revolving
                    wheel, and a steel knife-like gauge shuts down upon it, thus forming the outside
                    or back of the plate, which, as it revolves against the edge, has all
                    superfluous paste scraped from it and is accurately formed into the required
                    shape. When the plate or other vessel has been shaped it is allowed to dry, and
                    is finished by being turned on a lathe and rubbed smooth with sand-paper. The
                    handles and all projecting ornaments are moulded, or rather cast, by pouring the
                    paste in a fluid state into piece-moulds made of plaster of Paris, which take to
                    pieces and set free the casting, which is then fixed on the vessel it belongs to
                    with a little more fluid slip used as a “lute.” The moulded ornaments are
                    afterwards carefully finished by hand with ordinary modelling tools. Even
                    statuettes and groups of figures are cast and finished in this way. The vase
                    with its attached ornaments, after being thoroughly dried, is ready for the
                    first firing.</p>
                <p>The kilns are like tall circular towers tapering towards the top, about 10 feet
                    in diameter at the base inside; they are divided into four stories, with
                    perforated brick vaults between them. The fire, fed either with white wood or
                    coke, is in the lowest story; the chamber next to the fire is of course the
                    hottest, and the top one the least hot of the three. These different degrees of
                    heat are utilized according to the temperature required for each firing. Thus
                    the “raw” vessels fresh from the wheel, which only require a moderate heat to
                    prepare them for being glazed, are piled in the highest chamber, and those that
                    are being glazed in the lowest. In order to keep the white paste from being
                    discoloured by the smoke the porcelain is packed in round porcelain boxes
                    (called in English “saggers”), which fit closely one upon another and are
                    arranged in high piles. The various chambers of the kilns have small openings,
                    closed with transparent talc, through which the progress of the baking can be
                    watched, and test-bits of porcelain painted with carmine, a colour that changes
                    tint according to the heat it is subjected to, are withdrawn from time to time
                    to show what temperature has been reached. As a rule the fire is kept up for
                    about thirty-six hours, and the kiln with its contents is allowed from four to
                    six days to cool before being opened.</p>
                <p>After the first firing the porcelain is in the biscuit state, and is then ready
                    for the glaze, which is made of felspar and quartz crystals (pure silica); it is
                    finely ground with water, and the porcelain is dipped into it, until sufficient
                    of the fluid mixture adheres to the absorbent biscuit to form a coat of glaze.
                    When dry it is fired for the second time, but in the lowest and hottest
                    compartment of the kiln, this natural rock-glaze being very infusible. About
                    1600° C. is the usual temperature for this process.</p>
                <p>The painted decoration is always applied <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the glaze;
                    but within recent years a new method of under-glaze ornament has been much used,
                    called “pâte sur pâte,” similar in method to the “slip decoration” mentioned
                    above under several different heads. The biscuit ground of the vase is first
                    tinted a uniform colour, and then the same white paste of which the porcelain is
                    made is mixed with water and applied in successive layers with a brush, thus
                    producing delicate cameo-like reliefs. Very beautiful designs of figuresubjects
                    or flowers are put on in this way, and additional effect is gained by the
                    coloured ground shining through the thinner parts of the semi-transparent white
                    reliefs. The whole is then glazed in the usual way. To return to the painted
                    porcelain, when it has come from the second firing in a white highly glazed
                    state it is ready for the painter. Almost endless varieties of coloured pigments
                    are gained by the use of elaborately prepared chemical compounds, all different
                    salts of metals. In the main the blues are from cobalt, the turquoise colour
                    from copper, the rose-pink from gold, the green from chrome and copper, and the
                    violets from manganese. A far greater variety and brilliance of colour can be
                    gained in over-glaze painting than in under-glaze pigments. But the over-glaze
                    colours are very inferior in softness and decorative beauty, and are frequently
                    very harsh and gaudy. Different pigments require different temperatures, and
                    three distinct firings are used at Sèvres for the painting only: they are called
                    “grand feu,” “demi-grand feu,’ and “feu de moufle.” Pure gold for the gilt parts
                    in a very finely divided state is~ obtained by chemical solution and
                    precipitation. The gold requires a special kiln, and firing at a higher
                    temperature than the colour-pigments, and therefore, in the case of <hi
                    rend="italic">pâte</hi><hi rend="italic">dure,</hi> is applied first. The
                    colours have to be put on and fired in order according to the degree of heat
                    they require, thus very much adding to the painter’s difficulties, which are
                    also increased by the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0662-0639"/> fact that all the colours alter in the kiln, the
                    unfired pigments often bearing no resemblance to their fired state. Thus an
                    elaborately painted and gilt Sèvres vase passes through six separate firings,
                    and often a seventh when it needs final retouching.</p>
                <p>The porcelain <hi rend="italic">à pâte tendre</hi> is now made in small
                    quantities at Sèvres. Its materials have been described above. In most respects
                    it goes through the same processes as the <hi rend="italic">pâte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dure,</hi> but the gold is applied after the painting, as it
                    requires a less degree of heat to fix it on the more fusible glaze used formate
                    <hi rend="italic">tendre.</hi></p>
                <p>Modern Sèvres porcelain has two marks—first, the mark of the paste or undecorated
                    vase, painted in green; second, a mark in red or gold to show that it has been
                    painted at Sèvres. Slightly defective pieces in the white glazed state are
                    sometimes sold and decorated elsewhere. In this case the green mark is cancelled
                    by the cut of a lapidary’s wheel before it leaves the manufactory. Μ.
                    Brongniart, in his <hi rend="italic">Arts</hi><hi rend="italic">Céramiques,</hi>
                    has given a complete set of plates, showing all the processes, the machinery,
                    and the kilns used at Sèvres in his time,—that is, from 1800 to 1847. Other
                    processes are now practised. One is for making very thin cups and saucers, like
                    Eastern “egg-shell china,” which are formed by merely rinsing out a plaster
                    mould with fluid paste, when sufficient of the paste to make the thin walls of
                    the cup adheres to the absorbent mould; and thus porcelain is made much thinner
                    than it could be by use of the wheel and lathe. Another recent invention is of
                    great importance in the forming of large vases with bodies thin in proportion to
                    their size. Such would be liable to collapse from their own weight while the
                    paste was soft. To prevent this, the vase is set in an air-tight chamber, its
                    mouth being carefully closed, and the air in the chamber round, it is exhausted,
                    so that the soft vase is kept in shape by the expansive pressure of the air
                    within it. The converse method is also used in some cases, by compressed air
                    being forced into the vase. When the paste is sufficiently dry all fear of
                    failure from this cause is over. In this way vases as much as 12 feet in height
                    have been successfully made and fired.</p>
                <p>In addition to porcelain shaped and painted after the 18th-century fashions, and
                    the new <hi rend="italic">pâte sur pâte</hi> process, the present manufactory
                    produces a great deal of fine porcelain copied exactly from the fanciful and
                    elaborate wares of China and Japan, such as the delicate double cups and vases,
                    with outer shells of minute open work pierced through, and many other varieties
                    requiring great technical skill and patience. Unhappily the old faults and
                    misdirected aims still prevent the laboured products of this great factory from
                    having much real artistic value, or even strong decorative effect. The paintings
                    on the porcelain are still pictures like miniatures on ivory, and the treatment
                    and forms of the most elaborate vases are not such as would arise from a natural
                    and rational treatment of plastic clay. The ingenious resources of modern
                    chemistry have produced pigments of countless variety of tint, but they are
                    mostly over-gaudy and harsh in combination; and the modern habit, not peculiar
                    to Sèvres, of applying paintings <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the glaze, wilfully
                    rejects the special soft richness of effect which a vitreous coating gives to
                    the pigments under it.</p>

                <p>The porcelain of Germany was, from the first, composed of a hard natural paste, a
                    true kaolinic clay. Its successful production was the result of a single, almost
                    accidental, act of discovery, and not, like that of the French, of a long series
                    of experiments with dififerent materials, ending in the invention of a highly
                    artificial imitation of true porcelain. In the year 1700 a young chemist, or
                    rather alchemist, of great ability, called Frederick Böttger (1682-1719), a
                    native of Saxony, fled to Dresden under the accusation of practising magical
                    arts and searching for the “philosopher’s stone.” He was there taken under the
                    protection of Augustus II., elector of Saxony, who employed him to make
                    experiments, at first connected with medical chemistry and afterwards with the
                    composition of pastes and clays for ceramic ware. From 1701 he worked for his
                    royal patron, partly at Dresden and partly at the castle of Meissen, carefully
                    guarded, and kept in seclusion almost like a prisoner, in order that his
                    discoveries might remain secret, and also to prevent his leaving the country.
                    For nine years Böttger only produced stoneware, though of a finer and harder
                    quality than had hitherto been made (see pp. 630-31); but in 1710 he seems to
                    have been in some way set on the track of the secret of porcelain manufacture.
                    His first attempts were unsuccessful: the paste is grey and defective, and there
                    is little or no glaze. So far no real progress had been made towards the
                    discovery of true porcelain. But in 1710 a lucky accident, combined with the
                    young chemist’s ready powers of observation, revealed the true nature of the
                    required paste. Having noticed the unusual weight of some new hairpowder with
                    which his wig was dressed, he inquired what it was made of, and, finding that it
                    was a finely-powdered white clay from Aue, near Schneeberg in Saxony, he
                    procured some of the clay. He made vessels of it and fired them, and found that
                    he had discovered the material of true hard porcelain, like that from, China and
                    Japan. When Augustus II. learned the importance of the discovery he established
                    the porcelain manufactory at Meissen with Böttger as its director. This
                    establishment, 5 miles from Dresden, was more like a prison than a factory,
                    being surrounded by high walls and shut in by portcullises: none except workmen
                    were ever admitted, and they were sworn to secrecy under pain of penal servitude
                    for life. The kaolin from Aue was dug out, packed in sealed bags, and brought to
                    Meissen with every care possible to avoid betraying the secret of its
                    importance; no possible precaution was omitted, and yet, in one case at least,
                    all attemps to keep the monopoly were in vain (see below, “Vienna porcelain
                    ”).</p>
                <p>The earliest productions of the Meissen (Dresden) porcelain-works are copies from
                    the Chinese and Japanese. Some are plain white, with flowers or fruit in low
                    relief; others have painted under-glaze in blues only, like the celebrated blue
                    and white china of Nanking. The first pieces painted with other colours are
                    imitations of old Japanese china in green and red with enrichments in gold.
                    Böttger died in 1719, and -was succeeded in his directorship by George Höroldt,
                    who introduced certain improvements in the processes of the manufacture, and
                    increased the quantity of its annual production. In his time Chinese designs
                    were still copied, mostly very ugly figure-subjects on white panels, the rest of
                    the vase being coloured yellow, green, or grey, and decorated with elaborate
                    gilt scroll-work in the worst possible taste.</p>
                <p>After about 1725 the Eastern style of design was superseded by elaborate
                    miniature paintings of flowers and insects, or copies from Dutch and Flemish
                    painters. All notion of true ceramic decoration was gone, and the porcelain was
                    only regarded as a ground on which to paint an imitation of an oil - painting.
                    Another style of decoration soon came into fashion: china was decorated in
                    relief with the “honeycomb” or “may-flower” pattern. In the latter kind (see
                    fig. 70) the vessel is closely studded with blossoms of the may, moulded in a
                    realistic way, with thin crisp edges, and then coloured and gilded, very
                    laborious to execute, and extremely disagreeable<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0663-0640"/> in effect. Perhaps the chief specialty of Dresden
                    porcelain consists in its statuettes and group of figures, the best of which
                    were made between 1731 and 1756 under the superintendence of a sculptor named
                    Kandier. Some of these, especially the Watteau-like shepherds and shepherdesses,
                    have a sort of feeble prettiness; but most have only little merit, and some are
                    grotesque and wilfully ugly. They are generally decorated with colours and
                    gilding; the best, however, are in plain glazed white. Elaborate candelabra,
                    clocks, and other objects were largely made, into the designs of which figures
                    in the round, flowers realistically modelled, and rococo scroll-work were
                    introduced, generally in a feeble and ungraceful way. For some years after 1774
                    designs of more classical form, purer in outline and less crowded with clumsy
                    ornament, came into fashion. Since then nothing of any real value has been
                    produced in the Dresden china-works. Of late years, since the increase of prices
                    given for old Dresden, the directors of the manufactory have begun to reproduce
                    their old designs, and even to use some of the worn-out moulds; the result is
                    that the china thus produced is very blunt and spiritless, quite devoid of
                    merit.</p>
                <p>The old Dresden porcelain is of a fine paste, and has a good glaze, but its white
                    is of a rather cold tint, occasionally even having a bluish shade. It is,
                    however, both in quality of material and in design, the best porcelain that
                    Germany has produced. During the early period the monogram “AR” interlaced (for
                    Augustus Rex) marks the pieces made either for the king’s use or from his
                    design. Between 1712 and 1715 pieces made for sale were marked with a
                    rudely-sketched snake twining round a stick. Since 1721 two crossed swords have
                    been used as a general mark; the addition of a dot or star marks special periods
                    (see No. 30). The swords were the arms of the elector of Saxony as arch-marshal
                    of the empire. Some pieces have “MPM” for “Meissenen Porzellan Manufactur.” As
                    at Sèvres, china from Dresden, if sold undecorated, has the cross-swords mark
                    cancelled by the cut of a wheel. In 1863 the china-works were moved from the
                    fortress of Meissen and established in a new and more convenient building.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vienna Porcelain.—</hi> In 1720 one of the workmen escaped from
                    the prison-like manufactory of Meissen and brought the secrets of the porcelain
                    clay to Vienna, where he set up kilns and workshops in partnership with a
                    Frenchman named Du Pasquier. They obtained a special patent, but had little
                    practical success; and the Vienna porcelain was not made in large quantities
                    till after 1744, when the manufactory was carried on under the patronage of
                    Maria Theresa and the emperor Joseph. In 1785 there were thirty-five kilns in
                    working order, and 500 work-people were employed. Vienna porcelain is not of a
                    pure white, but is greyish in tint; its paintings are very poor, and it depends
                    for its effect chiefly on gilt-moulded scroll-work in delicate relief. Its
                    manufacture was suspended in 1864 on account of the heavy expense it entailed on
                    the Austrian Government.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Berlin porcelain</hi> was first made in 1751 by a potter named
                    Wegely, who marked his ware with No. 31. It was not, however, a commercial
                    success till Frederick the Great took it in hand. He sent a number of skilled
                    workmen from the Meissen (Dresden) china-works to Berlin, and also ordered the
                    manufactory to be supplied with the kaolinic clay from Aue, of which Meissen
                    hitherto had preserved the monopoly. In quality the Berlin porcelain comes next
                    to that of Dresden; it is often decorated with a bright rose-pink, the favourite
                    colour of Frederick, which was unknown at the Meissen works. Large quantities of
                    porcelain are still made at Berlin.</p>

                <p>A very large number of other places in Germany produced hard natural porcelain
                    during the 18th century, but none of their work is of any special interest or
                    beauty. It became, in fact, the fashion for every king or reigning prince to be
                    the patron of a porcelain manufactory. Porcelain was produced at Amsterdam and
                    The Hague; at Brussels, Copenhagen, and Zurich; and in Russia at St Petersburg
                    and Moscow.</p>
                <p>In Italy also fine soft porcelain was made,—at Doccia as early as 1735, some of
                    which, ornamented in under-glaze blues only, is very decorative and in good
                    taste. Venice produced clever copies of Japanese porcelain, painted with
                    chrysanthemums and other flowers in enamel. The royal manufactory at Capo di
                    Monte, close to Naples, founded in 1736 by Charles III., produced a great deal
                    of porcelain decorated in many styles, mostly in very bad taste.</p>
                <p>The best are Oriental designs painted in blues only. The accompanying marks (No.
                    32) were used, the fleur-de-lis in 1736, the crowned N after 1759, and the RF
                    after 1780. All the Italian porcelain is of the soft artificial sort.</p>
                <p>The porcelain-works in the Buen-Retiro gardens at Madrid were also established by
                    Charles III. after he succeeded to the throne of Spain. Much of this (soft)
                    porcelain is classical in form, and is decorated with miniature paintings in
                    colours or monochrome. Charles III. transferred thirty-two workmen and painters
                    from Capo di Monte when he founded the</p>
                <p>Buen-Retiro manufactory, and hence the productions of the two factories are very
                    similar in style. One of the marks used, the lis, was common to both; the usual
                    forms on the Buen-Retiro porcelain were those in No. 33.</p>

                <p>The early history of English porcelain is rather obscure. John Dwight (see p. 632
                    above) was apparently the first English manufacturer who took out a patent for
                    the production of transparent porcelain; but no specimens made by him are now
                    known.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chelsea Porcelain.—</hi> According to Jewitt <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ceramic Art of Great Britain),</hi> John Dwight probably founded the
                    porcelain-works at Chelsea, which rank first among English manufactories both in
                    date and importance. In 1745 they were in full activity; and the popularity in
                    France of English porcelain was one of the causes which led to tħe establishment
                    of the royal manufactory at Sèvres. The owner of the Chelsea works was a
                    Frenchman called Nicholas Spremont, who continued to manufacture fine porcelain
                    till his retirement from business in 1764.</p>
                <p>This porcelain is very varied in style, as was the case with most of the
                    18th-century makes. Some of it is simply imitated from Eastern china, either in
                    blue and white, or in the old Japanese style, which was then so popular, chiefly
                    painted in rich red and green, with a good deal of gilding. Other pieces, more
                    elaborate and costly, resemble Sèvres porcelain, and have miniature paintings on
                    white panels, the rest of the vase being coloured with one uniform tint, such as
                    the French <hi rend="italic">bleu du roi</hi> or “rose Pompadour.” One colour,
                    peculiar to Chelsea, is a deep claret-red. Most of the vases have a great deal
                    of gilding, both applied in patterns on the body of the vase, and also used
                    solidly to decorate the elaborate moulded scrollwork which was fixed on the
                    sides of the porcelain. The writhing masses of gold on Chelsea ware are probably
                    the most meaningless and stupid attempts at decoration<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0664-0641"/> that have ever been produced. Many of them are
                    designed with apparently not even an attempt at beauty of form or gracefulness
                    of curve, and are quite without the vigour that is often possessed by the
                    grotesques of China or Japan.</p>
                <p>Chelsea vases of this elaborate sort are rare, as their production was slow, and
                    they now fetch very high prices: £2000 has been given for a single vase such as
                    that shown in fig. 71.</p>
                <p>It should be observed that, till the discovery of the half-decomposed kaolinic
                    clay of Cornwall about 1755 by Cookworthy, all English porcelain was of the soft
                    variety (à <hi rend="italic">pâte tendre),</hi> and was really an artificial
                    compound with an ordinary vitreous lead glaze. The painted decoration, like that
                    of Sèvres, was applied <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the glaze, with the exception
                    of a fine cobalt blue, which was painted on the china in a biscuit state. This
                    colour is much the finest and most truly decorative of any of the pigments, very
                    superior in richness of effect to the much brighter over-glaze colours. That
                    used at the Derby porcelain-works is the most beautiful in tint.</p>
                <p>The early success of the Chelsea porcelain was partly due to the patronage of
                    George II., who, following the royal fashion of the age, took a great interest
                    in the manufactory, and not only bought large quantities of its productions but
                    also aided it by importing kaolinic clay, models, and even skilled workmen from
                    Saxony. In 1769 the Chelsea porcelain-works were put up to auction, and bought
                    by William Duesbury, the owner of the Derby china-factory. Till 1784 he carried
                    on the manufacture of porcelain at both places, but in that year he pulled down
                    the Chelsea kilns and transferred all the movable plant and the workmen to
                    Derby. The Chelsea mark is usually an anchor, either painted in red or gold, or
                    moulded in relief; the anchor is often double (see No. 34), and in some cases
                    has the addition of one or more daggers. Some specimens first noted by Mr.
                    Jewitt<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See “History of
                    Chelsea China,” in <hi rend="italic">Art Journal</hi> for 1863.</p></note> have
                    quite different marks, incised on the paste before glazing, which are of special
                    interest as being the earliest dated specimens of English porcelain. Such marks
                    are a triangle, with the addition “Chelsea 1745.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bow Porcelain</hi> (Stratford-le-Bow).—In 1744 Edward Heylyn
                    and Thomas Frye, the latter a painter of some repute, took out a patent for the
                    manufacture of porcelain at Bow. The composition they used was a curious one,
                    being almost a hard porcelain. The clay, which was called “unaker,” was brought
                    from America, and was probably an impure kind of kaolin. It was ground and
                    washed to separate the sand and mica; and to it was added pounded glass—a pure
                    alkaline silicate—varying in proportion from equal parts of clay and glass to
                    one-fifth of glass. The glaze was a similar mixture, with less of the American
                    kaolinic clay. This paste and glaze must have been difficult to manage, since in
                    1748 the partners took out a fresh patent for a more artificial and softer kind
                    of porcelain, with a more fusible lead glaze. In 1750 the Bow works came into
                    the hands of Messrs Weatherby and Crowther, and were then called “New Canton.”
                    For some time the manufactory was successful, and employed 300 hands; but before
                    long one of the partners died, and the survivor, “John Crowther, <hi
                    rend="italic">chinaman,”</hi> was gazetted bankrupt in 1763, and the whole stock
                    was sold off. Crowther, however, in spite of his failure, carried on the works
                    till 1775, when they were bought by William Duesbury, the owner of the Chelsea,
                    Derby, and other chinafactories ∙, he pulled down the Bow kilns and transferred
                    the plant to Derby, as he did afterwards in the case of the Chelsea manufactory.
                    The Bow porcelain is of a fine soft milky white; many of the imitations of
                    Chinese figures are hardly to be distinguished from the originals. Some of the
                    Bow china, decorated only in the rich underglaze blue, with Eastern designs, is
                    very effective.</p>
                <p>A good many pieces are painted in the Dresden style, and coloured statuettes or
                    groups of figures, also after German models, were largely produced. The Bow
                    marks are very numerous, some not distinguishable from those of Chelsea; No. 35
                    shows four varieties.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Derby porcelain</hi> is supposed to have been made as early as
                    1750, possibly by Andrew Planché, a clever French refugee, who in 1756 entered
                    into partnership with Heath and Duesbury, the last of whom afterwards became the
                    chief china-manufacturer of England. The purchase by Duesbury of the Bow and
                    Chelsea works has already been mentioned. The Derby porcelain is often very
                    large, elaborately moulded, and profusely decorated, generally rather in the
                    Dresden style, weak in form and gaudy in colour. The Derby under-glaze blue was
                    remarkably fine, and many of the plain blue and white pieces, with Chinese
                    patterns, are highly decorative, as are also, though in a less degree, those
                    porcelain services that were painted in the “old Japanese style.” One of the
                    chief specialties of the Derby works was the production of delicate white
                    figures in biscuit china, often modelled with great skill and refinement.
                    Unfortunately the practice of <hi rend="italic">printing</hi> the under-glaze
                    patterns, instead of painting them by hand, was introduced at Derby about 1764,
                    and did much to destroy all the artistic value of the work (see below). The
                    marks used were these,—first a “D” combined with an anchor (No. 36), or a
                    crowned anchor (No. 37), used during the earlier part of the time when Duesbury
                    was carrying on both the Chelsea and the Derby factories, 1769-84; next the
                    crown was used, either over the “D” only (No. 38), or, more usually, with a
                    saltire or crossed swords immediately under it. Another variety has crossed
                    lines under the crown (No. 39). The Derby works continued in the possession of
                    the Duesbury family till 1814 or 1815, when Robert Bloor became the lessee and
                    finally <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n665/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0665-0642"/> the owner of the place. He soon realized a large
                    fortune, though to some extent at the expense of the credit and high reputation
                    for excellence of work which had been gained and kept up by the various members
                    of the Duesbury family. He gained a great deal of money by selling oft' the
                    stock, accumulated during many years, of slightly defective pieces of porcelain,
                    which the Duesbury family would not allow to go into the market.<note

                    >Worcester Porcelain.—</hi> The china-works at Worcester were founded by a very
                    remarkable man—Dr Wall, who appears to have possessed unusual skill as a
                    physician, artist, and chemist. After some years spent in attempts to discover a
                    fine artificial porcelain, he, in conjunction with other practical men and
                    capitalists, started the Worcester Porcelain Company in 1751. The early
                    productions of this factory are very artistic; they are chiefly copies of the
                    fine Nanking porcelain, painted under-glaze in blues only, with very boldly
                    decorative designs. Old Japanese ware was also successfully imitated. After that
                    the most ambitious pieces of Worcester porcelain were mostly dull reproductions
                    of the elaborately painted wares of Sèvres and Chelsea. Transfer printing was
                    first used at Worcester for designs on china in 1756, though it had been
                    invented and employed some years earlier for the decoration of the Battersea
                    enamelled copper. This process was no less injurious at Worcester than elsewhere
                    to the artistic value of the paintings. Dr Wall died in 1776, and after that the
                    porcelain-works passed through various hands. A great impetus was given to its
                    success by George III., who visited the factory in 1788 and granted it the title
                    of “The Royal Porcelain Works.” The earliest marks are a “W” or a crescent;
                    others used are crossed arrows or varieties of sham Chinese marks (see No.
                    40).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For fuller
                    information, see Binns, <hi rend="italic">Potting in Worcester,</hi>
                    1865.</p></note> The manufacture of china at Worcester is still continued with
                    great activity; the fineness of the paste and the skilful processes employed
                    leave nothing to be desired. Unfortunately the old fault of a too realistically
                    pictorial style of painted decoration still prevails, and an immense amount of
                    artistic skill and patient labour is practically wasted in producing minute but
                    not truly decorative work. Some of the modern Worcester copies of Eastern
                    porcelain and enamels are very delicate and beautiful, and the cameo-like method
                    of <hi rend="italic">pâte sur pâte</hi> decoration is practised with great skill
                    and often good effect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bristol porcelain</hi> is of interest as being the first hard
                    natural porcelain made in England. As early as 1766 attempts were made by
                    Richard Champion to make an artificial paste, with the help of the American
                    “unaker” or kaolinic clay, which was being used successfully at Bow, but no
                    results of any importance seem to have followed his experiments. The successful
                    production of Bristol porcelain was due to the discovery in Cornwall of large
                    beds of kaolinic “growan” stone or “china” stone, first brought into use by
                    William Cookworthy, a Plymouth potter. This discovery and the succeeding one of
                    similar beds in Devonshire were of great commercial importance to England, and
                    the beds have ever since produced enormous quantities of material for the
                    manufacture of fine hard porcelain both in England and abroad.</p>
                <p>This china stone (see Cock, <hi rend="italic">Treatise on China Clay,</hi> 1880)
                    is not a pure kaolinic clay like that found in China, but is simply a granitic
                    rock, partially decomposed, and soft and friable, but still retaining both
                    quartz and mica in addition to the felspar, which is the essential base of
                    kaolin. In China the processes of nature have carried the decomposition and
                    sorting of the different com ponent parts of granite to a further stage. There
                    the decomposed felspar has, by the action of rain and running streams, been
                    deposited in an almost pure and finely-divided state in beds by itself, almost
                    free from quartz and flakes of mica. In using the Cornish china stone,
                    therefore, various natural processes have to be artificially performed before
                    the paste is sufficiently white and pure for use; but when this is done it is
                    little if any inferior to the Chinese kaolin. The stone when dug out is white
                    with grey specks, and is so friable as to be easily reduced to powder between
                    millstones. It is agitated with water, and run through a series of settling
                    troughs; thus the lighter flakes of mica, which are very injurious to the paste,
                    are washed away, and the pure felspathic kaolin is deposited free from
                    impurities. Free silica is added in a fixed proportion; it is usually obtained
                    from flints, first calcined and then finely ground to powder, which are an
                    important ingredient in the composition of both fine pottery and porcelain. The
                    Jermyn Street Museum has a complete collection of all the materials used in
                    china manufacture.</p>
                <p>William Cookwortlιy at once recognized the value of his discovery, and set up
                    china-works both at Plymouth and at Bristol. No. 41 shows the mark of the
                    Plymouth porcelain, and No. 42 those that were used at Bristol. In 1774 he sold
                    the Bristol factory to Richard Champion, still retaining a large royalty on the
                    china stone. Champion signed his ware with No. 43. The production of Bristol
                    porcelain continued till 1781, when the works were sold to a Staffordshire
                    company, and the manufacture of hard porcelain was no longer carried on there.
                    Though fine in paste and unusually transparent, the Bristol porcelain has no
                    special artistic merits. As with most other English wares, the best in colour
                    and design are copies, with more or less adaptation from Eastern china; some of
                    them are very large and magnificent. The figures and flower-reliefs in biscuit
                    porcelain are also delicate, and often cleverly modelled, with wonderful
                    realism.</p>
                <p>Some fine blue and white china was produced towards the end of the last century
                    at Lowestoft, and at Liverpool as early as 1756; and many other china-works were
                    established in various parts of England. In the beginning of the present century
                    Swansea and Nantgarw in South Wales produced porcelain which was highly
                    esteemed; but the delicate shades of difference in the paste, glazes, and styles
                    of decoration of these numerous varieties of British porcelain are not such as
                    can be described in a few words; nothing but careful examination of the wares
                    themselves will enable the student to distinguish between the productions of the
                    different manufactories. Swansea ware bears various marks, of which No. 44 is
                    one example.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Modern Methods of Manufacture.—</hi> The methods and materials
                    now employed at Sèvres in the production of porcelain are in all essential
                    points much the same as those practised elsewhere (see above). The chief centre
                    in England of the manufacture of pottery or non-translucent earthenware is in
                    Staffordshire, near the borders of Cheshire, where a large district devoted to
                    this industry goes by the name of “The Potteries.” Worcester, Lambeth, and many
                    other places in England also turn out annually large quantities of pottery. The
                    processes employed may be divided under the following heads: —(1) choice and
                    mixture of clays; (2) washing and grinding the materials; (3) throwing on the
                    wheel and moulding; (4) kilns and methods of firing; (5) glazes; (6) pigments
                    and methods of decoration.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Choice and Mixture of Clays. —</hi> The extensive beds of
                    fine Dorset or Poole clay supply the chief ingredient in the manufacture of
                    English pottery. This is too fat a clay to be used alone, and is therefore mixed
                    with a certain proportion of free silica to prevent it from twisting or cracking
                    in the kiln. Another ingredient is added to the mixture for the finer wares,
                    namely, the Cornish or Devonian china stone, a kaolinic substance used in the
                    manufacture of porcelain (see above), which makes the paste finer in texture,
                    whiter, harder, and less brittle. These three substances are mixed in various
                    proportions. The following makes a fine cream-coloured ware,—Dorset clay 56 to
                    66 parts, silica (flint) 14 to 20, china stone 17 to 30 parts.</p>

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Washing and Grinding the Materials.—</hi> The Dorset or
                    Poole clay is finely ground between mill-stones, mixed with water to the
                    consistency of cream or slip, and then passed through fine silk sieves to strain
                    out all grit or palpable particles.- The china stone is treated in the same way,
                    with the additional precaution of washing away all the flakes of mica, which
                    come from the decomposition of the granitic rock from which the china stone is
                    derived. The silica is obtained from flints, which are easily ground to fine
                    powder after being heated red-hot and thrown into water. These three substances,
                    brought into the state of fluid slip, are repeatedly pumped up from vats and
                    passed through the sieves; they are then easily mixed in due proportion by being
                    pumped into graduated vats. The water is next evaporated from the fluid mixture
                    in large boilers heated by a complicated arrangement of flues, and the compound
                    is left in a soft pasty state, full of air-bubbles, which have to be got rid of
                    by constantly turning over and beating the paste till it is quite smooth and
                    compact, and sufficiently plastic to be thrown on the wheel. Coloured
                    earthenware, such as that Wedgwood used to make, was prepared by the addition of
                    various substances to the fluid slip. A black colour was given by protoxide of
                    iron and manganese, red by red ochres or red oxide of iron, blue by oxide of
                    cobalt, and green by protoxide of chrome. These coloured pastes are but little
                    used now.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Throwing and Moulding.—</hi> After sufficient kneading, the
                    clay is made up into balls of a convenient size for the thrower to mould into
                    shape upon his wheel. The methods both of throwing and of moulding are the same
                    for porcelain as for pottery (see p. 638 above). Unfortunately in England, as at
                    Sèvres, the thrown vessels are usually finished on the lathe; only the commonest
                    kinds of ware escape this process, which takes away all life and spirit from the
                    wheel-formed pottery. Consequently it is the cheapest and commonest wares that
                    now, as a rule, have most natural beauty of form and really artistic spirit.
                    Handles and other parts which are shaped in piece-moulds are either cast by
                    pouring fluid slip into the plastermoulds, or are formed by pressing and dabbing
                    thinly-rolled pieces of soft clay into moulds made in two parts. The moulded
                    halves of the spout or handle are fastened together while still wet, and the
                    edges at the junction pared down and trimmed with a modelling tool. Plates,
                    basins, and the like are formed by the combination of a mould and a shaped gauge
                    as described above (Sèvres).</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Kilns and Firing.—</hi> After the vessel with its moulded
                    handles or spout is thoroughly dry it is ready for the first firing. The usual
                    Staffordshire biscuit-kiln is a circular building, about 18 feet in internal
                    diameter at the base, narrowing towards the top. It is about 18 to 20 feet high,
                    and is very carefully built of refractory fire-bricks, strengthened by rings of
                    wrought-iron which clasp the outside. It is surrounded by eight to ten furnace
                    openings, with flues arranged to distribute the heat equally throughout the
                    kiln. The pottery is fired in drum-shaped “saggers” or boxes, made of fireclay,
                    which are piled one above the other, as in the case of the Sèvres porcelain. The
                    fire is kept up from thirty to fifty hours, and is then allowed to die out.
                    Several days are allowed for cooling before the kiln is opened and the saggers
                    with their contents withdrawn.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Glazes.—</hi> The composition of glazes for pottery varies
                    very much according to the custom of each manufacturer. For the most part they
                    are transparent silicates of alumina, rendered fusible by oxide of lead; this
                    compound is made by a mixture of Cornish china stone, flint, and white lead. The
                    best quality of glazes have borax and some alkali added as a flux, in which case
                    the proportion of lead is reduced. Those glazes that contain much lead are
                    easily scratched, and can be decomposed by many acids; thus there is always a
                    risk of lead-poisoning if vessels coated in this way are used for cooking
                    purposes. . The materials for the glaze are finely ground with water and made
                    into a thin white fluid. The biscuit pottery is rapidly dipped into vats of the
                    milky mixture, and sufficient to form the glaze adheres to the absorbent clay in
                    an even coating all over the surface. After being dried the pottery is ready for
                    the second firing in the glazing kiln, which is very similar in construction to
                    the biscuit-kiln, only, as a rule, rather smaller. It is packed in clay saggers,
                    as in the first firing, but a stronger heat is required to fuse the finer kinds
                    of glaze than was necessary for the baking of the raw pottery. Salt-glazing has
                    been described above (p. 632), and is only used for the coarser sorts of
                    ware.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Methods of Decoration.—</hi> In the ease of pottery
                    decoration is usually applied on the biscuit-ware <hi rend="italic">before</hi>
                    it is glazed by the transfer-printing process. The required design is engraved
                    on copper plates; the pigment is ground fine and mixed with a tenacious compound
                    of oil and gums. An ordinary rolling press is used to print the engraved
                    patterns in the oily pigment upon strips of tissue-paper, which are carefully
                    applied and pressed face downwards on the biscuit-ware while the oil is yet wet;
                    and so the pattern is transferred to the absorbent clay. This requires great
                    dexterity from the difficulty there is in fitting the printed strips neatly on
                    to curved surfaces. The paper is then washed off, and the printed ware is baked
                    at a moderate temperature in what is called the “hardening” kiln, which is done
                    before the glaze is applied, in order to drive off <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> the oily medium with which the pigment was mixed. The transfer process is
                    quite fatal to all artistic beauty in the designs; it is hard, clumsy, and
                    mechanical, the very opposite of a rational method for the decoration of
                    pottery, which above all things demands freedom of hand and a spirited touch.
                    Painted decoration which is executed by hand is now usually applied <hi
                    rend="italic">over</hi> the glaze, both because it is easier to do, not
                    requiring so certain a touch, and also because the soft subdued colours of the
                    under-glaze pigments do not suit the modern taste for what is bright and showy.
                    The pigments used are necessarily oxides and salts of metals which will stand
                    the heat of the kiln. * Only those few which can stand the very high temperature
                    of the glazing kiln can be used under the glaze. The over-glaze colours, on the
                    other hand, only need sufficient heat to fix them on the surface of the already
                    fired glaze; and this is often done in a very slight and imperfect way. These
                    colours not only lose in effect from want of the softening vitreous coat through
                    which under-glaze colours are seen, but they are also very inferior through
                    being unprotected, and therefore easily injured by scratches and ordinary wear.
                    In old times the value of a protecting coat of glaze was so strongly felt that
                    even paintings on enamel, like those on Persian pottery and Italian majolica,
                    usually had a thin vitreous glaze added <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the smooth
                    enamel, with the double object of protecting the painting and increasing its
                    soft richness of effect.</p>
                <p>The discoveries of modern chemistry have added very greatly to the number of
                    metallic salts which are available for the decoration of pottery. Almost every
                    possible tint can be produced for overglaze painting. Oxides of cobalt are used
                    for various shades of blue and grey up to black; antimony, usually combined with
                    lead, gives yellow; oxides of copper give deep red or brilliant blues and greens
                    according to the proportion of oxygen that they contain; oxide of chromium gives
                    a good quiet green; manganese gives violet and even black; gold gives a fine
                    ruby red; and uranium a rich orange. The various oxides of iron give a great
                    variety of colours,—reds, yellows, and browns. Oxide of zinc is largely used,
                    not as a pigment in itself, but in combination, to modify other colours. The
                    oxides of iron, cobalt, and chromium give very stable colours, capable of
                    bearing a very high temperature, and can therefore be used for under-glaze
                    painting; most of the others can only be employed for over-glaze work.
                    Over-glaze pigments cannot be used alone, but require a flux to make them
                    combine with the glaze. Oxide of lead, borax, nitre, carbonates of potash or
                    soda, and other substances are used for this purpose.</p>

                    The Musée Céramique of Sèvres is the best and most complete for the student of
                    all kinds of pottery. In England the Jermyn Street Museum of Geology has a small
                    but very widely-illustrative collection of pottery and the various materials
                    used in its manufacture. The South Kensington Museum is rich in almost all kinds
                    of mediaeval and modern pottery, but it is unfortunately very badly arranged.
                    The British Museum possesses a very large number of specimens of prehistoric
                    pottery, Greek vases, mediaeval English, and very choice examples of Persian and
                    majolica wares. The other chief European museums are mostly each rich in some
