                    was called a province.</p></note> But when, with the spread of the Roman arms,
                    the government of conquered countries grew to be one of the most important
                    duties of the higher magistrates, the term province, from designating the
                    government of a conquered country as one particular duty of a Roman magistrate,
                    came to be used generally as a designation of the country itself. It is to
                    province in the sense of a subject territory lying outside of Italy and governed
                    by Roman magistrates that the following remarks will apply. As distinguished
                    from Italy, the provinces paid tribute to Rome, for, at least from the time of
                    the Gracchi, it was a recognized constitutional principle that the provinces
                    were the estates of the Roman people and were to be managed for its benefit.
                    Under the republic the constitution of a province was drawn up by the victorious
                    Roman general assisted by ten commissioners appointed by the senate from its own
                    body, and the province was henceforth governed on the lines laid down in this
                    constitution or charter <hi rend="italic">(lex provincial).</hi> For
                    administrative purposes the province was divided into districts, each with its
                    capital, the magistrates and council of which were responsible for the
                    collection of the district taxes. For judicial purposes the province was divided
                    into circuits <hi rend="italic">(conventus),</hi> and in the chief town of each
                    circuit the governor of the province regularly held assizes.</p>
                <p>Cities taken by the sword were destroyed, and their lands were turned into Roman
                    domains and were let out by the censors at Rome to private persons, who
                    undertook to pay a certain proportion of the produce. Royal domains, such as
                    those of Syracuse, Macedonia, Pergamum, <pb break="no"

                <p>Bithynia, and Cyrene, were also confiscated. On the other hand communities which
                    surrendered without offering an obstinate resistance were usually allowed to
                    retain their personal freedom and private property, and their chief town was
                    left in the enjoyment of its territory and civil rights, but all the lands were
                    subjected to a tax, consisting either of a payment in kind <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vectigal)</hi> or of a fixed sum of money <hi rend="italic">(tributum,
                    stipendium),</hi> and in some cases a custom-duty <hi rend="italic"
                    >(portorium)</hi> was levied. It is to this latter class of communities (the <hi
                    rend="italic">civitates vectigales</hi> or <hi rend="italic">stipendiariae)</hi>
                    that the large majority of the provincial states belonged. In a better position
                    were those states whose freedom was guaranteed by Rome on the ground of old
                    alliances or special loyalty. Their freedom was recognized either by a treaty or
                    by a decree of the Roman people or senate. As a decree of the people or senate
                    could at any time be recalled, the position of the free states without a treaty
                    was more precarious than that of the treaty states <hi rend="italic"
                    >(civitates</hi><hi rend="italic">foederatae).</hi> The latter, though not
                    allowed to meddle in foreign politics, enjoyed a certain amount of internal
                    freedom, retained their lands, paid no taxes, and were bound to render those
                    services only which were expressly stipulated for in the original treaty, such
                    as furnishing ships and troops, supplying corn at a certain price, and receiving
                    Roman officials and soldiers <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >route.</hi> Amongst these treaty states were Massilia (Marseilles), Athens,
                    Rhodes, and Tyre. The privileges of the free but not treaty states were somewhat
                    similar, but, as stated, more precarious. All political distinctions, save that
                    between slave and freeman, disappeared when Caracalla bestowed the Roman
                    franchise on the whole empire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Provincial Diets.—</hi> Apart from the government by Roman
                    officials, every province appears to have had, at least under the empire, a
                    provincial assembly or diet of its own <hi rend="italic">(concilium</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">commune),</hi> and these diets are interesting as the first
                    attempts at representative assemblies. The diet met annually, and was composed
                    of deputies <hi rend="italic">(legati)</hi> from the provincial districts. It
                    arranged for the celebration of religious rites and games, especially (under the
                    empire) for the worship of the emperor, the neglect of which was severely
                    punished. The actual celebration was under the conduct of the high priest of the
                    province, a person of much dignity and importance, perhaps the forerunner of the
                    Christian bishop. The diet also decreed the erection of statues and monuments;
                    it passed votes of thanks to the outgoing governor, or forwarded complaints
                    against him to Rome; and it had the right of sending embassies direct to the
                    senate or the emperor.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Provincial Governor.—</hi> The provinces were administered
                    by governors sent direct from Rome, who held office for a year. From the
                    formation of the first provinces in 227 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> down to
                    the time of Sulla (82 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) the governors were
                    praetors (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Praetor)</hi>; from the time of Sulla to that
                    of Augustus the praetors remained in Rome during their year of office, and at
                    the end of it assumed the government of a province with the title of propraetor.
                    This applies, however, only to provinces which were in a settled state and could
                    consequently be administered without a large military force. A province which
                    was the seat of war, or was at least in a disturbed state, was committed to the
                    care either of one of the consuls for the year or of a commander specially
                    appointed for the purpose with the title of proconsul, who might be one of the
                    consuls of the preceding or of a previous year, or else a former praetor, or
                    even, in rare cases, a private individual who had held neither consulship nor
                    praetorship. Thus the distinction between consular (or proconsular) and
                    praetorial (or propraetorial) provinces varied from year to year with the
                    military exigencies of different parts of the empire. At the close of the
                    republic, however, we find even such a peaceful province as Asia administered by
                    a proconsul. In the earlier period of the republic the senate either before or
                    after the elections determined which provinces were to be governed by consuls
                    and which by praetors, and after their election the consuls arranged between
                    themselves by lot or otherwise which of the provinces nominated by the senate
                    each should have, and similarly with the praetors. But in order to guard against
                    partiality the Sempronian law of 123 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> provided
                    that the senate should yearly nominate the two consular provinces before the
                    election of the consuls, and that the consuls should after their election but
                    before their entry on office arrange between themselves which of the two
                    provinces each should have. The Pompeian law of 53 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> enacted that no one should hold the governorship of a province till
                    at least five years after his consulship or praetorship. This law was repealed
                    by Caesar after the battle of Pharsalia, but was re-enacted under Augustus; it
                    severed the connexion which had previously existed between an urban magistracy
                    and the governorship of a province, and turned the latter, from the mere
                    prolongation of a Roman magistracy, into an independent office. Like
                    magistracies at Rome a provincial governorship was regularly held for one year;
                    but, unlike them, it could be prolonged, formerly by a vote of the people, later
                    by a decree of the senate. The Julian law of Caesar (46 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> enacted that the governorship of a consular province should be held
                    for two, that of a praetorian province for one year. The necessary supplies of
                    men and money were voted to the governor by the senate. His staff consisted of
                    one or more lieutenants <hi rend="italic">(legati),</hi> a quaestor, and <hi
                    rend="subscript"> v</hi> numerous subordinates. The lieutenants were nominated
                    by the senate from men of senatorial rank; if they proved incompetent, the
                    governor dismissed them; if they showed ability, he entrusted them with military
                    or judicial functions. As to the quaestor, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Quaestor.</hi> Besides these the governor took with him from Rome a number of
                    young men of the upper classes to assist him in the government. These were known
                    as the companions <hi rend="italic">(comites')</hi> or suite of the governor,
                    sometimes, but incorrectly, as the praetorian cohort (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Praetorians).</hi> These members of his suite were chosen by the governor
                    himself, who was responsible for them, but they were maintained at the expense
                    of the state, and under the empire received regular pay. In addition there was a
                    crowd of beadles, clerks, couriers, criers, doctors, dragomans, &amp;c., not to
                    speak of freedmen and slaves for the personal service of the governor. Under the
                    republic the governor was not allowed to take his wife with him to his province;
                    under the empire he might do so, but he was answerable for her conduct. Before
                    setting out for his province the governor, clad in the purple military robe of
                    his office, offered sacrifice on the Capitol; then immediately after receiving
                    the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> or military command he marched out of the
                    city (for the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> could only be exercised outside of
                    Rome and was forfeited by staying in the city), preceded by his sergeants <hi
                    rend="italic">(lictores),</hi> and accompanied by his suite. He was bound to
                    travel direct to his province; the means of transport were supplied partly by
                    the state, partly by the provinces through which he travelled. His year of
                    office began from the day he set foot in his province, but the time of arrival
                    varied with the length and difficulty of the route. In the hands of the governor
                    all powers military and civil were united. He commanded all the troops in the
                    province, and had power to raise levies of Roman citizens as well as of
                    provincials, and to make requisitions of war material. He possessed both
                    criminal and civil jurisdiction; as criminal judge he had the power of life and
                    death, and from his sentence none but Roman citizens could appeal; as civil
                    judge he was guided partly by the charter of the province <hi rend="italic"
                    >(lex</hi><hi rend="italic">provinciae),</hi> partly by the edict which it was
                    customary for him to issue before his entrance on office (compare <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Praetor),</hi> partly by the original laws of the country so
                    far as their validity was acknowledged by the charter or by the governor’s own
                    edict. Under the empire Gaius wrote a commentary on the provincial edict, and it
                    is usually supposed that this was a general edict drawn up for use in all the
                    provinces and superseding all separate edicts for the different provinces.
                    Mommsen, however, is of opinion that Gaius only commented on the edict of a
                    particular province.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Condition</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi><hi rend="italic">the
                    Provinces under the Republic.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Under the republic
                    the Roman people regarded the provinces as so many estates from which they were
                    to derive revenue. The weal or woe of the provincials was of no moment, but the
                    development of the material resources of the provinces was of great moment.
                    Hence agriculture and commerce were encouraged, settlements were made, roads and
                    aqueducts were constructed; in short, the Roman aimed at exploiting his empire
                    by a system of prudent economy as far as possible removed from the blind
                    rapacity which has turned the empire of the Turk from a garden into a
                    wilderness. But the Roman governors were too apt to look on their provinces as
                    their own peculiar prey; they had usually bought their way to office at vast
                    expense, and they now sought in the provinces the means of reimbursing
                    themselves for the expenditure they had incuιτed at Rome. The annual change of
                    governor was thus a frightful calamity to the provincials, for every year
                    brought a repetition of the same extravagant demands to be met by the same or,
                    as the province became exhausted, still heavier sacrifices. Redress was to be

                    >b.c.</hi> there was a regular court established at Rome for the trial of cases
                    of oppression <hi rend="italic">(repetundae)</hi> by provincial governors. But,
                    even when after much trouble and expense the provincials had arraigned their
                    oppressor, it was difficult to secure his condemnation at the hands of juries
                    composed (as they usually were) of men who had a fellow-feeling for the offender
                    because they had themselves committed<pb break="no"

                    offences. Besides the governor, two classes of harpies joined in wringing the
                    uttermost farthing from the unhappy provincials. These were the publicans or
                    farmers of the taxes, and the money-lenders <hi rend="italic"
                    >(negotiatores'),</hi> who supplied a temporary accommodation at ruinous rates
                    of interest. Both these classes were recruited from the ranks of the Roman
                    knights, and, since from the legislation of Caius Gracchus (122 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) the juries were drawn at first exclusively and after
                    Sulla’s time (81 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> partially from the knightly
                    order, the provincial governor could not check the excesses of those
                    bloodsuckers without risking a condemnation at the hands of their brethren.
                    Accordingly he generally made common cause with them, backing their exactions
                    when needful by military force.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Provinces under the Empire.—</hi> Under the empire the
                    provinces fared much better. The monarchy tended to obliterate the distinction
                    between Romans and provincials by reducing both to a common level of subjection
                    to the emperor, who meted out equal justice to all his subjects. The first
                    centuries of our era were probably for some of the countries included in the
                    Roman empire the happiest in their history; Gibbon indeed fixed on the period
                    from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus (96-180 A.D.) as the
                    happiest age of the world.</p>
                <p>Augustus, in 27 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> divided the provinces into
                    imperial and senatorial. Those which, from their proximity to the frontier or
                    the turbulance of their population, required the presence of an army were placed
                    under the direct control of the emperor; those which needed no troops were left
                    to be administered by the senate. (1) The senatorial provinces were ruled by an
                    annual governor as under the republic. Of these provinces Augustus ordained that
                    Africa and Asia should be consular, the rest praetorian; but all the governors
                    of the senatorial provinces were now called proconsuls. Their powers and
                    dignities were much the same as they had been under the republic, except that
                    they had now no troops, or only a handful to maintain order. (2) The imperial
                    provinces were governed by imperial lieutenants <hi rend="italic"
                    >(legati</hi><hi rend="italic">Caesaris),</hi> who were nominated by the emperor
                    and held office at his pleasure; all of them had the power of the sword <hi
                    rend="italic">(jus gladii).</hi> For the administration of the finances these
                    lieutenants had procurators under them, while the governors of the senatorial
                    provinces continued to have quaestors as under the republic. Another class of
                    imperial provinces consisted of those which from the physical nature of the
                    country (as the Alpine districts) or the backward state of civilization (as
                    Mauretania and Thrace) or· the stubborn character of the people (as Judaea and
                    Egypt) were not adapted to receive a regular provincial constitution. These were
                    regarded as domains of the emperor, and were managed by a procurator (in the
                    case of Egypt by a praefect, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Praefect)</hi> nominated
                    by and responsible to the emperor.</p>
                <p>Under the empire all provincial governors received a fixed salary. Complaints
                    against them were brought before the senate, and the accusers were allowed a
                    senator to act as their advocate. The lengthened periods during which the
                    governors, at least in the imperial provinces, held office, together with the
                    oversight exercised by the emperor, alleviated materially the position of the
                    provincials under the empire. In order to keep himself well informed of what was
                    passing in the empire, Augustus established <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> post
                    whereby official despatches were forwarded by couriers and official persons were
                    conveyed by coaches. The post, however, was only for the use of the Government;
                    no private person was allowed, unless by an exceptional concession, to avail
                    himself of it (J. G. FR.)</p>
