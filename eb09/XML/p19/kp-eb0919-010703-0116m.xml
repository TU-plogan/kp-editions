                    spending some years in Lisbon and Setubal, and experiencing various adventures,
                    he left his native country in 1537, in a fleet of five ships, committing himself
                    to a career of adventure at sea, which lasted twenty-one years, in the course of
                    which he was five times shipwrecked, thirteen times taken captive, and seventeen
                    times sold as a slave. If Pinto’s own narrative is coloured in many passages by
                    a wandering and fervid imagination, its substantial honesty is now generally
                    admitted, in spite of Congreve’s opprobrium in <hi rend="italic">Love for
                    Love,—“</hi> F. Μ. Pinto was but a type of thee, thou liar of the first
                    magnitude.” The fleet with which Pinto left <pb break="no"

                    Socotra, and he himself was taken captive near the Straits of Babelmandeb,
                    carried to Mocha, sold as a slave, and ransomed by the Portuguese governor of
                    Ormuz. Returning to the Indies, he was again engaged in several expeditions,
                    again enslaved, again ransomed, and again captured by pirates. In 1542 he was
                    engaged in an expedition to Calempin, near Peking, to rifle the tombs of
                    seventeen Chinese kings. Shipwrecked and captured on the Chinese coast, he was
                    set to work in repairing the Great Wall, whence an inroad of Tartars transported
                    him to the siege of Peking and next to Tartary. Hence we follow him to
                    Cochin-China, Macao, and Japan. At Ningpo his report of Japan and its wealth
                    caused the equipment of nine ships, eight of which foundered, Pinto’s ship being
                    driven to the Lew-chew Islands. After a variety of other adventures, Pinto
                    returned a third time to Japan with Francis Xavier in 1548. In 1553, while at
                    Goa on his return to Portugal with his rich fortune, he was induced to devote
                    nearly all his wealth to the foundation of a seminary for propagating the faith
                    in Japan. Returning to Lisbon in 1558, he spent a few years at court, but found
                    the life very stale after his stirring adventures in the East.</p>
                <p>The first extant account of his adventures is to be found in a collection of
                    Jesuits’ letters published in Italian at Venice in 1565. The full narrative,
                    however, of his life is his own <hi rend="italic">Peregrinando,</hi> which was
                    first published in quarto at Lisbon in 1614 by Francisco de Herrera. In 1620
                    appeared a Spanish translation, and in 1628 at Paris a French translation by B.
                    Figuier, followed by two other editions (1645 and 1830). There is also an
                    English translation by H. Cogan (London, 1663 and 1692). See also Barbosa
