                    is a corruption of the Latin <hi rend="italic">praemonere,</hi> to pre-admonish
                    or forewarn, and is taken from the words of the writ itself, which runs

                    granted, and furthermore to the penalty it incurs. The range and description of
                    offences made liable to the penalties of praemunire became greatly widened
                    subsequently to the Reformation, so that acts of a very miscellaneous character
                    were from time to time brought within the scope of enactments passed for a very
                    different purpose. The offence is of a nature highly criminal, though not
                    capital, and more immediately affects the crown and Government. The statute 16
                    Rich. II. c. 5 (1392) is usually designated the Statute of Praemunire; it is,
                    however, but one only of numerous stringent measures (many of which are still
                    unrepealed) resulting from the enactment of the Statute of Provisors (35 Edw. I.
                    c. 1), passed in a previous reign, which according to Coke <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Instit.)</hi> was the foundation of all the subsequent statutes of praemunire.
                    Cowel <hi rend="italic">(Laιo Diet.)</hi> describes a provisor as one who sued
                    to the court of Rome for a provision which was called <hi rend="italic">gratia
                    expectiυa.</hi></p>
                <p>The penalties of praemunire involved the loss of all civil rights, forfeiture of
                    lands, goods, and chattels, and imprisonment during the royal pleasure. In the
                    Habeas Corpus Act (31 Car. II. c. 2, 1679) the committing of any man to prison
                    out of the realm was made praemunire unpardonable even by the king. It thus
                    appears that, whilst the crown by its prerogative might at any time remit the
                    whole or any part of the punishment incurred by a praemunire, an exception was
                    made in transgressions of the Statute of Habeas Corpus. The Royal Marriage Act
                    (12 Geo. III. c. 11) of 1772 is the last statute which subjects any one to the
                    penalties of a praemunire as ordained by 16 Rich. II.</p>
                <p>It cannot be doubted that the legislation exemplified in the Statutes of
                    Praemunire and Provisors was felt by the <pb break="no"

                    action. In the hands of Henry VIII. praemunire became eventually a lever for the
                    overthrow of papal supremacy. The last ancient statute concerning praemunire,
                    until the Reformation, was the 2 Hen. IV. c. 3 (1400), by which all persons who
                    accepted any provision from the pope to be exempt from canonical obedience to
                    their proper ordinary were subjected to the penalties prescribed. Bishop
                    Stubbs,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Constit. Hist, of Eng.</hi> (1880), iii. 356 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sg.</hi></p></note> in summing up his account of the various statutes of
                    praemunire, succinctly says of them that they were intended to prevent
                    encroachments on and usurpations of jurisdiction on the part of the pope, and he
                    adds that the more important statute was that of 16 Rich. II. c. <hi
                    rend="italic">5</hi> (1392), which he describes as one of the strongest
                    defensive measures taken during the Middle Ages against Rome, and which was
                    called for in consequence of the conduct of the pope, who had forbidden the
                    bishops to execute the sentences of the royal courts in suits connected with
                    ecclesiastical patronage. Tomlins <hi rend="italic">{Law Diet.)</hi> states that
                    there is only one instance of a prosecution on a praemunire to be found in the
                    state trials, in which case the penalties were inflicted upon some persons for
                    refusing to take the oath of allegiance to Charles II. It may be added that on
                    an indictment for praemunire a peer might not be tried by his peers.</p>
