                <p><label type="entry">POTATO</label>. The potato <hi rend="italic">(Solanuni
                    tuberosum)</hi> is too well known to need detailed description. It owes its
                    value to the peculiar habit of developing underground slender leafless shoots or
                    branches which differ in character and office from the true roots, and which
                    gradually swell at the free end and thus produce the tubers with which we are so
                    familiar. The nature of these tubers is further rendered evident by the presence
                    of “eyes” or leaf-buds, which in due time lengthen into shoots and form the
                    haulm or stems of the plant. Such buds are not, under ordinary circumstances,
                    formed on roots. What the determining cause of the formation of the tubers may
                    be <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n615/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0615-0594"/> is not known; the object evidently is to secure a
                    method of propagation independently of the seed. Starch and other matters are
                    stored up in the tubers, as in the perisperm of a seed, and in due season are
                    rendered available for the nutrition of the young shoots when they begin to
                    grow. The young shoots, in fact, derive their nourishment from the parent tuber
                    until by the production of roots and leaves they are enabled to shift for
                    themselves. When grown under natural circumstances (without being earthed up, as
                    is usually done by the cultivator) the tubers are relatively small and close to
                    the surface of the soil, or even lie upon it. In the latter case they become
                    green and have an acrid taste, which would probably render them objectionable to
                    predatory animals or insects, and which certainly renders them unpalatable to
                    human beings, and, in consideration of the known poisonous qualities of many <hi
                    rend="italic">Solanaceae,</hi> might probably cause them to be unwholesome.
                    Hence the recommendation to keep the tubers in cellars or pits, not exposed to
                    the light, for the green colouring matter is, in this case, developed in the
                    tubers independently of the direct action of light on the leaves. Among the six
                    hundred species of <hi rend="italic">Solanum</hi> less than a dozen have this
                    property of forming tubers, but similar growths are formed at the ends of the
                    shoots of the common bramble, of the <hi rend="italic">Convolvulus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sepium,</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Helianthus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tuberosus,</hi> the so-called Jerusalem artichoke, of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sagittaria,</hi> and other plants. Tubers are also sometimes
                    formed on aerial branches, as in some Aroids, Begonias, &lt;fcc. The production
                    of small green tubers on the haulm, in the axils of the leaves of the potato, is
                    not very unfrequent, and affords an interesting proof of the true morphological
                    nature of the underground shoots and tubers. The so-called fir-cone potatoes,
                    which are elongated and provided with scales at more or less regular intervals,
                    show also very clearly that the tuber is only a thickened branch with “eyes” set
                    in regular order, as in an ordinary shoot. The potato tuber consists mainly of a
                    mass of cells filled with starch and encircled by a thin corky rind. A few
                    vessels and woody fibres traverse the tubers.</p>
                <p>The chief value of the potato as an article of diet consists in the starch it
                    contains, and to a less extent in the potash and other salts. The quantity of
                    nitrogen in its composition is small, and hence it should not be relied on to
                    constitute the staple article of diet, unless in admixture with milk or some
                    other substance containing nitrogen. Letheby gives the following as the average
                    composition of the potato—</p>

                <p>—a result which approximates closely to the average of nineteen analyses cited in
                    <hi rend="italic">How Crops Grow</hi> from Grouven. In some analyses, however,
                    the starch is put as low as 13'30, and the nitrogenous matter as 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 92 (Dehérain, <hi rend="italic">Cours</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Chimie Agricole,</hi> p. 159). Boussingault gives 25 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 per cent, of starch and 3 per cent, of nitrogenous
                    matter. Warington states that the proportion of nitrogenous to non-nitrogenous
                    matter in the digestible part of potatoes is as 1 to 10 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 6. The composition of the tubers evidently varies according to season,
                    soils, manuring, the variety grown, &amp;c., but the figures cited will give a
                    sufficiently accurate idea of it. The “ash” contains on the average of
                    thirty-one analyses as much as 59 ’ 8 per cent, of potash, and 19 ’ 1 per cent,
                    of phosphoric acid, the other ingredients being in very minute proportion.
                    Where, as in some parts of northern Germany, the potato is grown for the purpose
                    of manufacturing spirit great attention is necessarily paid to the quantitative
                    analysis of the starchy and saccharine matters, which are found to vary much in
                    particular varieties, irrespective of the conditions under which they are
                    grown.</p>
                <p>The origin and history of the potato are better known than in the case of many
                    long-cultivated plants. It is to the Spaniards that we owe this valuable
                    esculent, “optimum benigni Numinis donum, dapes grata diviti, pauperi panis,” as
                    it has been called by an eminent botanist. The Spaniards met with it in the
                    neighbourhood of Quito, where it was cultivated by the natives. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cronica de Peru</hi> of Pedro Cieça, published at Seville in 1553,
                    as well as in other Spanish books of about the same date, the potato is
                    mentioned under the name “battata” or “papa.” Hieronymus Cardan, a monk, is
                    supposed to have been the first to introduce it from Peru into Spain, from which
                    country it passed into Italy and thence into Belgium. Carl Sprengel, cited by
                    Professor Edward Morren in his biographical sketch entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Charles de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Escluse,</hi><hi rend="italic">sa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Vie</hi><hi rend="italic">et ses Oeuvres,</hi> and to which we are
                    indebted for some of the historical details given below, states that the potato
                    was introduced from Santa Fé into England by John Hawkins in 1563 <hi
                    rend="italic">(Garten</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeitung,</hi> 1805, p. 346). If this
                    be so, it is a question whether the English and not the Spaniards are not
                    entitled to the credit of the first introduction; but, according to Sir Joseph
                    Banks, the plant brought by Drake and Hawkins was not our potato but the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sweet Potato</hi> (see below).</p>
                <p>In 1587 or 1588 De l ’ Escluse, better known under the Latinized appellation of
                    “Clusius,” received the plant from Philippe de Sivry, lord of Waldheim and
                    governor of Mons, who in his turn received it from some member of the suite of
                    the papal legate. At the discovery of America, we are told by Humboldt, the
                    plant was cultivated in all the temperate parts of the continent from Chili to
                    New Granada, but not in Mexico. Nearly a hundred years afterwards, in 1585 or
                    1586, potato tubers were brought from North Carolina and Virginia to Ireland on
                    the return of the colonists sent out by Sir Walter Raleigh, and were first
                    cultivated on Sir Walter’s estate near Cork. The tubers introduced under the
                    auspices of Raleigh were thus imported a few years later than those mentioned by
                    Clusius in 1588, which must have been in cultivation in Italy and Spain for some
                    years prior to that time. Be this as it may, the earliest representation of the
                    plant is to be found in Gerard’s <hi rend="italic">Herbal,</hi> published in
                    1597. The plant is mentioned under the name <hi rend="italic">Papus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">orbiculatus</hi> in the first edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catalogus</hi> of the same author, published in 1596, and again in the second
                    edition, which was dedicated to Sir Walter Raleigh (1599). It is, however, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Herbal</hi> that we find the first description of the
                    potato, accompanied by a woodcut sufficiently correct to leave no doubt whatever
                    as to the identity of the plant. In this work (p. 781) it is called “Battata
                    Virginiana sive Virginianorum, et Pappus, Potatoes of Virginia.” Gerard
                    says—</p>
                <p>“The roote is thicke, fat and tuberous; not much differing either in shape,
                    colour or taste from the common Potatoes, saving that the rootes hereof are not
                    so great nor long; some of them as round as a ball, some ouall or egge-fashion,
                    some longer and others shorter; which knobbie rootes are fastened unto the
                    stalks with an infinite number of threddie strings. . . . It groweth naturally
                    in America where it was first discovered, as reporteth C. Clusius, since which
                    time I have received rootes hereof from Virginia otherwise called Norembega
                    which growe and prosper in my garden, as in their owne native countrie.”</p>
                <p>The “common Potatoes” of which Gerard speaks are the tubers of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Convolvulus batatas,</hi> the Sweet Potato, which nowadays would not in Great
                    Britain be spoken of as common. Evidently the author attached great importance
                    to the potato, for in the frontispiece to his volume he is represented with the
                    flower and foliage of the plant in his hand. In his opinion it was, like the
                    common potato, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n616/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0616-0595"/> “a foode as also a meate for pleasure equall in
                    goodnesse and wholesomenesse unto the same, being either rosted in the embers,
                    or boiled and eaten with oile, vinegar and pepper, or dressed any other way by
                    the hand of some cunning in cookerie.” A second edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Herbal</hi> was published in 1636 by Thomas Johnson, with a different
                    illustration from that given in the first edition, and one which in some
                    respects, as in showing the true nature of the tuber, is superior to the first.
                    The phenomenon of growing out or “super-tuberation” is shown in this cut.</p>
                <p>Previous to this (in 1629) Parkinson, the friend and associate of Johnson, had
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Paradisus,</hi> in which (p. 517) he gives an
                    indifferent figure of the potato under the name of <hi rend="italic">Papas seu
                    Battatas Virginianorum,</hi> and adds details as to the method of cooking the
                    tubers which seem to indicate that they were still luxuries rather than
                    necessaries. Chabraeus, who wrote in 1666, tells us that the Peruvians made
                    bread from the tubers, which they called “chunno.” He further tells us that by
                    the natives <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Virginieae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">insui</hi><hi rend="italic">ae”</hi> the plant was called
                    “openauk,” and that it is now known in European gardens, but he makes no mention
                    of its use as an esculent vegetable, and, indeed, includes it among “plantae
                    malignae et venenatae.” Heriot (De Bry’s <hi rend="italic">Collection</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of Voyages'),</hi> in his report on Virginia, describes a plant
                    under the same name “with roots as large as a walnut and others much larger;
                    they grow in damp soil, many hanging together as if fixed on ropes; they are
                    good food either boiled or roasted.” The plant (which is not a native of
                    Virginia) was probably introduced there in consequence of the intercourse of the
                    early settlers with the Spaniards, who derived the plant from Peru or other
                    parts of South America, and perhaps provisioned their ships with its tubers. In
                    any case the cultivation of the potato in England made but little progress, even
                    though it was strongly urged by the Royal Society in 1663; and not much more
                    than a century has elapsed since its cultivation on a large scale became
                    general.</p>
                <p>The source of the potato being known, it is a matter of interest to determine the
                    particular species from which the cultivated forms have descended and the exact
                    part of the great American continent in which it is indigenous. As to the first
                    point, botanists are agreed that the only species in general cultivation in
                    Great Britain is the one which Bauhin, in his <hi rend="italic">Phytopinax,</hi>
                    p. 89 (1596), called <hi rend="italic">Solanum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tuberosum</hi><hi rend="italic">esculentum,</hi> a name adopted by Linnaeus
                    (omitting the last epithet), and employed by all botanical writers. This species
                    is native in Chili, but it is very doubtful if it is truly wild farther north.
                    Mr Baker <hi rend="italic">(Journal</hi> of the Linnean Society, vol. xx., 1884,
                    p. 489) has reviewed the tuber-bearing species of <hi rend="italic">Solanum</hi>
                    from a systematic point of view as well as from that of geographical
                    distribution. Out of twenty so-called species he considers six to be really
                    distinct, while the others are merely synonymous or trifling variations. The six
                    admitted tuber-bearing species are <hi rend="italic">S. tuberosum, S. Maglia, S.
                    Commersoni, S. cardioplιyllum, S. Jamesii,</hi> and &gt;S'. <hi rend="italic"
                    >oxy</hi><hi rend="italic">carpum.</hi><hi rend="italic">S. tuberosum</hi> is,
                    according to Mr Baker, a native not only of the Andes of Chili but also of those
                    of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia, also of the mountains of Costa Rica,
                    Mexico, and the south-western United States. It seems most probable, however,
                    that some at least of the plants mentioned in the northern part of the American
                    continent have no claim to be considered absolutely wild, but are the
                    descendants of cultivated forms. <hi rend="italic">S. Alaglia</hi> is a native
                    of the Chilian coast as far south as the Chonos Archipelago, and was cultivated
                    in the garden of the Horticultural Society at Chiswick in 1822, being considered
                    by Sabine, in his paper on the native country of the wild potato, to be the true
                    o. <hi rend="italic">tuberosum</hi> and the origin of the cultivated forms. This
                    species was also found by Darwin in Chili, and was considered by him, as by
                    Sabine before him, to be the wild potato. It is remarkable, says Darwin, that
                    the same plant should be found in the sterile mountains of.central Chili, where
                    a drop of rain does not fall for moιe than six months, and within the damp
                    forests of these southern (Chonos) islands. The explanation, according to Baker,
                    is that the plant of the dry mountains is <hi rend="italic">S. tuberosum,</hi>
                    that of the coast is <hi rend="italic">S. Maglia.</hi> It must, however, be
                    stated that, although Mr Baker refers to the plants figured by Sabine <hi

                    yeux,” that the plant grown from Chilian tubers and figured in the plate before
                    cited is <hi rend="italic">S. tuberosum. S. Commersoni</hi> occurs in Uruguay,
                    Buenos Ayres, and the Argentine Republic, in rocky situations at a low level.
                    Under the name of <hi rend="italic">S. Ohrondii</hi> it has lately been
                    introduced into western France, where it is not only hardy but produces
                    abundance of tubers, which are palatable, but have a slightly acid taste. The
                    tubers give promise of improvement under cultivation. <hi rend="italic">S.
                    cardiophyllum,</hi> described by Lindley in the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>

                    elevations of 8000 to 9000 feet. <hi rend="italic">S. Jamesii</hi> is a
                    well-defined species occurring in the mountains of Colorado, New Mexico, and
                    Arizona, and also in Mexico. In a wild state the tubers are not larger than
                    marbles, but as the plant is now in cultivation in England it may be expected to
                    improve in this particular. <hi rend="italic">S. oxycarpum</hi> is stated by Mr
                    Baker to be a little known but very distinct tuberous species from central
                    Mexico.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Although these
                    six are the only species admitted as such by Mr Baker, it is well to note some
                    of the forms or varieties, because, although they may not be entitled to
                    specific rank, which after all is a matter of opinion, they may yet be of
                    importance in the future. First of all may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">S.
                    etuberosum</hi> of Lindley, differing from the common <hi rend="italic">S.
                    tuberosum</hi> in not producing tubers. This was found in Chili, and is probably
                    not specifically distinct, although exceptional, for it is by no means very
                    unusual to find even cultivated plants produce no tubers. <hi rend="italic">S.
                    Fernandezianum</hi> is, according to Baker, a form of <hi rend="italic">S.
                    tuberosum,</hi> but if so its habitat in the mountain woods of Juan Fernandez is
                    climatically different from that in the dry mountains of central Chili, where,
                    as we have seen, the true &lt;8. <hi rend="italic">tuberosum</hi> grows. &lt;8.
                    <hi rend="italic">otites</hi> was found recently by Μ. André on the summit of
                    Quindiu in Colombia, at a height of 11,483 feet, in a rigorous climate, only
                    about 3300 feet below the perpetual snows of Tolima. It produces tubers of the
                    size of a nut. <hi rend="italic">S. Andreanum,</hi> found by Μ. André at Cauca,
                    at an elevation of 6234 feet, was considered by the traveller to be the true
                    &gt;8. <hi rend="italic">tuberosum,</hi> but this view is not shared by Mr
                    Baker, who named it after the discoverer. Its tubers, if it produces any, have
                    not been seen. »8. <hi rend="italic">immite</hi> is probably only a slight
                    variety of »8. <hi rend="italic">tuberosum,</hi> as are also the Venezuelan <hi
                    rend="italic">S. colombianum,</hi><hi rend="italic">S. verrucosum, S.

                    the mountains of New Mexico and Arizona, was considered by Asa Gray to be
                    likewise a form of <hi rend="italic">S. tuberosum.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>Mr Baker looks upon the forms enumerated not only with the eye of a systematic
                    botanist but with the tendencies of one whose object is to assign varying forms
                    to one common type from which they have, or may probably have, arisen. But from
                    a practical point of view the forms in question require careful analysis rather
                    than synthesis. Their morphological peculiarities and chemical constitution
                    deserve attentive consideration as to then-degree of constancy, and more
                    particularly as to any relation that may be traced between them and the climatic
                    circumstances under which they grow naturally, and their power of resistance to
                    the attacks of disease. A review of the localities in which the presence of <hi
                    rend="italic">S. tuberosum</hi> and its tuber-bearing allies has been
                    ascertained shows that, broadly, these varieties may be divided into mountainous
                    and littoral. In either case they would not be subjected, at least in their
                    growing season, to the same extremes of heat, cold, and drought as plants
                    growing on inland plains. Again, those forms growing at a high elevation would
                    probably start into growth later in the season than those near the coast. The
                    significance of these facts from a cultural point of view is twofold: for, while
                    a late variety is desirable for culture in Great Britain, as ensuring more or
                    less immunity from spring frost, which would injure the early sorts, it is, on
                    the other hand, undesirable, because late varieties are more liable to be
                    attacked by the potato disease, which as a rule makes its appearance at or about
                    the time when the earliest varieties are ready for lifting, but before the late
                    varieties are matured, and consequently while they are still exposed to the
                    destructive influences of the fungus.</p>

                    varies very greatly not only as to the season of its growth but also as to
                    productiveness, the vigour and luxuriance of its foliage, the presence or
                    relative absence of hairs, the form of the leaves, the size and colour of the
                    flowers, &lt;fcc. It is probable that a more careful investigation of these
                    peculiarities, and especially of those connected with the microscopical anatomy
                    of the leaves, would give serviceable indications of the varieties most or least
                    susceptible to the disease,— a point at present hardly if at all attended to. As
                    to the tubers, they vary greatly in size, form, and colour; gardeners divide
                    them into rounded forms and long forms or “kidneys”; “lapstones” are more or
                    less flattened; and “pebble” varieties are long potatoes broader at one end than
                    at the other. The colour of the rind, yellowish, brown, or purple, furnishes
                    distinctions, as does the yellow or white colour of the flesh. The colour of the
                    eyes and their prominence or depression are relatively very constant
                    characteristics. These variations have originated chiefly by cross-breeding, but
                    not invariably so, as some varieties rarely, if ever, produce flowers in
                    Britain, and yet “sports” have been observed in their tubers and have become the
                    parents of new varieties. Various methods have been proposed for the prevention
                    or arrest of the ravages of the fungus which causes the “potato disease” (see
                    below). In addition to different modes of cultivation, attempts have been made
                    to secure varieties less liable than others to disease, and, although no great
                    measure of success has been attained, still the matter is not without promise,
                    seeing how the early varieties, as before stated, escape the full virulence of
                    the malady. Other attempts have been made to infuse a hardier constitution by
                    hybridizing the potato with hardy species such as N. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dulcamara</hi> and <hi rend="italic">S. nigrum.</hi> Hybrids were accordingly
                    raised by Mr Maule, but they all suffered from the disease as much as the
                    parents, and it is to be feared that the hybrids raised between the common
                    potatoes and some of the six species mentioned by Mr Baker may suffer a like
                    fate. This, however, remains to be proved. Mr Maule, disappointed with his
                    hybridization experiments, then tried the effect of grafting. With this view he
                    grafted <hi rend="italic">S. nigrum</hi> on to a shoot of the potato. New tubers
                    were formed, the foliage being wholly that of N. <hi rend="italic">nigrum.</hi>
                    In another experiment he grafted the potato on to <hi rend="italic">S.
                    Dulcamara.</hi> In one case tubers were produced on the graft (the potato), but
                    none on the <hi rend="italic">Dulcamara</hi> stock, either above or below
                    ground, while in another case tubers were actually produced on the underground
                    portions of <hi rend="italic">S. Dulcamara.</hi> Mr Maule’s experiments were
                    most ingenious, but the theory he gave in his <hi rend="italic">The Potato, what
                    is it?</hi> (Bristol, 1876) will not commend itself to physiologists, and there
                    is no evidence to show whether the grafts he obtained were attacked by the
                    parasite or even whether they had a chance of being so. Mr Maule’s experiments,
                    especially the one last mentioned, afford confirmation of the possibility of
                    graft hybridization being effected. Various experimenters, especially Mr Fenn,
                    have asserted that by engrafting an eye of one variety into the tuber of
                    another, not only will adhesion take place but the new tubers will present great
                    variety of character; and this indeed seems to be the case from the numerous
                    specimens shown by Mr Fenn at the Royal Horticultural Society, but it can hardly
                    be considered as established that the variations in question were the result of
                    any commingling of the essences of the two varieties. The wound may simply have
                    set up that variation in the buds the occasional existence of which has been
                    already noted. The last-cited experiment of Mr Maule’s, however, is much more
                    conclusive. Mr A. Dean also <hi rend="italic">{Gardeners' Chronicle,</hi> 2d
                    September 1876, p. 304)</p>
                <p>succeeded in grafting the potato on to the tomato, with the result that, although
                    no tubers were found on the root of the tomato, numerous tubers were produced on
                    the sides of the branches of the potato. Another experiment may be here
                    mentioned as throwing light on the formation of tubers, one wherein Mr Burbidge
                    observed the production of tubers at the portion of an ordinary cutting of <hi
                    rend="italic">S. Commersoni</hi> inserted in the soil. In this case no tubers
                    were formed above ground. <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ.</hi> τ. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>There are few agricultural subjects of greater importance than the culture of the
                    potato and the losses entailed by potato disease. The number of acres in Great
                    Britain alone under cultivation for potatoes is generally more than half a
                    million (543,455 in 1883, 562,344 in 1884); the average weight of the produce
                    per acre may be taken at five tons, the average price about <hi rend="italic"
                    >£5</hi> per ton, so that the commercial value of each year’s crop commonly
                    ranges between £13,000,000 and £15,000,000. It is not unusual in bad seasons for
                    a single grower to lose from £1000 to £1500 through disease; for the market
                    grower sometimes not only loses the entire produce, or nearly so, but loses also
                    the value of the seed, the guano, the farm-yard manure, the rent, and the
                    labour. Growers sometimes lose £30 per acre in one season, for, exclusive of the
                    diseased produce, £10 may be put down to guano and dung, £4, 10s. to rent,
                    tithes, and taxes, £6, 10s. for seed, and £2 for digging; added to this there
                    are ploughing, harrowing, overlooking, earthing up, sacks, carriage to and fro,
                    and many minor expenses. The losses range in amount according to the virulence
                    and general extent of the disease. In extreme cases every tuber is lost, as the
                    produce will not even pay the cost of lifting. The year of the great potato
                    famine in Britain was 1845, but the Rev. Μ. J. Berkeley, in his famous essay on
                    the potato murrain published by the Royal Horticultural Society of England in
                    1846, stated that a very serious disease of the potato named the “curl” had at
                    that time been known in Britain for more than half a century. We now know that
                    the “curl” is a condition of the true potato murrain. As a rule, although there
                    are a few exceptions, the disease occurs wherever the potato is grown. It is
                    known in South America, in the home of the potato plant.</p>
                <p>The disease of potatoes is caused by the growth of a fungus named <hi
                    rend="italic">Peronospora</hi><hi rend="italic">infestans,</hi> Mont., within
                    the tissues of the host plant, and this fungus has the peculiar property of
                    piercing and breaking up the cellular tissues, and setting up putrescence in the
                    course of its growth. The parasite, which has a somewhat restricted range of
                    host plants, chiefly invades the potato, <hi rend="italic">Solanum</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">cardiophyllum,</hi> Lind. It is also very destructive to the
                    tomato, <hi rend="italic">Lycopersicum</hi><hi rend="italic">esculentum,</hi>
                    Mill., and to all or nearly all the other species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lycopersicum.</hi> At times it attacks petunias and even Scrophulariaceous
                    plants, as <hi rend="italic">Λnthocersis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schizanthus.</hi> A second species of <hi rend="italic">Peronospora</hi> is
                    known on Solanaceous plants, viz., <hi rend="italic">P. Hyoscyami,</hi> D.By., a
                    parasite of the common henbane.</p>
                <p>In England the disease is generally first seen during the last ten days of July;
                    its extension is greatly favoured by the warm and showery weather peculiar to
                    that period of the year, and according as the warm and humid weather of autumn
                    is late or early the murrain varies a little in its time of appearance. To the
                    unaided eye the disease is seen as purplish brown or blackish blotches of
                    various sizes, at first on the tips and edges of the leaves, and ultimately upon
                    the leaf-stalks and the larger stems. On gathering the foliage for examination,
                    especially in humid weather, these dark blotches are seen to be putrid, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n618/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0618-0597"/> and when the disease takes a bad form the dying
                    leaves give out a highly offensive odour. The fungus, which is chiefly within
                    the leaves and stems, seldom emerges through the firm upper surface of the leaf;
                    it commonly appears as a white bloom or mildew on the circumference of the
                    disease-patches on the under surface. It grows within the tissues from central
                    spots towards an everextending circumference, carrying putrescence in its
                    course. As the patches extend in size by the growth of the fungus they at length
                    become confluent, and so the leaves are destroyed and an end is put to one of
                    the chief vital functions of the host plant. On the destruction of the leaves
                    the fungus either descends the stem by the interior or the spores are washed by
                    the rain to the tubers in the ground. In either case the tubers are reached by
                    the fungus or its spores, and so become diseased. The fungus which undoubtedly
                    causes the mischief is very small in size, and under the microscope appears
                    slightly whitish or colourless. The highest powers are required to see all parts
                    of the parasite.</p>
                <p>The accompanying illustration, drawn from nature, shows the habit and structure
                    of the fungus, <hi rend="italic">Peronospora</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >infestans,</hi> Mont. The letters A B show a vertical section through a
                    fragment of a potato leaf, enlarged 100 diameters; A is the upper surface line,
                    and B the lower; the lower surface of the leaf is shown at the top’ the better
                    to exhibit the nature of the fungus growths. Between A and B the loose cellular
                    tissue of which the leaf is partly built up is seen in section, and at C the
                    vertical pallisade cells which gix e firmness to the upper surface of the leaf.
                    Amongst the minute spheιical cells within the substance of the leaf numerous
                    transparent threads are shown; these are the mycelial threads or spawn of the
                    tungus; wherever they touch the leaf-cells they pierce or break down the tissue,
                    and so set up decomposition, as indicated by the darker shading. The lower
                    surface of the potato leaf is furnished with numerous organs of transpiration or
                    stomata, which are naπow orifices opening into the leaf and from which moisture
                    is ranspιred in the form of fine vapour. Out of these small openings the tungus
                    threads emerge, as shown at D, D, D. When the threads reach the air they branch
                    in a tree-like manner, and each &lt;ranch carries one or more ovate reproductive
                    bodies termed spores or “conidia,” bodies roughly comparable with seeds, as s
                    own at E, E, E. Sometimes other reproductive bodies roughly comparable with the
                    anthers and pistils of flowering plants are orne inside the leaf, stem, or
                    tuber, as at F; the larger body of ese is female, and is termed an “oogonium,”
                    and the smaller, w neh at length pierces the oogonium, is male, and is termed an
                    “antheridium.” When the spores or conidia are magnified 400 diameters they are
                    seen as at F', and the contained protoplasm often breaks up into a definite
                    number of parts, as at G. When a spore like F germinates it protrudes an
                    amoeba-like mass of protoplasm, as shown at H, which is capable of reproducing
                    the potato fungus at once; and when a differentiated conidium as at G germinates
                    it expels about eight minute mobile bodies called “zoospores,” each zoospore
                    being furnished with two extremely attenuated vibrating hairs termed “cilia,” as
                    shown at J. These zoospores swim about in any film of moisture, and on going to
                    rest take a spherical form, germinate, and produce threads of mycelium as at K;
                    the mycelium from the germinating conidia or zoospores soon finds its way into
                    the tissues of the potato leaf by the organs of transpiration, and the process
                    of growth already described is repeated over and over again till the entire
                    potato leaf, or indeed the whole plant, is reduced to putridity.</p>
                <p>The oogonium and antheridium as seen at F are further enlarged to 400 diameters
                    at L; it will here be seen that the smaller male organ or antheridium has
                    projected a fine beak through the walls of the oogonium or female organism;
                    through this beak some of the protoplasm from the antheridium passes into and
                    mingles with the protoplasm of the oogonium; this is the act of fertilization,
                    and an oospore or resting spore (Μ, N), a body roughly comparable with a seed,
                    is the result. After fertilization the oospores quickly drop from their
                    supporting threads and become free like most ripe fruits. As the potato fungus
                    causes the potato to become putrid the mature oospores or resting spores are
                    necessarily confined to the portions of the potato plant which have been
                    destroyed by the fungus, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> either to the decayed
                    leaves or stems or to the diseased tubers; they are brown in colour and
                    generally more or less spinulose or warted. They will not germinate till after a
                    rest of nine, ten, or twelve months, or in some instances even two years. They
                    germinate by protruding threads, which speedily bear spores or conidia as at E,
                    or more rarely zoospores as at J. The resting spores were seen by Dr Rayer and
                    Dr Montague in 1845, and named (in ignorance of their true nature) <hi
                    rend="italic">Artotrogus</hi><hi rend="italic">hydnosporus.</hi> The Rev. Μ. J.
                    Berkeley shortly afterwards identified them as the resting spores of the potato
                    fungus; but they were not seen by any one between the years 1845 and 1875, when
                    in the latter year they were discovered in great abundance and artificially
                    produced from the potato fungus by the writer of this article. At first believed
                    to be rare, they are now known to be amongst the commonest of vegetable
                    productions. The potato fungus is easily made to produce resting spores, and
                    their germination after a year’s rest is an observation of no special
                    difficulty. At one time these resting spores were confused by some botanists
                    with a little fugitive transparent fungus, bearing oogonia not half the size of
                    the oogonia of <hi rend="italic">Peronospora</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >infestans,</hi> and named <hi rend="italic">Pythium vexans,</hi> D. By.; the
                    latter plant perfects itself in twenty-four hours or at most a day or two,
                    instead of taking a year or more as do the resting spores of the fungus of the
                    potato disease. <hi rend="italic">Pythium vexans</hi> has no connexion whatever
                    with the fungus or the potato disease.</p>
                <p>The germinating conidia of the potato fungus, as at E, are not only able to
                    pierce the leaves and stems of the potato plant, and so gain an entry to its
                    interior through the epidermis, but they are also able to pierce the bark of the
                    tuber, especially in young examples. It is therefore obvious that, if the tubers
                    are exposed to the air where they are liable to become slightly cracked by the
                    sun, wind, hail, and rain, and injured by small animals and insects, the spores
                    from the leaves will drop on to the tubers, quickly germinate upon the
                    slightly-injured places, and cause the potatoes to become diseased. Earthing up
                    therefore prevents these injuries, but where practised to an immoderate extent
                    it materially reduces the produce of tubers. The labour entailed in repeated
                    earthing up is also considered a serious objection to its general adoption.</p>
                <p>All diseased potato material should be gathered together and either deeply buried
                    or burnt, as the hibernating germs of the disease (oospores) rest in the
                    decaying potato refuse, and the mycelium itself sometimes hibernates.</p>
