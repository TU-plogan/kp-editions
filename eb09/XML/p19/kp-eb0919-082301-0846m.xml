                    fully <hi rend="italic">ger</hi><hi rend="italic">vftöshäb,</hi> is not any
                    “stranger” but a stranger dwelling in a Hebrew community and enjoying a certain
                    measure of protection. In old time at least the position of such a stranger was
                    no doubt very insecure, for he had no strong kinsmen to take his part, and so,
                    like the widow and orphan, with whom many passages of the Old Testament
                    associate him, he was liable to oppression. The law as well as the prophets
                    commend him to the humane regard of his neighbours, but it would have been quite
                    foreign to antique ideas to grant him equal rights (see Lev. xxv. 45; Deut,
                    xxiii. 20). Like the Arabic <hi rend="italic">jar,</hi> therefore (whose name is
                    at bottom the same), he must have generally sought to attach himself as a client
                    to some individual or community able to protect him, and so we must understand
                    the metaphor in passages like Ps. xv. 1, xxxix. 12.</p>
                <p>In the old Hebrew kingdom the word <hi rend="italic">gër</hi> had a civil not a
                    religious significance, and it would almost seem that a poor Israelite without
                    inheritance might sink to this position, which indeed is scarcely
                    distinguishable from that of the Le vite in Jud. xvii. 8, who went forth to
                    sojourn <hi rend="italic">(gur)</hi> where he might find a place. The exile and
                    the restoration made a change in this as in all other aspects of Hebrew society.
                    On the one hand Ezekiel xlvii. 22 and Isa. xiv. 1 contemplate that the restored
                    nation shall be recruited by strangers who are received on equal terms; but, as
                    the Jews returned not as an independent nation but as a distinct religious
                    community, this implies especially that the sons of the stranger, by joining
                    Israel, observing the Sabbath, and holding fast to Jehovah’s covenant, may gain
                    admission to all the privileges of the temple and its worship. So it is put in
                    Isa. Ivi. 6, 7 in marked contrast to the restrictions laid down in Deut, xxiii.
                    3, 7 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> That the views of the prophets had practical
                    issue cannot be doubted; even the foreign Nethinim in the second temple were
                    rapidly transformed not merely into good Israelites but into Levites. The
                    condition of admission to the full privileges of an Israelite, in particular to
                    the passover, is, according to the Priestly Code (Exod. xii. 48; Numb. ix. 14),
                    circumcision,—to which the later Jewish usage adds lustration by immersion in
                    water (baptism, <hi rend="italic">t</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">blla)</hi> and the
                    presentation of a sacrifice <hi rend="italic">(korbän).</hi> The immersion,
                    about which there has been a good deal of controversy, some maintaining that it
                    came into use later than Christian baptism, was really a necessary act for one
                    who had been previously unclean, and may be held to be involved in the general
                    Pentateuchal law of ceremonial washings. The later technical name for a heathen
                    who thus joined the theocracy was pηχ∏ *1J, “proselyte of righteousness.”</p>
                <p>The free admission of foreigners to the Jewish church is a mark of the
                    universalistic tendency which, in spite of all the narrownesses of Judaism under
                    the law, accompanied the break-up of the old national system. On the other hand
                    the so-called Law of Holiness (later than Ezekiel but earlier than the Priestly
                    Code), which is contained in Lev. xvii. <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> presents a
                    different line of transition from the purely civil to the religious meaning of
                    <hi rend="italic">gêr.</hi> In these laws, which proceed throughout on the
                    principle that Israel, and all that has to do with Israel, must be regulated by
                    regard to formal holiness, it is demanded that certain rules shall be enforced
                    not only on Israelites proper but on strangers sojourning in their land. They
                    are not to eat blood (xvii. 10), commit incest (xviii. 26), sacrifice to Moloch
                    (xx. 2), or blaspheme Jehovah (xxiv. 16); and for murder and other crimes they
                    are to be answerable to the Hebrew authorities according to Hebrew law (xxiv.
                    22). These rules are in substance—the third being extended to a prohibition of
                    idolatry generally—-the “Noachic laws” to which in later usage a man or woman
                    might promise to conform and thereby, without becoming a regular member of the
                    theocracy, be recognized as a “proselyte of the gate,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> “within the gates of Israel.” What the Law of Holiness proposed to
                    enforce became in fact—the theocracy not possessing political power over
                    strangers— a voluntary obligation assumed by those “who worshipped God” <hi
                    rend="italic">(σeβ0gevoL τbv θeov,</hi> Acts xiii. 50, xvi. 14, xvii. 4, 17,
                    xviii. 7—in E.V. often rendered “devout”).</p>
                <p>The proselytizing zeal of the Jews is spoken of in Mat. xxiii. 15, and by many
                    Greek and Latin writers. Up to the time of Hadrian it was facilitated by the
                    favour generally extended to the Jews by the Roman emperors; and not only on
                    Semitic soil, as at Damascus, where Josephus tells us that most of the women
                    were proselytes, but <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0847-0824"/> throughout the Roman world many converts were
                    made, especially among women. The most noted conversion was that of the royal
                    house of Adiabene (Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xx. 2), of which the
                    splendid tomb of Queen Helena, a little way outside of Jerusalem, still remains
                    a monument.</p>
