                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and Tibullus, whose birth has been assigned to 54
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and immediately preceding Ovid himself, who, as
                    he tells us elsewhere, was born in 43 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> We shall
                    not be far wrong in supposing he was born about 50 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> a date which also agrees well with the indications of the poems
                    themselves. His early life was full of misfortune. He buried his father before
                    his time; and grief was closely followed by poverty. After the battle of
                    Philippi and the return of Octavian to Rome the victorious legions had to be
                    provided for; their clamorous need and cupidity could only be appeased by
                    wholesale agrarian confiscation, and the north of Italy had to be surrendered.
                    In common with his fellow poets Virgil and Horace, Propertius was deprived of
                    his estate; but, unlike these, he had no patrons at court, and he was reduced
                    from opulence to comparative indigence. The widespread disaffection which these
                    measures provoked was turned to account by Lucius Antonius, the brother of the
                    triumvir, and his wife, the notorious Fulvia. The insurrection which is
                    generally known as the <hi rend="italic">bellum</hi><pb break="no"

                    important incident, the fierce and fatal resistance of Perugia, deprived the
                    poet of another of his relations, who was killed by brigands while making his
                    escape from the lines of Octavian. The loss of his patrimony, however, thanks no
                    doubt to his mother’s providence, did not prevent Propertius from receiving a
                    superior education. After or, it may be, during its completion he and she left
                    Umbria for Rome; and there, about the year 34 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> he
                    assumed the garb of manly freedom. He was urged to take up a pleader’s
                    profession; but the serious study went against the grain, and, like Ovid, he
                    found in letters and gallantry a more congenial pursuit. Soon afterwards he made
                    the acquaintance of Lycinna, about whom we know little beyond the fact that she
                    subsequently excited the jealousy of Cynthia, and was subjected to all her
                    powers of persecution <hi rend="italic">(vexandi).</hi> This passing fancy was
                    succeeded by a serious attachment, the object of which was the famous “Cynthia.”
                    Her real name was Hostia, and she was a native of Tibur. She was a courtezan of
                    the superior class, somewhat older than Propertius, and seems to have been a
                    woman of singular beauty and varied accomplishments. Her own predilections led
                    her to literature; and in her society Propertius found the intellectual sympathy
                    and encouragement which were essential for the development of his powers. Her
                    character, as depicted in the poems, is not an attractive one; but she seems to
                    have •entertained a genuine affection for her lover. The intimacy began in 28
                    and lasted till 23 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> These six years must not,
                    however, be supposed to have been a period of unbroken felicity. Apart from
                    minor disagreements, an infidelity on Propertius’s part excited the deepest
                    resentment in Cynthia; and he was banished for a year. The quarrel was made up
                    about the beginning of 25 B.C.; and soon after Propertius published his first
                    book of poems and inscribed it with the name of his mistress. Its publication
                    placed "him in the first rank of contemporary poets, and amongst other things
                    procured him admission to the literary circle of Maecenas. The intimacy was
                    renewed; but the old enchantment was lost. Neither Cynthia nor Propertius was
                    faithful to the other. The mutual ardour gradually cooled; motives of prudence
                    and decorum urged the discontinuance of the connexion; and disillusion changed
                    insensibly to disgust. Although this separation might have been expected to be
                    final, it is not certain that it was so. It is true that Cynthia, whose health
                    appears to have been weak, does not seem to have survived the separation long.
                    But a careful study of the seventh poem of the last book, in which Propertius
                    gives an account of a dream of her which he had after her death, leads us to the
                    belief that they were once more reconciled, and that in her last illness Cynthia
                    left io her former lover the duty of carrying out her wishes with regard to the
                    disposal of her effects and the arrangements of her funeral Almost nothing is
                    known of the subsequent history of the poet. He was certainly alive in 16 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> as some of the allusions in the last book testify.
                    And there are two passages in the letters of the younger Pliny in which he
                    speaks of a descendant of the poet, one Passennus Paullus. Now in 18 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Augustus carried the <hi rend="italic">Leges</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Juliae,</hi> which offered inducements to marriage and imposed
                    disabilities upon the celibate. It would seem therefore at least a natural
                    conclusion that Propertius was one of the first to comply with the provisions of
                    the law, and that he married and had at least one child, from whom the
                    contemporary of Pliny was descended.</p>
                <p>Propertius appears to have had a large number of friends and acquaintances,
                    chiefly literary, belonging to the circle of Maecenas. Amongst these may be
                    mentioned Virgil, the epic poet Ponticus, Bassus (probably the iambic poet of
                    the name), and at a later period Ovid. He does not aeem to have come across
                    Tibullus; and his relations with Horace were not particularly friendly. Horace
                    may have regarded him as an interloper in the favour of Maecenas, though there
                    is nothing in the poems of Propertius to warrant the supposition. In person
                    Propertius was pale and thin, as was to be expected in one of a delicate and
                    even sickly constitution. He was very careful about his personal appearance, and
                    paid an almost foppish attention to dress and gait. He was of a somewhat
                    voluptuous and self-indulgent temperament, which shrank from danger and active
                    exertion. He was anxiously sensitive about the opinion of others, eager for
                    their sympathy and regard, and, in general, impressionable to their influence.
                    His over-emotional nature passed rapidly from one phase of feeling to another;
                    but the more melancholy moods predominated. A vein of sadness runs through his
                    poems, sometimes breaking out into querulous exclamation, but more frequently
                    venting itself in gloomy reflexions and prognostications. He had fits of
                    superstition which in healthier moments he despised. It must be added that the
                    native weakness of his character was no doubt considerably increased by his
                    infirm and delicate constitution.</p>
                <p>The poems of Propertius, as they have come down to us, consist of four books
                    containing 4046 lines of elegiac verse. The unusual length of the second one
                    (1402 lines) has led Lachmann and other critics to suppose that it originally
                    consisted of two books, and they have placed the beginning of the third book at
                    ii. 10, a poem addressed to Augustus. This theory, somewhat modified, has been
                    powerfully advocated by Th. Birt <hi rend="italic">(Das Antike Buchwesen,</hi>
                    pp. 413-426). He divides the poems into two parts,—a single book (lib. i.),
                    published separately and called <hi rend="italic">Cynthia Monobiblos,</hi> as in
                    the MSS. and the lemma to Martial (xiv. 189), and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tetrabiblos Syntaxis,</hi> a collection of four books, published together,
                    consisting of the remainder of his poems. If this view is correct, the greater
                    part of the first book of the <hi rend="italic">Syntaxis</hi> must have been
                    lost, as ii. 1-9 only contain 354 lines. The first book, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynthia,</hi> was published early in the poet’s literary life, and may be
                    assigned to 25 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The date of the publication of the
                    rest is uncertain, but none of them can have been published before 24 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and the last, at any rate, was probably published
                    posthumously. The subjects of the poems are threefold :—(1) amatory and
                    personal, mostly regarding Cynthia—seventy-two (sixty Cynthia elegies), of which
                    the last book contains three; (2) political and social, on events of the
                    day—thirteen, including three in the last book; (3) historical and
                    antiquarian—six, of which five are in the last book.</p>
                <p>The writings of Propertius are noted for their difficulty; and this has
                    undoubtedly prejudiced his reputation as a poet. His style seems to unite every
                    element by which a reader could be deterred. Not to speak of the unequal quality
                    of his workmanship, in which curtness alternates with redundance, and
                    carelessness with elaboration, the indistinctness and discontinuousness of his
                    thought is a serious strain upon the attention. An apparently desultory sequence
                    of ideas, sudden and often arbitrary changes of subject, frequent vagueness and
                    indirectness of expression, a peculiar and abnormal Latinity, a constant
                    tendency to exaggeration, and an excessive indulgence in learned and literary
                    allusions,—all these are obstacles lying in the way of a study of Propertius.
                    But those who have the will and the patience to surmount them will find their
                    trouble well repaid. In power and compass of imagination, in freshness and
                    vividness of conception, in truth and originality of presentation, few Roman
                    poets can compare with him. If these qualities are seldom eminent for long
                    together, if his flights are rarely steady and sustained, this is matter for
                    regret rather than cavil or even astonishment. Propertius was essentially
                    incapable <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n836/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0836-0813"/></p>
                <p>of self-criticism, constitutionally intolerant of the slow labour of the file.
                    His work is ever best when done under the urgency of a supreme and rapid
                    excitement, and when, so to say, the discordant qualities of his genius are
                    fused together by the electric spark of an immediate inspiration. Two of his
                    merits seem to have impressed the ancients themselves. The first is most obvious
                    in the scenes of quiet description and emotion in whose presentation he
                    particularly excels. Softness of outline, warmth of colouring, a fine and almost
                    voluptuous feeling for beauty of every kind, and a pleading and almost
                    melancholy tenderness—such were the elements of the spell which he threw round
                    the sympathies of his reader, and which his compatriots expressed by the vague
                    but expressive word <hi rend="italic">blanditia.</hi> His <hi rend="italic"
                    >facundia,</hi> or command of striking and appropriate language, is more
                    noticeable still. Not only is his vocabulary very extensive, but his employment
                    of it extraordinarily bold and unconventional. New settings of use, idiom, and
                    construction continually surprise us, and, in spite of occasional harshness,
                    secure for his style an unusual freshness and freedom. His handling of the
                    elegiac couplet, and especially of its second line, deserves especial
                    recognition. It is vigorous, varied, and even picturesque. In the matter of the
                    rhythms, caesuras, and elisions which it allows, the metrical treatment is much
                    more severe than that of Catullus, whose elegiacs are comparatively rude and
                    barbarous; but it is not bound hand and foot, like that of the Ovidian distich,
                    in a formal and conventional system. It only now remains to call attention to
                    the elaborate symmetry of construction which is observable in many of his
                    elegies. Often indeed the correspondence between different parts of his poem is
                    so close that critics have endeavoured with more or less success to divide them
                    into strophes.</p>
                <p>Propertius’s poems bear evident marks of the study of his predecessors both Greek
                    and Latin, and of the influence of his contemporaries. He tells us himself that
                    Callimachus and Philetas were his masters, and that it was his ambition to be
                    the Roman Callimachus. We can trace obligations to Theocritus, Apollonius
                    Rhodius, and other Alexandrines, but above all to Meleager, and amongst earlier
                    writers to Homer, Pindar, Aeschylus, and others. Amongst Latin writers he had
                    read with more or less care the works of Ennius, Lucretius, the dramatists, and
                    Catullus. We find coincidences too close to be fortuitous between his poems and
                    those of Virgil, Horace, and Tibullus his contemporaries; but it is very
                    possible the influence was reciprocal. Propertius’s influence upon his
                    successors was considerable. There is not a page of Ovid which does not show
                    obligations to his poems, while other writers made a more modest use of his
                    stores. Among these may be mentioned Manilius, Juvenal, Martial, Statius,
                    Claudian, Seneca, and Apuleius.</p>
                <p>The works of Propertius have come down to us in a far from perfect condition.
                    Some of the poems have been lost; others are fragmentary; and most are more or
                    less disfigured by corruptions. The manuscripts on which we have to rely are
                    late and in several cases interpolated; and these circumstances, combined with
                    the native difficulty of the poet’s writing, make the task of his restoration
                    and interpretation one of peculiar delicacy and difficulty.</p>
                <p>Donatus (or Suetonius) in his life of Virgil, 30 (45), is the authority for the
                    full name of Propertius. “Aurelius” and “Nauta,” which are added in the MSS.,
                    are due to confusion with Prudentius, and a corrupt reading of iii. 19, 22
                    (Müller), (ii. 24, 22, Palmer).— On the Propertii, see Mommsen in <hi

                    p. 282. Besides the Propertius Blaesus (the Passennus Paullus of Pliny), we hear
                    of a C. Propertius who was <hi rend="italic">triumvir</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >capitalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">proconsul</hi> in the time of Augustus,
                    and a Propertius Celer, a poor senator under Tiberius. Inscriptions of the
                    Propertii have been found at Assisi, <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Hertzberg, <hi

                    (Spello) have been put forward as the birth-place of Propertius, but the poet’s
                    own expressions are decisive for Asisium. Apart from the question of reading in
                    v. (iv. ) 1,125 (MSS. Asis. ), the climbing walls of his town (scandentes arces,
                    scandens murus, v. (iv. ), 1, 65 and <hi rend="italic">l.c.),</hi> its nearness
                    to Perugia, and its position close above the plain (i. 22, 9, 10) are altogether
                    unsuitable to Spello and Bevagna.—Ovid thus assigns Propertius his place

                    the Gallus of i. 21, see i. 22, 5-8. Propertius’s mother is mentioned in ii. 8,
                    39; iii. 13, 15; and in very affectionate terms in i. 11, 21. She was dead when
                    iii. 13 (11) was written, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> six months after the
                    publication of the first book. For the quality of Propertius’s education, the
                    poems themselves are the only, but a sufficient, testimony.—For Lycinna see iv.
                    14 (iii. 15), 3-10, 43.— Cynthia, or Hostia (Apul., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apol.,</hi> p. 415) of Tibur (v. (iv.), 7, 85), was the granddaughter (iv. 19
                    (iii. 20), 8) of L. Hostius, who wrote a poem on the Illyrian war of 178 B. c.,
                    of which some fragments are preserved. She was much older than Propertius (iii.
                    10 (ii. 18), 20). That she was a <hi rend="italic">meretrix</hi> is clear from
                    many indications—her accomplishments, her house in the Subura, the occurrence of
                    scenes like those in i. 3, iii. 27 (ii. 29), the fact that Propertius could not
                    marry her, &amp;c. For descriptions of her beauty see ii. 2, 5 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.,</hi> and 3, 9 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; iii. 3 (ii. 13), 23, 24; her
                    poetry, ii. 3, 21; and other accomplishments, i. 2, 27 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.,</hi> iv. 19 (20), 7, 8. In character she was fickle (i. 15, ii. 6,
                    &amp;c.), greedy (iii. 8 (ii. 16), 11, 12, Cynthia non sequitur fasces, nec
                    curat honores: semper amatorum ponderat una sinus), and fond of finery (ii. 3,
                    15, 16); her temper was violent, iv. 7 (iii. 8), &amp;c., and led her to slander
                    those who had offended her (i. 4, 18 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> &amp;c).—For
                    the five years, see iv. (iii.) 25, 3, quinque tibi potui seruire fideliter
                    annos; and for the year of separation, iv. 15, 11 (iii. 16), 9, peccaram semel,
                    et totum sum pulsus in annum. The second separation is vouched for by the two
                    last elegies of book iv. The evidence which v. (iv.) 7 furnishes in favour of a
                    reconciliation is analysed by Postgate <hi rend="italic">(Prop.,</hi> Introd.,
                    p. xxv. <hi rend="italic">sq.).—</hi> v. 6 commemorates the celebration of the

                    Virgil is spoken of in the highest terms in iii. 32 (ii. 34), 61 <hi

                    (i. 4), Lynceus a tragic poet (iii. 32, ii. 34). Volpi conjectured (in his
                    edition of Propertius, i. pp. xv. <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> that the
                    inquisitive fellow of Horace, <hi rend="italic">Sat.,</hi> i. 9; but the
                    conjecture is generally rejected on grounds of chronology. It has recently been
                    re-discussed and rejected by Prof. A. Palmer in his edition of Horace’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Satires,</hi> i. 9 (notes), p. 219. In <hi rend="italic">Ep.</hi>
                    ii. 87 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> however, Horace seems to make a direct attack
                    on Propertius.—On Propertius’s personal appearance, see i. 1, 22, 5, 21;
                    pallorem nostrum . . . cur sim toto corpore nullus ego. A likeness of him has
                    possibly been preserved in a double Hermes in the Villa Albani and the Vatican,
                    which represents a young beardless Roman, of a nervous and somewhat sickly
                    appearance, in combination with a Greek poet, possibly Callimachus or Philetas
                    (Visconti, <hi rend="italic">Iconograph.</hi><hi rend="italic">Romana,</hi>

                    Ill health is proved, as well by the specific allusion of i. 15 as by the
                    frequent references to death and burial—i. 19; ii. 1, 71 <hi rend="italic"

                    poems. In particular it has had a great deal to do in moulding his vocabulary
                    (Postgate, Introd., p. xxxvi. <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> For want of courage
                    and energy, especially, see ii. 7, 14; iii. 12 (ii. 19), 17-24; and for

                    questions of Propertius; but it is not unlikely that Birt’s conclusions will be

                    But, as is well pointed out by Teuffel in his <hi rend="italic">History of Roman
                    Literature,</hi> Propertius’s debt to Callimachus and Philetas is chiefly a
                    formal one. Even into his mythological learning he breathes a life to which
                    those dry scholars were complete strangers.—For a summary account of his

                <p>There is no existing MS. of Propertius older than the 14th century. Up till the
                    publication of Bährens's edition (1880), the Neapolitanus (N., now often called
                    the Guelferbytanus) was regarded as the best. Bährens, however, maintained its
                    worthlessness as compared with the concurrence of four other MSS. of his own
                    collating :—Vossianus, circa 1360 (A); Laurentianus, beginning of 15th century
                    (F.); Ottoboniano-Vaticanus, end of 14th century (V.); Daventriensis, 1410-20
                    (D.), Bährens’s attack upon the Neapolitan was answered by H. Leo (Rh. Mus.,
                    xxxi. 431), EUis(√imer. Journ. Phil., i.389), Palmer (Hermathena, iv, 48-72).
                    The contending merits of these MSS. have been examined by Solbisky (Comm. Phil.
                    Jenenses, ii. 1883) with considerable care, and his conclusions as to the
                    independent value both of N. and the consensus of D. V. are likely to be
                    accepted.</p>
                <p>The editio princeps of Propertius is that of 1472, Venice. Among the chief
                    editions may be mentioned the following, those with notes being marked with an
                    asterisk *Scaliger (1577, &lt;tc.), *Broukhusius (2d ed., 1577), *Passeratius

                    (1880); selections, with introduction, Postgate (1881). Those of Müller and
                    Palmer are the editions cited throughout this article. It is impossible to cite
                    the numerous programs, dissertations, papers, &lt;fcc., which have been
                    published on subjects connected with Propertius. For fuller bibliographies it is
                    sufficient to refer to Hertzberg, Prop., i. pp. 248-59; Engelmann’s Bibliotheca
