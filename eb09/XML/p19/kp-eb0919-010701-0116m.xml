                    rend="italic">Scottish Tragic Ballads.</hi> These were followed in 1782’by <hi
                    rend="italic">Two Dithyrambic Odes on Enthusiasm and Laughter,</hi> and by a
                    series of <hi rend="italic">Tales in Verse.</hi> Under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Select Scottish Ballads</hi> he reissued in 1783 his tragic
                    ballads, with a supplement comprising <hi rend="italic">Ballads of the Comic
                    Kind,—</hi> a collection which obtained for him the not wholly appropriate title
                    of “the second Chatterton.” An <hi rend="italic">Essay on Medals</hi> in 1784
                    won him a considerable reputation, which was in some respects unpleasantly
                    maintained by his bold but eccentric <hi rend="italic">Letters on
                    Literature</hi> published in 1785 under the pseudonym of Robert Heron—a
                    temporary adoption of his mother’s surname. In the following year he edited the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ancient Scottish Poems from the MS. Collections of Sir Richard
                    Maitland of Lethington,—</hi> a genuine reproduction, though his confession in
                    the preface of forgery in the previous collections published by him brought
                    groundless suspicion upon it. It was succeeded in 1787 by a compilation, under
                    the new pseudonym of Bennet, entitled the <hi rend="italic">Treasury of
                    Wit,</hi> and by his first important historical work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertation on the Origin and Progress of the Scythians or Goths,</hi> to
                    which Gibbon professed himself indebted. Turning his attention to hagiology,
                    Pinkerton next collected and printed in 1789 certain <hi rend="italic">Vites
                    Sanctorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Scotiae,</hi> and, a little later, published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Enquiry into the History of Scotland preceding the Reign of
                    Malcolm III.,</hi> in which he hoped to settle the ancient history of his
                    country on the solid footing of facts and authorities and “leave nothing in <hi
                    rend="subscript"> t</hi> the μifc horn.” In many quarters his attitude towards
                    the Highlanders excited “violent disgust,” but the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enquiry</hi> was twice reprinted, in 1794 and 1814, and is still of value'for
                    the documents embodied in it. His edition of Barbour’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bruce</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Medallic History of England to the
                    Revolution</hi> appeared in 1790; a collection of <hi rend="italic">Scottish
                    Poems reprinted from scarce Editions</hi> in 1792; and a series of biographical
                    sketches, the <hi rend="italic">Iconographia</hi><hi rend="italic">Scotica,</hi>
                    in the years 1795-97. In the last-mentioned year he published a <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Scotland from the Accession of the House of Stuart to
                    that</hi><hi rend="italic">of Mary,</hi> containing valuable material, but
                    almost entirely devoid of literary finish. A new biographical collection, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gallery of Eminent Persons of Scotland</hi> (1799), was
                    succeeded after a short interval by a <hi rend="italic">Modern Geography
                    digested on a New Plan</hi> (1802; enlarged, 1807). About this time he left
                    London for Paris, where he chiefly resided until his death on May 10, 1826. His
                    remaining publications were the <hi rend="italic">Recollections of Paris in the
                    years</hi> 1802-3- 4-5 (1806); a very useful <hi rend="italic">General
                    Collection of Voyages and Travels</hi> (1808-1813); a <hi rend="italic">New
                    Modern Atlas</hi> (1809-15); and his <hi rend="italic">Petralogy</hi> (1811). An
                    unsuccessful tragedy by him was performed at Edinburgh in 1813.</p>
                <p>Pinkerton possessed an exceedingly vigorous and acute mind, but very lacking in
                    high constructive power; and, as he was less patient in the formation of opinion
                    than in research, his best work is marred by imperfect judgments crudely and
                    obstinately asserted. At the same time his writings take no mean rank in the
                    advance towards a scientific treatment of history. Walpole, notes of whose
                    conversations were published at his death by Pinkerton under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Walpoliana,</hi> regarded his understanding as “one of the
                    strongest, most manly, and clearest he ever knew;” and Gibbon not only praised
                    his faculty of persistent application as herculean and heroic, but wished to
                    secure his co-operation in a scheme for organizing the materials of early
                    English history. The final verdict upon his work must be that of the Earl of
                    Buchan, who endorsed Pinkerton’s statement that he was “a <hi rend="italic"
                    >homo</hi><hi rend="italic">umbratilis,</hi> of a hypochondriac unsocial
                    disposition,” with the comment <hi rend="italic">“se ipse dixit·,</hi> it is his
                    best apology; yet undoubtedly he has been a benefactor to literature.”</p>
