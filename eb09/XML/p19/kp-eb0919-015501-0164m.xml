                    course of studies in theology. He then held various teaching appointments in the
                    colleges of his order at Parma and at Rome. He was created an abbot of his order
                    by Pius VI., who appointed him bishop of Tivoli on the 16th December 1782, and
                    on February 14, 1785, raised him to the cardinalate and the see of Imola. At the
                    death of Pius VI. the conclave met at Venice on the 1st December 1799, with the
                    result that Chiaramonti was declared his successor on March 14, 1800, and
                    crowned on the 21st of that month. In the following July he entered Rome,
                    appointed Cardinal Consalvi secretary of state, and busied himself with
                    administrative reforms. His attention was at once directed to the ecclesiastical
                    anarchy of France, where, apart from the broad schism on the question of
                    submission to the republican constitution, discipline had been so far neglected
                    that a large proportion of the churches were closed, dioceses existed without
                    bishops or with more than one, Jansenism and marriage had crept into the ranks
                    of the clergy, and indifference or hostility widely prevailed amongst the
                    people. Encouraged by the intimation through Cardinal Martiniana of Napoleon’s
                    desire for the re-establishment of the Catholic religion in France, Pius
                    appointed Caselli and Archbishop Spina to arrange a concordat with three
                    nominees of Napoleon—Joseph Bonaparte, Cretet, and the Vendean priest Bernier.
                    Difficulties having arisen, the aid of Consalvi was called in, and the
                    concordat, signed at Paris on July 15th, was ratified by Pius on the 14th August
                    1801. Its value, however, from the pontifical point of view was considerably
                    lessened by the “Articles Organiques” appended to it by the French Government on
                    the 8th April 1802. In 1804 Napoleon opened negotiations to secure at the pope’s
                    hands his formal consecration as emperor. After some hesitation Pius was induced
                    to perform the ceremony at Notre Dame and to extend his visit to Paris for four
                    months. He returned to Rome on the 16th May 1805 with many expressions of good
                    will; butin the October following the French troops, in evacuating the kingdom
                    of Naples, suddenly occupied Ancona upon the alleged necessity of protecting the
                    Holy See. Resistance by force was out of the question, but to a requisition from
                    the emperor that all Sardinians, English, Russians, and Swedes should be
                    expelled from the pontifical states, and that vessels of all nations at war with
                    France should be excluded from his ports, Pius replied by asserting the
                    independence and neutrality of his realm. After negotiations had dragged on for
                    two years, in the course of which the French occupied the chief Adriatic ports,
                    Ci vita Vecchia was seized and the papal troops placed under French officers. On
                    the 2d February 1808 Rome itself was occupied by General Miollis; a month later
                    the provinces of Ancona, Macerata, Fermo, and Urbino were united to the kingdom
                    of Italy, and diplomatic relations between Napoleon and Rome were broken off;
                    finally, by a decree issued from Vienna on May 17, 1809, the emperor declared
                    the papal states reunited to France by resumption of the grant of Charlemagne.
                    Pius retaliated by a bull, drawn up by Fontana and dated June 10, 1809,
                    excommunicating the invaders; and, to prevent insurrection, Miollis—either on
                    his own responsibility, as Napoleon afterwards asserted, or by order of the
                    latter— employed General Radet to take possession of the pope’s person. The
                    palace on the Quirinal was broken open during the night of July 5th, and, on the
                    persistent refusal of Pius to renounce his temporal authority, he was carried
                    off, first to Grenoble, thence after an interval to Savona, and in June 1812 to
                    Fontainebleau. There he was induced, on the 25th January 1813, to sign a new
                    concordat, which was published as an imperial decree on the 13th February. On
                    conference with the cardinals, however, Pius withdrew his concessions and
                    proposed a concordat upon a new basis. At first no attention was paid to this,
                    and, when after the French armies were driven from Germany Napoleon endeavoured
                    to purchase a new concordat by offering to restore the papal possessions south
                    of the Apennines, Pius refused to treat with him from any place other than Rome.
                    The order for his departure thither reached him on the 22d January 1814, and
                    after a brief delay at Cesena he entered Rome on the 24th May 1814. With his
                    states restored to him by the congress of Vienna and freed from the Napoleonic
                    terror, he devoted the remainder of his life to social and ecclesiastic reform
                    in accordance with the modern spirit, suppressing many of the feudal survivals,
                    abolishing torture, reconstituting civil and judicial procedure, and giving
                    effect to many beneficial changes introduced by the French. His long and in many

                    having been broken by a fall in July 1823, acute inflammation supervened, and he
                    died on the 20th August in that year. His successor was Leo XII.</p>
