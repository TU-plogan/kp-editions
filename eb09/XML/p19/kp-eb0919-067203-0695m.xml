                    >centuria</hi><hi rend="italic">praerogativa,</hi> or century which voted first
                    on a proposed law <hi rend="italic">(rogatio)</hi> in the Roman <hi
                    rend="italic">comitia centuriata.</hi> In English law, Blackstone says, “by the
                    word prerogative we are to understand the character and power which the
                    sovereign hath over and above all other persons, in right of his regal dignity;
                    and which, though part of the common law of the country, is out of its ordinary
                    course. This is expressed in its very name, for it signifies, in its etymology,
                    something that is required or demanded <hi rend="italic">before,</hi> or in
                    preference to, all others; and, accordingly, Finch lays it down as a maxim that
                    the prerogative is that law in the case of the king which is law in no case of
                    the subject” (Stephen’s <hi rend="italic">Comm.,</hi> vol. ii. bk. iv. pt. i.
                    ch. vi.). The prerogative is sometimes called <hi rend="italic">jura</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">regalia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">regalia,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">regalia</hi> being either <hi rend="italic">majora,</hi> the regal
                    dignity and power, or <hi rend="italic">minora,</hi> the revenue of the crown.
                    The word “prerogative” is used to denote the whole privilege of the crown or any
                    part of it; in the latter sense it may be used in the plural number.</p>
                <p>The theory of English law as to the prerogative of the king seems to be not quite
                    consistent. On the one hand, he is a perfect and irresponsible being, holding
                    his office by divine right; “Victoria, <hi rend="italic">by the grace of
                    God</hi> of Great Britain and Ireland Queen,”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is no difference in the prerogative as
                    exercised by a king or a queen regnant, so that the word “king” in its
                    constitutional sense includes queen. That the queen regnant has the same rights
                    as a king was declared by 1 Mary sess. 3, c. 1.</p></note> is still the heading
                    of every writ. On the other hand, his powers are defined and limited by law.
                    This is laid down as early as the 13th century: “Rex non debet esse sub homine
                    sed sub Deo et sub lege, quia lex facit regem” (Bracton, 5b),—a striking
                    contrast to the rule of Roman law, “quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem.”
                    A consequence of this position is that the prerogative may be confined or
                    extended by the supreme legislative authority, and that the courts have
                    jurisdiction to decide whether or not any alleged right falls within the
                    prerogative. The prerogative of the crown, still of great extent, has been
                    gradually limited by a long series of enactments, the most worthy of notice
                    being <hi rend="italic">Magna Carta,</hi><hi rend="italic">Confirmatio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cartarum, Prerogativa Regis,</hi> the Petition of Right, the
                    Habeas Corpus Act, the Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">England.)</hi> Where a prerogative was abolished by statute, in
                    some instances compensation was granted in return for the surrender, in others
                    no compensation was given. An example of the former is the statute 12 Car. II.
                    c. 24, by which excise duties were granted to the crown in return for the
                    abolition of military tenures and their incidents; of the latter, the statute 16
                    Car. I. c. 20, abolishing the prerogative of imposing compulsory knighthood or a
                    fine in its place. The prerogative has also been limited by judicial decision
                    and by tacit abandonment. Thus monopolies were declared illegal (in the
                    respectful language of the judges the queen was held to have been deceived in
                    her grant) in the reign of Elizabeth by <hi rend="italic">The Case of
                    Monopolies</hi> (11 Coke’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> 84), and the right to
                    exclude a member from parliament was abandoned by the same queen in 1571. The
                    most important of the obsolete prerogatives, other than those named, which have
                    been at one time claimed and exercised are the following. (1) The right to
                    impose a tax upon the subject without the consent of parliament was the subject
                    of contest for centuries. Sums were raised at various times under the names of
                    talliage, scutage, hydage, subsidies, aids, benevolences, tonnage and poundage,
                    tolls, ship-money, tenths, fifteenths, Ac. (2) The right to dispense with the
                    obligation of statutes, by the insertion in a grant of the clause <hi
                    rend="italic">non obstante</hi><hi rend="italic">statuto,</hi> was frequently
                    asserted by the crown down to the Revolution. An end was finally put to this and
                    the last right by the Bill of Rights. (3) The right of purveyance and
                    pre-emption—that is, of buying up provisions at a valuation without the consent
                    of the owner —and the right of impressing carriages and horses were finally
                    abolished by 12 Car. II. c. 24. (4) The authority to erect tribunals not
                    proceeding according to the ordinary course of justice was declared illegal by
                    16 Car. I. c. 10 (the Act dissolving the Star Chamber, the court of the marches
                    of Wales, and the court of the president and council of the north). (5) The
                    revenue from first-fruits and tenths, annexed to the crown by Henry VIII., was
                    vested by Queen Anne in trustees for the augmentation of poor benefices, 2 and 3
                    Anne c. 11. This is what is usually called “Queen Anne’s bounty.” (6) The right
                    of corody—that is, of sending one of the royal chaplains to be maintained by a
                    bishop until the bishop promotes him to a benefice—has become obsolete by
                    disuse. (7) The right by forfeiture to the property of a convict upon his
                    conviction for treason or felony was abolished by the Felony Act, 1870. (8) The
                    immunity of the crown from payment of costs has been taken away in almost all
                    cases. The crown is liable to costs in revenue cases by 18 and 19 Vict. c. 90,
                    in petitions of right by 23 and 24 Vict. c. 34. (9) The right to alienate crown
                    lands by grant at pleasure was taken away by 1 Anne c. 8, passed in consequence
                    of the improvident alienations of land by William III. In very few cases has the
                    prerogative been extended by statute; 34 and 35 Vict. c. 86 is an example of
                    such extension. By that Act the jurisdiction of lords-lieutenant of counties
                    over the auxiliary forces was revested in the crown.</p>
                <p>The prerogative may be exercised in person or by delegation. The prerogative of
                    conferring honours is generally (though not necessarily) exercised by the king
                    in person, as in the case of investment with knighthood and military or civil
                    decorations. The delegation of the prerogative often takes place by commission,
                    issued with or without a joint address from both Houses of parliament. An
                    example of a commission issued on a joint address is the commission to inquire
                    into the existence of corrupt practices after an election (15 and 16 Vict. c.
                    57). In most <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n696/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0696-0673"/> cases a commission is issued by the prerogative
                    alone without any address from parliament; thus the assent of the crown to a
                    Bill may be given by commission, and rights of command may be granted by
                    commission to officers in the army and navy. The delegation of the prerogative
                    in judicial matters is illustrated by commissions of the peace and commissions
                    of assize. The prerogative may still further be delegated by a delegate; thus
                    commissions of lunacy are and commissions of bankruptcy were issued by the lord
                    chancellor as the representative of the crown. Parts of the
                    prerogative—generally in the nature of profit, and so in derogation of the
                    revenue of the crown—may be conferred upon subjects by grant in letters patent,
                    which will be presumed after enjoyment by the subject for a certain time. What
                    in the king is a prerogative becomes a franchise in the subject, e.y., chases,
                    warrens, wrecks, treasuretrove, courts-leet.</p>
                <p>The existing prerogatives may be divided, with Blackstone, into such as are
                    direct and such as are by way of exception; or perhaps better, with Chief Baron
                    Cornyns, into those affecting external relations and those affecting internal
                    relations. Under the first class would fall the power of making war and
                    concluding peace. As incidents to this power the king has the right of sending
                    and receiving ambassadors, of concluding treaties, and of granting passports,
                    safe-conducts, letters of marque, and reprisals. These rights may be limited by
                    international agreement; thus the Declaration of Paris, 1856, abolished
                    privateering as far as the assenting nations (of whom Great Britain was one)
                    were concerned.</p>
                <p>The prerogatives affecting internal relations may be conveniently, if not
                    scientifically, classified as personal, political, judicial, ecclesiastical, and
                    fiscal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Personal.—</hi> In order that there may always be an existing
                    head of the state the king is regarded as a corporation. He cannot die; there
                    can be only a demise of the crown,—that is, a transfer of the royal authority to
                    a different person. On the same principle the king cannot be under age, though
                    in cases where the king has been of tender years a protector or regent has
                    usually been appointed for administrative purposes. The king is personally
                    irresponsible for crime or tort, it being an ancient common law maxim that the
                    king can do no wrong, and that any injury suffered by a subject at the hands of
                    the king is to be attributed to the mistake of his advisers. A curious
                    consequence of this irresponsibility is that the king is apparently the only
                    person in the realm who cannot under any circumstances arrest a suspected felon,
                    for no action for false imprisonment would lie against him, and in the event of
                    the arrest of an innocent person there would be a wrong without a remedy. He
                    cannot be guilty of laches or negligence. The maxim of the common law is “Nullum
                    tempus occurrit regi.” This is still the law in criminal matters. With a very
                    few exceptions, such as prosecutions for treason and offences against the
                    customs, no lapse of time will in England (though it is otherwise in Scotland)
                    bar the right of the crown to prosecute. In civil matters the crown is barred of
                    its right in suits relating to land by the lapse of sixty years (9 Geo. III. c.
                    16). The king is exempt from taxation on the ground that, as the revenue of the
                    realm is his prerogative, it is useless for him to tax himself. But lands
                    purchased by the privy purse are liable to taxation (39 and 40 Geo. III. c. 88,
                    s. 6). He is also exempt from tolls (which can only exist as a franchise granted
                    by him), and from the poor-rate, as he is not mentioned in the Poor Law Acts.
                    His person cannot be arrested, or his goods distrained or taken in execution.
                    The privilege of exemption from taxation applies to his palaces and to the
                    public buildings of the state. No kind of judicial process can be executed in a
                    palace as long as it continues to be a royal residence. The privilege does not
                    attach to palaces which the king has ceased to use as a dwelling, such as
                    Hampton Court, with the one exception of Holyrood House, with the precincts,
                    which still affords a sanctuary from civil process. It does not, however,
                    protect criminals or crown debtors. The king has also several personal
                    privileges of minor importance, such as the title of “majesty,” the right to a
                    royal salute, to the use of the royal standard and of special liveries,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Political.—</hi> The king is the supreme executive and
                    co-ordinate legislative authority. As such authority he has the attribute of

                    “sovereign” is frequently applied to the king in legal works. It should be borne
                    in mind at the same time that the king is not a sovereign in the strict sense in
                    which the term is used by Austin.</p></note> or pre-eminence, and the right to
                    the allegiance of his subjects. All land is mediately or immediately held of him
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Land).</hi> Land derelict suddenly by the sea, land
                    newly discovered by subjects, and islands arising in the sea are his. As
                    paramount authority in parliament he can dissolve or prorogue it at pleasure,
                    but cannot prolong it beyond seven years. In theory parliament only exists at
                    his will, for it is summoned by his writ, and the vote for a member of
                    parliament is only a franchise, not a right existing independently of his grant.
                    He can refuse his assent to a Bill passed by the Houses of parliament. This
                    right has, however, not been exercised since 1707, when Queen Anne refused the
                    royal assent to a Scottish Militia Bill. The king has power to issue
                    proclamations and (with the assent of the privy council) orders in council, in
                    some cases as part of the ancient prerogative, in others under the provisions of
                    an Act of parliament. Proclamations are only binding so far as they are founded
                    upon and enforce the laws of the realm. They cannot alter the common law or
                    create a new offence. By 31 Hen. VIII. c. 8 it was enacted that the king’s
                    proclamations should, under certain conditions, have the force of Acts of
                    parliament, but this Act was repealed by 1 Edw. VI. c. 12. The king is not in
                    general bound by an Act of parliament unless named therein. He can, by virtue of
                    his supreme executive authority, recall a subject from abroad, or forbid his
                    leaving the realm by the writ of <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >exeat regno.</hi> This writ at the present day is not used for state purposes,
                    but merely to prevent a party to an action from going abroad. To order aliens to
                    leave the realm is apparently a matter not falling within the prerogative, as,
                    where such a course is necessary, an Act of parliament is passed; 11 and 12
                    Vict. c. 20 is an instance of such an Act passed for a temporary purpose. The
                    right of the crown to grant letters of denization to aliens is preserved by 33
                    and 34 Vict. c. 14, s. 13. The king is the fountain of honour; as such he has
                    the valuable power of granting peerages at will, so far as he is not restrained
                    by any Act of parliament, and so far as he keeps within certain constitutional
                    limits, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> he cannot insert a shifting clause in a
                    patent of peerage. He also confers all other titles of honour, whether
                    hereditary or not, and grants precedence and armorial bearings. The great
                    officers of state are appointed by the king. The only restriction upon the
                    creation of offices is that he cannot create new offices with new fees attached
                    to them, or annex new fees to old offices, for this would be to impose a tax
                    upon the subject without an Act of parliament. The king, as head of the state,
                    is in supreme command of the army and navy for the defence of the realm. This
                    right, contested by the Long Parliament, was finally declared by 13 Car. II. c.
                    6 to be in the king alone. All supplies for the maintenance of the army and navy
                    are voted annually, so that it is practically impossible for the king to use his
                    position to the detriment of the state. The army is an annual institution, the
                    Army Act of each session (which corresponds to the Mutiny Act passed annually up
                    to 1878) reciting the provision of the Bill of Rights, “that the raising or
                    keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with
                    consent of parliament, is against law.” The right of command carries with it as
                    an incident the right to build forts and defences, to impress seamen in case of
                    necessity, and to prohibit the importation of munitions of war (39 and 40 Vict.
                    c. 36, s. 43), also the right to the soil of the foreshore and of estuaries of
                    rivers, and the jurisdiction over territorial waters. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Navigation Laws.)</hi> Other rights which fall under the political branch of
                    the prerogative may be called the commercial rights, including the coining of
                    money, the regulating of weights and measures, the establishing of markets and
                    fairs, and the erecting of beacons, lighthouses, and sea-marks. The king also
                    has the power of constituting corporations. A royal grant to inhabitants makes
                    them a corporation for the purposes of the grant. The king is presumed to be the
                    visitor of all civil corporations. As <hi rend="italic">parens patriae</hi> he
                    is <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> guardian of infants, idiots, and lunatics.
                    It is scarcely necessary to point out that all these prerogatives (except the
                    conferring of honours and such prerogatives as are purely personal) are
                    exercised through responsible ministers, practically in these days members of
                    the party to which the majority of the House of Commons belongs. Thus the
                    jurisdiction over infants, &amp;c., is exercised in England by the lord
                    chancellor, and over beacons, &amp;c., by the Trinity House, under the general
                    superintendence of the Board of Trade.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Judicial.—</hi> The king is the fountain of justice, and the
                    supreme conservator of the peace of the realm. “By the fountain of justice,” as
                    has been well said by Blackstone, “the law does not mean the <hi rend="italic"
                    >author</hi> or <hi rend="italic">original,</hi> but only the <hi rend="italic"
                    >distributor.</hi> Justice is not derived from the sovereign, as from his <hi
                    rend="italic">free gift</hi>; but he is the steward of the public, to dispense
                    it to whom it is <hi rend="italic">due.</hi> He is not the spring, but the
                    reservoir, from whence right and equity are conducted, by a thousand channels,
                    to every individual” (Stephen’s <hi rend="italic">Comm.,</hi> vol. ii. bk. iv.
                    pt. i. ch. vi. ). The king was bound to the observance of justice by the
                    well-known words of <hi rend="italic">Magna Carta,</hi> “Nulli vendemus, nulli
                    negabimus aut differemus, rectum aut justiciam.” As supreme judge the king has
                    the appointment of all judicial officers (other than those in certain local
                    courts), who act as his deputies. He may constitute legal courts for the
                    administration of the general law of the land, but he cannot erect tribunals not
                    proceeding according to the known and established law of the realm, such as the
                    Star Chamber (see above) or the commissions of martial law' forbidden by the
                    Petition of Right. Nor can he add to the jurisdiction of courts; thus he cannot
                    give a spiritual court temporal <pb break="no"

                    the <hi rend="italic">curia</hi><hi rend="italic">regis.</hi> The growth of a
                    permanent judicature seems to be due to the increase of judicial business,
                    making it impossible for the king to hear all the suits in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >curia regis</hi> in person. Appeals from the colonies, the Channel Islands, and
                    the Isle of Man still lie to the crown in council, a jurisdiction now
                    practically exercised by the judicial committee of the privy council. The king
                    is still (or was until very recently) in theory present in court. Actions in the
                    Queen’s Bench were until modern times said to be <hi rend="italic">coram rege
                    ipso,</hi> and the king could not be non-suited, for a non-suit implied the
                    non-appearance of the plaintiff in court. The king enforces judgment by means of
                    the sheriff, who represents the executive authority. As supreme conservator of
                    the peace, the king, through the lordlieutenant in counties and through the lord
                    chancellor in cities and boroughs, appoints justices of the peace. In the same
                    capacity he is the prosecutor of crimes. All indictments still conclude with the
                    words ‘ ‘ against the peace of our lady the Queen, her crown and dignity.” As it
                    is the king’s peace that is broken by the commission of a crime, the king has,
                    as the offended party, the power of remission. The king cannot be sued by
                    ordinary action. He may sue by ordinary action, but he has the advantage of
                    being able to use prerogative process (see below). He has the right of
                    intervention in all litigation λvhere his rights are concerned, or in the
                    interests of public justice, as where collusion is alleged between the decree
                    nisi and the decree absolute in divorce. Crown debts have priority in
                    administration and bankruptcy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical.—</hi> The king is recognized as head of the
                    church by 26 Hen. VIII. c. 1 and 1 Eliz. c. 1. By this prerogative he convenes
                    and dissolves convocation and nominates to vacant bishoprics and other
                    ecclesiastical preferments. He is also guardian of the temporalities during the
                    vacancy of a see, but this is now merely a nominal prerogative. The dean and
                    chapter of a cathedral cannot proceed to the election of a bishop without the
                    king’s permission to elect <hi rend="italic">{congé d'élire).</hi> When any
                    benefice is vacant by the promotion of the incumbent to a bishopric other than a
                    colonial bishopric the king has the patronage <hi rend="italic">pro hoc
                    vice.</hi> He is the supreme court of appeal in ecclesiastical cases. This
                    appellate jurisdiction is now vested in the judicial committee of the privy
                    council, with the assistance of archbishops and bishops as assessors (39 and 40
                    Vict. c. 59, s. 14). The king cannot create new ecclesiastical jurisdiction in
                    England or in colonies other than crown colonies. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bishop.)</hi> Where a new bishopric is created it is under the powers of an Act
                    of parliament. It seems to be as head of .the church that the king grants
                    licences to hold in mortmain, though the right now extends to lay as well as
                    ecclesiastical corporations. The right is acknowledged by 7 and 8 Will. III. c.
                    37.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fiscal.—</hi> The theory of the constitution is that the king,
                    being entrusted with the defence of the realm and the administration of justice,
                    must have sufficient means given him for the purpose. The bulk of the revenue of
                    the Norman and Plantagenet kings was derived from crown lands and feudal dues.
                    At the present day the rents of crown lands form a very small part of the
                    revenue, and the feudal dues do not exist except in the pecuniarily unimportant
                    cases of escheat, royal fish, wrecks, treasure-trove, waifs and strays, &amp;c.
                    Of the revenue a comparatively small part (the civil list) is pai&lt;l to the
                    king in person, the rest (the consolidated fund) is applied to public
                    purposes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prerogative Process. —</hi> This is the name given to certain
                    methods of procedure which the crown alone has the right of using; such are
                    inquest of office (an inquiry by jury concerning the right of the crown to land
                    or goods), extent (a mode of execution), <hi rend="italic">scire facias</hi>
                    (for the resumption of a grant), and information (by which proceedings are
                    commenced in the name of the attorney-general for a public wrong or for injury
                    to crown property).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prerogative Writs.—</hi> Certain writs are called “prerogative
                    writs,” as distinguished from writs of right, because it is within the
                    prerogative to issue or reissue them. In order to induce the court to issue them
                    a <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> case must be made out
                    by the applicant. Writs of right, on the other hand, are <hi rend="italic"
                    >ex</hi><hi rend="italic">debito</hi><hi rend="italic">justitiae,</hi> and
                    cannot be refused. Examples of prerogative writs are <hi rend="italic"
                    >certiorari, habeas corpus, mandamus, procedendo, prohibition, quo
                    warranto.</hi><hi rend="italic">Prerogative Courts.—</hi> This was the name
                    given to the provincial courts of Canterbury and York, as far as regarded their
                    jurisdiction over the estates of deceased persons. They had jurisdiction to
                    grant probate or administration where the diocesan courts could not entertain
                    the case owing to the deceased having died possessed of goods above the value of
                    £5 <hi rend="italic">(bona notabilia)</hi> in each of two or more dioceses. The
                    jurisdiction of the prerogative courts was transferred to the Court of Probate
                    in 1857 by 20 and 21 Viet c. 77, and is now vested in the Probate, Divorce, and
                    Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice by the Judicature Act, 1873 (36
                    and 37 Viet c. 66, s. 34).</p>
                <p>In the State of New Jersey, United States, the court having jurisdiction over
                    probate matters is called the Prerogative Court <hi rend="italic">{Kent’s
