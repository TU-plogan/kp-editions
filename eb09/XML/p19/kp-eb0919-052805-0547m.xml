                <p><label type="entry">PORTLAND</label>, a city and port of entry of the United
                    States, capital of Cumberland county, Maine, lies on Casco Bay, in 43° 39' N.
                    lat. and 70° 13' W. long. By rail it is 108 miles north-north-east of Boston and
                    297 southeast of Montreal. The peninsula on which it is mainly built runs out
                    for about 3 miles, has a breadth of about I mile, and rises in the west to 175
                    feet in Bramhall’s Hill and in the east to 161 in Mun-joy’s Hill, which is
                    crowned by an observatory. As seen from the harbour, the whole city has a
                    pleasant and picturesque appearance, and the streets are in many parts so
                    umbrageous with trees that</p>
                <p>Portland has obtained the sobriquet of the “Forest City.” A large number of the
                    houses are built of brick. Congress street, the principal thoroughfare, runs
                    along the whole ridge of the peninsula, from the western promenade, which looks
                    down over the suburbs from Bramhall’s Hill to the eastern promenade, which
                    commands the bay; it passes Lincoln Park (2⅜ acres) and the eastern cemetery,
                    which contains the graves of Commodore Preble and Captains Burroughs and Blythe,
                    of Revolutionary fame. On Bramhall’s Hill is the reservoir (12,000,000 gallons)
                    of the water company, which was established in 1867 to supply the city from Lake
                    Sebago, whose beautiful expanse (14 miles long by 11 wide) was the favourite
                    haunt of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s boyhood. The more conspicuous buildings of
                    Portland are the city hall (1859), with a front in olivecoloured freestone, 150
                    feet long; the post-office (1872), constructed of Vermont white marble in the
                    mediaeval Italian style; the custom-house (1872), in granite, with rich marble
                    ornamentation in the interior; the marine hospital (1855), a large brick
                    erection; the Maine general hospital, 1868; the Roman Catholic cathedral; the
                    Roman Catholic episcopal palace; and several fine churches. The Portland Society
                    of Natural History, established in 1843 and incorporated in 1850, though it has
                    twice lost its property by fire (1854 and 1866), has again acquired very
                    valuable collections. The Portland institute and public library, dating from
                    1867, had 30,000 volumes in 1884. A medical school was founded in 1858. Portland
                    is in the main a commercial city, with an extensive transit trade, drawing
                    largely from Canada and the Far West. Connected with Boston by rail in 1842, and
                    with Montreal <pb break="no"

                    different railroads; and, since the gauge of the Grand Trunk Railroad was
                    altered, it can import direct from San Francisco. As the harbour (which lies
                    along the south side of the city) is seldom closed by ice, it has been long used
                    as the winter port for the great ocean steamers between Great Britain (Liverpool
                    and Glasgow) and Canada, which in summer ascend the St Lawrence to Montreal and
                    Quebec. At low water vessels drawing 22 feet and at high water vessels drawing
                    30 feet can come up to the wharves with</p>

                    The dry dock is one of the deepest in the United States. The following figures
                    show the extent of the foreign trade :—·</p>
                <p>Among the staple imports are wood, coal, potatoes (from Europe), salt, sugar and
                    molasses, fish, earthenware, and textile manufactures; and among the staple
                    exports to foreign countries fresh and preserved provisions of all kinds, grain,
                    hay, cattle, wood, copper ore, tallow, shoes, potash, cotton, lumber (mainly to
                    South America), and ice. In 1870 the total receipts of grain amounted to
                    1,516,875 bushels, in 1875 to 2,152,829, in 1878 to 4,492,952, and in 1883 to
                    4,964,158 bushels, or, adding flour, 7,543,873 bushels. The number of entrances
                    from foreign ports in 1883 was 338 (164,711 tons), clearances for foreign ports
                    501 (226,420 tons); entrances in the coasting trade 479 (403,166 tons), and
                    clearances 389 (394,500 tons). In the same year the Portland-owned vessels
                    numbered 368 (105,642 tons); and 116 were employed in the mackerel and cod
                    fisheries. Fish-curing (cod, mackerel, and sardines), preserving meat, Indian
                    corn, and other kinds of provisions, boot and shoe making, furniture-making,
                    carriage-building, machinery-making, engine-building, and sugar-refining are all
                    prosecuted on a considerable scale for the size of the town; and a large number
                    of minor industries are also represented. In 1884 there were six national banks,
                    with an aggregate capital of $3,250,000, and two savings banks, with deposits of
                    $8,966,879. In 1880 the capital invested in manufactur ing was $4,659,375, the
                    value of the annual production $9,569,523, and the amount of wages paid
                    $1,547,375. Portland is divided into seven wards, and is governed by a mayor, a
                    board of aidermen, and a common council. It is the seat of the sessions of the
                    United States courts for the district of Maine. The assessed value of property
                    was $30,723,936 in 1874, and $33,030,020 in 1883. The population was 3704 in
                    1800, 20,815 in 1850, 31,413 in 1870, and 33,810 in 1880. If the adjoining
                    villages be included, the total is raised to between 45,000 and 50,000.</p>
                <p>The name of Portland as applied to this city dates only from 1786; the Indians
                    knew the place as Machigonne. The first European settlers (1632) called it Casco
                    Neck, and after it passed to Massachusetts in 1658 it was denominated Falmouth.
                    During the rest of the 17th century and the early years of the 18th hostilities
                    on the part of the French and the Indians prevented the growth of the town,
                    which by 1764, however, had increased to about 2000 inhabitants. In 1775 it was
                    bombarded by four British vessels under Captain Mowatt, but it was rebuilt in
                    1783, and formally incorporated in 1786. A city charter was obtained in 1832.
                    The great fire of 1866 swept over a third of the city and caused a loss of from
                    $6,000,000 to $10,000,000. Portland is the birthplace of Henry W. Longfellow, N.
                    P. Willis, Sara P. Parton (“Fanny Fern”), Erastus and James Brooks, Commodore
                    Preble, John Neal, and Neal Dow.</p>
