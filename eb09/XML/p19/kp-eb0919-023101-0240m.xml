                <p><label type="entry">PLUNKET, <hi rend="smallcaps">William Conyngham Plunket,
                    Baron</hi></label> (1765-1854), an eminent lawyer, orator, and statesman, was
                    born in the county of Fermanagh in July 1765. He &gt;√as educated in boyhood by
                    his father, a man of considerable ability and reputation; and in 1779 he became
                    a student of Trinity College, Dublin. Though well versed in regular academic
                    studies, he was most conspicuous in his university career as the acknowledged
                    leader of the Historical Society, the debating club of Trinity College, then
                    full of young men of remarkable promise.</p>
                <p>Having entered Lincoln’s Inn in 1784, Plunket was called to the Irish bar in
                    1787. His intellect was exactly that of a jurist or a great master of equity—not
                    too refining or overprone to speculation, and yet capable of the highest legal
                    generalizations, and of applying them to masses of fact, however tedious and
                    complicated. His power of close and rapid argument was very remarkable, his
                    memory equally capacious and exact, and he had enriched an ample store of
                    professional learning with the fruits of assiduous general study. Although at
                    first his progress at the bar was not rapid, he gradually obtained a
                    considerable practice in equity; and, after an apprenticeship of eleven years as
                    a junior, he was raised to the rank of king’s counsel in 1798.</p>
                <p>In 1798 he entered the Irish parliament as member for Charlemont. His political
                    faith was already settled, and was only slightly modified in after life, at
                    least as regards its cardinal tenets. He was an anti-Jacobin Whig of the school
                    of Burke, not ungracefully filled with a fervent Irish patriotism. He disliked
                    the principles of the French Revolution, and its excesses made such an
                    impression upon him that he always showed the greatest antipathy to merely
                    democratic movements. But he was a sincere admirer of the constitutional
                    government of England as established in 1688; he even justified the ascendency
                    it had given to the Established Church, although he thought that the time had
                    arrived for extending toleration to Roman Catholics and dissenters. To transfer
                    it to Ireland as thus modified, and under an independent legislature, was even
                    in his youth the only reform he sought for his country; and, although he opposed
                    the Union with all his power, this was only because he thought it incompatible
                    with this object.</p>
                <p>When Plunket became a member of parliament, the Irish Whig party was almost
                    extinct, and Pitt was feeling his way to accomplish the Union. In this he was
                    seconded ably by Lord Castlereagh, by the panic caused by a wild insurrection,
                    and by the secession of Grattan from politics. When, however, the measure was
                    actually brought forward, it encountered a vehement opposition; and among the
                    ablest and fiercest of its adversaries was Plunket, whose powers as a great
                    orator were now universally recognized. His speeches in these debates show all
                    the force of reasoning, the admirable arrangement, and the grasp of facts which
                    characterize his later efforts; but they are somewhat disfigured by personal
                    invective, and here and there betray an indecent acrimony. They raised him,
                    however, immediately to the front rank of his party; and, when Grattan
                    re-entered the moribund senate, he took his seat next to Plunket, thus
                    significantly recognizing the place the latter had attained.</p>
                <p>After the union of Great Britain and Ireland Plunket returned to the practice of
                    his profession, and became at once a leader of the equity bar. In 1803, after
                    the outbreak of Emmet’s rebellion, he was selected as one of the crown lawyers
                    to prosecute the unfortunate enthusiast, and at the trial, in summing up the
                    evidence, delivered a speech of remarkable power, which shows his characteristic
                    dislike of revolutionary outbursts. For this speech he was exposed to much
                    unmerited obloquy, and more especially to the abuse of Cobbett, against whom he
                    brought a successful action for damages. In 1804, in Pitt’s second
                    administration, he became solicitor-general and then attorney-general for
                    Ireland; and he continued in office when Lord Grenville came into power at the
                    head of the ministry of All the Talents. Plunket held a seat in the imperial
                    parliament during this period, and there made several able speeches in favour of
                    Catholic emancipation, and of continuing the war with France; but, when the
                    Grenville cabinet was dissolved, he returned once more to professional life, and
                    for some years devoted himself exclusively to it.</p>
                <p>In 1812, having amassed a considerable fortune, he reentered parliament as member
                    for Trinity College, and identified himself thoroughly with the Grenville or
                    antiGallican Whigs. He was now in the full maturity of his powers, and very soon
                    was acknowledged one of the first orators, if not the first, of the House of
                    Commons. His reverence for the English constitution in church and state, his
                    strong dislike of French principles, his steady advocacy of the war with
                    Napoleon, and his antipathy to anything like democracy made him popular with the
                    Tory party. On the other hand, he was the zealous and most able supporter<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0241-0232"/> of Catholic emancipation; he was not averse to
                    some measure of parliamentary reform; and, as generally he was on the side of
                    constitutional progress, he was reckoned a principal ornament of one of the
                    sections of the Whigs.</p>
                <p>In 1822 Plunket was once more attorney-general for Ireland, with Lord Wellesley
                    as lord-lieutenant. One of his first official acts was to prosecute for the
                    “bottle riot,” an attempt on his part to put down the Orange faction in Ireland.
                    But, though always the advocate of the Catholic claims, he strenuously opposed
                    the Catholic Association, which about this time, under the guidance of
                    O’Connell, began its extraordinary and successful agitation. He struggled
                    vehemently to extinguish it, and in 1825 made a powerful speech against it; and
                    thus the curious spectacle was seen of the ablest champion of an oppressed sect
                    doing all in his power to check its efforts to emancipate itself.</p>
                <p>In 1827 Plunket was made master of the rolls in England; but, owing to the
                    professional jealousy of the bar, who not unnaturally thought him an intruder,
                    he was obliged to abandon this office. Soon afterwards he became chief justice
                    of the common pleas in Ireland, and was then created a peer of the United
                    Kingdom. In 1830 he was appointed lord chancellor of Ireland, and held the
                    office, with an interval of a few months only, until 1841, when he finally
                    retired from public life. During this period he made some able speeches in
                    favour of parliamentary reform; but they were scarcely equal to his earlier
                    efforts; and his reputation as a judge, though far from low, was not so eminent
                    as might have been expected. He died in 1854, in his ninetieth year. (w. o.
