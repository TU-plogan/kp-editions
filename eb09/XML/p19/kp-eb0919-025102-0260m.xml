                    by what is now the Col d’Altare or Col di Cadibona and has gradually been filled
                    by detritus from the surrounding highlands. That its course lies much nearer the
                    Apennines than the Alps is evidently due to the fact that the tributaries from
                    the loftier range on the north, whether in the form of glacier or stream, have
                    all along been much more powerful than the tributaries from the south. The total
                    length of the river from its conventional source to the mouth of the principal
                    channel is 417⅛ miles, and the area of its basin, which includes portions of
                    Switzerland and Austria, is estimated at 26,798 square miles. The general course
                    of the river has been already described in <hi rend="smallcaps">Italy</hi> (vol.
                    xiii. p. 435).</p>
                <p>The Po forms a very extensive delta, and is probably one of the most active of
                    all rivers in the work of denudation. Prony has calculated that between 1200 and
                    1600 the delta advanced at the rate of 80 feet per annum; and between 1600 and
                    1804 the rate is said to have been as much as 230 feet. This advance has
                    naturally been attended by great changes in the course and size of the several
                    channels. Ravenna, for example, once a great port, now stands on dry land 4
                    miles from the sea. The modern lagoons of Comacchio, which stretch southwards
                    from the delta, are being artificially reclaimed by the help of the alluvial
                    deposits.</p>
                <p>In its ordinary condition the Po has a depth between Pancalieri and the month of
                    the Ticino of from 6 to 10 feet, and between the mouth of the Lambro and that of
                    the Adda of about 14 or 15 feet. Lower down the depth occasionally exceeds 40
                    feet. Permanent fords exist only in the upper Po, and between the mouths of the
                    Ticino and the Lambro. In times of great drought the bed is quite dry at
                    Rovello, and fords appear below Casalmaggiore and at Borgoforte, where the
                    French and Germans crossed in 1796, 1807, 1813, and 1814; but in general the
                    river forms a complete barrier both to foot and horse. The principal points
                    where crossing is effected by ferries or bridges are *Moncalieri, Turin, *Casale
                    Monferrato, Frassinato, *Valenza, *Mezzana Corti, *Piacenza, Cremona,
                    Casalmaggiore, Brescello, *Borgoforte, San Benedetto, Ostiglia, *Occhiobello,
                    Pontelagoscuro, Francolino. Railway bridges exist at the places distinguished by
                    an asterisk.</p>
                <p>The river in general is at its fullest in May and June, and at its lowest in
                    January (see details in Lombardini’s elaborate study on the lower Po in <hi
                    rend="italic">Memorie del Reale Istituto Lombardo,</hi> Milan, 1870). The
                    ordinary floods on the Po are attended with little danger; but at intervals
                    sometimes of a few sometimes of many years they become events of the gravest
                    national concern. Those of 1651 and 1705 are among the most destructive recorded
                    in history, and in the present century the more memorable are those of 1839,
                    1846, 1855, 1857, 1868, 1872, and 1879. In 1872 1150 square miles of country
                    between the Reno and ∙the Adige were submerged, the district about Modena was
                    turned into a lake, the people of Revere saved the rest of their town only by
                    sacrificing the front row of houses to form a temporary embankment, and it was
                    only by the wisely conducted energy of its inhabitants that Ostiglia was kept
                    from destruction. During April and May 1879 the rainfall was exceptionally
                    heavy, the quantity for May alone being equal to more than a third of the annual
                    total. The result was a rise in all the tributaries of the Po, and on May 30 the
                    flood in the main river was 21 feet above low water at Mt·zzana Corta. A breach
                    720 feet long in the embankment between Bonizzo and Borgofranco caused the
                    submergence of 155 square miles in the provinces of Mantua, Modena, and Ferrara,
                    and involved in its repair a national expenditure of £53,460.</p>
                <p>Of the £5,902,981 devoted by the Government to the regulation of the rivers of
                    Italy in the twenty years 1861-1880, £2,257,872 had to be appropriated to the Po
                    and its tributaries. Nowhere in Europe except in Holland has the system of
                    embankment been carried to such perfection on so extensive a scale. A wide bed
                    for the river at its height is enclosed for long distances by a massive
                    master-dyke or <hi rend="italic">froldo,</hi> and in the space between this and
                    the ordinary channels suitable areas are often enclosed by secondary dykes or
                    <hi rend="italic">golene.</hi> The following figures show the extent of the

                    Leipsic, 1879) show that the lower valley of the Po was at an early period
                    occupied by people of the Palaeolithic and Neolithic stages of civilization, who
                    built houses on piles along the swampy borders of the streams. It is possible
                    that even they may have begun by crude dykes the great system by which the
                    waters are now controlled; at least it is certain that these works date their
                    origin from pre-Roman antiquity. Pliny refers them to the Etruscans, who
                    occupied the country before the arrival of the Gauls. The reclaiming and
                    protecting of the riparian lands went on rapidly under the Romans, and in
                    several places the rectangular divisions of the ground, still remarkably
                    distinct, show the military character of some of the agricultural colonies.
                    During the time of the barbarian invasions much of the protective system was
                    allowed to fall into decay; but the later part of the Middle Ages saw the works
                    resumed and carried out with great energy, so that the main features of the
                    present arrangement were in existence by the close of the 15th century.</p>
                <p>The usual name for the Po among Greek and Latin authors was Padus (∏αδor); but
                    the Greek writers of the empire began to apply to it the poetic name of
                    Eridanus, familiar in the Phaethon myth.</p>
