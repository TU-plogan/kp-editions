                    rend="italic">Salicaceae.</hi> The catkins of the poplars differ from those of
                    the nearly allied willows in the presence of a rudimentary perianth, of
                    obliquely cup-shaped form, within the toothed <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0530-0511"/> bracteal scales; the male flowers contain from
                    eight to thirty stamens; the fertile bear a one-celled (nearly divided) ovary,
                    surmounted by the deeply cleft stigmas; the two-valved capsule contains several
                    seeds, each furnished with a long tuft of silky or cotton-like hairs. The leaves
                    are broader than in most willows, and are generally either deltoid or ovate in
                    shape, often cordate at the base, and frequently with slender petioles
                    vertically flattened. Many of the species attain a large size, and all are of
                    very rapid growth. The poplars are almost entirely confined to the north
                    temperate zone, but a few approach or even pass its northern limit, and they are
                    widely distributed within that area; they show, like the willows, a partiality
                    for moist ground, and often line the river-sides in otherwise treeless
                    districts. The number of species cannot be very accurately defined,—several,
                    usually regarded as distinct, being probably merely variable forms of the same
                    type. All yield a soft easily-worked timber, which, though very perishable when
                    exposed to Xveather, possesses sufficient durability when kept dry to give the
                    trees a certain economic value.</p>
                <p>Of the European kinds, one of the most important and best marked forms is the
                    White Poplar or Abele, <hi rend="italic">P. alba,</hi> a tree of large size,
                    with rounded spreading head and curved branches, which, like the trunk, are
                    covered with a greyish-white bark, becoming much furrowed on old stems. The
                    leaves are ovate or nearly round in general outline, but with deeply waved, more
                    or less lobed and indented margins and cordate base; the upper side is of a dark
                    green tint, but the lower surface is clothed with a dense white down, which
                    likewise covers the young shoots,— giving, with the bark, a hoary aspect to the
                    whole tree. As in all poplars, the catkins expand in early spring, long before
                    the leaves unfold; the ovaries bear four linear stigma lobes; the capsules ripen
                    in May. A nearly related form, which may be regarded as a sub-species, <hi
                    rend="italic">P. canescens,</hi> the Grey Poplar of the nurseryman, is
                    distinguished from the true abele by its smaller, less deeply cut leaves, which
                    are grey on the upper side, but not so hoary beneath as those of <hi
                    rend="italic">P. alba</hi>; the pistil has eight stigma lobes. Both trees
                    occasionally attain a height of 90 feet or more, but rarely continue to form
                    sound timber beyond the first half-century of growth, though the trunk will
                    sometimes endure for a hundred and fifty years. The wood is very white, and,
                    from its soft and even grain, is employed by turners and toy-makers, while,
                    being tough and little liable to split, it is also serviceable for the
                    construction of packing cases, the lining of carts and waggons, and many similar
                    purposes; when thoroughly seasoned it makes good flooring planks, but shrinks
                    much in drying, weighing about 58 per cubic foot when green, but only 33∣ lb
                    when dry. The white poplar is an ornamental tree, from its graceful though
                    somewhat irregular growth, and its dense hoary foliage; it has, however, the
                    disadvantage of throwing up numerous suckers for some yards around the
                    trunk.</p>
                <p>The grey and white poplars are usually multiplied by long cuttings; the growth is
                    so rapid in a moist loamy soil that, according to Loudon, cuttings 9 feet in
                    length, planted beside a stream, formed in twelve years trunks 10 inches in
                    diameter. Both these allied forms occur throughout central and southern Europe,
                    but, though now abundant in England, it is doubtful whether they are there
                    indigenous. <hi rend="italic">P. alba</hi> suffers much from the ravages of
                    wood-eating larvae, and also from fungoid growths, especially where the branches
                    have been removed by pruning or accident; trunks have occasionally acquired a
                    diameter of 3 feet and upwards.</p>
                <p>The aspens form an important section, of which the Common Aspen of Europe, <hi
                    rend="italic">P. tremula,</hi> may be taken as the type,—a tall fast-growing
                    tree with rather slender trunk, and grey bark becoming rugged when old; the
                    orbicular leaves, toothed on the margin, and slightly downy when young, are
                    afterwards smooth, dark-green on the upper and greyish-green on the lower
                    surface; the long slender petioles, much flattened towards the outer end, allow
                    of free lateral motion by the slightest breeze, giving the foliage its
                    well-known tremulous character.</p>
                <p>The aspen is an abundant tree in the northern parts of Britain, even as far as
                    Sutherland, and is occasionally found in the coppices of the southern counties,
                    but in these latter habitats seldom reaches any large size; throughout northern
                    Europe it abounds in the forests,—in Lapland flourishing even in 70° N. lat.,
                    while in Siberia its range extends to the Arctic Circle; in Norway its upper
                    limit is said to coincide with that of the pine; trees exist near the western
                    coast having stems 15 feet in circumference. The wood of the aspen is very light
                    and soft, though tough; it is employed by coopers, chiefly for pails and
                    herring-casks; it is also made into butchers’ trays, pack-saddles, and various
                    articles for which its lightness recommends it; sabots are also made of it in
                    France, and in mediaeval days it was valued for arrows, especially for those
                    used in target practice; the bark is used for tanning in northern countries;
                    cattle and deer browse greedily on the young shoots and abundant suckers. Aspen
                    wood makes but indifferent fuel, but charcoal prepared from it is light and
                    friable, and has been employed in gunpowder manufacture. The powdered bark is
                    sometimes given to horses as a vermifuge; it possesses likewise tonic and
                    febrifugal properties, containing a considerable amount of salicin. The aspen is
                    readily propagated either by cuttings or suckers, but has been but little
                    planted of late years in Britain. <hi rend="italic">P. trepida,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">tremuloides,</hi> is closely allied to the European aspen, being
                    chiefly distinguished by its more pointed leaves; it is a native of most parts
                    of Canada and the United States, extending northwards as far as Great Slave
                    Lake. The American Aspen is a smaller tree than <hi rend="italic">P.
                    tremula,</hi> seldom rising to a greater height than 30 feet, and rarely forming
                    timber of any value; the wood burns better in the green state than that of most
                    trees, and is often used by the hunters of the northwest as fuel; split into
                    thin layers, it was formerly employed in the States for bonnet and hat making;
                    the bark is of some value as a tonic and febrifuge. <hi rend="italic">P.
                    grandidentata,</hi> the Large-leaved American Aspen, is a tree of larger growth,
                    with ovate or roundish leaves deeply and irregularly serrated on the margin. The
                    wood is strong, and considered durable for indoor use; it is also employed in
                    some districts for fences; split into slender strips, it has been applied to the
                    manufacture of hats, like that of the Canadian aspen.</p>
                <p>Some of the most valuable trees of the genus belong to a section remarkable for
                    the elongation of the fertile catkins, which become lax towards maturity. <hi
                    rend="italic">P. nigra,</hi> the Black Poplar, one of the most important of this
                    group, is a tree of large growth, with dark deeply-furrowed bark on the trunk,
                    and ash-coloured branches; the smooth deltoid leaves, serrated regularly on the
                    margin, are of the deep green tint which has given name to the tree; the
                    petioles, slightly compressed, are only about half the length of the leaves. The
                    black poplar is common in central and southern Europe and in some of the
                    adjacent parts of Asia, but, though abundantly planted in Britain, is probably
                    not there indigenous. The wood is of a yellowish tint. In former days this was
                    the prevalent poplar in Britain, and the timber was employed for the purposes to
                    which that of other species is applied, but has been superseded by <hi
                    rend="italic">P. monilifera</hi> and its varieties; it probably furnished the
                    poplar-wood of the Romans, which, from its lightness and soft tough grain, was
                    in esteem for shield-making; in continental Europe it is still in some request;
                    the bark, in Russia, is used for tanning leather, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n531/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0531-0512"/> while in Kamchatka it is sometimes ground up and
                    mixed with meal; the gum secreted by the buds was employed by the old herbalists
                    for various medicinal purposes, but is probably nearly inert; the cotton-like
                    down of the seed has been converted into a kind of vegetable felt, and has also
                    been used in paper-making. A closely related form is the well-known Lombardy
                    Poplar, <hi rend="italic">P. fastigiata,</hi> remarkable for its tall
                    cypress-like shape, caused by the nearly vertical growth of the branches.
                    Probably a mere variety of the black poplar, its native land appears to have
                    been Persia or some neighbouring country; it was unknown in Italy in the days of
                    Pliny, while from remote times it has been an inhabitant of Kashmir, the Punjab,
                    and Persia, where it is often planted along roadsides for the purpose of shade;
                    it was probably brought from these countries to southern Europe, and derives its
                    popular name from its abundance along the banks of the Po and other rivers of
                    Lombardy, where it is said now to spring up naturally from seed, like the
                    indigenous black poplar. It was introduced into France in 1749, and appears to
                    have been grown in Germany and Britain soon after the middle of the last
                    century, if not earlier. The Lombardy poplar is valuable chiefly as an
                    ornamental tree, its timber being of very inferior quality; its tall erect
                    growth renders it useful to the landscape-gardener as a relief to the rounded
                    forms of other trees, or in contrast to the horizontal lines of the lake or
                    river-bank where it delights to grow. In Lombardy and France tall hedges are
                    sometimes formed of this poplar for shelter or shade, while in the suburban
                    parks of Britain it is serviceable as a screen for hiding buildings or other
                    unsightly objects from view; its growth is extremely rapid, and it often attains
                    a height of 100 feet and upwards, while from 70 to 80 feet is an ordinary size
                    in favourable situations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">canadensis,</hi> the “Cotton-wood” of
                    the western prairies, and its varieties are perhaps the most useful trees of the
                    genus, often forming almost the only arborescent vegetation on the great
                    American plains. The <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">canadensis</hi>
                    of Michaux, which may be regarded as the type of this group, is a tree of rather
                    large growth, with rugged grey trunk, and with the shoots or young branches more
                    or less angular; the glossy deltoid leaves are sharply pointed, somewhat cordate
                    at the base, and with flattened petioles; the fertile catkins ripen about the
                    middle of June, when their opening capsules discharge the cottony seeds which
                    have given the tree its common western name; in New England it is sometimes
                    called the “River Poplar.” The cotton-wood timber, though soft and perishable,
                    is of value in its prairie habitats, where it is frequently the only available
                    wood either for carpentry or fuel; it has been planted to a considerable extent
                    in some parts of Europe, but in England a kindred form, <hi rend="italic"
                    >P.</hi><hi rend="italic">monilifera,</hi> is generally preferred from its
                    larger and more rapid growth. In this well-known variety the young shoots are
                    but slightly angled, and the branches in the second year become round; the
                    deltoid short-pointed leaves are usually straight or even rounded at the base,
                    but sometimes are slightly cordate; the capsules ripen in Britain about the
                    middle of May. This tree is of extremely rapid growth, and has been known to
                    attain a height of 70 feet in sixteen years; the trunk occasionally acquires a
                    diameter of from 3 to 5 feet, and, according to Emerson, a tree near New
                    Ashford, Massachusetts, measured 20 feet 5 inches in circumference; it succeeds
                    best in deep loamy soil, but will flourish in nearly any moist but well-drained
                    situation. The timber is much used in some rural districts for flooring, and is
                    durable for indoor purposes when protected from dry-rot; it has, like most
                    poplar woods, the property of resisting fire better than other timber. The
                    native country of this sub-species has been much disputed; but, though still
                    known in many British nurseries as the “Black Italian Poplar,” it is now well
                    ascertained to be an indigenous tree in many parts of Canada and the States, and
                    is probably a mere variety of <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >canadensis</hi>; it seems to have been first brought to England from Canada in
                    1772. In America it seldom attains the large size it often acquires in England,
                    and it is there of less rapid growth than the prevailing form of the western
                    plains; the name of “cottonwood” is locally given to other species. <hi
                    rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">macrophylla</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >candi</hi><hi rend="italic">cans,</hi> commonly known as the Ontario Poplar, is
                    remarkable for its very large heart-shaped leaves, sometimes 10 inches long; it
                    is found in New England and the milder parts of Canada, and is frequently·
                    planted? in Britain; its growth is extremely rapid in moist land; the buds are
                    covered with a balsamic secretion. The true Balsam Poplar, or Tacamahac, <hi
                    rend="italic">P. l·alsamifera,</hi> abundant in most parts of Canada and the
                    northern States, is a tree of rather large growth, often of somewhat fastigiate
                    habit, with round shoots and oblong-ovate sharp-pointed leaves, the base never
                    cordate, the petioles round, and the disk deep glossy green above but somewhat
                    downy below. This tree, the “Hard” of the Canadian voyageur, abounds on many of
                    the river sides of the north-western plains; it occurs in the neighbourhood of
                    the Great Slave Lake and along the Mackenzie river, and forms much of the
                    drift-wood of the Arctic coast. In these northern habitats it attains a large
                    size; the wood is very soft; the buds yield a gum-like balsam, from which the
                    common name is derived; considered valuable as an antiscorbutic, this is said
                    also to have diuretic properties; it was formerly imported into Europe in small
                    quantities, under the name of “baume focot,” being scraped off in the spring and
                    put into shells. This balsam gives the tree a fragrant odour when the leaves are
                    unfolding. The tree grows well in Britain, and acquires occasionally a
                    considerable size. A very closely allied variety abounds in Siberia and Dauria,
                    chiefly distinguished by its wider leaves, rounded growth, and the darker tint
                    of its wood; a kind of wine, esteemed as a diuretic, is prepared in Siberia from
                    the buds. Its fragrant shoots and the fine yellow green of the young leaves
                    recommend it to the ornamental planter. It is said by Aiton to have been
                    introduced into Britain about the end of the 17th century. (C. P. J.)</p>
