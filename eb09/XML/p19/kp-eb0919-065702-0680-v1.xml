                    Bohemian, <hi rend="italic">Praha),</hi> the capital of Bohemia, the seat of an
                    archbishop, and the third largest town of the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, lies
                    on both banks of the Moldau in 50° 5' N. lat. and 14° 25' E. long., 150 miles to
                    the north-west of Vienna and 75 miles to the south-south-east of Dresden. Its
                    position, near the centre of the country and at the only point where the valley
                    of the Moldau expands sufficiently to make room for a great city, marks it out
                    as the natural capital of Bohemia, and the picturesque effect of its masses of
                    buildings and innumerable spires and towers, filling the valley and climbing the
                    hills on either side, is enhanced by their stirring historical background. The
                    heights on the left bank descend somewhat rapidly to the river and are crowned
                    by the venerable Hradschin, or palace of the Bohemian kings, which forms the
                    dominant feature in every view of the town. On the other bank there is a
                    considerable level space between the river and the base of the hills. An
                    additional charm is lent to the scene by the pleasant green islands in the
                    Moldau, which is here 500 to 1500 feet in width. The general features of the
                    situation recall those of Budapest, and the smaller scale is fully compensated
                    for by the greater variety and interest of the buildings.</p>
                <p>The town proper consists of four main divisions, the Altstadt and the Neustadt on
                    the right bank of the Moldau, and the Kleinseite and the Hradschin on the left.
                    Immediately beyond the old line of circumvallation are the suburbs of
                    Carolinenthal, Wyscherad, Smichow, and Weinberg, while these in turn are
                    adjoined by various outer suburban districts. Down to 1866 Prague was surrounded
                    with walls and bastions, which, however, had long lost their military
                    importance, and have since been, to a great extent, removed. The two sides of
                    the river are connected by seven bridges, of which the most important are the
                    Kaiser Franz suspension bridge, the new Palacky bridge, and the fine old Carls
                    bridge. This last, erected between 1350 and 1500, is closed at each end by a
                    mediaeval gatetower, of which that to the east is particularly interesting. The
                    numerous buttresses are adorned with statues of saints, <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0919-0681-0658"/> among them that of St John Nepomuk, who
                    earned his title to be regarded as the patron saint of bridges from the fact
                    that he here allowed himself to be thrown into the Moldau at the order of King
                    Wenceslaus rather than divulge the queen’s confidences in the confessional
                    (1393). The statue is regarded with great veneration and is visited by thousands
                    of devotees on the saint’s anniversary (16th May).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Altstadt,</hi> or old town, is the most densely populated
                    part of Prague and the principal seat of traffic. Most of the streets are narrow
                    and irregular, but the centre of the district is occupied by a spacious square
                    called the Grosser Ring, and the side next the Moldau is bordered by wide quays
                    embellished with handsome monuments to Charles IV. and Francis I. On one side of
                    the Ring stands the town-house, to a great extent rebuilt, but still comprising
                    part of the mediaeval structure that witnessed so many of the stormy scenes of
                    Bohemian history. Opposite is the Teyn church, or old church of the Calixtine
                    Hussites, built in 1407, and containing the tomb of Tycho Brahe, the Danish
                    astronomer. Another interesting structure is the Late Gothic Pulverthurm, a
                    relic of the old wall that once separated the Altstadt from the Neustadt. The
                    Altstadt is .also the seat of the university and several other educational
                    establishments. The university, founded by Charles IV. in 1348, was the first in
                    the German empire, and was attended by 10,000 to 15,000 students, until
                    invidious distinctions made between Bohemians and Germans led the latter to
                    secede in a body and found academies for themselves in other parts of Germany.
                    The institution, however, still ranks high among European seats of learning and
                    numbers above 2600 students. Lectures are delivered both in Bohemian and in
                    German, and students may graduate in either language. The faculties of medicine
                    and law occupy the Carolinum near the town-hall, while those of theology and
                    philosophy are established in the Clemen tinum, a huge old Jesuit college, which
                    also comprises the university library (180,000 vols.), several chapels, a
                    school, and the archiépiscopal seminary. The most conspicuous modern buildings
                    are the civil courts, the savings bank, and the Rudolfinum, a large Renaissance
                    edifice on the quay, containing an academy of art, a conservatorium for music,
                    and an industrial museum. The church of the Knights of the Cross
                    (Kreuzherrenkirche) is an imposing building modelled on St Peter’s at Rome, and
                    the palace of Count Clam Gallas is a tasteful Renaissance structure of 1701.
                    Enclosed within the Altstadt is the Joseρhstadt, or Jewish quarter, a labyrinth
                    of crowded and dingy streets, to which the Jews were strictly confined down to
                    1848. The Jewish colony of Prague is one of the most ancient in Europe; the
                    Jewish cemetery, with its thousands of closely-packed tombstones interspersed
                    with shrubs and creeping plants, is one of the most curious sights in
                    Prague.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Neustadt,</hi> or new town, surrounds the old town in the
                    form of a semicircle, reaching the river both to the north and to the south of
                    it. The site of the old wall and moat that formerly separated the two quarters
                    is now occupied by a line of the handsomest and busiest streets in Prague, and
                    the rest of the Neustadt also consists of broad and well-built streets and
                    squares. Conspicuous among the buildings are the numerous hospitals and asylums
                    on the south side, forming a phalanx of charitable institutions that do great
                    credit to the philanthropy of the citizens. The town-house, now used as a
                    criminal court, is interesting as the spot where the Bohemian Hussite war was
                    inaugurated by the hurling of several unpopular councillors from the window.
                    Other noteworthy edifices are the Bohemian museum, the Bohemian technical
                    college (1500 students), the magnificent new Bohemian theatre (erected at a cost
                    of £200,000), and the churches of</p>
                <p>Carlshof, Emmaus, and Maria Schnee. To the south the Neustadt is adjoined by the
                    Wyscherad, or citadel, the oldest part of Prague. The original fortress was
                    almost entirely destroyed by the Hussites, and the present fortifications are
                    modern.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Kleinseite,</hi> or Little Prague, on the left bank of the
                    Moldau, occupies the slopes of the Laurenzberg and the Hradschin and is the
                    headquarters of the aristocratic and official classes. Like the Altstadt, its
                    centre is formed by a “ring,” containing the large and handsome Jesuit church of
                    St Nicholas and a fine monument to Marshal Radetzky. The most generally
                    interesting of the numerous palaces of the Bohemian noblesse is the Palace
                    Waldstein or Wallenstein, an extensive edifice built by the hero of the Thirty
                    Years’ War and still occupied by his descendants. Kleinseite also contains the
                    hall of the Bohemian diet and the residence of the Statthalter or governor of
                    Bohemia. To the north it ends in the pleasant promenades named after the
                    crown-prince Rudolf, which stretch along the bank of the Moldau.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hradschin,</hi> or castle hill, rises abruptly behind the
                    Kleinseite to a height of about 240 feet. The imperial palace, a vast and
                    irregular group of buildings crowning the height, is remarkable rather for its
                    situation and extent than for architectural importance. It is said to have been
                    founded by Princess Libussa, and was greatly enlarged by Charles IV. and others,
                    but now offers little of a mediaeval character with the exception of two or
                    three towers. Few of the 440 rooms it is said to contain are of any special
                    interest; in the council chamber is still pointed out the window from which the
                    imperial councillors Martinitz and Slavata were hurled in 1618. Within the large
                    court of the palace stands the cathedral of St Vitus, begun in 1344, in evident
                    imitation of the cathedral of Cologne, but consisting of little more than the
                    extensive Late Gothic choir (1385). Efforts are now being made to bring it to
                    completion. The tower was originally 500 feet high, but lost two-fifths of its
                    height by a fire. The interior enshrines several works of considerable interest
                    and value, such as the mausoleum of the Bohemian kings, a fine Renaissance work
                    in alabaster and marble by Alex. Colin of Mechlin (1589); the shrine of St John
                    Nepomuk, said to contain 1∣ tons of solid silver; and the chapel of St
                    Wenceslaus, the walls of which are encrusted with jasper, chalcedony, and
                    amethyst. In the treasury are the Bohemian regalia. The palace precincts also
                    enclose the church of St George, dating from the 12th century, and one of the
                    few Romanesque edifices of which Prague can boast. To the west of the imperial
                    palace is a wide square with three large palaces, one belonging to the
                    archbishop of Prague. Farther on is another square, surrounded by the extensive
                    palace of Count Czernin (now a barrack), a large Capuchin monastery, and the
                    church of St Loretto, an imitation of the wandering Casa Santa. At the extreme
                    west of this quarter, adjoining the wall, is the imposing monastery of Strahow,
                    possessing a good collection of pictures and a large library. To the north of
                    the imperial palace is a picturesque gorge called the Hirschgraben, beyond which
                    are the palace gardens, containing the Belvedere, a villa erected by Ferdinand
                    I. in 1536, and considered one of the most tasteful reproductions of Italian
                    architecture to the north of the Alps.</p>
                <p>Prague is unusually well supplied with public parks and gardens, as, in addition
                    to those already mentioned, pleasure-grounds have been laid out on the islands
                    in the Moldau, on the slopes of the Laurenzberg, and on part of the ground
                    occupied by the old fortifications. Among the most popular resorts are the
                    charming grounds of the Baumgarten, a mile to the north of the Kleinseite. Both
                    the industry and the commerce of Bohemia have their <pb break="no"

                    former being the large manufacturing suburbs of Smichow (21,000 inhabitants) and
                    Carolinenthal (20,000 inhabitants), the one to the south of the Kleinseite and
                    the other to the northeast of the Neustadt. The most prominent items in a very
                    miscellaneous list of industrial products are linen, cotton, calico, and leather
                    goods, gloves, machinery, confectionery, beer, and chemicals. Garnet wares also
                    form a specialty. Trade is facilitated by an extensive system of roads and
                    railways, but the river navigation is unimportant owing to the numerous weirs
                    and the insufficient depth. In 1880 Prague proper contained 162,323 inhabitants,
                    or including the suburban districts about 250,000; and at the beginning of 1885
                    the total population was officially stated at 272,333. Nearly five-sevenths of
                    these are of Slavonic race, while all are Roman Catholics with the exception of
                    20,000 Jews and 5000 Protestants. The Germans, however, though diminishing in
                    relative numbers, still claim to represent the bulk of the capital and culture
                    of the city. The garrison consists of from 8000 to 10,000 men.</p>
                <p>The foundation of Prague is ascribed to the princess Libussa, who appears at the
                    beginning of the 8th century of our era as ruling the Bohemians from her
                    stronghold of Wyscherad on the right bank of the Moldau. It is at least certain
                    that the town made rapid progress under the fostering care of the early Bohemian
                    sovereigns, and in the 13th century it was able to bid defiance to the Tatar
                    hordes that then overran the country. Its chief period of prosperity was the
                    reign of Charles IV. (1346-1378), who by founding the university, establishing
                    fairs, and investing the town with valuable privileges attracted to it numerous
                    strangers. At this time Prague was perhaps the most important town in Germany,
                    and could even boast of an independent school of art. Afterwards, however,
                    Prague became the centre of the agitation that culminated in the Hussite wars,
                    and thus brought upon itself a long train of misfortunes. The Hussites took
                    possession of the city soon after defeating the emperor Sigismund, and allowed
                    their religious zeal to carry them so far as to destroy many of the most
                    interesting old churches in the city—a fact that accounts for the want of
                    venerable ecclesiastical edifices in Prague. The town was, however, afterwards
                    rebuilt by the imperialists upon an improved scale. Under Rudolf II. (1576-1612)
                    a second season of prosperity was enjoyed; Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, and other
                    men eminent in science, art, or letters flocked to the court of this enlightened
                    monarch and contributed to the importance of his capital. Prague suffered its
                    full share of the evils of the Thirty Years’ War, which may be said to have
                    begun here with the precipitation of the councillors from the window of the
                    Hradschin (1618), and to have ended here with the occupation of the Kleinseite
                    by the Swedes in 1648. The town was occupied by the imperialists after the
                    defeat of the Protestants at the White Hill in 1620, and its Protestant
                    sympathies caused it to find scant grace in the eyes of the victors. It was
                    taken by the Swedes in 1631, by Wallenstein in 1632, by the French and Bavarians
                    in 1741, and by Frederick the Great in 1744. In 1757 it narrowly escaped a
                    second capture by Frederick, who held it closely invested after defeating the
                    Austrians at the battle of Prague, but was compelled to raise the siege by the
                    disaster of Kolin. This was the last time Prague underwent a siege, though it
                    was occupied by the Prussians in 1866. During the present century its material
                    advance has been unbroken, but its harmonious social development has been
                    hampered by the disunion between the Czechish and German elements of its
                    population. The revolutionary ideas of 1848 found a warm response in the
                    nationalist party of Bohemia, and a Pan-Slavonic congress was opened at Prague
                    in May of that year. Unfortunately, however, a collision took place between the
                    military and the populace, and Prince Windischgratz forcibly dissolved the
                    congress and bombarded the town for two days. In 1862 a new impetus was given to
                    the Slavonic agitation by the formation of a Bohemian diet, and since then the
                    fissure between the warring races has grown wider rather than diminished. The
                    Slavs seem to be steadily gaining ground at the expense of the Germans both in
                    numbers and influence. Among the celebrated natives of Prague the most eminent
                    in public interest are John Huss (1369-1415) and Jerome of Prague (c.
                    1365-1416). A fragment of the house of the former is still shown in the
                    Altstadt. (J. F. Μ. )</p>
