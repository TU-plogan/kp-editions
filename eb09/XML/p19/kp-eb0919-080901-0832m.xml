                <p><label type="entry">PROPAGANDA, or Sacred Congregation <hi rend="italic">de
                    Propaganda Fide</hi></label>, is the name given to a commission of cardinals
                    appointed for the direction of the missions of the Roman Church. The idea of
                    forming such an institution was conceived by Pope Gregory XIII. and other
                    pontiffs, but it was Gregory XV. (1621-1623) who, after having sought counsel
                    from cardinals and information concerning the state of religion in various
                    countries from apostolic nuncios and superiors of religious orders, published,
                    22nd July 1622, the bull <hi rend="italic">Inscrutabile</hi> by which he founded
                    the Congregation of Propaganda and provided means for its continuance. The
                    cardinal vicar and the cardinal secretary of state were amongst its first
                    members. Additional privileges were granted it by other bulls; and all the
                    pontifical colleges founded up to that date as well as those which should
                    afterwards be founded for the propagation of the faith were declared subject to
                    the Propaganda. The deliberations of this body, embracing a great variety of
                    important questions, when formulated in decrees and signed by the cardinal
                    prefect and the secretary were declared by Urban VIII., in 1634, to have the
                    force of apostolic constitutions, which should be inviolably observed. The
                    cardinal prefect is the head of the Congregation, and as such governs the
                    Catholic missions of the world; the secretary is assisted by five subalterns <hi
                    rend="italic">(minu-tanti),</hi> who act as heads of departments, and these
                    again are assisted by inferior employees <hi rend="italic">(scrittori).</hi> The
                    more important acts of the Congregation, which are discussed in weekly meetings
                    by the cardinal prefect and the officials, are submitted to the pope for his
                    supreme decision. The archives of the institution were transferred, in 1660,
                    from the Vatican to the Palazzo Ferrâttini in the Piazza di Spagna, Rome, which
                    is the seat of the Congregation. They form a valuable collection of historical,
                    ethnographical, and geographical documents, embracing a period of two hundred
                    and fifty years, and serve as a record of past events and of precedents to be
                    followed in decisions on questions that may arise. The funds of the institution
                    were supplied in the first instance by Gregory XV. and by private bequests.
                    Cardinal Barberini, brother of Urban VIII., provided for eighteen places in
                    perpetuity for students, Mgr. Vives for ten. Pope Innocent XII. bequeathed to it
                    150,000 crowns in gold; Clement XII. gave it 70,000 crowns. In the second
                    assembly of the Congregation it was proposed, and accepted as a rule, that
                    prelates on being raised to the dignity of cardinal should pay for a ring
                    offered them by the pope a sum which was at first fixed at 545 golden <hi
                    rend="italic">scudi,</hi> and which is now 600 Roman <hi rend="italic"
                    >scudi.</hi> Large donations were made to the Propaganda by Catholics in
                    England, Scotland, Ireland, the United States, Spain, and Italy. The cardinal
                    prefect administers the property of the institution in the name of the
                    Congregation. To provide for the affairs of the Church of the Oriental Rite,
                    Pius IX., in 1862, appointed a special Congregation with its own secretary,
                    consultors, and officials.</p>
                <p>The primary purpose of the Propaganda being to secure laborious and pious
                    missionaries, colleges for their education and training were established. Chief
                    amongst these is the Propaganda or Urban College in Rome, so named from Urban
                    VIII. It is a general missionary seminary for the whole world. Here students are
                    received from all foreign nations, and there are special foundations for
                    Georgian, Persian, Chaldaean, Syrian, Coptic, Brahman, Abyssinian, Armenian,
                    Greek, and Chinese students, as well as for students from England, Ireland,
                    America, and Australia, although these last have special colleges in Rome. After
                    the age of fourteen each student takes an oath to serve the missions during his
                    whole life in the ecclesiastical province or vicariate assigned to him by the
                    Congregation, to which he must send annually an account of himself and of his
                    work. He is maintained and clothed free of expense. His studies embrace the full
                    course of Greek, Latin, and Italian letters, some of the chief Oriental
                    languages, as Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, and, when necessary, Chinese.
                    There are also schools for the teaching of rational and natural philosophy, a
                    complete course of theology, and the institutions of canon law. Besides this
                    principal seminary, the Propaganda has colleges dependent on it both in Rome and
                    in other countries, under the direction of regular and secular priests. From its
                    beginning it had at its disposition national colleges,—such as the English,
                    founded by Gregory XIII.; the Irish, by Cardinal Ludovisi in 1628; the Scotch,
                    by Clement VIII. in 1600; the German and Hungarian; the American, of the United
                    States, opened by Pius IX. in 1859; the Greek, founded by Gregory XIII.; the
                    Armenian, recently established by Leo XIII.; and the Bohemian, opened 4th
                    November 1884. The jurisdiction of the Propaganda extends over the English
                    colleges of Lisbon and Valladolid, the Irish college of Paris, and the American
                    of Louvain. Until recently it had the Chinese college of Naples, transformed by
                    the Italian Government, and the Illyrian college of Loreto, suppressed by the
                    same Government; and it still has the Albanian pontifical college of Scutari.
                    Besides these, other colleges serve for the education of missionaries for the
                    Propaganda, as the college of SS. Peter and Paul in Rome, founded by Pius IX.,
                    in Milan the seminary of St Calocero for all foreign missions, and at Genoa the
                    College Brignole Sale for Italian emigrants to America. The institutions at
                    Verona for central Africa are the support of the missions in the Soudan. Chief
                    of all the seminaries is that of Paris which, for two centuries, has supplied
                    missionaries for India and China. To these is committed the vast college of the
                    island of Pulo Penang, where young men from China and neighbouring countries are
                    trained to the priesthood. In Paris many missionaries are taken from the French
                    seminary directed by the fathers of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost, who go
                    to French colonies. At Lyons is the college for African missions. In Belgium
                    there are the colleges of Foreign Missions, of the Immaculate Conception, and of
                    St Francis Xavier for Chinese missions. In Holland there was recently
                    established the college of Stiel, whose students go to China. In All Hallows
                    College, Ireland, the students are educated for the missions in Australia,
                    Canada, and the Cape of Good Hope. In England a seminary has grown up within a
                    few years at Mill Hill, which has already supplied priests to the missions of
                    Borneo and Madras. Previous to the late changes in Rome, the Propaganda had
                    dependent upon it the college of Reformed Minors in S. Pietro in Montorio, the
                    Carmelites in S. Pancrazio (suppressed), the Minor Observants of S. Bartolomeo
                    all’ Isola recently reestablished, the Conventuals (suppressed), and the Irish
                    Minor Franciscans of St Isidore. Outside of Rome there were also colleges of
                    regulars for the missions, as Ocana in Spain, Sernache in Portugal, and others.
                    The Propaganda, in the establishment of vicariates or new episcopal sees, has
                    always encouraged the formation, as soon as circumstances would permit, of
                    seminaries for the education of a native clergy, and frequently these have
                    flourished, as the community of the “Houses of God” <hi rend="italic">(case di
                    Did)</hi> in Tongking, the seminaries of Sze-chuen, of Peking, and of Nanking.
                    The first step taken in a new mission is the erection of a chapel, followed by
                    the opening of a school and an orphanage. As numbers increase, and more priests
                    come to the new mission, they are united under a superior invested with special
                    powers by the Propaganda—in fact a prefect apostolic. As churches increase and
                    the faith spreads, a vicar apostolic, who is a bishop <hi rend="italic">in
                    partibus,</hi> is appointed, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n833/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0833-0810"/> and, if the progress made requires it, the
                    mission is erected into an episcopal diocese. Such has been the method of
                    proceeding in the American and Canadian missions; such, in part, what has
                    happened in India, China, and Africa. Through these, whether prefects or vicars
                    apostolic or bishops, the orders of the Propaganda, which are those of the head
                    of the church, are transmitted to the faithful, and they are the ordinary
                    centres of its correspondence, although it does not disdain the reports
                    furnished by the humblest members of the Christian flock. The prelates furnish
                    exact reports to the Propaganda of the progress and circumstances of the faith
                    in their various missions.</p>
                <p>The material means for the diffusion of the faith are supplied in the first place
                    by special grants from the revenues of the Propaganda and from various
                    associations in Europe. The greatest part is furnished by the society for the
                    propagation of the faith of Paris and Lyons. This society is independent of the
                    Propaganda, relying wholly on the energy of the two central councils of Paris
                    and Lyons and on the charity of the faithful, though it attends to the
                    suggestions of the Propaganda, which indicates to it the needs of new missions.
                    Contributions are also furnished by other associations, as that of the Holy
                    Infancy, or that for the education of Oriental nations. Similar societies,
                    occupied with the support of special missions, exist in Bavaria, Germany, and
                    Austria. The Propaganda likewise takes care that, as soon as a mission is
                    established, pious foundations are constituted by native Christians, aud become
                    the local property of the church, and so supply it with a stable and enduring
                    vitality. Subscriptions from Europe are given only to the poorer missions,
                    which, however, are very numerous. One of the most powerful aids adopted by the
                    Propaganda in the diffusion of the faith is the printing-press. The missionaries
                    are required to study the languages of the countries to which they are sent and
                    exhorted to publish books in these languages. Printing-presses are introduced
                    into new missions. In China, what may be described as wooden stereotypes are
                    employed for the printing of Catholic works in the Chinese language. Early in
                    its career the Congregation of Propaganda established at its seat in Rome the
                    celebrated Polyglott Printing Press, and gave it a character of universality.
                    There people of all nations—the Copt, the Armenian, the Arab, the Hebrew, the
                    Japanese, and the native of Malabar— may find books in their native tongue and
                    in their special type. Although great progress has been made by other countries
                    in polyglott printing, the Propaganda press still holds a high position.</p>
                <p>The part of the world to which the cardinals of the Congregation of Propaganda
                    first turned their attention was Asia. In no region of the globe has
                    Christianity had greater difficulties to struggle against than in China. An
                    ancient tradition exists, confirmed by documents, that in the early centuries of
                    the Christian era Christianity had penetrated into and left traces in China. It
                    was reintroduced in the 13th century by Franciscan fathers. It flourished at
                    Peking for a time, but died out with the Mongolian dynasty, and China remained
                    closed to Christian influences until 1555, when the Dominican father Gaspare
                    della Croce introduced it into the province of Canton. After he was expelled
                    came the Jesuits Rogeri and Ricci. They established a residence there in 1579,
                    and were followed by Dominicans and Franciscans. These were succeeded a century
                    later by the priests of the Paris seminary of foreign missions, in the last
                    century by Augustinians and Lazarists, and in the present century by the
                    missionaries of the seminary of St Calocero of Milan. Two bishoprics were
                    created in 1688, one at Nanking, the other at Peking, and the missions of
                    Yun-nan and Szechuen founded. At the beginning of the 18th century the number of
                    churches in the northern provinces reached 300, and of Christians 300,000. In
                    1803 a college for native clergy was opened in Sze-chuen, and the work of the
                    Holy Infancy introduced. In 1837 the Portuguese patronage of Chinese missions
                    was brought to an end, with the exception of that exercised over Macao, a
                    Portuguese colony.</p>
                <p>In 1310 B. Odorico di Friuli, a Franciscan, entered Tibet and made many converts.
                    In 1624 Father D’Andrada penetrated into the same country, but was not allowed
                    to remain. Others followed, and were put to death. In 1847 the Propaganda
                    entrusted to the seminary of foreign missions the task of entering Tibet, and in
                    1857 a vicariate apostolic was erected on the frontiers. In Mongolia,
                    constituted a vicariate apostolic in 1840, many converts were made and several
                    priests educated in the seminary of Siwang-se. This mission offers great hopes.
                    It was divided into three vicariates in 1883, and is entrusted to the Belgian
                    congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The Manchuria mission was made a
                    vicariate in 1839; in 1854 a church, S. Maria ad Nives, was erected, and many
                    other churches have since been built for the increasing mission. In 1592 an
                    attempt was made to Christianize Corea; but repeated persecutions crushed out
                    the germs of Christianity. Its first neophyte, its first native priest, its
                    first bishops, and its first European missionaries were martyrs. From 1784 to
                    1789 4000 Coreans were converted, but their number was greatly reduced by
                    persecution. In 1831 a vicariate was established; in 1835 the number of
                    Christians was 6280; in 1861 they reached 18,000; butin 1866 persecution began
                    anew. Christianity was introduced into Japan in 1549 by S. Francis Xavier. In
                    less than fifty years there were in Japan a bishopric, 380 churches, and 30,000
                    professing Christians. Persecution broke out in 1601, and in 1614 became so
                    fierce that the priests were put to death and the people dispersed. In 1640 all
                    Europeans, missionaries included, were banished from Japan, this proscription
                    continuing for two centuries. Missionaries were admitted in 1843, but so
                    jealously watched that little good was accomplished. In 1863 a treaty was
                    concluded between the emperor of the French and the Japanese Government
                    permitting the preaching of the gospel. The first church was built after a lapse
                    of two centuries; the number of catechumens soon reached 10,000; other churches
                    were constructed; and the descendants of the old Christians, who had still
                    preserved the faith, came forth from their concealment. A new persecution broke
                    out in 1870; many Christians apostatized; a great number died of hunger, and
                    many were exiled. Peace was established in 1873. The vicariate apostolic was
                    divided in 1876 into two—the northern and southern vicariates. By the treaty of
                    Peking, concluded between the French and Chinese Governments, liberty of
                    religion was granted in the Chinese empire and a new era opened. In 1873, in the
                    eighteen provinces of the Chinese empire, the number of Catholics was 410,644,
                    with 4054 centres, 1220 churches and public chapels, 294 bishops and
                    missionaries, 252 native priests, 137 European female religious and 924 native,
                    104 orphanages with 6853 orphans, and 947 schools frequented by 10,624 pupils.
                    In spite of popular tumults and persecutions these numbers have increased in
                    late years.</p>
                <p>In the year of its foundation the Propaganda established a prefecture apostolic
                    in Burmah. Italian Barnabites penetrated into the country in 1721, and two of
                    them, Fathers Gallizio and Nerici, were put to death. The priests of the
                    seminary of foreign missions continue the work, and three vicariates have been
                    established. Malacca was visited by S. Francis Xavier, and was for a long time
                    under the Portuguese jurisdiction; but a vicariate was <pb break="no"

                    Franciscans brought the Catholic faith to Siam in the 16th century. The first
                    vicar apostolic was appointed in 1678. A terrible persecution of Christians,
                    causing great loss, broke out in 1772, and it was not till 1821 that the
                    missions were restored. The vicariate was divided into two in 1841. In the
                    missions of the Anamite empire, comprising Tong-king and Cochin China, and the
                    missions to Cambodia and to the Laos people, Christianity may be said to have
                    had its birth and its growth in blood, so fierce and numerous have the
                    persecutions been. In the 14th century the faith was introduced by Dominicans
                    and Franciscans, and the first mission established in 1550 by Gaspare della
                    Croce. The Jesuits came in 1615, and in 1665 the Propaganda established here the
                    priests of the seminary of foreign missions. A few years later the number of
                    Christians in the southern provinces of Cochin China was 17,000, with 60
                    churches. Persecution followed persecution. The Dominican Father Francesco Gil,
                    after nine years’ imprisonment, was martyred in 1745. All foreigners were driven
                    from the kingdom in 1825, and in 1826 an edict was issued against the
                    Christians. What seemed a war of extermination was undertaken in 1833.
                    Missionaries sought refuge in tombs and grottos, whence they issued by night to
                    administer the sacraments. Mgr. Delgado, vicar apostolic of Western Tong-king,
                    Mgr. Henares his coadjutor, several Chinese priests, Mgr. Barie, vicar apostolic
                    of Eastern Tong-king (about to be consecrated bishop), and an incredible number
                    of lay persons of all ranks were put to death. In 1842 the cause of the
                    beatification and sanctification of the Anamite martyrs was introduced by the
                    Sacred Congregation of Rites. Persecution was renewed in 1844; the exiled
                    missionaries and prelates returned, though a price was put upon their heads.
                    Christianity was proscribed throughout all Anam in 1848; native priests were
                    exiled, and European clergy cast into the sea or the nearest river. Nevertheless
                    the vicariate of Cambodia was founded in 1850, and Eastern Cochin China was made
                    a separate vicariate. A new edict appeared in 1851, again enjoining that
                    European priests should be cast into the sea, and natives, unless they trampled
                    upon the cross, severed in two. The missionaries Schaeffler and Bonnard were put
                    to death; the vicars apostolic perished of hunger; the mass of Christians were
                    imprisoned or exiled. In 1856 and 1857 whole Christian villages were burned and
                    their inhabitants dispersed. The edict of 1862 enjoined that Christians should
                    be given in charge to pagans, that their villages should be burned and their
                    property seized, and that on one cheek should be branded the words “false
                    religion.” In 1863 the number of martyrs had reached forty thousand, without
                    reckoning those driven into the woods, where they perished. Nevertheless, the
                    Anamite church, steeped in blood, has increased, and is regarded as the
                    brightest gem of the Propaganda missions.</p>
                <p>India is one of the most extensive fields in which the missionaries have
                    laboured. Previous to the founding of the Propaganda the Jesuits had established
                    several missions in India. The introduction of vicars apostolic consolidated the
                    basis of Christianity, and now twenty-three vicariates apostolic and a delegate
                    apostolic direct the spiritual affairs of this great country. In Africa,
                    Catholic missionaries were the first travellers, two centuries prior to
                    Livingstone and Stanley. The earliest mission was that of Tunis (1624). The
                    missions of the Cape of Good Hope were entrusted to the clergy of Mauritius; the
                    Reformati and the Observants went to Egypt, the Carmelites to Mozambique and
                    Madagascar, the Capuchins and Jesuits to Ethiopia and Abyssinia. The spiritual
                    affairs of Africa are directed by one metropolitan and thirty-six bishops,
                    vicars, and prefects apostolic. The progress of Catholicism in Australia is
                    evident from the fact that two metropolitans, those of Melbourne and Sydney,
                    with twelve suffragans direct its ecclesiastical affairs. While the missionary
                    field of the Propaganda embraces Asia, Africa, Oceania, and both Americas, as
                    well as England, Ireland, Scotland, Holland, Germany, Norway and Sweden,
                    Iceland, Greenland, Switzerland, Albania, Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, &lt;fcc.,
                    perhaps the most splendid results of its work are to be met with in the United
                    States and in Canada. In 1632 many Catholics settled with Lord Baltimore in
                    Maryland. A century and a half later, in 1789, they had so increased that the
                    Congregation of Propaganda withdrew them from the jurisdiction of the vicar
                    apostolic of London and formed a new see in Baltimore, comprising the territory
                    of the United States. In 1808 the sees of New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and
                    Bardstown (Louisville) were erected, and Baltimore was made the metropolitan
                    diocese. At the end of 1884 there were twelve metropolitans and seventy-six
                    bishops and vicars apostolic in the United States. In 1659 Mgr. François de
                    Laval was the first vicar apostolic of Canada; shortly afterwards the episcopal
                    see of Quebec was established. Now Canada has four metropolitan and sixteen
                    suffragan sees.</p>
                <p>The Italian Government, in virtue of the laws relating to ecclesiastical property
                    of 1866, 1867, and 19th June 1873, sold the Villa Montalto, Frascati, belonging
                    to the Propaganda, and placed the price in the Italian funds, paying interest to
                    the Congregation. Other property of the Congregation having been sold, a
                    law-suit was entered upon and decided in the Court of Cassation at Rome, 31st
                    May 1881, in favour of the Propaganda. Appeal was made to the tribunal of
                    Ancona, where, 14th December 1881, decision was given against the Propaganda.
                    Appeal being again made, the Court of Cassation of Rome gave final judgment, 9th
                    February 1884, against the Propaganda. This sentence empowers the Italian
                    Government to sell the landed or immovable property of the Propaganda, place the
                    proceeds in the Italian funds, and pay the interest to the Congregation.
                    Protests against this act have been issued by Pope Leo XIII., by Cardinal
                    Jacobini, secretary of state to the pontiff, by nearly all the Catholic bishops,
                    and by innumerable thousands of lay Catholics and many Protestants. (D. J.)</p>
