                    (1688-1744), was the most famous English poet of his century. His own century
                    dwelt most upon his merits; the 19th century is disposed rather to dwell upon
                    his defects, both as a poet and as a man, with a persistency and minuteness that
                    more than counterbalance any exaggeration in the estimate formed when it was the
                    fashion to admire his verse and treat his moral obliquity as a foible.
                    Substantially, the best judgment of the two centuries is at one, only different
                    sides are prominent in the bulk of current criticism. All are agreed that he was
                    not a poet of the first rank, and nobody can deny that he did certain things in
                    literature in a way that has been the despair of all who have since attempted
                    the same kind of thing. The great point of difference lies in the importance to
                    be assigned to such work as Pope’s satires. The polemic against his title to the
                    name of poet would be contemptible were it not that beneath the dispute about
                    the name there is a desire to impress on the public a respect for the highest
                    kinds of poetry. The 19th century takes the poet’s mission more seriously than
                    the 18th. Similarly with Pope’s moral delinquencies. With the exception of some
                    details recently brought to light with an industry worthy of a better subject,
                    his contemporaries were as well aware of these delinquencies as we are now, only
                    none but his bitter enemies were so earnest in denouncing them. “In this
                    design,” Johnson says in his comments on the <hi rend="italic">Dunciad,</hi>
                    “there was petulance and malignity enough, but I cannot think it very criminal.”
                    And this was the general verdict of his contemporaries about the poet’s moral
                    weakness. They knew that he was insincere, intriguing, touchy, and spiteful,
                    but, as nobody was much harmed by his conduct, they could not think it very
                    criminal. Perhaps his physical weakness made them <pb break="no"

                    temper. But, apart from this, intriguing was the way of his world, a fact too
                    much kept out of sight when Pope is denounced for his crooked ways in little
                    matters, as if he had lived in our own straightforward and virtuous age.</p>
                <p>If we are to judge Pope, whether as a man or as a poet, with human fairness, and
                    not merely by comparison with standards of abstract perfection, there are two
                    features of his times that must be kept steadily in view—the character of
                    political strife in those days, and the political relations of men of letters.
                    As long as the succession to the crown was doubtful, and political failure might
                    mean loss of property, banishment, or death, politicians, playing for higher
                    stakes, played more fiercely and unscrupulously than in modern days, and there
                    was no controlling force of public opinion to keep them within the bounds of
                    common honesty. Hence the age of Queen Anne is pre-eminently an age of intrigue.
                    The government was almost as unsettled as in the early days of personal
                    monarchy, and there was this différence that it was policy rather than force
                    upon which men depended for keeping their position. Secondly, men of letters
                    were admitted to the inner circles of intrigue as they had never been before and
                    as they have never been since. A generation later Walpole defied them, and paid
                    the rougher instruments that he considered sufficient for his purpose in solid
                    coin of the realm; but Queen Anne’s statesmen, whether from difference of tastes
                    or difference of policy, paid their principal literary champions with social
                    privileges and honourable public appointments. Hence men of letters were
                    directly infected by the low political morality of the unsettled time. And the
                    character of their poetry also suffered. The most prominent defects of our
                    Augustan age in 19th-century eyes—the lack of high and sustained imagination,
                    the genteel liking for “nature to advantage dressed,” the incessant striving
                    after wit—were fostered if not generated by the social atmosphere. The works of
                    the serious imagination could not thrive in a fashionable society, feverishly
                    interested in the daily chances of intrigue for place and power.</p>
                <p>Pope was peculiarly fitted by nature to take the impress of his
                    surroundings—plastic, sensitive, eagerly covetous of approbation. Affection and
                    admiration were as necessary to his life as the air he breathed. “Pope was from
                    his birth,” Johnson says, “of a constitution tender and delicate, but is said to
                    have shown remarkable gentleness and sweetness of disposition. The weakness of
                    his body continued through his life; but the mildness of his mind perhaps ended
                    with his childhood.” Perhaps; but certainly to a much less degree with the
                    friends who loved and honoured him. With them he was always more or less sweet
                    and docile; his petulance and malignity were directed as by an instinct of
                    self-preservation against those who baulked him in his craving for admiration, a
                    spiritual food literally and physically essential to the sustenance of his
                    fragile being.</p>
                <p>If Pope had been a man of more robust and self-sufficing constitution, he had one
                    great advantage for resisting the spirit of his age. He was cut off by the
                    religion of his parents from all public employment. His father was a Roman
                    Catholic, a merchant in Lombard Street,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>According to his own statement to Spence, his
                    “Conversations” with whom are the chief authority for all the incidents of his
                    youth. The value of the authority is much suspected. ‘ ‘ He was more willing to
                    show what his father was not than what he was,” and Johnson accepted the
                    statement that he was “a linen-draper in the Strand.” Pope’s vanity also renders
                    doubtful in some details what he says about his own precocity.</p></note>
                    London, who retired from business with a small fortune in the year of the
                    Revolution, and fixed his residence at Binfield in Windsor Forest. Pope was born
                    at Lombard Street on</p>
                <p>May 22, 1688, but his father’s retirement to Binfield took place soon after his
                    birth. The delicate child’s book education was desultory and irregular. His
                    father’s religion excluded him from the public schools, if there was no other
                    impediment to his being sent there. Before he was twelve he got a smattering of
                    Latin and Greek from various masters, from a priest in Hampshire, from a
                    schoolmaster at Twyford near Winchester, from another in Marylebone, from a
                    third at Hyde Park Corner, and finally from another priest at home. “He thought
                    himself the better,” Spence says, “in some respects for not having had a regular
                    education. He (as he observed in particular) read originally for the sense,
                    whereas we are taught for so many years to read only for words.” This helps to
                    explain his attack on Bentley in the <hi rend="italic">Dunciad.</hi> He
                    afterwards learnt French and Italian, probably to a similar extent. As far as
                    the sense was concerned, he could get a dilution of that at least in
                    translations, for all poets of note—Greek, Latin, French, and Italian—had been
                    translated into English verse in the course of the previous century. Of these
                    translations the precocious boy availed himself voraciously, and by the age of
                    twelve, when he was finally settled at home and left to himself, he was not only
                    a confirmed reader, but an eager aspirant to the highest honours in poetry. When
                    at school in London he had crept into Will’s coffee-house to look at Dryden; he
                    had lampooned his schoolmaster, and made a play out of Ogilby’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> for his schoolfellows; and, thinking himself the
                    greatest genius that - ever was, he retired to the solitude of the forest to
                    write a great epic on a mythological subject, his hero being Alcander, a prince
                    of Rhodes.</p>
                <p>Nothing of Pope’s was printed till 1709, when he was twenty-one. The detachment
                    from contemporary life in London which his father’s religion and retirement
                    might have occasioned was prevented by one of the accidents of that position.
                    Fortunately or unfortunately for him, there were among the Papist families near
                    Binfield men capable of giving a direction to his eager ambition, men of
                    literary tastes, and connexions with the literary world. These families held
                    together as persecuted sects always do, and the family priests were mediums of
                    communication.</p>
                <p>Through some such medium the retired merchant’s precocious son was brought under
                    the notice of Sir William Trumbull, a retired diplomatist living at
                    Easthampstead, within a few miles of Binfield. At Whiteknights, near Reading,
                    lived another Roman Catholic, Mr Englefield, “a great lover of poets and
                    poetry.” Through him Pope made the acquaintance of Wycherley and Harry Cromwell,
                    and Wycherley introduced him to Walsh, then of great renown as a critic. Thus
                    the aspiring poet, before he was seventeen, was admitted to the society of
                    London “wits” and men of fashion, and he was cordially encouraged as a prodigy.
                    It may be doubted whether the company of these veteran relics of Restoration
                    manners was much for the benefit of the moral tone of the bookish youth, who
                    learnt from them to speak and write of the fair sex with a very knowing air of
                    rakish gaiety. But he discussed poetry also with them, as was then the fashion,
                    and soon under their influence his own vague aspirations received shape and
                    direction.</p>
                <p>Walsh’s contribution to his development was the advice to study “correctness,” as
                    the one merit that was still possible for an English poet. But before he was
                    introduced to Walsh, which was in 1705, he had already written the first draft
                    of his “Pastorals,” a subject on which Walsh was an authority, having written
                    the preface to Dryden’s translation of Virgil’s <hi rend="italic">Eclogues.</hi>
                    Trumbull’s influence was earlier and more extensive. For him may <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n502/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0502-0483"/> fairly be claimed the credit of having been
                    Pope’s schoolmaster in poetry. It was he who turned Pope’s attention to the
                    French critics, out of the study of whom grew the <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Criticism</hi>; he suggested the subject of <hi rend="italic">Windsor
                    Forest,</hi> and he started the idea of translating Homer. When Trumbull first
                    saw the precocious boy, he was hard at work on his great epic. He had probably
                    chosen his subject on the first impulses of his crude ambition, because it was
                    an established maxim at the time that a great epic is the greatest work of which
                    the human mind is capable. It says something for Pope’s docility at this stage
                    that he recognized so soon that a long course of preparation was needed for such
                    a <hi rend="italic">magnum opus,</hi> and began steadily and patiently to
                    discipline himself. The epic was put aside and afterwards burnt; versification
                    was industriously practised in shorter “essays”; and an elaborate study was made
                    of accepted critics and models. When we look at the subjects of Pope’s juvenile
                    attempts, we cannot fail to be struck by a singular clearness of purpose in his
                    poetic ambition, such as might have come from the judgment of the accomplished
                    man of the world who was his adviser. He not only chose kinds of poetry in which
                    there was an interest at the time, and a consequent likelihood of gaining
                    attention and winning applause, but he had an eye to subjects that had not
                    already been appropriated by great English poets, and in which success was still
                    open to all comers. At the beginning of the 18th century Dryden’s success had
                    given great vogue to translations and modernizations. The air was full of
                    theories as to the best way of doing such things. What Dryden had touched Pope
                    did not presume to meddle with,— Dryden was his hero and master; but there was
                    much more of the same kind to be done. Dryden had rewritten three of the
                    Canterbury tales; Pope tried his hand at the <hi rend="italic">Merchant’s
                    Tale,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Prologue to the Wife of Bath’s Tale,</hi>
                    and produced also an imitation of the <hi rend="italic">House oj Fame.</hi>
                    Dryden had translated Virgil; Pope experimented on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thebais</hi> of Statius, Ovid’s <hi rend="italic">Heroides</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Metamorphoses,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi> He
                    knew little Latin and less Greek, but there were older versions in English whose
                    metre he could improve upon and from which he could get a clue to the sense;
                    and, when the correspondents to whom he submitted his versions pointed out
                    mistranslations, he could answer that he had always agreed with them, but that
                    he had deferred to the older translators against his own judgment. It was one of
                    Pope’s little vanities—very venial in a nature requiring such support —to try to
                    give the impression that his metrical skill was more precocious even than it
                    was, and we cannot accept his published versions of Statius and Chaucer
                    (published in “miscellanies” at intervals between 1709 and 1714) as indisputable
                    evidence of his proficiency at the age of fifteen or sixteen, the date,
                    according to his own assertion, of their composition. But it is indisputable
                    that at the age of sixteen his skill in verse was such as to astonish a veteran
                    critic like Walsh, and that his verses were handed about in manuscript and
                    admired by men then in the foremost rank in literature. There is no better proof
                    of his dexterity than his imitations, or rather parodies, of Chaucer, Spencer,
                    Rochester, and Dorset, though dexterity is their only merit. His metrical letter
                    to Cromwell, which Mr Elwin dates in 1707, when Pope was nineteen, is also a
                    brilliant feat of versification, and has turns of wit in it as easy and spirited
                    as any to be found in his mature satires. Pope was twenty-one when he sent the
                    “Ode to Solitude” to Cromwell, and said it was written before he was twelve
                    years old. He may have retouched this; in all probability he did; perhaps every
                    line of it was written when he was twenty-one; but there is abundance of
                    external evidence of his extraordinary precocity as a metrician. He was vain
                    enough to try to make it appear still more extraordinary than it was; but the
                    attempt was hardly more puerile and comically superfluous than the solemn
                    efforts of criticism to reduce his pretensions. They are too solidly founded to
                    be shaken either by his own vain superstructure or by the outraged critic’s
                    vindictive undermining.</p>
                <p>Precocious Pope was, but he was also industrious; and he spent some eight or nine
                    years in arduous and enthusiastic discipline, reading, studying, experimenting,
                    taking the advice of some and laughing in his sleeve at the advice of others,
                    “poetry his only business,” he said, “and idleness his only pleasure,” before
                    anything of his appeared in print. In these preliminary studies he seems to have
                    guided himself by the maxim formulated (after a French model) in a letter to
                    Walsh (written at the date he gives, or later) that “it seems not so much the
                    perfection of sense to say things that have never been said before, as to
                    express those best that have been said oftenest.” His first publication was his
                    “Pastorals.” Tonson the bookseller had heard these pastorals highly spoken of,
                    and he sent a polite note to Pope asking that he might have them for one of his
                    miscellanies. They appeared accordingly in May 1709 at the end of a volume
                    containing contributions from Philips, Sheffield, Garth, and Rowe, besides
                    Pope’s version of Chaucer’s <hi rend="italic">Merchant’s Tale.</hi> We have not
                    space to show what can be said on both sides about these artificial
                    compositions, avowedly designed to represent the manners of an imaginary golden
                    age, when men of “wit and refinement” were shepherds. The worst that can be said
                    of them was said by implication in the <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi> in 1713,
                    when a case, which was afterwards justified by Allan Ramsay, was made out for
                    the representation of real English country life. Johnson, though he did not
                    approve of pastorals in the abstract, said a word of common sense against
                    exaggerated depreciation of Pope’s attempt. Few persons are likely nowadays to
                    put themselves in a position for making a fair historical estimate of Pope’s
                    pastorals. There was a passing fashion for the kind of thing at the time, and
                    possibly he wrote them under the impression that they offered a new field for
                    poetic ambition in English, not knowing or forgetting what had been done by
                    Giles Fletcher and Milton. Or he may have thought that a great poet should begin
                    as Virgil began with pastorals. At any rate his pastorals, though Johnson was
                    right in remarking the “closeness of thought” shown in their composition, cannot
                    be ranked high as poetry, however much superior to everything else written in a
                    passing fashion.</p>
                <p>Pope’s next publication was the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Criticism.</hi> “In
                    every work regard the writer’s end,” is one of its sensible precepts, and one
                    that is often neglected by critics of the essay, who comment upon it as if
                    Pope’s end had been to produce an original and profound treatise on first
                    principles. His aim was much less lofty—being simply to condense, methodize, and
                    give as perfect and novel expression as he could to floating opinions about the
                    poet’s aims and methods, and the critic’s duties, to “what oft was thought but
                    ne’er so well expressed.” “The town” was interested in <hi rend="italic"
                    >belles</hi><hi rend="italic">lettres,</hi> and given to conversing on the
                    subject; Pope’s essay was simply a brilliant contribution to the fashionable
                    conversation. The youthful author said with delicious loftiness that he did not
                    expect the sale to be quick because “not one gentleman in sixty, even of liberal
                    education, could understand it.” But he misjudged his audience. The town was
                    fairly dazzled by it—such learning, such comprehensiveness of judgment, such
                    felicity of expression, was indeed a marvel in one so young. Many of its
                    admirers, doubtless, like Lady Mary Montague, would have thought less of it if
                    they had not <pb break="no"

                    people of fashion are seldom wide readers, and they gave Pope credit for much
                    that they might have found, where he found it, in Quintilian, Rapin, and Bossu.
                    “The truth is," Mr Elwin says, “that Addison, by his encomiums and authority,
                    brought into vogue the exaggerated estimate entertained of the essay.” Nothing
                    could be more preposterously far from “the truth.”</p>
                <p>A better illustration could not be found of the critical vice that Pope censures
                    of “forming short ideas” by attending to parts to the neglect of the whole. If
                    the whole of Addison’s paper is read, it stands out in its true colours as a
                    kindly gentle attempt to throw cold water on the enthusiasm about a work which
                    had been published for some months and was already, as the paper admits, “highly
                    esteemed by the best judges.” It is “a masterpiece in its kind”; but people
                    expect too much from the kind—originality, for instance. And again, it is “a
                    masterpiece in its kind,” worthy of a place beside Roscommon’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay on</hi><hi rend="italic">Translated Verse</hi> and Mulgrave’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on</hi><hi rend="italic">the Art of Poetry</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">!</hi> Most exaggerated encomiums these! How kindly, too, the
                    paper opens by giving prominence to trivial incidents in the essay, one or two
                    passing strokes of satire at Blackmore and Dennis. Bad poets are given to
                    detraction; they try to raise themselves by pulling down the reputation of their
                    brothers in the art. A, third of the whole paper is devoted to warning the young
                    poet against a spirit of envy and detraction, all because he had thrown a stone
                    in passing at two of the common butts of their generation. But this was
                    Addison’s kindliness; he wished to give the promising youth a lesson against a
                    bad habit. Read the whole paper <hi rend="italic">(Spectator,</hi> No. 253) and

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Rape of the</hi><hi rend="italic">Lock</hi> in its first
                    form appeared in 1712 in <hi rend="italic">Linton’s Miscellany</hi>; the
                    “machinery” of sylphs and gnomes was an afterthought, and the poem was
                    republished as we now have it early in 1714. This was his first poem written on
                    an inspiration from real life, from nature and not from books. A gentleman had
                    in a frolic surreptitiously cut off a lock of a young lady’s hair, and the
                    liberty had been resented; Pope heard the story from his friend Caryll, who
                    suggested that it might be a subject for a mock-heroic poem like Boileau’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Lutrin.</hi> Pope caught at the hint; the mock-heroic treatment of
                    the pretty frivolities of fashionable life just suited his freakish
                    sprightliness of wit, and his studies of the grand epic at the time put him in
                    excellent vein. The <hi rend="italic">Rape of the</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lock</hi> is almost universally admitted to be his masterpiece. English critics
                    from his own time to the present have competed in lauding its airiness, its
                    ingenuity, its exquisite finish. But Μ. Taine’s criticism shows how much depends
                    upon the spirit in which such humorous trifles are approached. The poem strikes
                    Μ. Taine as a piece of harsh, scornful, indelicate buffoonery, a mere succession
                    of oddities and contrasts, of expressive figures unexpected and grinning, an
                    example of English insensibility to French sweetness and refinement. Mr Leslie
                    Stephen objects on somewhat different grounds to the poet’s tone towards women.
                    What especially offends the French critic’s delicate sense is the bearishness of
                    Pope’s laughter at an elegant and beautiful woman of fashion. Pope describes
                    with a grin of amusement all the particulars of the elaborate toilet with which
                    Belinda prepared her beauty for conquest, and all the artificial airs and graces
                    with which she sought to bewitch the heart of susceptible man. The Frenchman
                    listens without sympathy, without appreciation, with the contemptuous wonder of
                    a well-bred man at clownish buffoonery. What is there to laugh at? Is she not
                    preparing a beautiful picture? She cannot do this without powders and washes and
                    paint-pots. What is there to laugh at in this? It is mere matter of fact The
                    entire surrender of the female heart to little artifices for little ends does
                    not apparently strike the Frenchman as ludicrous. Mr Stephen’s laughter is
                    checked by the serious thought that this is a misrepresentation of women, that
                    women are spoken of in the poem as if they were all like Belinda. But the
                    Frenchman is not moved to laughter at all; it would seem as if his delight in
                    the finished picture, the elegant graceful captivating woman, hallowed every
                    ingredient used in the making of it. Such are the differences in national
                    humour. With English readers the change of manners since the fashionable party
                    rowed up the river to spend a happy day at Hampton is more likely to be an
                    obstacle to the enjoyment of Pope’s airy extravagance.</p>
                <p>In the interval between the first and the enlarged edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rape of the Lock,</hi> Pope gave the finishing touches to his <hi
                    rend="italic">Windsor Forest,</hi> and published it in March 1713, with a
                    flattering dedication to the secretary at war and an opportune allusion to the
                    peace of Utrecht. This was a nearer approach to taking a political side than
                    Pope had yet made. His principle had been to keep clear of politics, and not to
                    attach himself to any of the sets into which literary men were divided by party.
                    Although inclined to the Jacobite party by his religion, he was on friendly
                    terms with the Whig coterie, so friendly indeed as to offend some of his
                    co-religionists. He had contributed his poem “The Messiah” to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Spectator;</hi> he had written an article or two in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Guardian;</hi> and he wrote a prologue for Addison’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Cato.</hi> But Pope’s advances had not been received in a way to
                    satisfy a man of his petulant and exacting temper. Mr Elwin is much mistaken in
                    supposing that Addison helped to bring Pope into notice in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spectator.</hi> We have seen how he treated the <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Criticism.</hi> When the <hi rend="italic">Rape of the Lock</hi> was published,
                    Addison is said to have praised it to Pope himself as <hi rend="italic"
                    >merum</hi><hi rend="italic">sal,</hi> but he was much more guarded in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Spectator.</hi> There he dismissed one of the gems of English
                    literature with two sentences of patronizing faint praise to the young poet whom
                    he rejoiced to see getting· on, coupled it with Tickell’s “Ode on the Prospect
                    of Peace,” and devoted the rest of the article to an elaborate puff of “the
                    pastorals of Mr Philips.” We have only to look at the shameless puffery of the
                    members of the little senate, not only in this article but throughout all the
                    periodicals of the coterie, to see how little the young Mr Pope owed to
                    Addison.</p>
                <p>When Pope showed a leaning to the Tories in <hi rend="italic">Windsor
                    Forest,</hi> the coterie, so far from helping him, made insidious war on him—not
                    open war but underhand war. Within a few weeks of the publication of the poem,
                    and when it was the talk of the town, there began to appear in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Guardian</hi> a series of articles on “Pastorals.” Not a word was
                    said about <hi rend="italic">Windsor Forest,</hi> but everybody knew to what the
                    general principles referred. Modern pastoral poets were ridiculed for
                    introducing Greek moral deities, Greek flowers and fruits, Greek names of
                    shepherds, Greek sports and customs and religious rites. They ought to make use
                    of English rural mythology—hobthrushes, fairies, goblins, and witches; they
                    should give English names to their shepherds; they should mention flowers
                    indigenous to English climate and soil; and they should introduce English
                    proverbial sayings, dress, and customs. All excellent principles, and all
                    neglected by Pope in <hi rend="italic">Windsor Forest.</hi> The poem was fairly
                    open to criticism in these points; there -are many beautiful passages in it,
                    showing close though somewhat professional observation of nature, but the
                    mixture of heathen deities and conventional archaic fancies with modern
                    realities is incongruous, and the comparison of Queen Anne to Diana was
                    ludicrously <pb break="no"

                <p>infelicitous. But the sting of the articles did not lie in the truth of the
                    oblique criticisms. “The pastorals of Mr Philips,” published four years before,
                    were again trotted out. Here was a true pastoral poet, the eldest born of
                    Spenser, the worthy successor of Theocritus and Virgil! Pope’s pastorals have
                    their defects, great defects, but it was an unkind cut to him to prefer such
                    trash, and with such audacious emphasis. It was an affront, but so contrived
                    that the sufferer could not retaliate without putting himself in the wrong, a
                    mean backbiting provocation, the action of a critic “willing to wound and yet
                    afraid to strike.”</p>
                <p>Pope took an amusing revenge, which turned the laugh against his assailants. He
                    sent Steele an anonymous paper in continuation of the articles in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Guardian</hi> on pastoral poetry, reviewing the poems of Mr Pope
                    by the light of the principles laid down. Ostensibly Pope was censured for
                    breaking the rules, and Philips praised for conforming to them, quotations being
                    given from both. The quotations were sufficient to dispose of the pretensions of
                    poor Philips, and Pope did not choose his own worst passages, accusing himself
                    of actually deviating sometimes into poetry. Although the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guardian's</hi> principles were also brought into ridicule by burlesque
                    exemplifications of them after the manner of Gay’s <hi rend="italic">Shepherd's
                    Week,</hi> Steele, misled by the opening sentences, was at first unwilling to
                    print what appeared to be a direct attack on Pope, and asked Pope’s consent to
                    the publication, which was graciously granted.</p>
                <p>The relations between Pope and his Whig friends were further strained by one or
                    two little incidents about the same time. The truculent Dennis attacked both
                    Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Rape of the Lock</hi> and Addison’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cato.</hi> Pope said nothing in his own defence, but—we were very obliging in
                    those days—defended his friend Addison in a <hi rend="italic">Narrative of the
                    Frenzy of John Dennis.</hi> The attack was so coarse that Addison sent Steele to
                    Dennis to disclaim all connexion with it. Then Pope asked his friend Addison’s
                    advice about the enlargement of the <hi rend="italic">Rape of the Lock,</hi> and
                    Addison advised him to leave it as it was, which advice the man who had asked it
                    attributed to jealousy.</p>
                <p>The estrangement was completed in connexion with Pope’s translation of Homer.
                    This enterprise was definitively undertaken in 1713. The work was to be
                    published by subscription as Dryden’s Virgil had been. Men of all parties
                    subscribed, their unanimity being a striking proof of the position Pope had
                    attained at the age of twenty-five. It was as if he had received a national
                    commission as by general consent the first poet of his time. But the unanimity
                    was broken by a discordant note. A member of the Addison clique, Tickell,
                    attempted to run a rival version. There was nothing criminal in this, but it was
                    an irritating continuation of the cold grudging treatment that Pope had all
                    along received from the same quarter. Pope suspected Addison’s instigation;
                    Tickell had at least Addison’s encouragement. Pope’s famous character of
                    Addison, if not true in the main, is at least a strictly fair description,
                    inspired not by malignity but by legitimate resentment, if resentment is ever
                    legitimate, of Addison’s treatment of himself as he was rising into fame.<note

                    magnanimous, and he is suspected of having supported this claim by petty
                    inventions in his account of the quarrel. Magnanimity he could not fairly claim;
                    but he did not attack without provocation.</p>
                <p>The translation of Homer was Pope’s chief employment for twelve years. The new
                    pieces in the miscellanies published in 1717, his “Elegy on an Unfortunate Lady”
                    and his “Eloisa to Abelard,” were probably written some years before their
                    publication. The <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> was delivered to the subscribers
                    in instalments in 1715, 1717, 1718, and 1720. For the translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> he took Fenton and Broome as coadjutors, who between
                    them translated twelve out of the twenty-four books.<note anchored="true"

                    the work was Pope’s chief temptation to undertake it. He cleared more than £8000
                    by the two translations, after deducting all payments to coadjutors—a much
                    larger sum than had ever been received by an English author before. Pope, with
                    his economical habits, was rendered independent by it, and enabled to live
                    nearer London. The estate at Binfield was sold, and he removed with his parents
                    to Chiswick in 1716, and in 1718 to Twickenham, to the residence with which his
                    name is associated. Here he held his little court, and was visited by his
                    intimates Arbuthnot, Gay, Bolingbroke (after his return in 1723), and Swift
                    (during his brief visits to England in 1726 and 1727), and by many other friends
                    of political eminence. Martha Blount, after his mother’s death in 1733, was
                    occasionally domiciled in his house.</p>
                <p>The translation of Homer established Pope’s reputation with his contemporaries,
                    and has endangered it ever since it was challenged. It was the Homer chiefly
                    that Wordsworth and Coleridge had in their eye when they began the polemic
                    against the “poetic diction” of the 18th century, and struck at Pope as the
                    arch-corruptor. They were historically unjust to Pope, who did not originate
                    this diction, but only furnished the most finished examples of it. Mr Leslie
                    Stephen has asked in what the much abused pseudo-poetic diction consists. A long
                    analysis would be required to answer the question in detail, but in substance it
                    consisted in an ambition to “rise above the vulgar style,” to dress nature to
                    advantage—a natural ambition—when the arbiters of literature were people of
                    fashion. If one compares Pope’s “Messiah,” or “Eloisa to Abelard,” or an
                    impassioned passage from the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> with the originals
                    that he paraphrased, one gets a more vivid idea of the consistence of
                    pseudo-poetic diction than could be furnished by pages of analysis. But Pope
                    merely used the established diction of his time. A passage from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Guardian,</hi> in which Philips was commended as against him,
                    shows in a single example the great aim of fashionable poets in those days. “It
                    is a nice piece of art to raise a proverb above the vulgar style and still keep
                    it easy and unaffected. Thus the old wish, ‘ God rest his soul,’ is very finely
                    turned :—</p>
                <p>“Then gentle Sidney liv’d, the shepherd’s friend, <hi rend="italic">Eternal
                    blessings on his shade attend.”</hi></p>
                <p>Pope would have despised so easy a metamorphosis as this, for, just as dress is
                    often valued for what it cost the wearer, so the poetic dress of nature was
                    esteemed in proportion to the poet’s labour and ingenuity in devising it. The
                    work of his coadjutors and imitators in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> may
                    be distinguished by this comparative cheapness of material. Broome’s description
                    of the clothes-washing by Nausicaa and her maidens in the sixth book may be
                    compared with the original as a luminous specimen.</p>
                <p>The year 1725 may be taken as the beginning of the third period of Pope’s career,
                    when he made his fame as a moralist and a satirist. In point of sheer literary
                    power the works then composed are his greatest, but the subjects chosen belong
                    essentially to the lower levels of poetry. Why did Pope, when his independence
                    was secured and he was free to choose, “take to the plains,” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n505/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0505-0486"/> to use Wordsworth’s phrase, “when the heights
                    were within his reach”? His choice was determined partly by character and partly
                    by circumstances. It may be doubted whether Pope had the staying power necessary
                    for the composition of a great imaginative work, whether his crazy constitution
                    would have held together through the strain. He toyed with the idea of writing a
                    grand epic. He told Spence that he had it all in his head, and gave him a vague
                    (and it must be admitted not very promising) sketch of the subject and plan of
                    it. But he never put any of it on paper. He shrank as with instinctive repulsion
                    from the stress and strain of complicated designs. Even his prolonged task of
                    translating weighed heavily on his spirits, and this was a much less formidable
                    effort than creating an epic. He turned rather to designs that could be
                    accomplished in detail, works of which the parts could be separately laboured at
                    and put together with patient care, into which happy thoughts could be fitted
                    that had been struck out at odd moments and in ordinary levels of feeling.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi> (1728) was the first work of the new period.
                    Circumstances turned him to satire when he was free from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey</hi>, and from his edition of Shakespeare, a bookseller’s commission
                    completed in the same year. Young’s satire, <hi rend="italic">The Universal
                    Passion,</hi> had just appeared and been received with more enthusiasm than
                    anything published since Pope’s own early successes. This alone would have been
                    powerful inducement to Pope’s emulous temper. Swift was finishing <hi
                    rend="italic">Gulliver’s Travels,</hi> and came over to England in 1726. The
                    survivors of the Scriblerus Club—Swift, Pope, Arbuthnot, and Gay— resumed their
                    old amusement of parodying and otherwise ridiculing bad writers, especially bad
                    writers in the Whig interest. A volume of their <hi rend="italic">jeux
                    d’esprit</hi> was published in 1727. According to Pope’s own history of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dunciad,</hi> the idea of it grew out of this. Among the
                    miscellanies was a “Treatise on the Art of Sinking,” in which poets were
                    classified, with illustrations, according to their eminence in the various arts
                    of debasing instead of elevating their subject. No names were mentioned, but the
                    specimens of bathos were assigned to various letters of the alphabet, most of
                    them taken at random. But no sooner was the treatise published than the
                    infatuated scribblers proceeded to take the letters to themselves, and in
                    revenge to fill the newspapers with the most abusive falsehoods and scurrilities
                    they could possibly devise. “This gave Mr Pope the thought that he had now some
                    opportunity of doing good, by detecting and dragging into light these common
                    enemies of mankind,” who for years had been anonymously aspersing almost all the
                    great characters of the age.</p>
                <p>The truth probably lies between this account and that adopted by those who take
                    the worst view of Pope’s character. This is that he was essentially vindictive
                    and malignant, and that, as soon as his hands were free from Homer, he proceeded
                    to settle old scores with all who had not spoken as favourably as he liked about
                    himself and his works. The most prominent objects of his satire can be shown to
                    have given him personal offence—Theobald, Cibber, Dennis, Lintot, and others.
                    This indeed was avowed by Pope, who claimed that it was their attacks on himself
                    that had given him a right to their names. We may admit that personal spite
                    influenced Pope at least as much as disinterested zeal for the honour of
                    literature, but in the dispute as to the comparative strength of these motives,
                    a third is apt to be overlooked that was probably stronger than either. This was
                    an unscrupulous elfish love of fun, and delight in the creations of a humorous
                    imagination. Certainly to represent the <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi> as the
                    outcome of mere personal spite is to give an exaggerated idea of the malignity
                    of Pope’s disposition, and an utterly wrong impression of the character of his
                    satire. He was not a morose, savage, indignant satirist, but airy and graceful
                    in his malice, writing more in fun than in anger, revengeful perhaps and
                    excessively sensitive, but restored to good-humour as he thought over his wrongs
                    by the ludicrous conceptions with which he invested his adversaries. We do not
                    feel the bitterness of wounded pride in his writings, but the laughter with
                    which that pride was consoled. He loved his own comic fancies more than he hated
                    his enemies. His fun at the expense of his victims was so far cruel that he was
                    quite regardless of their sufferings, probably enjoyed them; but it was an
                    impish and sprite-like cruelty, against which we cannot feel any real
                    indignation because it is substantially harmless, while its ingenious antics
                    never fail to amuse. Even when he exults in the poverty and material distresses
                    of his victims, the coarseness of the matter is redeemed by the irresponsible
                    gaiety of the manner. Such things should not be taken too seriously, if a
                    Scotsman may say so. Further, even if Pope is regarded as a bitter malignant, it
                    must be with two important qualifications. His plea that he was never the
                    aggressor in a quarrel, in spite of all Mr Elwin’s special pleadings to the
                    contrary, was a truthful plea, though his sensitiveness to criticism was such as
                    to make him fancy slights, and the withholding of praise where praise was due
                    would have been construed by him as a positive offence. And his literary
                    conscience was so strong that not one of his attacks on literary grounds was
                    unjust. Pope was a most generous critic of real merit. The only doubtful
                    exception is the case of Bentley, whom he satirized in the reconstruction and
                    enlargement of the <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi> made in the last years of his
                    life at the instigation, it is said, of Warburton. Looked at apart from personal
                    questions, the <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi> is the greatest feat of the
                    humorous imagination in English poetry.</p>
                <p>There was much more of unjust judgment in Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Satires and
                    Epistles of Horace Imitated,</hi> published at intervals between 1733 and 1738,
                    because in them he offener wrote of what he did not personally know, and was the
                    mouthpiece of the animus of his political friends. These friends were all in
                    opposition to Walpole, who was then at the height of his power, and the shafts
                    of Pope’s satire were directed at the adherents of the great minister. Pope’s
                    satires give the concentrated essence of the bitterness of the opposition. We
                    see gathered up in them the worst that was thought and said about the court
                    party when men’s minds were heated almost to the point of civil war. To
                    appreciate fully the point of his allusions requires of course an intimate
                    acquaintance with the political and social gossip of the time. But apart from
                    their value as a brilliant strongly-coloured picture of the time Pope’s satires
                    have a permanent value as literature. It is justly remarked by Pattison<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In his incomparable edition
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Satires and Epistles.</hi></p></note> that “these <hi
                    rend="italic">Imitations</hi> are among the most original of his writings.” The
                    felicity of the versification and the diction is universally admired.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> (1732-34) was also intimately connected
                    with passing controversies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Pattison’s edition of the <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Man.</hi></p></note> It belongs to the same intellectual movement with Butler’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Analogy—</hi> the effort of the 18th century to put religion
                    on a rational basis. But Pope was not a thinker like Butler. The subject was
                    suggested to him by Bolingbroke, who is said also—and the statement is supported
                    by the contents of his posthumous works—to have furnished most of the arguments.
                    Pope’s contribution to the controversy consisted in brilliant epigram and
                    illustration. In this di<pb break="no"

                    Criticism,</hi> he put together on a sufficiently simple plan a series of happy
                    sayings, separately elaborated, picking up the thoughts as he found them in
                    miscellaneous reading and conversation, and trying only to fit them with perfect
                    expression. The want of logical coherence in his system was shown by the very
                    different interpretations put upon it. Dealing as it did in incomparably
                    brilliant fashion with a subject of living interest, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay</hi> at once attracted attention both at home and abroad, and Pope was
                    attacked by a Swiss professor as an ally of the freethinkers. But a champion of
                    his orthodoxy was found in Warburton. Pope was so delighted with the pugnacious
                    paradoxist’s reply to De Crousaz that he made Warburton’s acquaintance. The
                    readiness with which Pope allowed Warburton to take possession of himself and
                    his works in his old age was not a symptom of senile weakness. It was an act of
                    that characteristic business-like acuteness which he showed throughout in the
                    management of his reputation. He saw that as long as Warburton was the
                    authorized commentator on his works there was not likely to be any lack of
                    critical debate about him and about them.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man,</hi> which may be said to contain the essence
                    of the thought of men of the world in his generation on its subject—such was the
                    poet’s skill and judgment in collecting the substance of floating opinion—was
                    announced by Pope as part of a system of “pieces on human life and manners.”
                    Whether Warburton was authorized or not in his sketch of Pope’s intentions, the
                    so-called <hi rend="italic">Moral Essays</hi> (published at intervals between
                    1731 and 1735) which Warburton connected with the general plan have each an
                    independent interest. They contain some of the most brilliant of Pope’s
                    satirical portraits, and his famous theory of “the ruling passion.” If space
                    permitted it might easily be shown that in this theory Pope proved himself a
                    better psychologist than Macaulay, who subjects it to much misunderstanding
                    ridicule.</p>
                <p>Pope died on the 30th May 1744, and was buried in the church of Twickenham. His
                    own ruling passion was what a poet of his generation described as the universal
                    passion, the love of fame. Under the influence of this passion he tried to
                    support his reputation by intrigues such as the statesmen of his time used in
                    climbing the ladder and keeping themselves in place. He had no moral scruple
                    where this was concerned—everything gave way before the ruling passion. For some
                    of these intrigues, so incongruous with our idea of a poet’s character, he has
                    suffered severe retribution. Especially of late years he has been violently
                    denounced as little better than a common swindler for his petty manoeuvres in
                    connexion with the publication of his letters—letters designed to exhibit him as
                    a pattern of friendship, magnanimity, and all the virtues. These manoeuvres,
                    which were first tracked with great patience and ingenuity by Mr Dilke,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Papers
                    of a Critic.</hi></p></note> are too intricate to be recorded in short space.
                    This, in effect, is what he seems to have done. He collected his letters from
                    his friends, retouched them, changed dates and passages to suit the picture of
                    himself which he wished to present, deposited the collection thus manipulated in
                    the safe-keeping of the earl of Oxford, then sent a printed book of them to
                    Curll, and intrigued to make it appear that they had been fraudulently published
                    without his consent. It was a ridiculously petty action, but to characterize it
                    as Mr Elwin has done will be fair when it is customary to use similar language
                    about the intrigues of statesmen and diplomatists. To apply it to Pope at
                    present is not to call a spade a spade, but a molehill a mountain. Recent
                    revelations have not affected by one iota Johnson’s judgment of his character.
                    The man who</p>
                <p>“played the politician about cabbages and turnips,” and “hardly drank tea without
                    a stratagem,” was not likely to be straightforward in a matter in which his
                    ruling passion was concerned. Against Pope’s petulance and “general love of
                    secrecy and cunning” have to be set, in any fair judgment of his character, his
                    exemplary conduct as a son, the affection with which he was regarded in his own
                    circle of intimates, and many well-authenticated instances of genuine kindliness
                    to persons in distress. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.)</hi></p>
