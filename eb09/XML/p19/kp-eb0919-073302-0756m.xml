                <p><label type="entry">PRIMOGENITURE</label>. The term “primogeniture” is used to
                    signify the preference in inheritance which is given by law, custom, or usage to
                    the eldest son and his issue, or in exceptional cases to the line of the eldest
                    daughter. The practice prevailed under the feudal codes throughout all the
                    Western countries. It is now almost entirely confined to the United Kingdom,
                    having been abolished (except in the succession to the crown) by the various
                    civil codes which have superseded feudalism on the Continent, and having been
                    universally rejected in the United States of America as being contrary to the
                    spirit of their institutions. The system has of late years been persistently
                    attacked in Great Britain, chiefly on the ground of hardship in cases of
                    intestacy where the property is small; but the rule was found to operate so
                    successfully in former times towards keeping large properties together that it
                    seems likely to be still maintained by law; and even if abolished as a rule of
                    law it would most probably be maintained in full vigour as a habit or rule of
                    practice.</p>
                <p>In dealing with the whole subject it will be convenient to state in the first
                    place the nature of the rules of primogeniture as they now exist in England,
                    with some notice of the exceptional usages which illustrate the meaning and
                    origin of the system, and in the second place to give an account of those
                    archaic customs in which we may find the actual origin of primogeniture before
                    it was altered and extended by the policy of the feudal sovereigns, and by
                    traditional usages which governed their succession to the throne. The English
                    law provides that in ordinary cases of inheritance to land the rule of
                    primogeniture shall prevail among the male children of the person from whom
                    descent is to be traced, but not among the females; and this principle is
                    applied throughout all the degrees of relationship. There are exceptions to this
                    rule in the gavelkind lands of Kent, where all the males take equally in each
                    degree, in the burgage tenements of certain ancient boroughs, where the descent
                    is to the youngest son under the custom called “borough-English,” and in the
                    copy hold lands of a great number of manors, where customs analogous to those of
                    gavelkind and borough-English have existed from time immemorial. In another
                    class of exceptions the rule of primogeniture is applied to the inheritance of
                    females, who usually take equal shares in each degree. The necessity for a sole
                    succession has, for example, introduced succession by primogeniture among
                    females in the case of the inheritance of the crown, and a similar necessity led
                    to the maxim of the feudal law that certain dignities and offices, castles
                    required for the defence of the realm, and other inheritances under “the law of
                    the sword” should not be divided, but should go to the eldest of the
                    co-heiresses (Bracton, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Legibus,</hi>
                    ii. c. 76; Co. Litt., 165a). In the case of dignities the rule of sole
                    succession is adopted without reference to the right of primogeniture, the
                    dignity lying in abeyance until the line of a particular co-heiress is selected
                    by the sovereign as “the fountain of honour.” Another exceptional usage gives a
                    preference to the line of the eldest daughter in the inheritance of customary
                    holdings in the Isle of Man, in various lordships in Cumberland, Westmoreland,
                    and Durham, as well as in isolated manors in Surrey and Sussex, and in other
                    parts of the southern and midland counties. At Tynemouth in Northumberland it
                    was the custom that the eldest daughter surviving her parents should inherit her
                    father’s estate for her life, artd in some of the southern manors already
                    mentioned the rule of primogeniture among females is not confined to daughters
                    but is extended to the eldest sister or aunt, or even to female relations in
                    more remote degrees. There are many other special customs by which the ordinary
                    rules of descent are varied according to manorial usage, as that the youngest
                    son shall inherit if the father dies seised, but otherwise the eldest, or that
                    fee-simple shall go to the youngest and entailed land to the eldest, or that the
                    special custom shall only affect lands of a certain value (as is said to be the
                    usage in several manors near London), or that male and female issue should share
                    together (as formerly was the practice at Wareham and Exeter and in certain
                    other ancient boroughs, as well as in some of the copy holds belonging to the
                    see of Worcester), or that the eldest or the youngest should be preferred among
                    the daughters in the claim to a renewal of a customary estate for lives, with
                    other analogous variations.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that the English law of inheritance creates a double preference,
                    subject to the exceptions already mentioned, in favour of the male over the
                    female and of the firstborn among the males. This necessitates the rule of
                    representation by which the issue of children are regarded as standing in the
                    places of their parents. This is called “representative primogeniture.” The rule
                    appears to have been firmly established in England during the reign of Henry
                    III., though its application was favoured as early as the 12th century
                    throughout the numerous contests between brothers claiming by proximity of blood
                    and their nephews claiming by representation, as in the case of King John and
                    his nephew Prince Arthur (Gianville, vii. c. 3; Bracton, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Legibus,</hi> ii. c. 30). We must now describe some of
                    those ancient usages in which the origin of primogeniture is to be sought.</p>
                <p>In addition to the rule of eldership as applied to inheritances of land there are
                    traces of a multitude of customs which applied a similar rule to certain classes
                    of “principals” or heirlooms, such as the best bed or piece of furniture, or
                    horse and cart, and the like, which descended to the eldest son; and by a
                    similar rule of the common law the ancient jewels of the crown are heirlooms
                    which descend to the successor according to the rule of primogeniture. In the
                    district of Archenfield near the Welsh border the house and lands were divided
                    between the sons on their father’s death, but certain “principals” passed to the
                    eldest as heirlooms, such as the best table and bed, “all which the men of
                    Archenfield retained as derived to them from great antiquity, even before the
                    Norman Conquest” (Quo Warranto Roll, 20 Edw. I., “Irchinfield ”).</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n757/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0757-0734"/>
                <p>A similar usage existed in some of the lands in Sussex belonging to Battle Abbey;
                    and by the custom of the hundred of Stretford in Herefordshire the eldest son
                    was entitled to keep the best article of every kind of chattel, as the best of
                    the chests and cups, or the best table and chair (Co. Litt., 18b). This right
                    resembles in many respects the privilege of the youngest co-heir to take the
                    hearthplace or <hi rend="italic">covert del</hi><hi rend="italic">astre,</hi>
                    which formerly prevailed in the gavelkind lands of Kent according to the Kentish
                    custumal, and privileges of the same kind which were customary in the district
                    round Amiens and in many parts of Flanders under the tenures called “maineté,”
                    “quévaise,” and “madelstad” (Bouthors, “Coutûmes Locales du Bailliage d’Amiens,”
                    <hi rend="italic">Cout. Gén.,</hi> i. 699, ii. 901). This exceptional law does
                    not seem to have prevailed in Scotland or Ireland; but in the Shetland Islands
                    it appears to have been the custom, as also in several of the Continental
                    instances, that the youngest child of either sex should have the house when the
                    property came to division. Similar benefits were reserved to the youngest son by
                    the Welsh laws, which provided that when brothers divided a patrimony containing
                    a habitation “the youngest should have the principal messuage and all the
                    buildings and eight acres of land, and the hatchet, the boiler, and the
                    ploughshare,” and a preference of the same kind prevailed in some parts of Devon
                    and Cornwall and in very extensive lordships in Brittany. Traces of the same or
                    analogous usages may be found in many parts of Germany, Switzerland, Russia,
                    Hungary, and other countries.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The custom of giving a preferential birthright to the eldest son or child did not
                    prevail so extensively in ancient times, though it was known in some parts of
                    Germany as well as in France, where it is called “le préciput.” The eldest son
                    or eldest child got the house and a piece of furniture and a plot of land “as
                    far as a chicken could fly,” as being traditionally exempt from the general
                    partition. In the <hi rend="italic">Ordinances</hi> of St Louis we find a rule
                    that a gentleman having daughters only should divide the rest of his property
                    equally among them, “mais l’aînée outre sa portion aura la maison paternelle et
                    le vol du chapon.”</p>
                <p>Instances of this kind are found among the rural customs of Εngland and Normandy,
                    which serve to indicate the source of one part at least of the English system of
                    primogeniture. The rights of the eldest, however, have been collected from many
                    quarters. Sir Henry Maine has traced the modern form of this system to the
                    growth of the power of the chieftain and its development in feudal times. The
                    mediaeval jurists are responsible for many exaggerations of the principle of
                    sole succession to rights of dominion. But it is at any rate important to
                    observe that there were Teutonic customs giving a benefit of eldership before
                    the feudal system was invented, which appear to have much less connexion with
                    the power of the patriarch or chieftain than with the sentiment that gave the
                    father’s house to the eldest son under the Athenian law or secured to him a
                    larger set of rights under the <hi rend="italic">Laws of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Manu</hi> (Demosth., <hi rend="italic">Pro Phorm.,</hi> 34; Coulanges, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cité</hi><hi rend="italic">Antique,</hi> c. 6). It should also be
                    remembered that at least one tribe of Germans was accustomed in the days of
                    Tacitus to allow the father’s war-horse to descend as an heirloom or “principal”
                    to the eldest son <hi rend="italic">(Germ.,</hi> cc. 18, 20, 32), and that the
                    strict rule of primogeniture appears to have existed in Scandinavia from the
                    most ancient times. To the English instances already mentioned may be added a
                    passage from Bede’s life of St Benedict which shows that some substantial
                    birthright was reserved in his time for the eldest son, when a patrimony had to
                    be divided according to the</p>
                <p>Northumbrian laws, “Quomodo terreni parentes, quem primum fuderint, eum
                    principium liberorum suorum cognoscere et caeteris praeferendum ducere solent”
                    (Bede, <hi rend="italic">Vit.</hi><hi rend="italic">Bened.,</hi> s. 11). This
                    may refer to some system of double portions, like the Jewish rule as to
                    “birthright” (Deut. xxi. 15, 16), or it may denote a preference in partition
                    which secured the dwelling-house or principal chattels to “the first-fruits of
                    the family.” A passage from Glanville, which is applicable to England and
                    Scotland in the 12th century, shows that in the case of a rustic holding the
                    custom of the district determined whether it should be divided among all the
                    sons or reserved for the eldest or youngest. “If he were a free sokeman, the
                    inheritance in that case will be divided among all the sons according to their
                    number in equal shares, if the holding was partible by ancient custom, the chief
                    messuage being, however, reserved for the first-born son in honour of his
                    seniority, but on the terms of his making compensation to his brothers from the
                    rest of his property. But if it was not anciently partible, .then by the custom
                    of some places the first-born son will take the whole inheritance, but by other
                    customs the youngest son is the heir” (Glanville, vii. c. 3). In the time of
                    Bracton, a century later, the presumption that primogeniture was an exceptional
                    rule had been reversed, and special proof was required in freehold lands of a
                    custom to exclude the eldest. He still speaks, however, of customs in favour of
                    the eldest or youngest son in the case of the “villein-socage” holdings, which
                    afterwards developed into copyholds. “When a free sokeman dies leaving several
                    heirs to share, if the inheritance is partible from ancient times, they shall
                    all have their equal shares; and if there is only one messuage that shall remain
                    entire for the eldest, but so that the others shall have up to its value out of
                    the common stock. But if the inheritance has not been divided from ancient times
                    then it shall remain to the eldest. But if it be villein-socage then the custom
                    of the place is to be observed, for it is the usage in some parts for the
                    youngest to be preferred to the eldest, or the contrary” <hi rend="italic">(De
                    Leg.,</hi> ii. c. 76). The ancient rule of inheritance among socage tenants in
                    Scotland was the same as that described by Glanville.</p>
                <p>These customs of “rural primogeniture” can be traced, as we have seen, in some
                    parts of the Continent, but their existence is rarely to be distinguished where
                    the influence of the Roman law prevailed in the barbarian kingdoms, as in Italy,
                    Spain, and Provence. In Normandy and Picardy, however, these usages long
                    remained in an exceptionally vigorous form,—a fact which may be due to the
                    Scandinavian origin of the Normans, or perhaps, as Richebourg suggested in his
                    note on the <hi rend="italic">Coutûme</hi><hi rend="italic">de Caux,</hi> the
                    custom may have lasted down as a tradition from Gaulish times. The laws of the
                    Channel Islands still preserve a special benefit for the eldest son; but the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coutumier Général</hi> affords several examples of a more ample
                    birthright which can hardly be attributed to any feudal influence. By the custom
                    of Normandy “the eldest son in right of his eldership might take and choose as a
                    <hi rend="italic">préciput</hi> such fief or <hi rend="italic">terre</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">noble</hi> as he pleased; and if there were but one <hi
                    rend="italic">manoir roturier</hi> on the land the eldest before the division
                    might declare that he retained it with court and garden, making recompense to
                    his younger brothers” <hi rend="italic">(Coutûme</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Normandie,</hi> 337, 356). “L’aisné faisant partage . . . peut retenir par
                    précipu le lieu chevels . . . anciennement appelé hébergement, soit en ville ou
                    en champs, de quelque estendue qu’il soit” (“Usage de Bayeux,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cout. Gén.,</hi> iv. 77, 78, 94). The usage of the district of Caux, on the
                    frontier of Picardy, was even more favourable to the eldest son: “Demeurant le
                    manoir et pourpris en son intégrité au profit de l’aisné sans qu’il en puisse

                <p>This last instance appears to give us a clue to the origin of the strict English
                    primogeniture as applied to the rustic holdings, sometimes called <hi
                    rend="italic">fiefs</hi><hi rend="italic">de roturier</hi> or “ploughman’s fee,”
                    which in most parts of the Continent, as in almost every district in England
                    before the Norman Conquest, descended to all the sons in equal shares, with some
                    customary privilege or birthright in favour of the eldest or youngest son. The
                    strict rule of the custom of Caux was deliberately applied by the Norman kings
                    of England not only to military fiefs but also (wherever it was possible) to
                    agricultural tenancies. This was effected partly by reversing the presumption of
                    partibility, as shown by the passage from Bracton cited above, and partly by
                    direct enactments of the king or of his greater tenants, who assumed or received
                    the prerogative of abolishing inconvenient modes of inheritance. The urban
                    customs of the “French” portions of Hereford and Nottingham appear to have been
                    altered in this way. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Municipality.)</hi> Simon de
                    Montfort, by his charter in 1255, granted to the burgesses of Leicester that the
                    eldest son should be his father’s heir instead of the youngest; and an analogous
                    right was exercised under the name of “disgavelling” by the archbishop of
                    Canterbury in Kent. About the reign of Edward II. the idea first began to
                    prevail that such alterations of descent could not be carried out without the
                    consent of parliament, and it was eventually held that even the king had no such
                    prerogative (Robinson, <hi rend="italic">Gavelkind,</hi> i. c. 5). The earlier
                    view is very clearly stated in a charter by which Edward I. disgavelled certain
                    lands of John de Cobham (Charter Rolls, 4 Edw. I., No. 17). The most important
                    clauses of this document were in effect as follows :—</p>
                <p>“It pertains to our prerogative to abolish such laws and customs as diminish
                    instead of increasing the strength of the kingdom, or at least to change them by
                    our special favour in the case of our deserving and faithful followers; and
                    since it has often happened by the Kentish custom that lands, which when
                    undivided in certain hands are quite sufficient for the service of the state and
                    the maintenance of many, are afterwards divided and broken up among co-heirs
                    into so many parts and particles that no one portion suffices even for its
                    owner’s maintenance, we therefore grant to J. de Cobham that all the gavelkind
                    lands and tenements which he now holds in fee simple shall descend to his eldest
                    son or other heir at common law in the same way as his estates held by serjeanty
                    or knight-service.”</p>
                <p>A similar change of tenure was effected by Acts of parliament for many estates in
                    Kent in 11 Hen. VII., 15 Hen. VIII., 31 Hen. VIII., 2 and 3 Edw. VI., 1 Eliz., 8
                    Eliz., and 21 James I., and primogeniture was introduced in the same way into
                    the soke of Oswaldbeck in Nottinghamshire in 32 Hen. VIII. and into the city of
                    Exeter by the Act of 23 Eliz. c. 12. The customary descent of copyhold lands
                    (where primogeniture had not been established in ancient times by the ordinances
                    of the lords or by an application of the current presumption) has been changed
                    in a great number of cases by other private Acts of parliament or has been
                    destroyed by enfranchisement. The Welsh custom of partition was altered in some
                    respects, especially by forbidding the inheritance of bastards, by the Statute
                    of Wales passed in the 12 th year of Edward I.; the custom as modified was
                    confirmed when the principality was united in 27 Hen. VIII. to the kingdom of
                    England, but it was soon afterwards enacted by the Act 34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c.
                    26 that freehold lands in Wales should thenceforth be “holden as English tenure
                    to all intents according to the common laws of this realm of England, and not be
                    partible amongst heirs-male after the custom of gavelkind as heretofore in
                    divers parts of Wales was used and accustomed.” The change in the Irish customs
                    was carried out in a different way. There is evidence that before the adoption
                    of the English law several systems of customary inheritance were known in
                    Ireland.</p>
                <p>Besides the law of tanistry, which will be described afterwards, there are
                    indications in the Brehon tracts not only of arrangements in favour of the
                    youngest branch, such as have been already mentioned, but also of a preference
                    in some cases for the eldest son, “the cattle and land being equally divided,
                    but the house and offices going in addition to his own share to the eldest son”
                    (Hearn, <hi rend="italic">Aryan Household,</hi> 80, 82; O’Curry, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures,</hi> clxxix.). Besides these cases we have the record of
                    that system of “Irish gavelkind” which was described by Spenser and Davis, and
                    which has been shown by Sir H. S. Maine to be closely connected with very early
                    Aryan institutions still surviving in practice among the Hindus.</p>
                <p>“The lands in that kingdom possessed by the mere Irish were divided into several
                    territories or countries, and the inhabitants of every Irish <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> country ’ were divided into several septs or
                    lineages, in every one of which there was a chief called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canfinny</hi> or <hi rend="italic">‘ caput</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cognationis,’</hi> and all the inferior tenancies in these territories were
                    partible among the males in gavelkind; but the estate which these inferior
                    tenants had was not an estate of inheritance, but a temporary or transitory
                    possession, for these lands were not partible among the next heirs of him that
                    died, but among all the males of this sept or clan in this manner: the <hi
                    rend="italic">Canfinny</hi> (who was generally the oldest man in the sept) made
                    all these partitions according to his discretion. This <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canfinny,</hi> after the death of every one who had a competent portion of
                    land, assembled all the sept and having put all their possessions into hotchpot
                    made a new partition of the whole; in which partition . . . he allotted to every
                    one of the sept according to his age a better or larger part” (Robinson, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gavelkind,</hi> i. c. 2; Davis’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi>
                    37, “Case of Tanistry ”).</p>
                <p>This is obviously the description of a joint family similar to those which have
                    been found in the Scottish Highlands, in France, in the Slavonic countries, and
                    in India, and, as it would seem, the various modes and periods of redistributing
                    such joint possessions are merely matters of detail and convenience. It would be
                    of greater importance to our subject to know whether any special property was
                    reserved for one of the dead man’s sons, as in the case of the Frisian
                    “theel-lands.” It was resolved in the great case of tanistry in the third year
                    of James I. that this Irish “custom of gavelkind” was void in law as being
                    unreasonable and as being “a mere personal custom” not binding the descent of
                    the inheritance, “and therefore all the lands in these Irish territories were
                    adjudged to be descendible according to the course of the common law,
                    notwithstanding the Irish usage.” By one of the penal statutes against Roman
                    Catholics in Ireland (2 Anne c. 6), the usage of partibility was to some extent
                    revived, it being enacted that the lands of Roman Catholics should be divided
                    among all the sons “as in gavelkind,” unless the heir should be a Protestant;
                    but this harsh law was fortunately repealed by the Irish Act of 18 Geo. III. c.
                    49.</p>
                <p>The remote origin of all these ancient forms of primogeniture may probably be
                    traced to a system of family religion that prevailed among the tribes from which
                    the Aryan nations have descended. We are told in the <hi rend="italic">Laws
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">Manu</hi> that the eldest son had his very being for
                    the purpose of accomplishing the rites of the family religion, of offering the
                    funeral cake, and of providing the repasts for the spirits of the dead
                    ancestors. “The right of pronouncing the prayers belongs to him who came into
                    the world the first. A man must regard his elder brother as equal to his father.
                    By the eldest at the moment of his birth the father discharges his debt to his
                    own progenitors; the eldest son ought therefore before partition to manage the
                    whole of the patrimony” <hi rend="italic">(Laws of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Manu,</hi> ix. 105, 126; Coulanges, <hi rend="italic">La Cité Antique,</hi> c.
                    6, “La Droit d’Aînesse ”). This view seems to account for the widespread usage
                    that the eldest son should keep the house, or hearthplace, or the parents’
                    furniture as part of his share of the inheritance. It is said that among the
                    Hindus the right to inherit a dead man’s property is exactly coextensive with
                    the duty of performing his obsequies, and we are told that in ancient <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n759/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0759-0736"/> Rome an inheritance could not be distributed
                    under a will “without a strict apportionment of the expenses of these ceremonies
                    among the different co-heirs” (Maine, <hi rend="italic">Ano. Law,</hi> 191).
                    Some support is also given to this theory by the custom which is said to have
                    prevailed in Norway by which particular lands were set apart for funeral
                    expenses, and if a man had no kinsman to give him proper burial he might leave
                    his property as “brande-erbe” or “burningland” as an endowment for burial, and
                    the friend who accepted the duty was allowed to keep the property as “odal land”
                    or privileged family inheritance (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">Early Kings,</hi>
                    ii. 323). Numerous other illustrations might be given from the analogous customs
                    in which the youngest son is preferred. There seems to be no reason why the
                    eldest should be preferred by one nation and the youngest by another; but
                    something may perhaps be due to the accident that the one set of tribes was
                    civilized enough to have fixed family habitations, and the other may have lived
                    in a nomad fashion, so that the youngest would be most likely to remain in the
                    parents’ tent and to be ready to perform the duties of the hearthplace. Sir
                    Henry Maine draws a distinction between the archaic customs of the tribe and
                    that strict form of primogeniture which he has traced to the power of the
                    chieftain. Taking primogeniture in the sense of an exclusive succession of the
                    eldest son to property, he finds no sign of its existence before the destruction
                    of the Roman empire by the barbarians. “Even when the Teutonic races spread over
                    western Europe they did not bring with them primogeniture as their ordinary rule
                    of succession.” He considers the “birthright” given to the eldest in the
                    instances which have been mentioned to be in the nature of a reward or a
                    security for impartial distribution <hi rend="italic">{EarlyHist. Inst.,</hi>
                    197,198). “Primogeniture, as we know it in our law, had rather a political than
                    a civil origin, and comes from the authority of the feudal lord and probably
                    from that of the tribal chief; but here and there on the Continent there are
                    traces of it as a civil institution, and in such cases the succession of the
                    eldest son does not exclude provision for the younger sons by what are called
                    appanages. The evidence of ancient law and Usage would, however, seem to show
                    that it was usually the youngest son who remained at home with his father to
                    serve him through life and succeed to his remaining property at his death” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Early Law and Custom,</hi> p. 260).</p>
                <p>As regards the political origin of a great part of the English system of
                    primogeniture a distinction should be made between royal and feudal successions.
                    The devolution of the crown in European countries has usually been regulated by
                    some kind of primogeniture, based partly on the rules which have governed
                    private successions, partly on the indivisible character of the empire as it
                    survived into modern times, and partly again on that “law of the sword” or rule
                    of public policy which forbids the disintegration of the state. It is possible
                    also that the Irish system of tanistry contained some of the elements of this
                    method of royal succession. The custom was described by Spenser in his <hi
                    rend="italic">View of the State of Ireland</hi> shortly before the abolition of
                    the Brehon law in the reign of James I. as follows: “It is a custom among all
                    the Irish that, presently after the death of any of their chief lords or
                    captains, they do presently assemble themselves . . . to choose another in his
                    stead, where they do nominate and elect for the most part not the eldest son nor
                    any of the children of the lord deceased, but the next to him of blood that is
                    eldest and worthiest, as commonly the next brother, if he have any, or the next
                    cousin and so forth, as any is elder in that kindred or sept, and then next to
                    him they choose the next of the blood to be tanaist, who shall succeed him in
                    the said captaincy if he live thereunto.” This system may be described as the
                    election of an elder to be head of the sept (like the analogous election of a
                    patriarchal “house-father” in a joint family), with an additional choice of an
                    elder in reversion, to avoid disputes as to succession in times of war. A
                    similar rule may have obtained among the Teutonic tribes (Maine, <hi
                    rend="italic">Early Hist. Inst.,</hi> 202); as the smaller chiefs sank into the
                    position of nobles and were succeeded by their eldest sons (for reasons
                    connected with the priestly character of the king) in the possession of their
                    offices and demesnes, a rule of the same kind might grow up with regard to the
                    king or ruling chieftain, by which the eldest son would get not only his private
                    demesne but also that “portion of land attached to the seignory or chiefry which
                    went without partition to the tanaist.” In this way a principle of inheritance
                    might be formed “which first of all extended from the demesne to all the estates
                    of the holder of the seignory, however acquired, and ultimately determined the
                    law of succession for the privileged classes throughout feudalized Europe” <hi
                    rend="italic">{ibid.,</hi> 204, 208). This part of the subject is confessedly
                    very obscure; and it must not be forgotten that there were other and stranger
                    modes of succession to chieftainships in Ireland and Scotland, which appear to
                    have been unconnected with any such rules of primogeniture (Girald. Cambr., <hi
                    rend="italic">Top. Hibern.,</hi> iii. 25; Ware, <hi rend="italic">Ant.
                    Hib.,</hi> ii. 64; Ailred’s <hi rend="italic">Chron.,</hi> ed. Twysden, 348;
                    Robertson, <hi rend="italic">Early Kings,</hi> i. 36). Bede has left us a
                    description of the rule among the Picts. “It was the custom in Pictland,” as the
                    saying went, that the kingdom should come from women rather than from men.
                    (Compare the similar customs among the ancient Spartans, Lycians, and Iberians
                    in M <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> Lennan ’ s <hi rend="italic">Studies,</hi>
                    101, 145.) The dignity never went from father to son, but when the king died the
                    crown went to his next brother, or in default to his sister’s son, or in any
                    event to the nearest male relation claiming through a female and on the female
                    side. The list of kings contains no instance of a son bearing his father’s name,
                    or of the same name belonging to both father and mother ∙, and the only fathers
                    of kings of whom any account has survived are certainly known to have been
                    foreigners, the one being a prince of Strathclyde and the other a grandson of
                    the king of Northumbria. One and the same rule of primogeniture has been applied
                    in England to royal and to private estates, with the exception as to the
                    succession of the eldest daughter which has already been mentioned. The system
                    varied greatly in the Continental countries according to the circumstances of
                    each case. In France the crown was regarded as a partible inheritance under the
                    first two dynasties. At the beginning of the 11th century primogeniture had
                    become the rule as to fiefs, offices, and dignities, and partly no doubt from
                    analogy and partly for reasons of public policy the crown was brought within the
                    same rule under the house of Capet (Montesquieu, <hi rend="italic">Esprit des
                    Lois,</hi> xxxi. 32; Kenny, <hi rend="italic">Law of Primogeniture in
                    England,</hi> 10). But in this case there was a singular modification, known as
                    the “Salic law” or “Salic rule” (as if it had been derived from the customs of
                    the Salian Franks), by which the succession was eventually limited to males
                    claiming through males. The origin of this law has been found in the fact that
                    “the kings sprung from Hugh Capet succeeded one another, son to father, or
                    brother to brother, for more than 300 years” previously to the disputes which
                    arose in the 14th century as to the succession of an heir claiming through a
                    female (Maine, <hi rend="italic">Early Law and Custom,</hi> 154). The rule was
                    adopted because it corresponded to the facts which had existed; it was extended
                    because it suited the circumstances of those states in which the sovereign had a
                    large authority; in constitutional countries the rule has been considered to be
                    against public policy, partly perhaps because the reign of a female sovereign is
                    regarded as favourable to popular liberties.</p>

                <p>The history of primogeniture as applied to feudal succession is simpler than that
                    of the inheritance of the crown. When a fief was regarded not strietly as an
                    estate in land but rather as being in the nature of an office there was at first
                    no room for the notion of its descent to an heir. Held first at will and
                    afterwards for short fixed periods, the fiefs or benefices came gradually to be
                    regarded as inheritances. When this idea was first established the fief was
                    usually treated as being partible among all the sons, and it was not until 1138
                    that Frederick Barbarossa, for reasons of public policy, forbade the greater
                    tenancies to be subdivided. The <hi rend="italic">Assises</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de Jérusalem</hi> had laid down the same rule in 1099, though the king was then
                    allowed to select any one of the children for succession. “In Brittany,
                    primogeniture was not introduced till 1185, even for nobles and knights. . . .
                    Down to the French Revolution a German baron had to make a family settlement and
                    to get the consent of his younger sons, if he wished his land to descend to the
                    eldest son alone” (Kenny, 11). In France the eldest son began to gain
                    pre-eminence in the division of fiefs about the beginning of the 11th century,
                    and the usage spread with more or less vigour through all the Western countries.
                    “Usu ad omnia feuda serpsit, ut vel ex asse majori cedant, vel major praecipuum
                    aliquod in iis habeat” (Zoesius, cited in Co. Litt., 191a). In countries where
                    the Roman law prevailed the privileges of the eldest son were secured by a legal
                    fiction, the jurists deciding that every noble was a “miles” or soldier on
                    service entitled to exceptional benefits. In Spain the inheritance was
                    considered to be divisible into fifteen shares, of which seven in all (being
                    one-fifth of the whole and one-third of the residue, known as the customary
                    “fifth and third” ) were within the parent’s disposal as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >majoratus</hi>; and this was usually entailed upon the eldest son. Similar
                    privileges by way of <hi rend="italic">majorat</hi> have been given to
                    particular landowners in France at various times since the abolition of
                    primogeniture in the great Revolution. The feudal primogeniture of England was
                    firmly established in the reigns of the first two Norman kings, with a temporary
                    provision for the case of estates lying both in England and Normandy, in which
                    the Norman estate was allotted to the eldest son and the English estates to the
                    second. Its origin, as we have seen, is to be found partly in old modes of
                    customary inheritance surviving both in England and in Normandy, but mainly in
                    the deliberate policy of the sovereigns, who wished to keep the military estates
                    together, and took advantage of the strictness of the “custom of Caux” to carry
                    out the objects of the “law of the sword.” (c. I. E.)</p>
