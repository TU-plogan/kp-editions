                <p><label type="entry">PROUT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Samuel</hi></label> (1783-1852),
                    water-colour painter, was born at Plymouth on September 17, 1783. His education
                    in art was obtained by a patient and enthusiastic study of nature. He spent
                    whole summer days, in company with the ill-fated Haydon, in drawing the quiet
                    cottages, rustic bridges, and romantic water-mills of the beautiful valleys of
                    Devon. He even made a journey through Cornwall, to try his hand in furnishing
                    sketches for Britton’s <hi rend="italic">Beauties of England.</hi> On his
                    removal in 1803 to London, which became his headquarters after 1812, a new scene
                    of activity opened up before Prout. He now endeavoured to correct and improve
                    his style by the study of the works of the rising school of landscape. To gain a
                    living he painted marine pieces for Falser the printseller, received pupils, and
                    published many drawing books for learners. He was likewise one of the first who
                    turned to account in his profession the newly-invented art of lithography. In
                    spite of all this industry, however, it was not until about, 1818 that Prout
                    discovered his proper sphere. Happening at that time to make his first visit to
                    the Continent, and to study the quaint streets and market-places of Continental
                    cities, he suddenly found himself in a new and enchanting province of art. All
                    his faculties, having found their congenial element, sprung into unwonted power
                    and activity. His eye readily caught the picturesque features of the
                    architecture, and his hand recorded them with unsurpassed felicity and fine
                    selection of line. The composition of his drawings was exquisitely natural;
                    their colour exhibited “the truest and happiest association in sun and shade”;
                    the picturesque remnants of ancient architecture were rendered with the happiest
                    breadth and largeness, with the heartiest perception and enjoyment of their
                    time-worn ruggedness; and the solemnity of great cathedrals was brought out with
                    striking effect. Encouraged by this success, Prout continued most
                    enthusiastically to pursue that path upon which he had unexpectedly come. At the
                    time of his death, 10th February 1852, there was scarcely a nook in France,
                    Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands where his quiet, benevolent, observant face
                    had not been seen searching for antique gables and sculptured pieces of stone.
                    In Venice especially there was hardly a pillar which his eye had not lovingly
                    studied and his pencil had not dexterously copied.</p>
