                    New Brunswick on the south and west by Northumberland Strait, which varies from
                    9 to 30 miles in width. Its greatest length is nearly 150 miles, its general

                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> Prince Edward Island resembles a
                    crescent in its northern outline, the two horns being North and East Capes, and
                    it is altogether irregular in form. Its surface is slightly rolling, the
                    elevations of land, however, rising nowhere higher than 500 feet. The coast-line
                    is indented with numerous bays and projecting headlands, the more prominent of
                    the latter being North Cape on the north-west, West Cape on the west, East Cape
                    on the east, Cape Bear on the south-east; others are Stewart, Bell, Prim,
                    Gallas, Black, Amherst, and Fifteen on the south, Kildare, Aylesbury, Turner,
                    Cablehead, and Campbell on the north, Durell and Bruce on the east, and Seal
                    Point on the west. The principal bays are Richmond on the north, Egmont on the
                    south-west, Hillsborough on the south, and Cardigan on the east. These inlets,
                    piercing the land from opposite directions, form narrow isthmuses which divide
                    the island into three distinct peninsulas. Other bays are St Peter’s, Grenville,
                    Harrington, and Tignish on the north; Colville, Rollo, Fortune, and Boughton on
                    the east; Orwell and Pownal on the south. Along the coasts there are several
                    small islands, viz., Grover, Fish, Burnbury, Lennox, Robinson’s, Boughton,
                    Panmore, Wood, Governor, St Peter’s, and Brae. The chief rivers are North,
                    Elliott or West, Hillsborough or East, Ellis or Grand, Percival, Trout,
                    Boughton, Murray, Dunk, and Morrell. The Grand river is the seat of a large and
                    increasing oyster and codfish trade. The Dunk is a fine salmon and trout stream.
                    The principal harbours are Charlottetown, Georgetown, Bedeque, Port Hill,
                    Cascum-peque, Souris, Murray, Savage, Bedford, and Westmoreland. The island is
                    well watered, and by the disintegration of the soft red sandstones a bright red
                    loamy soil of great fertility is produced. To this the province owes its
                    remarkable productiveness as an agricultural district, and the gently undulating
                    surface, the rich fields, and pretty homesteads embowered in trees give variety
                    and beauty to the landscape.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The oldest geological formations in Prince
                    Edward Island are represented by beds of brown, grey, and red sandstone and
                    shale, with layers of coarse concretionary limestone and fossil plants. These
                    are of newer Carboniferous (or in part of Lower Permian) age, and have <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0763-0740"/> been named by Sir William Dawson the
                    Permo-carboniferous series. They appear in the peninsula between Orwell Bay and
                    Pownal Bay, in Governor’s Island, in Hillsborough Bay, and on the coast between
                    West and North Capes, as well as in other localities on the south and west. But
                    the prevalent rocks are bright red sandstones with calcareous cement,
                    alternating with beds of red and mottled clay, and with occasional white bands
                    and layers of concretionary limestones and conglomerate, which in mineral
                    character resemble the Trias or New Red Sandstone of Nova Scotia. The formation
                    may be divided into two sections: “the lower, representing,” says Dawson, “the
                    Bunter Sandstein of Europe, is characterized by the prevalence of hard
                    concretionary calcareous sandstones and obscure fossil plants, while the upper
                    (representing, perhaps, the Keuper of Europe) has softer and more regularly
                    bedded sandstones and clays.” Owing to the similarity of the Permo-carboniferous
                    and Triassic beds, and the general covering of soil, it is not possible
                    definitely to mark the limits of the two formations. Drift deposits, viz.,
                    boulder clay, stratified sand and gravel containing in some places sea-shells of
                    species now living and occasional boulders (this deposit comparatively rare),
                    and loose boulders, overlie the surface of the more solid rocks in the greater
                    part of the island. Beds of peat, dunes of drifted sand, alluvial clays, and
                    mussel mud (valuable as a fertilizer) occur in creeks and bays. The portions of
                    country occupied by the Upper Carboniferous series are generally flat, and this
                    applies, observe Drs Dawson and Harrington, to a portion of the Triassic region
                    north of Bedeque, where the beds seem to have been subjected to severe aqueous
                    denudation. The minerals are unimportant, neither coal, gypsum, nor gold being
                    found in any part of the island.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Vegetation.—</hi> The climate of Prince Edward
                    Island is much milder than that of the adjacent provinces, and, though the
                    winter is severe and cold, the air is invigorating and salubrious. The coldest
                    month is January, when the thermometer registers a daily average of 15 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 9. Fogs seldom occur. In the summer the heat is less
                    extreme than in Quebec, the mean being 62 <hi rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 3, and
                    the pleasant autumn months attract visitors from all parts of the American
                    continent. Vegetation develops rapidly, and agriculture is extensively
                    prosecuted. Wheat, barley, oats, pease and beans, potatoes, turnips, and other
                    crops ripen to perfection.</p>
                <p>The amount of land under crop in 1881 was 467,211 acres, and in pasture 126,935
                    acres. The chief produce raised in that year was 546,986 bushels of wheat,
                    119,368 of barley, 3,538,219 of oats, 90,458 of buckwheat, 6,042,191 of
                    potatoes, 1,198,407 of turnips, 42,572 of other roots, 143,791 tons of hay, and
                    15,247 tons of grass and clover seed. Of live stock there were 31,335 horses,
                    45,895 milch cows, 44,743 other horned cattle, 166,496 sheep, and 40,181 swine.
                    1,688,690 lb of butter, 196,273 of cheese, 14,945 of honey, and 25,098 of maple
                    sugar were made during the year. Prince Edward Island does not grow much fruit,
                    but the apple crop is usually good, though not large, and grapes, plums, and
                    currants are grown in small quantities. The land which is not cultivable
                    consists of soft spongy turf which may be used for fuel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> The forests of the island used to be very
                    extensive, but lumbering operations, destructive fires, and the needs of the
                    husbandmen have reduced them, though many trees still remain, the principal
                    being beech, birch, pine, maple, poplar, spruce, fir, hemlock, larch, cedar,
                    &amp;c. The exports in 1883 were valued as follows :— produce of the forest,
                    $28,385; agricultural produce, $377,614; animals and their produce, $238,952;
                    manufactures, $183,986, the total being $1,318,549; that of the imports
                    (manufactured goods, iron, hardware, wines, spirits, tobacco, tea, coffee,
                    sugar, molasses. &amp;c.) was $682,170.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Industries.—</hi> Shipbuilding in former years was a very
                    active industry. It is still carried on, but to a considerably smaller
                    extent,—the number of vessels built in 1883 having been only seventeen, with a
                    tonnage of 5343. On the 31st of December 1883 the vessels registered in the
                    province and remaining on the registry books of the several ports amounted to
                    241, with a tonnage of 40,400. In that year there were engaged in the coasting
                    trade (including steamers) 1162 vessels, representing a tonnage of 113,117. The
                    manufactures are chiefly for domestic use, and include the making of woollen
                    cloth, saws and files, saddles and harness, sashes, doors, and blinds; there are
                    also saw-mills, starch factories, tanneries, tin and sheet-iron works,
                    tobacco-pipe factories, &amp;c. In 1881 the amount of capital invested in
                    industries was $2,085,776, giving employment to 5767 hands, and the value of the
                    products was $3,400,208.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fisheries.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The fisheries are
                    exceedingly valuable, particularly those on the north coast, the catch being
                    chiefly mackerel, haddock, cod, hake, and herrings, though other kinds are
                    taken. Of late years increased impetus has been given to this industry, and many
                    men and boats are employed in conducting it. Enormous quantities of lobsters and
                    oysters are annually shipped to all parts of the American continent as well as
                    elsewhere. The value of the fisheries in 1883 was nearly half a million
                    dollars.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Game, die.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Wild ducks, teal,
                    brant, wild geese, woodcocks, partridges, pigeons, and snipe occur in great
                    abundance. Birds number 260 species. Of wild animals the principal are bears
                    (found occasionally only), lynxes, foxes, musk-rats, hares, squirrels, &amp;c.
                    In the summer and autumn seals in large numbers frequent the shores.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> Good waggon roads are to be found wherever
                    there is a settlement. The Prince Edward Island Railway, 200 miles long, runs
                    from one end of the island to the other, and branches off to every town or point
                    of importance. The main line extends from Souris and Georgetown on the east to
                    Tignish on the north-western extremity, connecting with Summerside and
                    Charlottetown, the capital. During the season of navigation regular
                    communication is had by steamer with Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, and
                    Boston. Navigation usually closes about the middle of December and opens before
                    the first of May. In winter the mails and passengers are conveyed across the
                    strait in ice-boats, which ply between Cape Traverse in Prince Edward Island and
                    Cape Tormentine in New Brunswick. A steamer runs between Georgetown and Pictou,
                    Nova Scotia, nearly the whole season. There is a post-office to every 400 of the
                    inhabitants. Telegraphic communication is maintained with America and Europe by
                    means of a submarine cable about 10 miles in length, connecting the island with
                    New Brunswick. Telegraph offices are established throughout the province and
                    along the line of railway.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The province is
                    divided into three counties, viz., King’s, Queen’s, and Prince, which are
                    subdivided into sixty-seven townships and three royalties. The population is of
                    mixed origin, a large proportion being emigrants from Great Britain, and the
                    remainder natives of the country, descendants of the French Acadians, Scottish,
                    English, and Irish settlers, and the loyalists who went to the island after the
                    American revolution. The Indians number 281. In 1881 the population was 108,891
                    (54,729 males and 54,162 females). The Roman Catholic diocese is situated at
                    Charlottetown, and authority over the spiritual affairs of the Episcopalians is
                    exercised by the bishop of Nova Scotia. The following table shows the chief

                <p>The chief towns are Charlottetown (11,485), the capital of the island and the
                    county town of Queen’s, Summerside (2853), capital of Prince county, and
                    Georgetown (1118), capital of King’s county. Princetown is a flourishing seaport
                    on Richmond Bay, and Rustico, famous for its bathing facilities, is a place of
                    popular summer resort. Tignish and Alberton are stations much frequented by
                    fishermen, and Souris, 60 miles east of Charlottetown, well furnished with
                    harbour accommodation, is the outlet for the exports of the greater part of
                    King’s county. Other rising villages are Mount Stewart, Kensington, Montague,
                    Breadalbane, and Crapaud.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration, Finance, &lt;tc.—</hi> The affairs of the
                    province are administered by a lieutenant-governor and an executive council
                    consisting of nine members, three with portfolios and six without, assisted by a
                    legislative council of thirteen members and a legislative assembly of thirty
                    members, both elective. The lieutenant-governor is appointed by the
                    governor-general of Canada in council. A system of responsible government has
                    existed in the island since 1851. Prince Edward Island returns six members to
                    the Canadian House of Commons, and four senators are appointed to the Canadian
                    Senate by the crown. All males owning a freehold or leasehold property to the
                    value of $400, or partly freehold and partly leasehold amounting together to
                    $400, and in possession of the same for at least twelve months previous to

                <p>In 1882 the public revenue was $233,464 and the expenditure $257,228. The chief
                    source of revenue is the yearly subsidy granted by the Dominion Government under
                    the terms of the British North America Act. In 1883 it amounted to $164,674. The
                    remainder of the receipts is derived from the sale of Government lands,
                    licences, and miscellaneous fees. The provincial legislature meets at
                    Charlottetown, where the public offices are situated. The judiciary consists of
                    a supreme court with one chief and two assistant judges; a court of chancery, of
                    which the lieutenant-governor is <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> chancellor,
                    and the judicial powers of which are exercised by a master of the rolls and
                    vice-chancellor; a court of marriage and divorce, of which the
                    lieutenant-governor and members of the executive council are judges; a court of
                    vice-admiralty with one judge and two deputies; a court of probate and wills
                    with one judge; three county courts with one judge for each; and stipendiary
                    magistrates and justices of the peace. The province has authority to make its
                    own civil laws, but in all criminal cases the form employed in the courts is the
                    criminal law of the Dominion. Prince Edward Island is the twelfth military
                    district in the militia of Canada. The established strength of the active force,
                    by arms, is composed of three batteries of garrison artillery, one company of
                    engineers, and ten companies of infantry,—total, 54 officers and 608
                    non-commissioned officers and men. The period of service in time of peace is
                    three years.</p>

                    island since 1852. Previous to that date the schools were mainly supported by
                    voluntary subscription and such local assistance as could be obtained. In 1877
                    the Public Schools Act—an ample and liberal measure—was passed, and a department
                    of education was instituted. Two years later ladies were admitted to Prince of
                    Wales College, an institution established in 1860, and amalgamated in 1879 with
                    the normal school, and since then the department has introduced many
                    improvements into the system. The total number of teachers in 1883 was 473, of
                    school districts 419, and of schools 424. The number of pupils enrolled was
                    21,495, and the average daily attendance was 11,759. The total expenditure for
                    education was, by the provincial Government $101,193, by the school districts
                    $35,624, total $136,817. The Bible is read in all public schools. Besides the
                    institutions named there are St Dunstan’s College (exceedingly well conducted,
                    and Roman Catholic in religion), a model school, thirteen high schools, and
                    several private schools and academies. The local government maintains a hospital
                    for the care of the insane, and the marine hospital is under the control of the
                    Dominion authorities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Sebastian Cabot is said to have discovered this
                    island in 1497, but the authority on which this statement rests is at least
                    doubtful. Certain it is that Jacques Cartier had the credit of naming it Isle St
                    Jean when he discovered it on 24th June 1534 during one of his voyages up the St
                    Lawrence. That name clung to it for 265 years. Champlain, early in the next
                    century, took possession of it for France, and in 1663 a giant was made of it to
                    Captain Doublet, an officer in the army, who, however, failing to make
                    settlements in the colony, soon afterwards lost his grant. Little attention was
                    paid to the island until after the peace of Utrecht, when the French, allured by
                    its fertility, made efforts to colonize it. In 1719 it was granted, <hi
                    rend="italic">en seigneurie,</hi> to the count of St Pierre, who tried to
                    establish fisheries and a trading company. He lavished considerable means on his
                    enterprise, but the scheme proved unsuccessful and his grant was revoked. In
                    1755 the island was captured by the British, but after the treaty of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle it was restored to France, from which it was again wrested in
                    1758. It was afterwards placed under the administration of Nova Scotia, and some
                    years later it was erected into a separate government. The first parliament was
                    called together in 1773, and a constitution was given to the colony. In November
                    1798 the legislature passed an Act changing the name of the province to Prince
                    Edward Island, out of compliment to the duke of Kent, who was at that time
                    commander of the forces in British North America. In February 1799 the Act was
                    confirmed by the king in council.</p>
                <p>After the peace of 1763 a plan was agreed to by which the island was divided into
                    townships of about 20,000 acres each. Grants of these lands were made to
                    individuals supposed to have claims on the Government. They were to pay a small
                    sum as quit rents, and the conditions imposed provided for the establishment of
                    churches and wharves, and <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> settlement. The
                    grantees, however, were in most cases mere speculators, who had no mind to brave
                    the trials of colonization in a new country. Many promptly disposed of their
                    “lots,” and the lands fell into the hands of a large number of non-residents.
                    The land question remained a vexed point of contention until 1860, when the
                    Government was compelled to appoint a commission to appraise the rights of the
                    absentee owners, and to formulate a scheme of adjustment. The commission advised
                    the Government to buy the lands and resell them to the tenantry. A Bill for that
                    purpose was passed, but the imperial authorities disallowed it. A second attempt
                    proved more successful, and a measure, having the same object in view, was
                    agreed to. The agitation was silenced, and the tenants eagerly availed
                    themselves of their privileges. At the close of 1882, out of the 843,981 acres
                    of land acquired by the Government, only 142,011 acres remained to be disposed
                    of. Of that amount about 75,000 acres represented land held by parties who had
                    not yet purchased.</p>
                <p>Prince Edward Island declined to accept the Act of Confederation in 1867, but in
                    July 1873 it entered the union of American colonies which constitute the
