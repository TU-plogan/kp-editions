                    and with Seekonk River on its eastern boundary. A nearly circular sheet of water
                    known as the Cove lies in the heart of the city at the junction of river and
                    estuaries. The total area of Providence is 14’76 square miles. On the east side
                    the ground rises to a <pb break="no"

                    is much more of level surface, to 75 feet; but both the sides and summits of the
                    hills are occupied by dwelling-houses. To the south lies the Roger Williams Park
                    (102 acres), bequeathed to the city in 1871 by Betsy Williams, a descendant of
                    the founder of Providence. The best known of all the public institutions is
                    Brown University, whose spacious buildings (University Hall, Manning Hall, Hope
                    College, Rhode Island Hall, Sayles Memorial Hall, Slater Hall, &lt;fcc.) crown
                    the heights on the east side of the river. Originally founded at Warren in 1764
                    as Rhode Island College, it was removed to Providence in 1770, but did not
                    obtain its present name (bestowed in honour of Nicholas Brown, one of its
                    principal benefactors) till 1804. By the terms of its charter 30 out of the 48
                    members of its board of fellows and board of trustees must be Baptists, but the
                    management is unsectarian. In 1884 there were 20 professors and instructors, and
                    248 students. The library, kept in a fire-proof building, numbers 62,000
                    volumes. Besides the university, the city contains two high-schools, the
                    Friends’ Yearly-Meeting Boarding-School (1819), the Roman Catholic Academy of
                    the Sacred Heart of Jesus (1873), the Athenaeum (1836) with a library of over
                    43,000 volumes, the Providence Public Library with nearly 32,000 volumes, the
                    Rhode Island Historical Society (1822, present building 1844), the Franklin
                    Society (1823) for the furtherance of the natural sciences and mechanic arts,
                    and many other educational institutions. The Butler Hospital for the insane
                    (1844-47), which takes its name from Cyrus Butler, the principal subscriber,
                    occupies several handsome buildings on the west bank of Seekonk river, capable
                    of accommodating about 200 patients and possessing 140 acres of ground. Dexter
                    Asylum (1827) for the poor, with 39 acres, the bequest of Mr Ebenezer Knight
                    Dexter, receives about 125 inmates; and the Rhode Island Hospital (1863-68),
                    erected at a cost of $450,000, has about 80 patients. Other institutions of a
                    benevolent character are a home for aged men, a home for aged women, a Roman
                    Catholic orphan asylum (1860), and dispensaries. The State prison and county
                    jail used to stand on the north side of the Cove; but the State prison, the
                    workhouse, the house of correction, the almshouse, and the State hospital for
                    the insane are now clustered together at the State farm in Cranston, about 3
                    miles from the city line. The State house, which dates from 1762, is a plain
                    brick building; but the city-hall, erected about 1878-79, at a cost of more than
                    $1,000,000, is one of the finest buildings of its kind in New England. In front
                    of it is a soldiers’ and sailors’ monument designed by Randolph Rogers and
                    erected (1871) by the State in memory of 1741 citizens who fell in the civil
                    war. Worthy of note also are the county court-house (1877), the Providence
                    opera-house (1871), the Butler Exchange (1872), the arcade (1828), which runs
                    225 feet between Westminster and Weybosset Street, with a width of 80 feet.
                    Among the principal churches are a new cathedral (1878-85), St Stephen’s
                    Episcopal, the First Baptist, erected in 1775, and St Joseph’s and St Mary’s
                    Roman Catholic. At one time Providence carried on a good trade with China and
                    the East Indies; but its shipping interests, though still considerable,<note

                    altogether it has become rather a manufacturing than a commercial centre. In the
                    production of gold jewellery it is one of the leading cities in the United
                    States, and the Gorham silver factory alone employs 560 workmen. Cotton, wool,
                    and iron are all worked up on the most extensive scale into a vast variety of
                    forms—</p>
                <p>yarn, calico, braids, laces, broad-cloth, worsteds, steam-engines, rifles, sewing
                    machines, boilers, screws, hinges, &amp;c. Among the larger companies are the
                    Providence Tool Company (1500 workmen), the Corliss steam-engine works, the
                    Providence Steam-engine Company, the Allen Fire Department Supply Company, Perry
                    Davis’s pain-killer manufactory, &amp;c. Altogether there are about one hundred
                    cotton mills and sixty wool mills. In 1880 the value of the cotton products was
                    $2,250,273, of the wool products and worsted goods $7,139,947, and of the iron
                    castings, machinery, &amp;c., $4,757,401. The growth of the city in population
                    is shown by the following figures :—</p>

                <p>Providence was founded and named by Koger Williams the religious reformer, who,
                    having been expelled from Massachusetts in 1636, landed first at What Cheer Rock
                    near the mouth of Seekonk river and settled some time after at the head of
                    Providence river, where he obtained a grant of ground from the Sachem Canonicus.
                    The town united with others in applying for and receiving a charter from the
                    Parliamentary Government in 1643-44. It was partially burned in King Philip’s
                    war in 1675. In 1788 De Warville describes it as decayed. A south-easterly storm
                    in September 1815 raised the water in the harbour 12 feet above the usual
                    spring-tide level and did great damage. The city charter dates from 1832. (W. E.
                    F.)</p>
