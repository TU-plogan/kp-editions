                    he, in accordance with a suggestion of the physicians, volunteered to lie in bed
                    with him, that the heat of his body might check and expel the disease. This
                    remarkable act of self-sacrifice secured him throughout life the special
                    friendship of the prince, and by his prudence and ability, no less than by his
                    devotedness, he fully justified the confidence that was placed in him. In 1677
                    he was sent by the prince to England to solicit the hand of the princess Mary,
                    eldest daughter of James, then duke of York. At the Revolution he was the chief
                    medium of communication between the prince and the English nobility, and in the
                    delicate negotiations his practical shrewdness greatly facilitated the arrival
                    at a proper understanding. After superintending the arrangements in connexion
                    with the prince’s expedition, he accompanied him to England, and was made groom
                    of the stole, privy purse, first gentleman of the royal bedchamber, and first
                    commissioner on the list of privy councillors. On 9th April 1689 he was created
                    Baron Cirencester, Viscount Woodstock, and earl of Portland. With the rank of
                    lieutenant-general he distinguished himself in command of the Dutch cavalry at
                    the battle of the Boyne in 1690, and he was also present at the battle of Landen
                    in 1693, and at the siege of Namur in 1695. Along with marshal de Bouflers he
                    prepared the terms of the peace of Ryswick in 1697, and shortly afterwards was
                    appointed ambassador-extraordinary to Paris. Notwithstanding his diplomatic
                    skill, his grave and cold manner rendered him unpopular with the English
                    nobility, and his brusque honesty caused him to be sometimes wanting in outward
                    respect to the king. Gradually his influence at the court was supplanted by that
                    of the earl of Albemarle, who was more skilled in the arts of popularity; and in
                    1700, notwithstanding the efforts of the king to soothe his wounded vanity, he
                    resigned his offices and retired to his seat at Bulstrode, Bucks, where he
                    occupied his leisure in gardening and in works of charity. For receiving grants
                    of land in Ireland, and for his share in the partition treaty, he was impeached
                    by parliament, but the prosecution did not succeed. He died 23d November 1709,
                    and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
