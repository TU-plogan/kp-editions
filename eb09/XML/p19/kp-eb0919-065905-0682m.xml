                    generally admitted) to the group <hi rend="italic">Limicolae,</hi> being either
                    placed in the Family <hi rend="italic">Charadriidae</hi> or regarded as

                    Pratincoles, of which some eight or nine species have been described, are all
                    small birds, slenderly built and mostly delicately coloured, with a short stout
                    bill, a wide gape, long pointed wings, and a tail more or less forked. In some
                    of their habits they are thoroughly Plover-like, running very swiftly and
                    breeding on the ground, but on the wing they have much the appearance of
                    Swallows, and like them feed, at least partly, wlιile flying.<note

                    Linnaeus, even in his latest publication, placed it in the genus <hi

                    seems to have been induced to this change of view mainly through a specimen of
                    the bird sent to him by John the brother of Gilbert White; but the opinion <pb

                    had doubtless contributed thereto, though the earlier judgment to the same
                    effect of Brisson, as mentioned above, had been disregarded. Wa∣∣t of space here
                    forbids a notice of the different erroneous assignments of the form, some of
                    them made even by recent authors, who neglected the clear evidence afforded by
                    the internal structure of the Pratincole. It must suffice to state that
                    Sundevall in 1873 <hi rend="italic">(Tentamen,</hi> ρ. 86) placed <hi

                    >pratincola,</hi> breeds abundantly in many parts of Spain, Barbary, and Sicily,
                    along the valley of the Danube, and in Southern Russia, while owing to its great
                    powers of flight it frequently wanders far from its home, and more than a score
                    of examples have been recorded as occurring in the British Islands. In the
                    south-east of Europe a second and closely-allied species, <hi rend="italic">G.
                    nordmanni</hi> or <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi rend="italic">melanoptera,</hi>
                    which has black instead of chestnut inner wing-coverts, accompanies or, further
                    to the eastward, replaces it; and in its turn it is replaced in India, China,
                    and Australia by <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi rend="italic">orientalis.</hi>
                    Australia also possesses another species, <hi rend="italic">G. grailaria,</hi>
                    remarkable for the great length of its wings and much longer legs, while its
                    tail is scarcely forked—peculiarities that have led to its being considered the
                    type of a distinct genus or subgenus <hi rend="italic">Stiltia.</hi> Two
                    species, <hi rend="italic">G. lactea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cinerea,</hi> from India and Africa respectively, seem by their
                    pale coloration to be desert forms, and they are the smallest of this curious
                    little group. The species whose mode of nidification is known lay either two or
                    three eggs, stone-coloured, blotched, spotted, and streaked with black or
                    brownish-grey. The young when hatched are clothed in down and are able to run at
                    once— just as are young Plovers. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
