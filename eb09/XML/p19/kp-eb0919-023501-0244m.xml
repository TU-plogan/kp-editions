                <p><label type="entry">PLUTO</label>, the god of the dead in Greek mythology. His
                    oldest name was Hades (‘Atifys, Άιδτ/ς, ’Αδτ/ç), “the Unseen”; the name Pluto
                    (∏λoυτωv) was given him as the bestower of the riches (τrλovτoς) of the mine,
                    and in ordinary language it ousted the dread name of Hades, which was, however,
                    retained in poetry. He was the son of Cronus and Rhea, and brother of Zeus and
                    Poseidon. Having deposed Cronus, the brothers cast lots for the kingdoms of the
                    heaven, the sea, and the infernal regions, and Pluto obtained the infernal
                    regions, which from their ruler were afterwards known as Hades. The “house of
                    Hades” was a dark and dreadful abode deep down in the earth. How literally the
                    god was supposed to dwell underground is shown by the method of invoking him,
                    which was by rapping on the ground to attract his attention. According to
                    another view the realm of Hades was in a land beyond the ocean in the far west,
                    which to the Greek was always the region of darkness and death, as the east of
                    light and life. This is the view of Hades presented in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey.</hi> Ulysses sails all day with a north wind, and at sunset reaches a
                    land at the limits of ocean. Here, wrapped in mist and cloud, dwell the
                    Cimmerians, who never see the sun. He lands, and moving along the shore he calls
                    the ghosts of the departed to meet him. In the description of the Cimmerians we
                    have perhaps a traveller’s tale of the long dark winters of the north. Besides
                    this gloomy region, we find in another passage of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey</hi> (iv. 561 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> a picture of Elysium, a happy
                    land at the ends of the earth, where rain and snow fall not, but the cool west
                    wind blows and men live at ease. After Homer this happy land, the abode of the
                    good after death, was known as the Islands of the Blest, and these in later
                    times were identified with Madeira and the Canary Islands.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The conception of the land of the dead,
                    whether in the far west or beneath the earth, might be paralleled from the
                    beliefs of many savage tribes. The Samoan Islanders unite the two conceptions:
                    the entrance to their spirit-land is at the westernmost point of the westernmost
                    island, where the ghosts descend by two holes into the under-world. Long ago the
                    inhabitants of the French coast of the English Channel believed that the souls
                    of the dead were ferried across to Britain, and there are still traces of this
                    belief in the folk-lore of Brittany (Tylor, <hi rend="italic">Primitive
                    Culture,</hi> ii. p. 64; Grimm, <hi rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mythologie,</hi> ii, p. 694). In classical mythology the underground Hades
                    prevailed over the western. It was an Etruscan custom at the foundation of a
                    city to dig a deep hole in the earth, and close it with a stone; on three days
                    in the year this stone was removed, and the ghosts were then supposed to ascend
                    from the lower world. In Asia Minor caves filled with mephitic vapours or
                    containing hot springs were known as Plutonia or Charonia. The most famous
                    entrances to the under-world were at Taenarum in Laconia, and at the Lake Avemus
                    in Italy.</p></note> But in the oldest Greek mythology the “house of Hades” was
                    a place neither of reward nor punishment; it was simply the home of the dead,
                    good and bad alike, who led a dim and shadowy reflexion of life on earth. The
                    differentiation of this “home of Hades” into a heaven and a hell was the result
                    of progressive thought and morality. Pluto was himself simply the ruler of the
                    dead; in no sense was he a tempter and seducer of mankind like the devil of
                    Christian theology. Indeed the very conception of a devil, as a principle of
                    evil in continual conflict with God or the principle of good, is totally foreign
                    to Greek mythology, as it was also to Indian and Teutonic mythology. Pluto was
                    certainly depicted as <pb break="no"

                    discharge of his duty as custodian of the dead. But even Pluto once melted at
                    the music of Orpheus when he came to fetch from the dead his wife Eurydice. The
                    cap of Hades, like the <hi rend="italic">Nebelkappe</hi> of German mythology,
                    rendered its wearer invisible; as a sort of thick cloud it was the reverse of
                    the nimbus or halo of the heavenly gods. While the victims sacrificed to the
                    latter were white, those offered to Pluto were black. His wife was Proserpine
                    (Persephone), daughter of Demeter (Ceres), whom he carried off as she was
                    gathering flowers at Enna in Sicily. Like the Greeks, the ancient Italians
                    believed that the souls of the dead dwelt underground; in Latin the names for
                    the god of the dead are Orcus and Father Dis, but the Greek name Pluto also
                    frequently occurs. But, while Orcus was rather the actual slayer, the angel of
                    death, Father Dis was the ruler of the dead, and thus corresponded to Pluto.
                    Their names also correspond, Dis being a contraction for Dives, “wealthy.” The
                    Etruscan god of death was represented as a savage old man with wings and a
                    hammer; at the gladiatorial games of Rome a man masked after this fashion used
                    to remove the corpses from the arena. In Romanesque folklore Orcus has passed
                    into a forest-elf, a black, hairy, man-eating monster, upon whose house children
                    lost in the woods are apt to stumble, and who sometimes shows himself kindly and
                    helpful. He is the Italian <hi rend="italic">or co,</hi> the Spanish <hi
