                <p><label type="entry">POLECAT</label>. This name is applied to one of the English
                    members of the large Family <hi rend="italic">Mustelidae,</hi> which contains
                    besides the Martens, Weasels, Otters, and Badgers (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> vol. XV. p. 439, and the separate articles under these
                    names).</p>
                <p>In this family the Polecats, while belonging, with the stoats, weasels, and many
                    others, to the nearly cosmopolitan genus <hi rend="italic">Putorius,</hi> form
                    by themselves a small group confined to the northern hemisphere, and consisting
                    of four species, of which the best known and most widely distributed, is the
                    common polecat of Europe <hi rend="italic">{Putorius</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >foetidus).</hi> This animal, at least so far as its disposition, size, and
                    proportions are concerned, is well known in its domesticated condition as the
                    ferret, which is but a tamed albino variety of the true polecat. The colour of
                    the latter, however, instead of the familiar yellowish white of the ferret is of
                    a dark brown tint above, and black below, the face being variegated with dark
                    brown and white <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n347/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0347-0332"/> markings. Its skull is rough, strongly ridged,
                    and altogether of a far more powerful type than those of the stoats, weasels, or
                    martens; the skull of the female is very much smaller and lighter than that of
                    the male. Its fur is long, coarse, and of comparatively small value, and changes
                    its colour very little, if at all, at the different seasons of the year.</p>
                <p>The distribution and habits of the common polecat have been well described by
                    Blasius in his <hi rend="italic">Säugethiere Deutschlands,</hi> and the
                    following is an abstract of his account. The polecat ranges over the greater
                    part of Europe, reaching northwards into southern Sweden, and in Russia to the
                    region of the White Sea. It does not occur in the extreme south, but is common
                    everywhere throughout central Europe. In the Alps it ranges far above the
                    tree-line during the summer, but retreats in winter to lower ground. In fine
                    weather it lives either in the open air, in holes, fox-earths, rabbit-warrens,
                    under rocks, or in woodstacks; while in winter it seeks the protection of
                    deserted buildings, barns, or stables. During the day it sleeps in its hiding
                    place, sallying forth at night to plunder dovecots and hen-houses. It climbs but
                    little, and shows far less activity than the marten. It feeds ordinarily on
                    small mammals, such as rabbits, hamsters, rats, and mice, on such birds as it
                    can catch, especially poultry and pigeons, and also on snakes, lizards, frogs,
                    fish, and eggs. Its prey is devoured only in its lair, but, even though it can
                    carry away but a single victim, it commonly kills everything that comes in its
                    way, often destroying all the inhabitants of a hen-house in order to gratify its
                    passion for slaughter. The pairing time is towards the end of the winter, and
                    the young, from three to eight in number, are born in April or May, after a
                    period of gestation of about two months. The young, if taken early, may be
                    easily trained, like ferrets, for rabbit-catching. The polecat is very tenacious
                    of life and will bear many severe wounds before succumbing; it is also said to
                    receive with impunity the bite of the adder. Its fetid smell has become
                    proverbial. To this it is indebted for its generic name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Putorius</hi> (derived, as are also the low Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >putacius,</hi> the French <hi rend="italic">putois,</hi> and the Italian <hi
                    rend="italic">puzzola,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">puteo),</hi> as well as the
                    designation <hi rend="italic">foumart (i.e.</hi> foul marten), and its other
                    English names <hi rend="italic">fitchet, fitchew.</hi> Attempts to account for
                    the first syllable of the word <hi rend="italic">polecat</hi> rest entirely on
                    conjecture.</p>
                <p>The other species of the polecat group are the following</p>
                <p>The Siberian Polecat <hi rend="italic">(Putorius eυersmanni),</hi> very like the
                    European in size, colour, and proportions, but with head and back both nearly or
                    quite white, and skull more heavily built and sharply constricted behind the
                    orbits, at least in fully adult individuals. It inhabits the greater part of
                    south-western Siberia, extending from Tibet into the steppes of south-eastern
                    European Russia.</p>
                <p>The Black-footed or American Polecat <hi rend="italic">(Putorius nigripes),</hi>
                    a native of the central plateau of the United States, and extending southwards
                    into Texas. It is very closely allied to the last species, hut has nevertheless
                    been made the type of a special sub-genus named <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynomyonax,</hi> or “King of the Prairie Marmots,” a name which expresses its
                    habit of living in the burrows of, and feeding upon, the curious prairie marmots
                    <hi rend="italic">(Cynomys}</hi> of the United.States. An excellent account of
                    this species may be found in Dr Elliott Coues’s <hi rend="italic">Fur-bearing
                    Animals of North America.</hi></p>
                <p>Lastly, the Mottled Polecat <hi rend="italic">{Putorius sarmaticus),</hi> a rare
                    and peculiar species occurring in southern Russia and south-western Asia,
                    extending from eastern Poland to Afghanistan. It differs from the other polecats
                    both by its smaller size and its remarkable coloration, the whole of its upper
                    parts being marbled with large irregular reddish spots on a white ground, and
                    its underside, limbs, and tail being deep shining black. Its habits, which seem
                    to be very much those of the common polecat, have been studied in Kandahar by
                    Captain Thomas Hutton, who has given a vivid description of them in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</hi> for 1843.</p>
