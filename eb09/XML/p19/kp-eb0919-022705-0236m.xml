                    French <hi rend="italic">Plovier,</hi> which doubtless has its origin in the
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">pluvia,</hi> rain (as witness the German equivalent <hi
                    rend="italic">Regenpfeifer,</hi> Rain-fifer); but the connexion of ideas between
                    the words therein involved, so that the former should have become a bird’s name,
                    is doubtful. Belon (1555) says that the name <hi rend="italic">Pluvier</hi> is
                    bestowed “pour ce qu’on le prend mieux en temps pluvieux qu’ en nulle autre
                    saison,” which is not in accordance with modern observation, for in rainy
                    weather Plovers are wilder and harder to approach than in fine. Others have
                    thought it is from the spotted (as though with rain-drops) upper plumage of two
                    of the commonest species of Plovers, to which the name especially belongs—the
                    <hi rend="italic">Charadrius</hi><hi rend="italic">pluvialis</hi> of Linnaeus,
                    or Golden Plover, and the <hi rend="italic">Squatarola helvetica</hi> of recent
                    ornithologists, or Grey Plover. Both these birds are very similar in general
                    appearance, but the latter is the larger and has an aborted hind-toe on each
                    foot.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>But for this
                    really unimportant distinction both birds could doubtless have been kept by
                    ornithologists in the same genus, for they agree in most other structural
                    characters. As it is they have long been sundered.</p></note><hi

                    Golden Plover they are pure white, and this difference often affords a ready
                    means of distinguishing the two species when on the wing, even at a considerable
                    distance. The Grey Plover is a bird of almost circumpolar range, breeding in the
                    far north of America, Asia, and eastern Europe, frequenting in spring and autumn
                    the coasts of the more temperate parts of each continent, and generally retiring
                    further southward in winter—examples <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">pluvialis</hi> has a much narrower distribution, though where it
                    occurs it is much more numerous as a species. Its breeding quarters do not
                    extend further than from Iceland to western Siberia, but include the more
                    elevated tracts in the British Islands, whence in autumn it spreads itself,
                    often in immense flocks, over the cultivated districts if the fields be
                    sufficiently open. Here some will remain so long as the absence of frost or snow
                    permits, but the majority make for the Mediterranean basin, or the countries
                    beyond, in which to winter; and, as with the Grey Plover, stragglers find their
                    way to the southern extremity of Africa. The same may be said, <hi rend="italic"
                    >mutatis</hi><hi rend="italic">mutandis,</hi> of what are usually deemed to be
                    two other cognate forms, <hi rend="italic">C. virginicus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">fulvus,</hi> which respectively represent
                    <hi rend="italic">C. pluvialis</hi> in America and eastern Asia, where they are
                    also known by the same English name. The discrimination of these two birds from
                    one another requires a very acute eye, and room is here wanting in which to
                    specify the minute points in which they differ;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Schlegel <hi rend="italic">{Mus.

                    examples it seems impossible to determine the form to which they belong; but
                    ordinarily American specimens are rather larger and stouter, and have shorter
                    toes than those from Asia.</p></note> bat both are easily distinguished from
                    their European ally by their smaller size, their greyish-brown axillary
                    feathers, and their proportionally longer and more slender legs. All,
                    however,—and the same is the case with the Grey Plover, —undergo precisely the
                    same seasonal change of colour, greatly altering their appearance and equally
                    affecting both sexes. In the course of spring or early summer nearly the whole
                    of the lower plumage from the chin to the vent, which during winter has been
                    nearly pure white, becomes deep black. This is partly due to the growth of new
                    feathers, but partly to some of the old feathers actually changing their colour,
                    though the way in which the alteration is brought about is still uncertain.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is much to be regretted
                    that ornithologists favourably situated in regard to zoological gardens have not
                    more extensively used opportunities which might thus be accorded to them of
                    conducting useful observations on this subject and others of similar kind.
                    Elsewhere it would be hardly possible to carry on such an investigation, and
                    even under the best circumstances it would not be easy and would require
                    unremitting attention. The results of some partial observations superintended by
                    Yarrell in the gardens of the Zoological Society of London are given in its <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions</hi> (i. pp. 13-19). Little has been done there since
                    of this nature.</p></note> A corresponding alteration is at the same season
                    observable in the upper plumage; but this seems chiefly due (as in many other
                    birds) to the shedding of the lighter-coloured margins of the feathers, and does
                    not produce so complete a transformation of appearance, though the beauty of the
                    wearer is thereby greatly increased.</p>
                <p>Though the birds just spoken of are those most emphatically entitled to be called
                    Plovers, the group of Ringed Plovers before mentioned <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Killdeer,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 76) and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lapwing</hi>
                    (vol. xiv. p. 308), with its allies, have, according to usage, hardly less claim
                    to the name, which is also extended to some other more distant forms that can
                    here have only the briefest notice. Among them one of the most remarkable is the
                    “Zickzack” (so called from its cry)—the τροχίλος of Herodotus (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Humming-Bird,</hi> vol. xii. p. 358, n. 3), the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pluvianus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hyas eegyptius</hi> of
                    ornithologists, celebrated for the services it is said to render to the
                    crocodile—a small bird whose plumage of delicate lavender and cream-colour is
                    relieved by markings of black and white. This probably belongs to the small
                    section generally known as Coursers, <hi rend="italic">Cursorius,</hi> of which
                    some eight or ten species inhabit the deserts of Africa and India, while one,
                    <hi rend="italic">C. gallicus,</hi> occasionally strays to Europe and even to
                    England. Allied to them are the curious <hi rend="smallcaps">Pratincoles
                    (⅛.v.),</hi> also peculiar to the Old World, while the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thinocoris</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Attagis</hi> form an outlying group
                    peculiar to South America, that is by some systematists regarded as a separate
                    Family <hi rend="italic">Thinocoridee,</hi> near which are often placed the
                    singular <hi rend="smallcaps">Sheath bills</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.).</hi> By

                    form that has been bandied about from one Family and even Order to
                    another—should possibly find its resting-place. It frequents the sandy shores of
                    the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal from Natal to Aden, and thence to Ceylon, the
                    Malabar coast, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,—a white and black bird,
                    mounted on long legs, with webbed feet, and a bill so shaped as to have made
                    some of the best ornithologists lodge it among the <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>Though the various forms here spoken of as Plovers are almost certainly closely
                    allied, they must be regarded as constituting a very indefinite group, for
                    hardly any strong line of demarcation can be drawn between them and the <hi
