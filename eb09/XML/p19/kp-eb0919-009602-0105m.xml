                    rend="italic">ductor),</hi> a pelagic fish of the family of Horse-Mackerels,
                    well known to sailors from its peculiar habit of keeping company with ships and
                    large fishes, especially sharks. It occurs in all tropical and sub-tropical
                    seas, and is common in the Mediterranean, but becomes scarcer in higher
                    latitudes. In summer pilots will follow ships as far north as the south coast of
                    England into port, where they are generally speedily caught. This habit was
                    known to the ancients, who describe the <hi rend="italic">Pompilus</hi> as a
                    fish which points out the way to dubious or embarrassed sailors, and by its
                    sudden disappearance indicates to them the vicinity of land; the ancient seamen
                    of the Mediterranean regarded it therefore as a sacred fish. That the pilot
                    follows sharks is an observation of much later date, which first appears in
                    works of travel of the 17th century, the writers asserting that the shark never
                    seizes the pilot-fish, and that the latter is of great use to its big companion
                    in conducting it and showing it the way to its food. It is, however, extremely
                    doubtful whether the pilot’s connexion with a shark serves a more special
                    purpose than its temporary attachment to a ship. It accompanies both on account
                    of the supply of food which it derives from them, picking up the crustaceans,
                    cirripeds, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n106/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0106-0097"/> or other marine animals swarming about the ship’s
                    bottom or parasitic on the shark, offal thrown overboard, or smaller pieces of
                    flesh which are left unnoticed by the shark when it tears its prey. The pilot,
                    therefore, stands to both in the relation of a so-called “commensal,” like the
                    <hi rend="italic">Echeneis</hi> or sucking-fish, whose habits are in some
                    respects identical with those of the pilot, and which is frequently found
                    associated with it. All observers, however, agree that neither the pilot nor the
                    sucker is ever attacked by the shark. The pilot attains to a length of about 12
                    inches. In the shape of its body it resembles a mackerel, but is rather shorter,
                    especially in the head, and covered with small scales. A sharp keel runs along
                    the middle of each side of the tail. The first dorsal fin consists of a few
                    short spines not connected by a membrane; the second dorsal and the anal are
                    composed of numerous rays. The teeth, which occupy the jaws, vomer, and palatine
                    bones, are all small, in villiform bands. The coloration of the pilot renders it
                    conspicuous at a distance; on a bluish groundcolour from five to seven dark-blue
                    or violet cross-bands traverse the body from the back to the belly. The
                    pilot-fish spawns in the open sea, and its fry is constantly caught in the
                    tow-net. But young pilot-fish differ considerably from the adult, having the
                    spines of the first dorsal connected by a membrane, and some bones of the head
                    armed with projecting spines. These little fishes were therefore long considered
                    to be a distinct genus, <hi rend="italic">Nauclerus.</hi></p>
