                    being a natural thorn, such as is still often seen fastening the dresses of
                    peasant women in upper Egypt. Pins of bronze, and bronze brooches in which the
                    pin is the essential feature, are of common occurrence among the remains of the
                    bronze age. Brooches and pins on which considerable artistic ingenuity was
                    lavished were universally used among the civilized nations of antiquity (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Brooch,</hi> vol. iv. p. 369). The ordinary domestic pin had
                    become in the 15th century an article of sufficient importance in England to
                    warrant legislative notice, as in 1483 the importation of pins was prohibited by
                    statute. In 1540 Queen Catherine received pins from France, and again in 1543 an
                    Act was passed providing that “no person shall put to sale any pinnes but only
                    such as shall be double headed, and have the heads soldered fast to the shank of
                    the pinnes, well smoothed, the shank well shapen, the points well and round
                    filed, canted, and sharpened.” At that time pins of good quality were made of
                    brass; but a large proportion of those against which the legislative enactment
                    was directed were made of iron wire blanched and passed as brass pins. To a
                    large extent the supply of pins in England was received from France till about
                    1626, in which year the manufacture was introduced into Gloucestershire by John
                    Tilsby. His business flourished so well that he soon gave employment to 1500
                    persons, and Stroud pins attained a high reputation. In 1636 the pinmakers of
                    London formed a corporation, and the manufacture was subsequently established at
                    Bristol and Birmingham, the latter town ultimately becoming the principal centre
                    of the industry. So early as 1775 the attention of the enterprising colonists in
                    Carolina was drawn to the manufacture by the offer of prizes for the first
                    native-made pins and needles. At a later date several <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0107-0098"/> pin-making machines were invented in the United
                    States. During the war of 1812, when the price of pins rose enormously, the
                    manufacture was actually started, but the industry was not fairly successful
                    till about the year 1836. Previous to this an American, Mr Lemuel W. Wright of
                    Massachusetts, had in 1824 secured in England a patent for a pin-making machine,
                    which established the industry on its present basis.</p>
                <p>The old form of pin, which has become obsolete only within the memory of
                    middle-aged persons, consisted of a shank with a separate head of fine wire
                    twisteα round and secured to it. The formation and attachment of this head were
                    the principal points to which inventive ingenuity was directed. The old method
                    of heading involved numerous operations, which had to be expeditiously
                    accomplished, and, notwithstanding the expertness of the workers, the result was
                    frequently unsatisfactory. Fine wire for heads was first wound on a lathe round
                    a spit the exact circumference of the pin shanks to be headed. In this way a
                    long elastic spiral was produced which had next to be cut into heads, each
                    consisting of two complete turns of the spiral. These heads were softened by
                    annealing and made into a heap for the heading boy, whose duty was to thrust a
                    number of shanks into the heap and let as many as might be fit themselves with
                    heads. Such shanks as came out thus headed were passed to the header, who with a
                    falling block and die arrangement compressed together shank and head of such a
                    number as his die-block was fitted for. All the other operations of
                    straightening the wire, cutting, pointing, &amp;c., were separately performed,
                    and these numerous details connected with the production of a common pin were
                    seized on by Adam Smith as one of the most remarkable illustrations of the
                    advantages of the division of labour.</p>
                <p>The beautiful automatic machinery by which pins are now made of single pieces of
                    wire is an invention of the present century. In 1817 a communication was made at
                    the Patent Office by Seth Hunt, describing a machine for making pins with “head,
                    shaft, and point in one entire piece.” By this machine a suitable length of wire
                    was cut off and held in a die till a globular head was formed on one end by
                    compression, and the other end was pointed by the revolution around it of a
                    roughened steel wheel. This machine does not appear to have come into use; but
                    in 1824 Wright patented the pin-making apparatus above referred to as the parent
                    form of the machinery now employed. An extension for five years, from 1838, of
                    Wright’s patent, with certain additions and improvements, was secured by Henry
                    Shuttleworth and Daniel Foote Tayler, and in the hands of Tayler's firm in
                    Birmingham the development of the machine has principally taken place. In a
                    pin-making machine as now used wire of suitable gauge running off a reel is
                    drawn in and straightened by passing between straightening pins or studs set in
                    a table. When a pin length has entered it is caught by lateral. jaws, beyond
                    which enough of the end projects to form a pin-head. Against this end a steel
                    punch advances and compresses the metal by a die arrangement into the form of a
                    head. The pin length is immediately cut off and the headed piece drops into a
                    slit sufficiently wide to pass the wire through but retain the head. The pins
                    are consequently suspended by the head while their projecting points are held
                    against a revolving file-cut steel roller, along the face of which they are
                    carried by gravitation till they fall out at the extremity well-pointed pins.
                    The pins are next purified by boiling in weak beer; and, so cleaned, they are
                    arranged in a copper pan in layers alternating with layers of grained tin. The
                    contents of the pan are covered with water over which a quantity of argol
                    bitartrate of potash) is sprinkled, and after boiling for several hours the
                    brass pins are coated with a thin deposit of tin, which gives them their silvery
                    appearance. They are then washed in clean water and dried by revolving in a
                    barrel, mixed with dry bran or fine sawdust, from which they are winnowed
                    finished pins.</p>
                <p>A large projιortion of the pins sold are stuck into paper by an automatic machine
                    not less ingenious than the pin-making machine itself. Mourning pins are made of
                    iron wire, finished by immersing in black japan and drying in a stove. A
                    considerable variety of pins, including the ingeniously coiled, bent, and
                    twisted nursery safety pin, ladies <hi rend="superscript"> y</hi> hair pins,
                    &amp;c., are also made by automatic machinery. The sizes of ordinary pins range
                    from the 3⅜-inch stout blanket pin down to the finest slender gilt pins used by
                    entomologists, 4500 of which weigh about an ounce. A few years ago it was
                    estimated that in the United Kingdom there were made daily 50,000,000 pins, of
                    which 37,000,000 were produced in Birmingham, and the weight of brass and iron
                    wire then annually consumed was stated at 1275⅜ tons, of which one-eighth part
                    was iron wire. The annual value of the whole British trade was stated at
                    £222,000. At the same time the consumption of wire in pin-making in the United
                    States was estimated to be from 350 to 500 tons per annum, the value of the
                    trade being £112,000. (J. PA.)</p>
