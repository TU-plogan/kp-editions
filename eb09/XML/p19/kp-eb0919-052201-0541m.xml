                    San Onofrio and the Poveri di Gesu Cristo he trained the finest voices of the
                    age. Farinelli—the greatest singer who ever lived—Caffarelli, Mingotti,
                    Salimbeni, and other celebrated vocalists owed all they ever knew to his
                    teaching. Still his numerous engagements did not tempt him to forsake
                    composition. In 1725 he visited Vienna, but the emperor Charles VI. disliked his
                    florid style, especially his constant use of the <hi rend="italic">trillo,</hi>
                    and refused to patronize him. After this rebuff he settled in Venice, teaching
                    regularly in the schools of La Pietà and the Incurabili. In 1728 he removed to
                    Dresden, where he was received with great cordiality by the electoral princess
                    Maria. In 1729 he was invited to London as a rival to Handel; but his visit was
                    an unfortunate one. Little less disastrous was his second visit to England in
                    1734, when even the presence of his pupil, the great Farinelli, failed to save
                    the dramatic company known as the “Opera of the Nobility” from ruin. In order to
                    fulfil his English engagement he procured a release from that previously
                    contracted in Dresden; but he finally quitted London in 1736, and again settled
                    in Venice. There he remained until 1745, when he returned to Vienna in the suite
                    of the Venetian ambassador, giving lessons in 1754 to the young Joseph Haydn,
                    and returning in 1759 to his birthplace, Naples. From this time Porpora’s career
                    was a series of misfortunes. His last opera, <hi rend="italic">Camilla,</hi>
                    failed; and he became so miserably poor that the expenses of his funeral were
                    paid by subscription. Yet at the moment of his death (1767) Farinelli and
                    Caffarelli were living in princely splendour on fortunes for which they were
                    indebted to the excellence of the old maestro’s teaching.</p>
                <p>Porpora was a learned scholar, an accomplished linguist, and a genial wit. Some
                    excellent stories are told in illustration of this last-named characteristic.
                    His compositions are masterly and brilliant, but less remarkable for depth of
                    feeling than for technical display. The style of his oratorios and cantatas is
                    far more elevated than that of his numerous operas.</p>
