                    twenty-second year (54 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) he impeached
                    unsuccessfully C. Cato, who in his tribunate (56) had acted as the tool of the
                    triumvirs. In the civil war between Caesar and Pompey, Pollio sided with Caesar,
                    and after the successful campaigns against the remnants of the Pompeian party in
                    Africa and Spain he was raised to the praetorship, and received the command of
                    the war in Spain against Sextus Pompeius. At the time of Caesar’s assassination
                    (March 15, 44) Pollio was in Spain. He was defeated by Sextus Pompeius and fled
                    for his life. But by Lepidus’s influence a peace was patched up and Sextus left
                    Spain, while Pollio remained with three legions under him. During the war
                    between Mark Antony and the senate, Pollio, in a letter to Cicero, declared
                    himself on the side of the senate, but found pretexts for waiting to cast in his
                    lot with the victor. In fact no sooner had Octavian become reconciled to Antony
                    and Lepidus, and compelled the senate to rescind the decrees against them, than
                    Pollio joined Lepidus with two legions. Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian now formed
                    the triumvirate (43), and Pollio was nominated consul for the year 40 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Meantime he was entrusted by Antony with the
                    administration of Gallia Transpadana, and in superintending the distribution of
                    the Mantuan territory amongst the veterans he used his influence to save from
                    confiscation the property of the poet Virgil. When L. Antonius, brother of Mark
                    Antony, revolted against Octavian and was besieged in Perusia (41-40), he
                    entreated Pollio to hasten to his relief. Pollio advanced hesitatingly, but was
                    fain to take refuge in Ravenna when Octavian marched to meet him. After the fall
                    of Perusia Octavian and Antony were reconciled for a time by the peace of
                    Brundisium, which Pollio helped to negotiate. He was now consul (40); Virgil’s
                    famous fourth eclogue is addressed to him in his consulship. Next year Pollio
                    was sent by Antony against the Parthini, an Illyrian people who adhered to
                    Brutus. He was successful, took the town of Salonae, and celebrated a triumph in
                    the same year. The eighth eclogue of Virgil is addressed to Pollio while engaged
                    in this campaign. From the spoils of the war he constructed the first public
                    library at Rome.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    library was in the Atrium Libertatis, which was also erected by Pollio (Isidor.,
                    <hi rend="italic">Orig.,</hi> vi. 5; Sueton., <hi rend="italic">Aug.,</hi> 29;
                    Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Trist.,</hi> iii. 1, 71). The situation of this Atrium
                    is uncertain. There was an older Atrium Libertatis near the Forum (Cic. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ad Att.,</hi> iv. 16, 8), but we are precluded from identifying it
                    with that of Pollio by the language of Isidore and Suetonius, who imply that
                    Pollio built a new Atrium. Perhaps Pollio’s Atrium was connected with the temple
                    of Liberty on the Aventine (Livy, xxiv. 16); this would be strongly confirmed by
                    Martial (xii. 3, 6), if we could be sure that his “domus alta Remi” referred to
                    the Aventine. Mr A. W. Verrall <hi rend="italic">{Studies in Horace,</hi> p.
                    113) has made it probable that Dion Cassius (xlix. 43) confused the Pollian with
                    the Octavian library, and that accordingly 33 B. C. is the date of the
                    dedication of the former library and not of the latter, which we know from
                    Plutarch <hi rend="italic">{Marc.,</hi> 30) to have been dedicated not earlier
                    than 23 B. o., the date of Marcellus’s death. But Mr VerralΓs conjecture that
                    “in the great reconstructions of Augustus” the Pollian library was absorbed in
                    the Octavian seems negatived by Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Trist.,</hi> iii. 1,
                    69-72, where “atria” certainly refers to the Pollian library, and “templa—vicino
                    juncta theatro,” probably refers to the Octavian library, which was in the
                    Porticus Octa vise, adjoining the twin temples of Jupiter and Juno, and close to
                    the theatre of Marcellus (see Burn, <hi rend="italic">Rome and the
                    Campagna,</hi> p. 306 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> Pliny (Λ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">H.,</hi> xxxvi. 24) also refers to
                    “Pollionis Asini monumenta” as being distinct from the Porticus Octaviae.
                    Moreover, there is no evidence that the two libraries were even near each other;
                    if the Pollian was on the Aventine, they were separated by nearly the whole
                    breadth of the city.</p></note> Thenceforward Pollio withdrew from active life
                    and devoted himself to literature. When Octavian invited him to join in the war
                    against Antony which ended in the battle of Actium, Pollio declined on the score
                    of his former friendship with Antony. He seems to have maintained to a certain
                    degree an attitude of independence if not of opposition towards Augustus. He
                    lived to a green old age, and died in his villa at Tusculum in 4 <hi

                <p>Pollio was a distinguished orator; his speeches showed ingenuity and care, but
                    were marred by an affected archaism which rendered them somewhat crabbed and
                    harsh. He wrote tragedies also, which Virgil declared to be worthy of Sophocles,
                    and a prose history of the civil Avars of his time from the first triumvirate
                    (60 B.C.) down <pb break="no"

                    >b.c.</hi>) or perhaps to the battle of Philippi (42 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> or even later. This history, in the composition of which Pollio
                    received assistance from the grammarian Ateius, was used as an authority by
                    Plutarch and Appian. As a literary critic Pollio was very severe. He censured
                    Sallust and Cicero and professed to detect in Livy’s style certain
                    provincialisms of his native Padua; he attacked the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentaries</hi> of Julius Caesar, accusing their author of carelessness and
                    credulity if not of deliberate falsification. Horace addressed one of his odes
                    (ii. 1) to Pollio on the subject of his history. Pollio was the first Roman
                    author who recited his writings to an audience of his friends, a practice which
                    afterwards grew very common at Rome. All his writings are lost except a few
                    fragments of his speeches (collected by Meyer, <hi rend="italic">Orat. Rom.
                    Frag. ),</hi> and three letters addressed to Cicero (Cic., <hi rend="italic">Ad
