                <p><label type="entry">PIUS VI</label>. (Giovanni Angelo Braschi), pope from 1775 to
                    1799, was born at Cesena, December 27, 1717. After taking the degree of doctor
                    of laws in 1735, he went to Ferrara and became the private secretary of Cardinal
                    Ruffo, in whose bishopric of Ostia and Velletri he held the post of <hi
                    rend="italic">uditore</hi> until 1753. His skill in the conduct of a mission to
                    the court of Naples won him the esteem of Benedict XIV. who appointed him one of
                    his secretaries and canon of St Peter’s. In 1758 he was raised to the prelature
                    and then to the treasurership of the apostolic chamber by Clement XIII., whose
                    successor, Clement XIV. created him cardinal on the 26th April 1773. On the
                    death of Clement XIV. and after protracted debate, Braschi was elected to the
                    vacant see on the 15th February 1775. His assumption of the title Pius VI. even
                    then recalled to the populace the verse current in the pontificate of Alexander
                    VI. “Semper sub Sextis perdita Roma fuit,” though his earlier acts gave fair
                    promise of liberal rule and reform in the defective administration of the papal
                    states. He showed discrimination in his benevolences, reprimanded Potenziani,
                    the governor of Rome, for unsuppressed disorders, appointed a council of
                    cardinals to remedy the state of the finances and relieve the pressure of
                    imposts, called to account Nicolo Bischi for the expenditure of moneys intended
                    for the purchase of grain, reduced the annual disbursements by the suppression
                    of several pensions, and adopted a system of bounties for the encouragement of
                    agriculture. The circumstances of his election, however, involved him in
                    difficulties from the outset of his pontificate. He had received the support of
                    the ministers of the crowns and the anti-Jesuit party upon a tacit understanding
                    that he would continue the action of Clement, by whose brief <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dominus ac Redemptor</hi> (1773) the dissolution of the Society of Jesus had
                    been pronounced. On the other hand the <hi rend="italic">zelanti,</hi> who
                    believed him secretly inclined towards Jesuitism, expected from him some
                    reparation for the alleged wrongs of the previous reign. As the result of these
                    complications, Pius was betrayed into a series of half measures which gave
                    little satisfaction to either party. The case of Ricci and the other Jesuits
                    imprisoned in the castle of St Angelo had scarcely been settled, by formal
                    discountenance but informal relaxations and final release, before the question
                    became an international one. Driven from devout Catholic countries, the members
                    of the condemned society found an asylum under the rule of the heretic Frederick
                    II. and the schismatic Catherine II., who welcomed them upon educational
                    grounds. A long correspondence ensued in which both monarchs maintained their
                    right, Catherine carrying the matter still further and wresting from Pius a
                    series of important concessions. Even in countries acknowledging the papal
                    authority practical protests arose which tended to its limitation. In Austria
                    the social and ecclesiastical reforms undertaken by Joseph II. and his minister
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n164/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0164-0155"/> Kaunitz touched the supremacy of Rome so nearly
                    that in the hope of staying them Pius adopted the exceptional course of visiting
                    Vienna in person. He left Rome on the 27th February 1782, and was magnificently
                    received by the emperor, but his mission was unattended by any marked success.
                    In Naples difficulties necessitating certain concessions in respect of feudal
                    homage were raised by the minister Tannucci, and more serious disagreements
                    arose with Leopold I. and Ricci, bishop of Pistoia and Prato, upon questions of
                    reform in Tuscany. The outbreak of the French Revolution followed, and Pius in
                    vain endeavoured to preserve the ecclesiastical discipline and property. The old
                    Gallican Church was suppressed; the pontifical and ecclesiastical possessions in
                    France were confiscated; and an effigy of himself was burnt by the populace at
                    the Palais Royal. The murder of the Republican agent, Hugo Basseville, in the
                    streets of Rome (January 1793) gave new ground of offence; the papal court was
                    charged with complicity by the French Convention; and Pius threw in his lot with
                    the league against France. In 1796 Napoleon invaded Italy, defeated the papal
                    troops, and occupied Ancona and Loreto. Pius sued for peace, which was granted
                    at Tolentino on the 19th February 1797; but on the 28th December of that year,
                    in a riot created by some Italian and French revolutionists, General Duphot of
                    the French embassy was killed and β, new pretext furnished for invasion. General
                    Berthier marched to Rome, entered it unopposed on February 10, 1798, and,
                    proclaiming it a republic, demanded of the pope the renunciation of his temporal
                    authority. Upon his refusal he was taken prisoner, and on February 20th was
                    escorted from the Vatican to Siena, and thence from place to place—in succession
                    to Florence, Parma, Piacenza, Turin, Grenoble, and Valence, where he died six
                    weeks later, on the night of the 28th August 1799. Pius VII. succeeded him.</p>
                <p>The name of Pius VI. is associated with many and often unpopular attempts to
                    revive the splendour of Leo X. in the promotion of art and public works,—the
                    words “Munificentia Pii VI. P.Μ.,” graven in all parts of the city, giving rise
                    amongst his impoverished subjects to such satire as the insertion of a minute
                    loaf in the hands of Pasquin with that inscription beneath it. He is best
                    remembered in connexion with the establishment of the museum of the Vatican,
                    commenced at his suggestion by his predecessor, and with the attempt to drain
                    the Pontine Marshes. In the latter undertaking large sums were expended to such
                    small purpose that the phrase “Sono andate alie paludi Pontine” passed into a
                    proverb applied to funds employed in extravagant projects. The chief result was
                    the restoration of the Appian Way by the removal of the additions of Trajan and
                    Theodoric with later accumulations, and the erection of a new viaduct to
                    Terracina upon the original road of Appius Claudius.</p>
