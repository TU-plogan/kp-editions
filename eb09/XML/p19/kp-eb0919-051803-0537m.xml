                <p><label type="entry">PORCUPINE</label>. This word, derived from the French <hi
                    rend="italic">porc-épic,</hi> or “spiny pig,” is applied to the members of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Hystric(dae,</hi> a family of rodents whose most prominent
                    peculiarity is their covering of long stout spines, which form a highly
                    efficient protection against enemies, and which are better developed in this
                    family than in any other mammal. Zoologically the porcupines are allied to the
                    cavies, chinchillas, agoutis, &lt;kc., and with them form the great section <hi
                    rend="italic">Hystricomorpha</hi> or porcupine-like rodents (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> vol. xv. p. 420).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">IIystricidix</hi> are readily divisible into two
                    subfamilies according to their geographical distribution, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hystricina</hi> or True Porcupines being confined to the Old World, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Synetherina</hi> to the New. The <hi rend="italic">Hystricina</hi>
                    are distinguished by their semi-rooted molars, imperfect collar-bones, cleft
                    upper lips, rudimentary pollices, smooth soles, six mammae, and by many
                    important cranial characters. They range over the south of Europe, the whole of
                    Africa, India, and the Malay Archipelago as far eastwards as Borneo. They are
                    all stout heavily-built animals, with blunt rounded heads, fleshy mobile snouts,
                    and coats of thick cylindrical or flattened spines, which form the whole
                    covering of their body, and are not intermingled with ordinary hairs. Their
                    habits are strictly terrestrial. Of the three genera in this section, the first
                    and best-known is <hi rend="italic">Hystrix,</hi> characterized by its curiously
                    inflated skull, in which the nasal chamber is often considerably larger than the
                    brain-case, and by its short tail, tipped with numerous slender stalked open
                    quills, which make a loud rattling noise whenever the animal moves. Its
                    longest-known member is the Common Porcupine (ZZ. <hi rend="italic"
                    >cristata),</hi> which occurs throughout the south of Europe and North and West
                    Africa, but is replaced in South Africa by <hi rend="italic">H. africae-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">australis,</hi> and in India by the Hairy-nosed Porcupine <hi
                    rend="italic">(H. leucura),</hi> whose habits are described in the following
                    notice extracted from Jerdon’s <hi rend="italic">Mammals of India.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Hystrix</hi><hi rend="italic">leucura</hi>
                    is found over a great part of India, from the lower ranges of the Himalayas to
                    the extreme south, but does not occur in lower Bengal, where it is replaced by
                    <hi rend="italic">H. bengalensis.</hi> It forms extensive burrows, often in
                    societies, in the sides of hills, banks of rivers and nullahs, and very often in
                    the bunds of tanks, and in old mud walls, &amp;c. &amp;c. In some parts of the
                    country they are very destructive to various crops, potatoes, carrots, and other
                    vegetables. They never issue forth till after dark, but now and then one will be
                    found returning to his lair in daylight Dogs take up the scent of the porcupine
                    very keenly, and on the Nilghiris I have killed many by the aid of dogs,
                    tracking them to their dens. They charge backwards at their foes, erecting their
                    spines at the same time, and dogs generally get seriously injured by their
                    strong spines, which are sometimes driven deeply into the assailant. The
                    porcupine is not bad eating,—the meat, which is white, tasting something between
                    pork and veal.”</p>
                <p>Besides the three large crested species of <hi rend="italic">Hystrix</hi>
                    above-mentioned, there are some four or five smaller species without nuchal
                    crests occurring in north-east India and in the Malay region, from Nepal to
                    Borneo. The second genus of Old-World porcupines is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atherura,</hi> the Brushtailed Porcupines, much smaller animals than the last,
                    with long tails tipped with bundles of peculiar flattened spines. Of the three
                    species two are found in the Malay region and one in West Africa. <hi
                    rend="italic">Trichys,</hi> the last genus, contains but one Bornean species,
                    <hi rend="italic">T. lipura,</hi> externally very like an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atherura,</hi> but differing from the members of that genus in many important
                    cranial characteristics.</p>
                <p>The New-World porcupines, the <hi rend="italic">Synetherina,</hi> have rooted
                    molars, complete collar-bones, uncleft upper lips, tuberculated soles, no trace
                    of a pollex, and four mammae only. Their spines are to a great extent mixed with
                    long soft hairs; they are less strictly nocturnal in their habits; and, with one
                    exception, they live entirely in trees, having in correspondence with this long
                    and powerful prehensile tails. They consist of three genera, of which the first
                    is formed by the common Canadian Porcupine <hi rend="italic">(Erethizon
                    dorsatus),</hi> a stout heavily-built animal, with long hairs almost or quite
                    hiding its spines, four anterior and five posterior toes, and a short stumpy
                    tail. It is a native of the greater part of Canada and the United States,
                    where-ever there is any remnant of the original forest left. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Synetheres,</hi> the second genus, contains some eight or ten species, known as
                    Tree Porcupines, and found throughout the tropical parts of South America, one
                    of them extending northwards into Mexico. They are of a lighter build than the
                    ground porcupines, are covered with short, close, many-coloured spines often
                    mixed with hairs, and their tails are always prehensile. Their hind feet have
                    only four toes, owing to the suppression of the hallux, but instead they have a
                    peculiar fleshy pad on the inner side of the foot, <pb break="no"

                <p>between which and the toes boughs and other objects can be firmly grasped as with
                    a hand. The last genus is <hi rend="italic">Chaetomys,</hi> distinguished by the
                    shape of its skull and the greater complexity of its teeth. It contains only one
                    species, <hi rend="italic">C. subspinosus,</hi> a native of the hottest parts of
                    Brazil.</p>
