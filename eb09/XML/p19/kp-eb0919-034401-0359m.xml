                    plenipotentiary of Louis XIV. to the congress of Utrecht. During the regency he
                    became involved in the Cellamare plot, and was relegated to Flanders for three
                    years. From 1725 to 1732 he acted for France at the Vatican. In <pb break="no"

                    he died at Paris in 1742. He left unfinished a metrical refutation of Lucretius
                    which was published after his death by the Abbé de Rothelin <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anti-Lucretius,</hi> 1745), and had considerable vogue in its day. Count <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Jules de Polignac</hi> (ob. 1817), grand-nephew of the
                    preceding, was created duke by Louis XVI. in 1780, and in 1782 was made
                    postmastergeneral. His position and influence at court were largely due to his
                    wife, the bosom friend of Marie Antoinette; the duke and duchess alike shared
                    the unpopularity of the court, and were among the first who were compelled to
                    “emigrate” in 1789. The duchess died shortly after the queen, but her husband,
                    who had received an estate from Catherine II. in the Ukraine, survived till
                    1817. Of their three sons the second, Prince <hi rend="smallcaps">Jules de
                    Polignac</hi> (1780- 1847), held various offices after the restoration of the
                    Bourbons, received from the pope his title of “prince” in 1820, and in 1823 was
                    made ambassador to the court of St James’s. In August 8, 1829, he was called by
                    Charles X. to the ministry of foreign affairs, and in the following November he
                    became president of the council. On the revolution of July 1830 he fled for his
                    life, but after wandering for some time among the wilds of Normandy was arrested
                    at Granville. His trial before the chamber of peers resulted in his condemnation
                    to perpetual imprisonment (at Ham), but he benefited by the amnesty of 1836,
                    when the sentence was commuted to one of exile. During his captivity he wrote
                    <hi rend="italic">Considérations politiques</hi> (1832). He afterwards spent
                    some years in England, but finally was permitted to reenter France on condition
                    that he did not take up his abode in Paris. He died at St Germain on March 29,
                    1847.</p>
