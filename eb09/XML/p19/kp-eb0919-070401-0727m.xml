                <p><label type="entry">PRESCRIPTION</label> in the broadest sense of the word
                    denotes the acquisition or extinction of rights by lapse of time. The term is
                    derived from the <hi rend="italic">praescriptio</hi> of Roman law, originally a
                    matter of procedure, a clause inserted before the <hi rend="italic">formula</hi>
                    on behalf of either the plaintiff or, in early times, the defendant, limiting
                    the question at issue. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Pleading.)</hi> It was so
                    called from its preceding the <hi rend="italic">formula.</hi><note

                    appellatas esse ab eo quod ante formulas praescribuntur” (Gaius, iv. §
                    132).</p></note> One of the defendant’s <hi rend="italic">praescriptiones</hi>
                    was <hi rend="italic">longi</hi><hi rend="italic">temporis</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">longae possessionis praescriptio</hi> (afterwards superseded by
                    the <hi rend="italic">exceptio),</hi> limiting the question to the fact of
                    possession without interruption by the defendant for a certain time (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Possession).</hi> It seems to have been introduced by the
                    praetor to meet cases affecting aliens or lands out of Italy where the <hi
                    rend="italic">usucapio</hi> of the civil law (the original means of curing a
                    defect of title by lapse of time) could not apply. The time of acquisition by
                    <hi rend="italic">usucapio</hi> was fixed by the Twelve Tables at one year for
                    movables and two years for immovables. <hi rend="italic">Praescriptio</hi> thus
                    constituted a kind of praetorian <hi rend="italic">usucapio.</hi> In the time of
                    Justinian <hi rend="italic">usucapio</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >praescriptio</hi> (called also <hi rend="italic">longi temporis
                    possessio),</hi> as far as they affected the acquisition of ownership, differed
                    only in name, <hi rend="italic">usucapio</hi> being looked at from the point of
                    view of property, <hi rend="italic">praescriptio</hi> from the point of view of
                    pleading. By the legislation of Justinian movables were acquired by three years’
                    possession, immovables by ten years’ possession where the parties had their
                    domicile in the same province <hi rend="italic">(inter jrraesentes),</hi> twenty
                    years’ possession where they were domiciled in different provinces <hi
                    rend="italic">(inter</hi><hi rend="italic">absentes).</hi> Servitudes could not
                    be acquired by <hi rend="italic">usucapio</hi> proper, but were said to be
                    acquired by <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi><hi rend="italic">usucapio,</hi>
                    probably in the same time as sufficed to give a title to immovables. There was
                    also a <hi rend="italic">longissimi temporis possessio</hi> of thirty years,
                    applicable to both movables and immovables, and requiring nothing but <hi
                    rend="italic">bona</hi><hi rend="italic">fides</hi> on the part of the
                    possessor. Where the right sought to be established was claimed against the
                    church, a still longer period of forty years (at one time a hundred) was
                    necessary. Immemorial prescription was required in a few cases of a public
                    character, as roads.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“Viae vicinales, quarum memoria non extat” <hi rend="italic">(Dig.,</hi>
                    xliii. 7, 3).</p></note><hi rend="italic">Praescriptio</hi> was also the term
                    applied to lapse of time as barring actions upon contracts or torts under
                    various provisions corresponding to the English Statutes of Limitation. The
                    prescription of Roman law (and of modern systems based upon it) is thus both
                    acquisitive and extinctive. It looks either to the length of time during which
                    the defendant has been in possession, or to the length of time during which the
                    plaintiff has been out of possession. In English law the latter kind of
                    prescription is called <hi rend="smallcaps">Limitation</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.).</hi> The tendency of law is to substitute a definite for an indefinite
                    period of prescription.</p>
                <p>In English law prescription is used in a comparatively narrow sense. It is
                    acquisitive only, and is very limited in its application. A title by
                    prescription can be made only to incorporeal hereditaments—that is, in legal
                    language, hereditaments that are or have been appendant or appurtenant to
                    corporeal hereditaments—and to certain exemptions and privileges.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prescription seems at one
                    time to have borne a wider meaning. A claim by prescription to land is mentioned
                    in 32 Hen. VIII. c. 2. And it seems that tenants in common may still make title
                    to land by prescription (Littleton’s <hi rend="italic">Tenures,</hi> §
                    310).</p></note> The rights claimable by prescription for the most part consist
                    of rights <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">alieno</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">solo.</hi> The most important are advowsons, tithes, commons,
                    ways, watercourses, lights, offices, dignities, franchises, pensions, annuities,
                    and rents. Land or movables cannot be claimed by prescription. The foundation of
                    prescription is the presumption of law that a person found in undisturbed
                    enjoyment of a right did not come into possession by an unlawful act (see
                    Williams, <hi rend="italic">Rights of Common,</hi> 3). In the English courts
                    this presumption was, perhaps it may be said still is, based upon the fiction of
                    a lost grant, viz., that at some time in the past there had been a grant of the
                    hereditament by a person capable of granting it to a person capable of taking
                    it, and that the grant had been lost. The jury were instructed to find the loss
                    of a once existing grant in whose existence no one really believed. The
                    enjoyment of the right must have been from a time whereof the memory of man
                    runneth not to the contrary. The period of legal memory was after a time
                    necessarily fixed for purposes of convenience at a certain date. The date
                    adopted varied at first with the time during which the demandant in a writ of
                    right must have proved seisin in himself or his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n728/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0728-0705"/> ancestors. After one or two previous enactments
                    the date was finally fixed by the Statute of Westminster the First (3 Edw. I. c.
                    39) at the reign of Richard I., which was interpreted to mean the first year of
                    the reign of Richard I. The inconvenience of this remote date, as time went on,
                    led to the gradual growth of a rule of evidence that proof of enjoyment for
                    twenty years was <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi>
                    evidence of enjoyment from time immemorial. But evidence of the beginning of the
                    enjoyment at however remote a date, if subsequent to 1 Rie. I., was sufficient
                    to destroy the claim. This is still the law with respect to claims not falling
                    within the Prescription Act, mostly rights in gross, —that is, where there is no
                    dominant or servient tenement, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a right to a pew or
                    to a several fishery in gross. The twenty years’ rule was of comparatively late
                    introduction; it does not seem to have been known in the time of Elizabeth, and
                    was perhaps introduced in analogy to the Statute of Limitations, 21 Jac. I. c.
                    16. With respect to claims of profits <hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >prendre</hi> and easements a change was made by the Prescription Act, 2 and 3
                    Will. IV. c. 71 (extended to Ireland by 21 and 22 Vict. c. 42, but not to
                    Scotland). By that Act claims to rights of common and other profits <hi
                    rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">prendre</hi> are not to be defeated after
                    thirty years’ enjoyment by any person claiming right thereto without
                    interruption for thirty years by showing only the commencement of the right, and
                    after sixty years’ enjoyment the right is absolute and indefeasible unless had
                    by consent or agreement by deed or writing (§ 1). In claims of rights of way or
                    other easements the periods are twenty years and forty years respectively (§ 2).
                    The right to access and use of light is absolute and indefeasible by twenty
                    years’ enjoyment Λvithout interruption unless by consent or agreement by deed or
                    writing (§ 3). The before-mentioned periods are to be deemed those next before
                    suits, and nothing is to be deemed to be an interruption unless acquiesced in
                    for one year (§ 4). In pleading, the enjoyment as of right may be alleged during
                    the period mentioned in the Act, and without claiming in the name or right of
                    the owner of the fee (§ 5). No presumption is to be made in favour of a right
                    exercised for a less period (§ 6). The time during which a person otherwise
                    capable of resisting a claim is an infant, idiot, <hi rend="italic">non compos
                    mentis, feme covert,</hi> or tenant for life, or during which an action or suit
                    has been pending until abated by the death of a party, is to be excluded in the
                    computation of the periods unless where the right or claim is declared to be
                    absolute and indefeasible (§ 7). In the period of forty years a term of life or
                    more than three years is to be excluded in case the claim be resisted by the
                    reversioner· within three years after the determination of the term (§ 8). An
                    Act to define the period of prescription for a <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">decimandi,</hi> or an exemption from tithes by composition, was
                    passed the same year (2 and 3 Will. IV. c. 100; see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tithes).</hi> The Prescription Act is only supplemental to the common law, so
                    that a claim may be based upon the Act or, in the alternative, upon the common
                    law. Nor does the Act alter the conditions necessary at common law for a good
                    claim by prescription. The claim under the statute must be one which may be
                    lawfully made at common law. The principal rules upon the subject are these. (1)
                    The title is founded upon actual usage. The amount of actual usage and the
                    evidence necessary to prove it vary according to the kind of claim. For
                    instance, in continuous easements (such as a watercourse) the enjoyment may go
                    on without any active interference by the person claiming the right; in
                    discontinuous easements (such as a right of way) the right is only enjoyed at
                    intermittent periods. (2) The enjoyment must (except in the case of light) be as
                    of right, a rule sometimes expressed by the words <hi rend="italic">nec υi nee
                    clam nee</hi><hi rend="italic">precario,</hi> derived from Roman law,—that is to
                    say, peaceable, openly used, and not by licence. These words bear a meaning less
                    strict than they did in Roman law. The enjoyment in Roman law must (except in
                    the case of <hi rend="italic">jus aquae</hi><hi rend="italic">ducendae)</hi>
                    have been <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">justo titulo</hi> in order
                    to found <hi rend="italic">usucapio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">usucapio·,</hi> in English law there is no doubt that enjoyment
                    may be good by prescription, even though it began in trespass, as a footpath or
                    a rent. (3) The prescription must be certain and reasonable. Examples of claims
                    by prescription which have been held to be bad on this ground are a claim to
                    take out of the land of another as much clay as is required for making bricks at
                    a certain kiln, and a claim to a marriage fee which, though reasonable now,
                    would have been an unreasonable amount to have been paid in the reign of Richard
                    I., looking to the difference in the value of money. Inhabitants cannot claim by
                    prescription, as they are an uncertain and fluctuating body, unless under a
                    grant from the crown, which constitutes them a corporation for the purposes of
                    the grant. (4) The prescription must be alleged in a <hi rend="italic"
                    >que</hi><hi rend="italic">estate</hi> or in a man and his ancestors.
                    Prescription in a <hi rend="italic">que</hi><hi rend="italic">estate</hi> lies
                    at common law by reason of continuous and immemorial enjoyment by the claimant,
                    a person seised in fee, and all those whose estate he has <hi rend="italic"
                    >(toux ceux que</hi><hi rend="italic">estate</hi><hi rend="italic">il</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad).</hi> The Prescription Act fixes a definite period and does
                    away with the necessity which existed at common law of prescribing in the name
                    of the person seised in fee. Prescription in a man and his ancestors is not of
                    ordinary occurrence in practice. “I am not aware of more than two cases in
                    modern times,” says Mr Joshua Williams <hi rend="italic">(Rights of Common,</hi>
                    9), “where a prescription of this kind, viz., a prescription of enjoyment by a
                    man and his ancestors, irrespective of the possession of land, has been set up.”
                    Corporations, however, occasionally claim by a prescription analogous to this,
                    viz., in the corporation and its predecessors. Such claims by either a person or
                    a corporation are not within the Prescription Act, which applies only where
                    there are dominant and servient tenements. By 32 Hen. VIII. c. 2 no person can
                    make any prescription by the seisin or possession of his ancestor unless such
                    seisin or possession has been within threescore years next before such
                    prescription made. (5) A prescription cannot lie for a thing which cannot be
                    granted, as it rests upon the presumption of a lost grant. Thus a lord of a
                    manor cannot prescribe to raise a tax or toll upon strangers, for such a claim
                    could never have been good by any grant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prescription and Custom.—</hi> Prescription must be carefully
                    distinguished from custom. Prescription, as has been said, is either in a <hi
                    rend="italic">que</hi><hi rend="italic">estate</hi> or in a man and his
                    ancestors,—that is to say, it is a personal claim; custom is purely local,—that
                    is to say, it is a usage obtaining the force of law within a particular
                    district. In the time of Littleton the difference between prescription and
                    custom was not fully recognized (see Littleton’s <hi rend="italic">Tenures,</hi>
                    § 170), but the law as it exists at present had become established by the time
                    of Sir Edward Coke. “J. S. seised of the Mannor of D. in fee prescribeth thus;
                    That J. S. his ancestors and all those whose estate he hath in the said Mannor
                    have time out of mind of man had and used to have Common of pasture &lt;fcc. in
                    such a place &amp;c., being the land of some other &amp;c. as pertaining to the
                    said Mannor. This property we call a Prescription. A custome is in this manner;
                    A copyholder of the Mannor of D. doth plead that within the same Mannor there is
                    and hath been for time out of mind of man used, that all the Copyholders of the
                    said Mannor have had and used to have Common of pasture &amp;c. in such a waste
                    of the Lord, parcel of the said Mannor &lt;fcc.” <hi rend="italic">(Coke upon
                    Littleton,</hi> 113b). A custom must be certain, reasonable, and exercised as of
                    right. Like prescription at common law, it must have existed from time
                    immemorial. On this ground a custom <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n729/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0729-0706"/> to erect stalls at statute sessions for hiring
                    servants was held to be bad, because such sessions were introduced by the
                    Statute of Labourers, 23 Edw. III. st. 1 (Simpson <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Wells, <hi rend="italic">Law Reports,</hi> 7 Queen’s Bench, 214). Some rights
                    may be claimed by custom which cannot be claimed by prescription, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a right of inhabitants to dance on a village green, for
                    such a right is not connected with the enjoyment of land. On the other hand,
                    profits <hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">prendre</hi> can be claimed by
                    prescription but not by custom, unless in two or three exceptional cases, such
                    as rights of copyholders to common in the lord’s demesne, or to dig sand within
                    their tenements, rights to estovers in royal forests, and rights of tin-bounders
                    in Cornwall.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> The law of the United States (except in
                    Louisiana) is based upon that of England, but the period of enjoyment necessary
                    to found a title by prescription varies in the different States. An easement or
                    profit <hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">prendre</hi> is acquired by
                    twenty years’ enjoyment in most States, following the English common law rule.
                    In Michigan the term is twenty-five years, Pennsylvania twenty-one years,
                    Connecticut and Vermont fifteen years, South Carolina five years. In Louisiana
                    the period varies according to the subject from three to thirty years, and
                    property other than incorporeal hereditaments may be claimed by prescription as
                    in Roman law (see <hi rend="italic">Kent's Comm.,</hi> vol. iii. 442). In the
                    case of ancient lights the tendency of the decisions of many of the State courts
                    seems to have been against the English doctrine, that a prescriptive right to
                    light may be gained by mere enjoyment not necessarily under a claim of right
                    (<hi rend="italic">Washburn's Law of Real Property,</hi> vol. ii. 318).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">International law</hi> uses the term “prescription” in its
                    wider or Roman sense. “The general consent of mankind has established the
                    principle that long and uninterrupted possession by one nation excludes the
                    claim of every other” (Wheaton, <hi rend="italic">Int. Law,</hi> § 165).
                    Historic instances of rights which were at one time claimed and exercised by
                    prescription as against other nations are the sovereignty of Venice over the
                    Adriatic and of Great Britain over the Narrow Seas, and the right to the Sound
                    dues long exacted by Denmark. But such claims were rejected by the highest
                    authorities on international law (e.y., Grotius), on the ground that they were
                    defective both in <hi rend="italic">justus titulus</hi> and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >de facto</hi> possession. There is no special period fixed, as in municipal
                    law, for the acquirement of international rights by lapse of time. In private
                    international law prescription is treated as part of the <hi rend="italic">lex
                    fori</hi> or law of procedure. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Limitation.) (j.</hi>
                    wf.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.</hi> — In the law of Scotland “prescription” is a
                    term of wider meaning than in England, being used as including both^re- <hi
                    rend="italic">scription</hi> and <hi rend="italic">limitation</hi> of English
                    law. In its most general sense it may be described as the effect which the law
                    attaches to the lapse of time, and it involves the idea of possession held by
                    one person adverse to the rights of another. Though having its basis in the
                    common law, its operation was early defined by statute, and it is now in all
                    respects statutory. The most appropriate mode of treating the prescription of
                    Scotch law is to regard it (1) as a mode of acquiring rights—the positive
                    prescription; (2) as a mode of extinguishing rights—the negative prescription;
                    (3) as a mode of limiting rights of action—the shorter prescriptions. It must,
                    however, be observed with reference to this division that the distinction
                    between (1) and (2) is rather an accidental (due to a loose interpretation of
                    the language of the Act 1617, c. 12) than a logically accurate one. It is,
                    moreover, as will immediately be seen, strictly confined to heritable rights,
                    having no application in the case of movable property. But, though the
                    distinction has been complained of by the highest authority as tending to create
                    embarrassment in the law (see opinion of Lord Chancellor St Leonards in Dougall
                    <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Dundee Harbour Trustees, 1852, 24 <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jurist,</hi> 385), it is now too well settled to be departed from.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Positive Prescription.—</hi> The positive prescription was
                    introduced by the Act 1617, c. 12,—a statute which has been described by Lord
                    Kames as “the palladium of our land proprietors.” After setting forth in the
                    preamble the inconvenience resulting from the loss of titles and the danger of
                    forgery after the means of improbation are lost by the lapse of time, it enacts
                    that whatever heritages the lieges, their predecessors or authors, have
                    possessed by themselves or others in their names peaceably, in virtue of
                    infeftments for the space of forty years, continually and together, from the
                    date of their said infeftments, and without any lawful interruption during the
                    said space, they shall not be disturbed therein, provided they produce a written
                    title on which their possession has proceeded. Such written title must be either
                    a charter and sasine preceding the forty years, or, when no charter is extant,
                    instruments of sasine proceeding upon retours or precepts of <hi rend="italic"
                    >dare constat.</hi> Though the statute in its literal construction only applied
                    to such heritable subjects as had been conveyed by charter and sasine, it λvas
                    at an early date interpreted so as to include other heritable rights, as
                    servitudes, tacks, public rights of way, &amp;c., where no charter could be
                    supposed to exist. Thus forty years’ possession of a road by members of the
                    public is held to establish a right of way. And any member of the public who
                    uses or may have occasion to use the road is considered to have a good title to
                    plead prescription. Thus in the celebrated Glen Tilt case a path through Glen
                    Tilt was established as a right of way in an action at the instance of three
                    gentlemen, one of ιvhom was a residenter in Edinburgh and another in Aberdeen
                    (see Torrie <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Duke of Atholl, 1849, 12 Dunlop’s <hi
                    rend="italic">lieports,</hi> 328; affirmed in House of Lords, 1852, 1 Macqueen’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> 65). This valuable Act of 1617 was so well
                    framed that it continued to regulate the prescription of land rights till the
                    year 1874. By the Conveyancing Act of that year (37 and 38 Vict. c. 94, s. 34)
                    the period of prescription was shortened from forty years to twenty. It was
                    provided that possessions for twenty years upon “an <hi rend="italic">ex
                    facie</hi> valid irredeemable title recorded in the appropriate register of
                    sasines” should in future give the same right as forty years’ possession upon
                    charter and sasine under the earlier law. This Act of 1874 does not, however,
                    apply to all the cases which fell under the Act of 1617. Thus it has been
                    decided that twenty years’ possession on a charter of adjudication followed by
                    sasine and a declarator of expiry of the legal is insufficient to give an
                    unchallengeable right, an adjudication not being an <hi rend="italic"
                    >“exfacie</hi> irredeemable title.” (Hinton <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> ConneΓs
                    Trustees, 1883, 10 Rettie’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> p. 1110). It is
                    further specially provided by the Act of 1874 that the twenty years’
                    prescription is not to apply to servitudes, rights of way, and public rights
                    generally. The following rules apply to the positive prescription, (a) The
                    possession which is required for it must be peaceable, continuous (“continually
                    and together,” as the Act of 1617 has it), and uninterrupted. (ft) The
                    prescription runs <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">momento</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in momentum,</hi> (c) The person against whom the prescription
                    runs must be major and <hi rend="italic">sui juris,—</hi> a rule which, as
                    regards minority, was specially provided for by the Act of 1617, and as regards
                    other cases of incapacity by the application of the principles of the common
                    law. Under the Conveyancing Act, however, it is provided that in all cases where
                    the twenty years’ prescription applies, the lapse of thirty years is to exclude
                    any plea on the ground of minority or want of capacity.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Negative Prescription.—</hi> This prescription was
                    introduced by the Act 1469, c. 28, and re-enacted with some modification by
                    1474, c. 55. At first restricted to personal claims of debt, it was gradually
                    extended in practice and ultimately made applicable to heritable bonds and other
                    heritable rights by the above-mentioned Act of 1617. By the Act of 1469 it is
                    declared that the person having interest in an obligation must follow the same
                    within the space of forty years and take document thereupon, otherwise it shall
                    be prescribed. The negative prescription accordingly extinguishes <hi
                    rend="italic">in toto</hi> the right to demand performance of an obligation
                    after forty years, the years being reckoned from the day on which fulfilment of
                    the obligation can be first demanded. The lapse of this period of time creates a
                    conclusive presumption—one incapable of being redargued—that the debt or
                    obligation has been paid or fulfilled. But it must be kept in view that the
                    negative prescription does not <hi rend="italic">per se—</hi> without the
                    operation of the positive— establish a right to heritable property (Erskine, <hi
                    rend="italic">Inst.,</hi> b. iii. tit. 7, § 8). Thus, as has been observed, “If
                    A has possessed for a hundred years but was not infeft, any competitor who has
                    neglected his right for that time may completely establish it, if his right was
                    better than A’s” <hi rend="italic">{per</hi> Lord Corehouse, in Cubbison <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Hyslop, 183, 16 Shaw’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> p.
                    112). So a right of patronage has been held incapable of being lost by the
                    negative prescription; but, on the other hand, it is settled that servitudes and
                    public rights of way may be so extinguished. As regards the character of the
                    prescription, it is requisite, in the same way as in the case of the positive,
                    that the years shall have run continuously and without interruption, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> without any act done on the part of the creditor which
                    indicates his intention to keep alive the right. Such interruption may, for
                    instance, take place by the payment of interest on the debt, or citation of the
                    debtor in an action for the debt, or by a claim being lodged in the debtor’s
                    sequestration. In the same way as in the positive, the currency of the negative
                    prescription is suspended by the debtor being minor or <hi rend="italic"
                    >non</hi><hi rend="italic">valens agere.</hi></p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Shorter Prescriptions.—</hi> There are certain short
                    prescriptions recognized by Scotch law—corresponding to the limitations of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n730/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0730-0707"/> English law—which operate not as extinguishing
                    rights but as excluding the ordinary means of proving them. The following
                    require to be noticed, (a) Vicennial prescription. By the Act 1617, c. 13, a
                    vicennial prescription of retours was introduced, and in modern practice the
                    same prescription is applicable to an extract decree of service which has taken
                    the place of a retour (31 and 32 Vict. c. 101, § 37). This prescription protects
                    a person who has been served as heir for twenty years against action by any
                    other person claiming to be heir. By the Act 1669, c. 9, holograph missive
                    letters and bonds in comρt books also prescribe in twenty years. The debt,
                    however, is not in this case extinguished, as within forty years it may be
                    proved by the defender’s oath. (6) Decennial prescription. By the Act 1669, c.
                    9, all actions by minors against their tutors and curators, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> must be prosecuted within ten years from the
                    expiration of the guardianship (Erskine, <hi rend="italic">Inst.,</hi> iii. 7,
                    25). (c) Septennial prescription. By the Act 1695, c. 5, it is provided that no
                    person binding himself for and with another, conjunctly and severally, in any
                    bond or contract for sums of money shall be bound for more than seven years
                    after the date of the obligation. But it is necessary that the cautioner either
                    be bound expressly as such in the bond, &amp;c., or, if bound as co-principal,
                    that there be either a clause of relief in the bond or in a separate back bond
                    duly intimated (i.e., notarially or in some formal way) to the creditor. This
                    prescription does not apply to guarantees for the fulfilment of an office, or to
                    security for a bill of exchange, or to judicial bonds. (d) Sexennial
                    prescription. This prescription applies to bills and promissory notes, so as to
                    deprive them of their privileges. After the lapse of six years the holder of the
                    bill or note can no longer found on it except as an adminicle of evidence to
                    prove his debt. This prescription was first introduced by 12 Geo. III. c. 72.
                    (e) Quinquennial prescription applies to bargains concerning movables, such as
                    sales of goods, loans, deposits, &amp;c.—in short, to all mercantile
                    transactions except such as pass into current accounts and fall under the
                    triennial prescription noticed below. By the Act 1669, ç. 9, such bargains
                    prescribe in five years, and can thereafter only be proved by the debtor’s writ
                    or oath. The same statute also made ministers’ stipends, multures, and maills
                    and duties prescribe in five years unless proved by writ or oath. (∕) Triennial
                    prescription. This valuable prescription was introduced so far back as the year
                    1579. By the Act 1579, c. 83, it was provided that “actions of debt for house
                    maills, men’s ordinaries, servants’ fees, merchants’ accounts, and others the
                    like debts not founded on written obligations” shall prescribe in three years.
                    Under the terms “like debts” have been held to fall such debts as workmen’s
                    wages, law agents’ accounts, and rents due on verbal lease. All such debts must
                    be pursued within three years, otherwise they cannot be proved except by the
                    writ or oath of the party sued. The period from which this prescription begins
                    to run is the date of the last item in the account. With regard to all the minor
                    prescriptions it is to be observed generally that the respective periods of time
                    must have run without interruption, and that, except when the contrary is
                    expressed in the Act constituting the prescription, the years of minority and
                    <hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic">valentia agere</hi> are not taken
                    into account. (H. GO.)</p>
