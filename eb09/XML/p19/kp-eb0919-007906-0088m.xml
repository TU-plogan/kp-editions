                    he was at once elected. The fine condition of his regiment was soon remarked in
                    the army of the Rhine, to which it was attached, and his organizing ability was
                    made use of by an appointment on the staff, and finally by his promotion to the
                    rank of general of brigade. In 1793, when Dumouriez had deserted, and all
                    generals of noble birth had been superseded, Carnot and Saint Just were sent to
                    find <hi rend="italic">roturier</hi> generals who could be successful; Carnot
                    discovered Jourdan, and Saint Just discovered Hoche and Pichegru. In
                    co-operation with Hoche and the army of the Moselle, Pichegni, now general of
                    division and in command of the army of the Rhine, had to reconquer Alsace and
                    reorganize the disheartened troops of the republic. They succeeded; Pichegru,
                    instead of fighting great battles, made use of the <hi rend="italic">élan</hi>
                    of his soldiers to win innumerable small engagements, and with Hoche forced the
                    lines of Haguenau, and relieved Landau. In December 1793 he superseded Hoche,
                    became commander-in-chief of the united armies of the Rhine and Moselle, whence
                    he was summoned to succeed Jourdan in the army of the North in February 1794. It
                    was now that he fought his three great campaigns of one year. The English and
                    Austrians held a strong position along the Sambre to the sea. After vainly
                    attempting to break the Austrian centre, Pichegru suddenly turned their left,
                    and defeated Clerfayt at Cassel, Menin, and Courtrai, while Moreau, his second
                    in command, defeated Coburg at Turcoing in May 1794; then after a pause, during
                    which <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n89/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0089-0080"/> Piclιegru feigned to besiege Ypres, he again
                    dashed at Clerfayt and defeated him at Rousselaer and Hooglede, while Jourdan
                    came up with the new army of the Sambre and Meuse, and utterly routed the
                    Austrians at Fleurus on June 27, 1794. After a pause Pichegru began his second
                    campaign by crossing the Meuse on October 18, and after taking Nimeguen drove
                    the Austrians beyond the Rhine. Instead of going into winter-quarters, he
                    prepared his army for a winter campaign. On December 28th he crossed the Meuse
                    on ,the ice, and stormed the island of Bommel, then crossed the Waal in the same
                    manner, and, driving the English before him, entered Utrecht on January 19, and
                    Amsterdam on January 20, and soon occupied the whole of Holland. This grand feat
                    of arms was marked by many points of interest, such as the capture of the Dutch
                    ships which were frozen in the Helder by the French hussars, and the splendid
                    discipline of the ragged battalions in Amsterdam, who, with the richest city of
                    the Continent to sack, yet behaved with perfect self-restraint. This conquest
                    aroused a storm of admiration in France. The former friend of Saint Just now
                    offered his services to the Thermidorians, and after receiving from the
                    Convention the title of Sauveur de la Patrie, subdued the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sans-culottes</hi> of Paris, when they rose in insurrection against the
                    Convention on 12 Germinal (1 April). Honoured by the republicans, and with the
                    greatest military reputation in France, Pichegru then took command of the armies
                    of the North, the Sambre and Meuse, and the Rhine, and crossing the Rhine in
                    force took Mannheim in May 1795. When his fame was thus at its height he became
                    a traitor, and for the promise of a marshal’s baton, the governorship of Alsace,
                    the castle of Chambord, 1,000,000 francs in cash, and 200,000 francs a year,
                    sold his army and his country. He allowed Jourdan to be beaten before Mannheim,
                    and betrayed all his plans to the enemy. His intrigues were suspected, and when
                    he offered his resignation to the Directory in October 1795 it was to his
                    surprise promptly accepted. He retired in disgrace, but hoped to serve the
                    royalist cause by securing his election to the Council of Five Hundred in May
                    1797. He was there the royalist leader, and planned a <hi rend="italic">coup
                    d’etat,</hi> but on the 18th Fructidor he was arrested, and with fourteen others
                    deported to Cayenne in 1797. Escaping, he reached London in 1798, and served in
                    the archduke Charles’s staff in the campaign of .1799. He went to Paris in
                    August 1803 with Georges Cadoudal to head a royalist rising against Napoleon;
                    but, betrayed by a friend, he was arrested on February 28, 1804, and on April
                    15th was found strangled in prison. It has often been asserted, but without a
                    shadow of probability, as he was certain to have been condemned if brought to
                    trial, that he was murdered by the orders of Napoleon.</p>
                <p>Pichegru’s campaigns of 1794 are marked by traits of an audacious genius which
                    would not have disgraced Napoleon; like him, he perceived the intrinsic fitness
                    of the French soldiers for strokes of daring rather than for sustained battles.
                    But a more thorough traitor never commanded an army. He flattered in turn Saint
                    Just and the Terrorists, the Thermidorians and the Directors, and seemed
                    altogether unmoved by considerations of loyalty or patriotism.</p>
