                    family, and was born at Bausset in Provence on 1st April 1745. He was educated
                    by the Oratorians at their schools in Toulon and Marseilles, and then went to
                    the university of Aix; while a student there he published his first two works,
                    <hi rend="italic">Observations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur Émile</hi> in 1763 and
                    <hi rend="italic">Des Préjugés</hi> in 1764. In 1765 he became an avocat at the
                    parlement of Aix, and soon obtained so great a reputation that he was instructed
                    by Choiseul in 1770 to draw up the decree authorizing the marriage of
                    Protestants. From 1778 to 1781 he was one of the four assessors or
                    administrators of Provence, and in 1783 he brought about the countess of
                    Mirabeau’s separation from her husband in spite of the impassioned pleading of
                    the great Mirabeau himself. In 1788 he protested on behalf of the avocats of Aix
                    against Loménie de Brienne’s May edicts, but in the following year, probably
                    owing to Mirabeau’s influence, he was not elected to the States-General. He
                    entirely disapproved of the great changes brought about by the Constituent
                    Assembly; and, after refusing to be one of the royal commission for splitting up
                    Provence into departments, he retired, first to his country house and then to
                    Lyons, and took no further part in politics. In November 1793, after the
                    republic had been proclaimed, he came to Paris, and was thrown into prison,
                    being the brother-in-law of Siméon, who was the leader of the federalists in
                    Provence. He was soon removed through the influence of Barere to a maison de
                    santé, where he remained undisturbed till the fall of Robespierre. On being
                    released he practised as a lawyer in Paris; and in 1795 he was elected by the
                    capital to the Council of Ancients, at once becoming a leader of the moderate
                    party opposed to the directory. His reports, however, were chiefly on questions
                    of law reform, and he commenced the labours which have made his name famous. As
                    a leader of the moderates he was proscribed at the coup d’étât of Fructidor,
                    but, unlike Pichegru and Barbé-Marbois, he managed to escape to Switzerland, and
                    did not return till Bonaparte became First Consul. Bonaparte knew his value, and
                    made him a conseiller d’étât in 1800, and then charged him, with Tronchet, Bigot
                    de Préameneu, and Jacques de Maleville, to draw up the <hi rend="italic">Code
                    Civil.</hi> Of this commission he was the most industrious member, and many of
                    the most important titles, notably those on marriage and heirship, are his work.
                    In 1801 he was placed in charge of the department of cultes, or public worship,
                    and in that capacity had the chief share in drawing up the provisions of the
                    Concordat. In 1803 he became a member of the Institute, in 1804 minister of
                    public worship, and in 1805 a knight grand cross of the Legion of Honour. He
                    soon after became totally blind; and after undergoing an unsuccessful operation
                    he died at Paris on 23d August 1807.</p>
