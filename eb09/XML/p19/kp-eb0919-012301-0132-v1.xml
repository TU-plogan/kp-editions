                <p><label type="entry">PISANO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Niccola</hi></label>. (<hi
                        rend="italic">c.</hi> 1206-1278), one of the chief sculptors and architects
                    of mediaeval Italy, was born about 1206. Though he called himself <hi
                        rend="italic">Pisanus,</hi> from Pisa, where most of his life was spent, he
                    was not a Pisan by birth. There are two distinct accounts of his parentage, both
                    derived mainly from existing documents. According to one of these he is said to
                    have been the son of “Petrus, a notary of Siena ;” but this statement is very
                    doubtful, especially as the word “Siena” or “de Senis” appears to be a
                    conjectural addition. Another document among the archives of the Sienese
                    cathedral calls him son of “Petrus de Apulia.” Crowe and Cavalcaselle, as well
                    as the majority of modern writers, accept the latter statement, and believe that
                    he not only was a native of the province of Apulia in southern Italy, but also
                    that he gained there his early instruction in the arts of sculpture and
                    architecture. Those on the other hand who, with most of the older writers,
                    prefer to accept the theory of Niccola’s origin being Tuscan suppose that he was
                    a native of a small town called Apulia near Lucca. As is the case with the
                    biographies of so many of those artists who lived long before Vasari’s own time,
                    that author’s account of Niccola is quite untrustworthy. There is no doubt that
                    in the century preceding Niccola Pisano’s birth Apulia, and the southern
                    provinces generally, were more advanced in the plastic art than any part of
                    northern Italy—witness especially the magnificent architecture and sculpture in
                    the cathedrals of Salerno, Bari, Amalfi, Ravello, and many others, in which
                    still exist bronze doors, marble pulpits, and other works of art of great merit,
                    dating from the 11th and 12th centuries,—a period when northern Italy produced
                    very little art-work of any real beauty. That the young Niccola Pisano saw and
                    was influenced by these things cannot be denied, but Crowe and Cavalcaselle, in
                    their eagerness to contradict the old traditions, go very much too far when they
                    deny the story, told by Vasari, of Niccola’s admiration for and keen study of
                    the remains of ancient Roman sculpture which were then beginning to be sought
                    for and appreciated. In Niccola Pisano’s works it is somewhat difficult to trace
                    the direct influence of Apulian art, while in many of them, especially the
                    panel-reliefs of his Pisan pulpit (see figure), classical feeling is apparent in
                    every fold of the drapery, in the modelling of the nude, and in the dignified
                    reserve of the main lines of the composition.</p>
                <p>For all that, Niccola was no dull copyist; though he emancipated himself from the
                    stiffness and unreality of earlier sculpture, yet his admiration and knowledge
                    of the physical beauty of the human form in no way detracted from the purity and
                    religious spirit of his subjects. Though pagan in their beauty of modelling and
                    grace of attitude, his Madonnas are as worshipful, and his saints as saintly, as
                    those of any sculptor the world has ever seen. With true genius he opened out to
                    the church a new field in which all the gifts of God, even purely physical ones,
                    were made use of and adopted as types and symbols of inward purity and love—not
                    repudiated and suppressed as snares of the evil one. Except through his works,
                    but little is known of the history of Niccola’s life. As early <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n133/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0919-0133-0124"/> as 1221 he is said to have been summoned to
                    Naples by Frederick II., to do work in the new Castel dell’ Uovo. This fact
                    supports the theory of his southern origin, though not perhaps very strongly,
                    as, some years before, the Pisan Bonannus had been chosen by the Norman king as
                    the sculptor to cast one of the bronze doors for Monreale cathedral, where it
                    still exists. The earliest existing piece of sculpture which can be attributed
                    to Niccola is a beautiful relief of the Deposition from the Cross in the
                    tympanum of the arch of a side door at San Martino at Lucca; it is remarkable
                    for its graceful composition and delicate finish of execution. The date is about
                    1237. In 1260, as an incised inscription records, he finished the marble pulpit
                    for the Pisan baptistery; this is on the whole the finest of his works.</p>
                <p>It is a high octagon, on semicircular arches, with trefoil cusps, supported by
                    nine marble columns, three of which rest on white marble lions. In design it
                    presents that curious combination of Gothic forms with classical details which
                    is one of the characteristics of the mediaeval architecture of northern Italy;
                    though much enriched with sculpture both in relief and in the round, the general
                    lines of the design are not sacrificed to this, but the sculpture is kept
                    subordinate to the whole. In this respect it is superior to the more magnificent
                    pulpit at Siena, one of Niccola’s later works, w⅛ich suffers greatly from want
                    of repose and purity of outline, owing to its being overloaded with reliefs and
                    statuettes. Five of the sides of the main octagon have panels with subjects— the
                    Nativity, the Adoration of the Magi, the Presentation in the Temple, the
                    Crucifixion, and the Doom, These are all, especially the first three, works of
                    the highest beauty, and a wonderful advance on anything of the sort that had
                    been produced by Niccola’s predecessors. The drapery is gracefully arranged in
                    broad simple folds; the heads are full of the most noble dignity; and the sweet
                    yet stately beauty of the Madonna could hardly be surpassed. The panel with the
                    Adoration of the Magi is perhaps the one in which Niccola’s study of the antique
                    is most apparent (see figure). The veiled and diademed figure of the Virgin
                    Mother, seated on a throne, recalls the Roman Juno; the head of Joseph behind
                    her might be that of Vulcan; while the youthful beauty of an Apollo and the
                    mature dignity of a Jupiter are suggested by the standing and kneeling figures
                    of the Magi. Certain figures in others of the panels are no less deeply imbued
                    with classical feeling.</p>
                <p>The next important work of Niccola in date is the Area di San Domenico, in the
                    church at Bologna consecrated to that saint, who died in 1221. Only the main
                    part, the actual sarcophagus covered with sculptured reliefs of St Dominic’s
                    life, is the work of Niccola and his pupils. The sculptured base and curved roof
                    with its fanciful ornaments are later additions. This “Area” was made when St
                    Dominic was canonized, and his bones translated; it was finished in 1267, not by
                    Niccola himself, but by his pupils. The most magnificent, though not the most
                    beautiful, of Niccola’s works is the great pulpit in Siena cathedral (1268). It
                    is much larger than that at Pisa, though somewhat similar in general design,
                    being an octagon on cusped arches and columns. Its stairs, and a large landing
                    at the top, with carved balusters and panels, rich with semi-classical foliage,
                    are an addition of about 1500. The pulpit itself is much overloaded with
                    sculpture, and each relief is far too crowded with figures. An attempt to gain
                    magnificence of effect has destroyed the dignified simplicity for which the
                    earlier pulpit is so remarkable.</p>
                <p>Niccola’s last great work of sculpture was the fountain in the piazza opposite
                    the west end of the cathedral at Perugia. This is a series of basins rising one
                    above another, each with sculptured bas-reliefs; it was begun in 1274, and
                    completed, except the topmost basin, which is of bronze, by Niccola’s son and
                    pupil Giovanni.</p>
                <p>Niccola Pisano was not only pre-eminent as a sculptor, but was also the greatest
                    Italian architect of his century; he designed a number of very important
                    buildings, though not all which are attributed to him by Vasari. Among those now
                    existing, the chief are the main part of the cathedral at Pistoia, the church
                    and convent of Sta Margherita at Cortona, and Sta Trinita at Florence. The
                    church of Sant’ Antonio at Padua has also been attributed to him, but without
                    reason. Unfortunately his architectural works have in most cases been much
                    altered and modernized. Niccola was also a skilled engineer, and was compelled
                    by the Florentines to destroy the great tower, called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Guarda-morto,</hi> which overshadowed the baptistery at Florence, and had
                    for long been the scene of violent conflicts between the Guelfs and Ghibellines.
                    He managed skilfully so that it should fall without injuring the baptistery.
                    Niccola Pisano died at Pisa in the year 1278, leaving his son Giovanni a worthy
                    successor to his great talents both as an architect and sculptor.</p>
                <p>Though his importance as a reviver of the old traditions of beauty in art has
                    been to some extent exaggerated by Vasari, yet it is probable that he, more than
                    any other one man, was the means of starting that “new birth” of the plastic
                    arts which, in the years following his death, was so fertile in countless works
                    of the most unrivalled beauty. Both Niccola and his son had many pupils of great
                    artistic power, and these carried the influence of the Pisani throughout Tuscany
                    and northern Italy, so that the whole art of the succeeding generations may be
                    said to have owed the greater part of its rapid development to this one
                    family.</p>
