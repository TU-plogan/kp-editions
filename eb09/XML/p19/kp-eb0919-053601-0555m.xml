                    STATISTICS.</p>
                <p>THE kingdom of Portugal, which is geographically a province of the Iberian
                    Peninsula on its west coast, is bounded on the N. by the Spanish province of
                    Galicia, on the E. by the Spanish provinces of Leon, Estremadura, and Andalusia,
                    and on the S. and W. by the Atlantic Ocean. It lies between 36° 56' and 42° 10'
                    N. lat. and 6° 15' and 9° 30' W. long. It is 362 miles in length by 140 in
                    breadth, and contained by the latest (1878) computation<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Strelbitsky, <hi rend="italic"

                    square miles. Its coast-line is nearly 500 miles in length, and only one
                    province, Tras-os-Montes, is not washed by the sea. On the extreme north the
                    coast is low, but farther south it becomes rocky and steep for a few miles near
                    Povoa de Varzim. From that town to Cape Carboeiro the coast of Beira is flat,
                    sandy, and marshy, closely resembling the French Landes; after another stretch
                    of dunes it again becomes steep and rugged from Cape Roca to Cape Espichel, and
                    along the northern side of the Bay of Setubal, and then remains low throughout
                    the rest of the coast-line of Estremadura (Portuguese). In Alemtejo the coast is
                    low and in places rocky and full of shallows; and, although at Cape St Vincent
                    the cliffs are steep and inaccessible, the general coast-line of Algarves, the
                    southernmost province of Portugal, is low and sandy. The chief capes, which form
                    the only cliff’s on the otherwise flat and sandy coast, are Cape Mondego, Cape
                    Carboeiro, Cape Roca, Cape Espichel, Cape Sines, Cape St Vincent, and Cape Santa
                    Maria, and the chief bays are those of Figueira, Ericeira, Setubal, and Sines.
                    The only islands off the coast are the dangerous Farilhδes and the Berlengas off
                    Cape Carboeiro, which would be uninhabited but for an old castle, now used as a
                    prison, on the largest island of the latter group.</p>
                <p>The mountain-systems of Portugal can only be adequately treated under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Spain</hi> (&lt;7.v.), as they are in every instance
                    continuations to the west or south-west of the great Spanish ranges. Thus the
                    mountains of the Cantabrian Pyrenees in Galicia spread themselves over the two
                    northern provinces of Portugal, Entre Minho e Douro and Tras-os-Montes, in
                    various short ranges, of which the most important are the Serra do Gerez (4815
                    feet) and the Serra de Marào (4665 feet), the latter extending down the left
                    bank of the Tameja and sheltering the wine-districts of Tras-os-Montes from the
                    east winds. In Beira the granite Serra da Estrella (6540 feet), the loftiest
                    range in Portugal, forms part of the system of the Guadarramas and a
                    continuation of the Sierra de Gata, and terminates in the Serra de Lousâo (3940
                    feet), while the chalk mountains in the south of the province, such as the Monte
                    Junto near Santarem (2185 feet) and the Serra de Cintra, which runs into the sea
                    at Cape Roca, belong to a different geological period. The chalk mountains of
                    the Serra de Arrabida (1537 feet) to the south of the Tagus correspond with the
                    Serra de Cintra, and form Cape Espichel; but the other low ranges to the south
                    of the river in Alemtejo, such as the Serra de San Mamede (3363 feet) and the
                    Serra de Ossa (2130 feet), belong to the system of the mountains of Toledo. The
                    continuation of the Sierra Morena, which separates Algarves from the rest of
                    Portugal, forms various small ranges and isolated mountains, such as the Serra
                    do Malhäo (1886 feet) and Monte Figo, and then closes with the Serra de
                    Monchique (2963 feet) and runs into the sea in the steep cliffs of Cape St
                    Vincent.</p>
                <p>The river-system of Portugal is also merely a portion of that of Spain. Its three
                    most important rivers, the</p>
                <p>Douro, the Tagus, and the Guadiana, all rise in Spain and flow through that
                    country; but they all enter the sea in Portugal, and at the mouths of the Douro
                    and the Tagus are situated the two most important cities of the kingdom, Oporto
                    and Lisbon. The chief Portuguese tributaries of the Douro are the Tameja, the
                    Tua, and the Sabor on the north, and the Agueda, the Coa, and the Paiva on the
                    south; of the Tagus, the Elja, the Ponsul, and the Zezere on the north, and the
                    Niza, the Sorraya, and the Canha on the south; while into the Guadiana, on its
                    right or Portuguese bank, flow the Caia, the Oeiras, and the Vascâo. The other
                    important rivers are the Minho, which forms the boundary of Portugal and Galicia
                    in the lower part of its course, the Limia, the Cavado, the Vouga, and the
                    Mondego to the north of the Tagus, and the Sado, the Mira, the Odelouca, and the
                    Silves to the south of it. Important as are the rivers of Portugal, it has no
                    inland lakes worthy of mention, though it abounds in hot and other medicinal
                    springs, such as the Caldas de Monchique; and beautiful little mountain-lakes
                    are numerous on the tops of the Serra da Estrella.</p>
                <p>The climate of Portugal is particularly equable and temperate, and its salubrious
                    qualities were recognized by the English doctors of the 18th century, who used
                    to send many patients to winter there, including Fielding the novelist; and,
                    though Portugal has been superseded as a winter resort by the Riviera and
                    Algiers, there are signs that it may again become a European health-resort of
                    the first importance. To prove the temperate nature of the climate it is not
                    enough to state that the average mean temperatures of Lisbon, Coimbra, and
                    Oporto are 61° *3, 61° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 1, and 60 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 2 Fahr, respectively; more instructive is it to
                    mention that the mean average temperature foi' the month of January is only 50°
                    ’ 2 at both Coimbra and Oporto, and for July only 69° <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 4 and 70° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3 for the same two cities,
                    showing a difference between summer and winter of about 20°. This equability of
                    temperature is partly caused by the very heavy rainfall which is precipitated on
                    Portugal as one of the most westerly kingdoms of Europe and one most exposed to
                    the Atlantic, and which has reached as much as 16 feet in a year; but it is
                    noticeable that this heavy rainfall comes down in gradual showers spread over
                    the whole year, and not in the torrents of the tropics. This great humidity has
                    its drawbacks as well as its advantages, for, though it makes the soil rich, it
                    produces also heavy fogs, which render the Portuguese coast exceedingly
                    dangerous to ships. This charming climate and equability of temperature are not,
                    however, universal in Portugal; they are to be enjoyed mainly in the highlands
                    of Beira, Estremadura, and in the northern provinces, especially at Cintra and
                    Coimbra. In the deep valleys, even of those favoured provinces where the
                    mountains keep off the cool winds, it is excessively hot in summer; while on the
                    summits of the mountains snow lies for many months, and it is often
                    extraordinarily cold. Even in Lisbon itself the temperature, though its mean is
                    only the same as that of Coimbra, varies from 38° 'l in January to 90° ’ 6 Fahr,
                    in July, a difference of more than 50°. In Alemtejo the climate is very
                    unfavourable, and, though the heat is not so great as in Algarves, the country
                    presents a far more deserted and African appearance, while in winter, when heavy
                    rains swell the Tagus and make it overflow its banks, damp unhealthy swamps are
                    left, which breed malaria. Notwithstanding that Algarves is hotter than
                    Alemtejo, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n558/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0558-0537"/> the climate there very sultry owing to the
                    sea-breezes being intercepted by the Serra de Monchique and other mountains, a
                    profuse vegetation takes away much of the tropical effect, so that it is a far
                    shadier and more agreeable province than Alemtejo. Although such a rainy
                    country, Portugal is very rarely visited by thunderstorms; but, on the other
                    hand, shocks of earthquake are frequently felt, and recall the great earthquake
                    of Lisbon in 1755.</p>
                <p>The geology, flora, and fauna of Portugal are essentially the same as those of
                    Spain, and will be studied under <hi rend="smallcaps">Spain</hi>

                <p>According to the census of 1878 the following towns had a population of more than
                    10,000 each:—Lisbon, 246,343; Oporto, 105,838; Braga, 19,755; Setubal, 14,798;
                    Loulé, 14,448; Coimbra, 13,369; Evora, 13,046; Tavira, 11,459; Covilha, 10,809;
                    Elvas, 10,471; Povöa de Varzim, 10,365; Ovar, 10,022.</p>
                <p>The ethnological composition of the population is most mixed: in the two northern
                    provinces the population is essentially Galician, but farther south the mixture
                    becomes obvious; not only did the conquering Portuguese largely intermarry with
                    the Arabs, but in the places where they exterminated them they replaced them by
                    colonies of crusaders of all nations, chiefly French, English, Dutch, and
                    Frisian, who have left their mark on the features and character of the nation,
                    and they also largely intermarried with the Jews. No Jews were so wealthy or so
                    cultivated as those of Portugal, who, though for many centuries keeping strictly
                    apart from the Christians, yet after their forced conversion or expulsion by
                    King Emmanuel largely intermarried, especially with the people of Lisbon.
                    Farther south an African physiognomy appears, derived from the thousands of
                    negro slaves imported to till Alemtejo and Algarves, from the days of Dorn Henry
                    till the decline of the Portuguese power.</p>
                <p>Emigration is thinning the population, or rather keeping it from rapidly
                    increasing; and the following are the results of the statistics published by the
                    Royal Geographical Society of Lisbon for 1872-81. There emigrated in the ten
                    years between 1871 and 1881 from Entre Minho e Douro 51,531 persons, from
                    Tras-os-Montes 7799, from Beira 31,437, from Estremadura 12,769, from Alemtejo
                    42, from Algarves 225, from the Azores 22,794, from Madeira 6410, making a grand
                    total of 133,007. Of these emigrants 129,549 were bound for America, the whole
                    number in all probability for the Brazils,</p>
                <p>3348 for the Portuguese colonies in Africa, and 95 for Asia. It will be noticed
                    that the majority of these emigrants come from the wealthy northern provinces
                    and the sober population of Entre Minho e Douro, while the number from the
                    fever-stricken Alemtejo is practically nil.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce. —</hi> The commerce of Portugal has not rapidly,
                    though it has steadily, increased during the last thirty years; the chief
                    countries with which it trades are, in order of value, England and her colonies,
                    Brazil, the United States, France, and Spain; but it is hardly fair to mention
                    commerce with Spain, because the large amount of smuggling $hich takes place
                    makes it impossible to estimate the real amount of trade between the two
                    countries. The following table of exports and imports in nineteen classes,
                    compiled by Mr George Brackenbury, British consul at Lisbon, dated 24th April
                    1884, is published in the <hi rend="italic">Consular Reports</hi> for 1884, and
                    contains the latest information on Portuguese trade and commerce. It will be
                    noticed that the chief imports are bread-stuffs, metals, cottons, and minerals,
                    and the chief exports fermented liquors, live stock (which is nearly all sent to
                    England), and timber.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The state of agriculture in Portugal is
                    still deplorable; the wealth and energy of the country have been thrown into the
                    wine trade, and the production and cultivation of cereals have been so much
                    neglected that, in spite of its being eminently adapted for such cultivation,
                    nearly all its cereals are imported from the United States, to the value in 1883
                    of over £1,000,000. The wine production, on which Portugal has so long depended,
                    was the work of the Methuen treaty of 1703, for it was not until after that
                    treaty that the barren rocks of the Alto Douro were covered with vines. But now,
                    though the returns show slight alteration, there must soon be a great change.
                    The phylloxera has utterly destroyed thousands of vineyards in Entre Minho e
                    Douro and in Beira. The labours of the phylloxera commission seem unable to
                    check its ravages;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Consul Crawfurd’s <hi rend="italic">Report,</hi> Oporto, 1884.</p></note> the
                    commissioners themselves are hindered by the people,—an inspector having been
                    even shot at in the district of Riguengo.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Mr Baring’s <hi rend="italic">Report.</hi></p></note> The
                    reason why no great alteration is to be perceived in the returns is that the
                    great Oporto shippers have such vast stocks that it may be years before the want
                    comes to be felt. To remedy the failure, which can be only a matter of time,
                    tobacco-growing has been proposed (see Consul Crawfurd’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Report},</hi> and will probably be tried in place of vine-culture. Portugal has
                    lately become a great exporter of live stock to England, as also of large
                    quantities of fruits and early vegetables, including oranges (especially from
                    Condeixa), lemons, limes, peaches (from Amarante), and the celebrated Elvas
                    plums. The difference in the character of the inhabitants of different provinces
                    is well shown by the fact that in the north the peasant not only tends his vines
                    but in many instances rears silkworms and even possesses olive trees, while in
                    Alemtejo he is content to live upon chestnuts and to take care of his pigs and
                    goats.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Nothing proves more decidedly the
                    agricultural character of the Portuguese than the repeated failures to establish
                    manufactures among them. This has often been ascribed to the provision
                    respecting the importation of English goods in the Methuen treaty; but not all
                    the efforts of Pombal or of the modern protectionist cabinets have been able to
                    establish any important manufactures. The following table, extracted from Consul
                    Brackenbury’s <hi rend="italic">Report,</hi> gives a list of the chief

                <p>Some of these establishments ought to be more successful, for the glass-works of
                    Leiria, the lace-works of Vianna and Peniche, and the potteries of Aveiro had an
                    immense reputation in the 18th century, which they have now lost, as the table
                    clearly shows. Portugal possesses plenty of mineral wealth, though not so much
                    as Spain, but from want of capital and enterprise such resources as exist are
                    neglected. A very few of the chief mines may be noted—the lead-mines of Coimbra,
                    one of antimony near Oporto, and above all the very important copper-mines of
                    San Domingos near Beja, worked by an English company, which contributed
                    thirteeu-sixteenths of the total exports of minerals in the six months between
                    January and June 1883. Of greater importance are the fisheries,—the fishermen
                    both of Beira and Algarves being famous for their courage; and large quantities
                    of sardines and preserved tunny fish are exported to Italy and France, and an
                    even larger quantity of oysters to England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Finance. —</hi> The revenue of Portugal has for many years
                    ceased to balance its expenditure, and the deficit has had to be met by
                    borrowing, but it is only fair to remark that vigorous attempts have been made
                    to reduce the expenditure of recent years. The estimated revenue for 1883-84 and
                    1884-85 was classified under six heads.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> The government of Portugal is an hereditary
                    and constitutional monarchy, exercised under the charter of 1826, as modified in
                    1852 and 1878, under which the king is charged with the executive and shares the
                    power of making laws with two chambers. His civil list amounts to £144,000 a
                    year, and he is advised in all matters of administration and assisted in
                    nominating peers by a council of state appointed for life, but depends for
                    advice in legislative and executive matters on a cabinet of seven members
                    selected from the chambers by a premier, summoned by the king. The House of
                    Peers consists of 150 members nominated by the king for life, and contains many
                    of the most eminent professors and authors, as well as men of wealth, and
                    additions may be made to its number by the king on the advice of the premier,
                    with the consent of the council of state. All the members of the House of Peers
                    do not possess titles, nor do all titled persons belong to the House of Peers;
                    legislation and the titular and hereditary aristocracy are kept quite apart. The
                    House of Deputies consists of 173 members, elected directly by all male citizens
                    of twenty-five years of age, either paying in direct taxes 4s. 6d. a year, or
                    deriving an annual income of 22s. from real estate, while all graduates,
                    priests, officers, and certified teachers have votes without further
                    qualification. The president of the chamber is selected by the king out of five
                    elected candidates, and the deputies are paid. The Azores and Madeira elect
                    members to the House at Lisbon. For administrative purposes Portugal is divided
                    into seventeen districts, for judicial purposes into twenty-six districts or
                    “comarcas,” with appeal courts at Lisbon and Oporto, and a supreme court at
                    Lisbon, and for military purposes into four divisions. The Roman Catholic is the
                    state religion, but others are tolerated, and the power of the priests has been
                    greatly checked by the wholesale suppression of monasteries in 1834. The church
                    in Portugal is governed by a patriarch at Lisbon, two archbishops at Braga and
                    Evora, and fourteen bishops, of whom the most important is the bishop of Oporto.
                    For purposes of local government the districts are under the rule of civil
                    governors, who have much the same powers as prefects in France, while in the 292
                    “concelhos,” or administrative councils, there are elected councillors, and in
                    the 3960 “freguezias” or parishes the villagers elect a magistrate, who has the
                    same powers as an English justice of the peace.</p>

                    Portuguese army has been reorganized. The effective war strength is to be
                    maintained at 120,000 men. The term of service is for 12 <pb break="no"

                    in the first reserve, and 4 in the second reserve. The force is divided into 36
                    regiments of infantry, 10 regiments of cavalry, 4 regiments, 1 brigade, and 4
                    companies of artillery, and 1 regiment of engineers. In 1883, under the old
                    regulations, the army contained 41 general officers; its effective strength in
                    time of peace was 33,231 men with 1643 officers, and on a war footing 75,336 men
                    with 2688 officers. For colonial service there is one regiment of 1143 soldiers
                    and 50 officers divided into 3 battalions, of which one is always stationed at
                    Goa and another at Macao. The officers are trained in the military academy at
                    Lisbon, and there is an asylum for the sons of soldiers. The navy is no longer
                    the power it used to be, but, though small, it is equipped in modern fashion and
                    furnished by the naval arsenal at Lisbon. It consisted in 1884 of 30
                    steam-ships, of which one was an armoured corvette mounting 7 guns, and 5 others
                    corvettes mounting 46 guns, and of 14 sailing ships, of which one was a frigate
                    mounting 19 guns. Its personnel consisted of 283 officers and 3235 sailors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Public Instruction.—</hi> The public instruction of Portugal is
                    regulated by the law of 1844, which enacted that all children should be bound to
                    attend a primary school, if there was one within a mile, from the age of seven
                    to fifteen, under penalty to the parents of a fine and deprivation of civil
                    rights. Under this law there were in Portugal, in 1874, 2649 primary schools
                    with 122,004 pupils of both sexes. Secondary education is not neglected, and
                    under the same law of 1844 17 lycées have been established in the seventeen
                    continental districts, and from them it is possible for a pupil to enter either
                    the university of Coimbra, which during the present century has recovered some
                    of its ancient lustre, or the special schools. These special schools are very
                    ably conducted, and modern Portuguese policy gives, as we have seen, a higher
                    status to teachers and professors of all grades than they obtain in most other
                    countries. The most important of these schools are the polytechnic school at
                    Lisbon, the polytechnic academy at Oporto, the medical schools and industrial
                    institutes in both these cities, the institute-general of agriculture, the royal
                    and marine observatories, and the academy of fine arts—all four at Lisbon. The
                    valuable public libraries of Lisbon, Evora, Villa Real, and Braga, supported by
                    the state, and in addition the free library at Oporto, ought also to be
                    mentioned, as well as the archives at the Torre del Tombo, with which a school
                    of palaeography and diplomacy has lately been connected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Public Works.—</hi> On 1st January 1884 there were 1245 miles
                    of railway open (944) and in course of construction (301), also 50 miles of
                    tramways were open, and 2900 miles of telegraph were in operation; and every
                    recent loan has been raised for the purpose of extending these important public
                    works. The chief lines of railway open are those from Lisbon to Valencia de
                    Alcantara, and thence by Talavera to Madrid, and from Lisbon to Oporto, Tua,
                    Nine, and Braga, while the line to Faro, which is to connect Algarves with the
                    capital, has been already extended beyond Beja as far as Casevel. There is also
                    an alternative line to Madrid open through El vas and Badajoz, which connects
                    Lisbon with the Andalusian system and gives a short route to Seville, Cadiz, and
                    Malaga. As to smaller lines opening up Beira, the line from Figueira da Foz to
                    Villar Formosa through Celorico and Guarda is completed, and one is projected
                    parallel to the Lisbon-Oporto line from Villar Formosa to Alcantara on the
                    south, which is to be connected with Oporto through Tua towards the west. The
                    telegraph system is already very complete, and the last touch has been put to it
                    by laying down a submarine cable from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro, binding the
                    mother-country still more closely with what was once her greatest colony, (H. Μ.

                <p><hi> PART</hi> II.—HISTORY.</p>
                <p>It has been stated that geographically the kingdom of Portugal is an integral
                    part of the Iberian Peninsula; the only reason why it has retained its
                    independence, while the other mediaeval states of that peninsula have merged
                    into the kingdom of Spain, is to be found in its history. When Philip II. of
                    Spain annexed Portugal it was a century too late for it to coalesce with Spain.
                    It had then produced Vasco de Gama and Affonso de Albuquerque, and its language
                    had been developed from a Romance dialect into a literary language by Camoens
                    and Sâ de Miranda. Conscious of its national history, it broke away again from
                    Spain in 1640, and under the close alliance of England maintained its separate
                    and national existence during the 18th century. A union with Spain might have
                    been possible, however, during the first half of the present century had not a
                    generation of historians and poets arisen, who, by recalling the great days of
                    the Portuguese monarchy, have made it impossible for Portugal ever again to lose
                    the consciousness of her national existence.</p>
                <p>The history of Portugal really begins with the gift of the fief of the Terra
                    Portucalensis or the county of Porto Cale to Count Henry of Burgundy in 1094;
                    for any attempt to identify the kingdom of Portugal and the Portuguese people
                    with Lusitania and the Lusitanians is utterly without foundation. With the rest
                    of the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal was colonized by the Phoenicians and
                    conquered by the Carthaginians; and the Roman province of Lusitania, whether
                    according to the division of Iberia into three provinces under Augustus or into
                    five under Hadrian, in no way coincided with the historical limits of the
                    kingdom of Portugal. In common with the rest of the Peninsula, it was overrun by
                    the Vandals, Alans, and Visigoths, and eventually conquered by the Arabs in the
                    8th century. It was not until the 15th century that an attempt was made by
                    Garcia de Menezes to identify Lusitania with Portugal. Under the influence of
                    the Renaissance, Bernardo de Brito insisted on the identity, and claimed
                    Viriathus as a Portuguese hero. Other writers of the same epoch delighted in
                    calling Portugal by the classical name of “Lusitania,” and Camoens, by the very
                    title of his great epic, <hi rend="italic">Os Lusiadas,</hi> has immortalized
                    the appellation.</p>
                <p>For two centuries Portugal remained subject to the Omayyad caliphs, and under
                    their wise rule the old Roman coloniae and municipia, such as Lisbon, Lamego,
                    Visen, and Oporto, maintained their Roman self-government and increased in
                    wealth and importance. Towards the close of the 10th century, as the Omayyad
                    caliphate grew weaker, the Christian princes of Visigothic descent who dwelt in
                    the mountains of the Asturias began to grow more audacious in their attacks on
                    the declining power, and in 997 Bermudo II., king of Galicia, won back the first
                    portion of modern Portugal from the Mohammedans by seizing Oporto and occupying
                    the province now known as Entre Minho e Douro. In the beginning of the 11th
                    century the Omayyad caliphate finally broke up, and independent emirs
                    established themselves in every large city, against whom the Christian princes
                    waged incessant and successful war. In 1055 Ferdinand the Great, king of Leon,
                    Castile, and Galicia, invaded Beira; in 1057 he took Lamego and Viseu, and in
                    1064 Coimbra; and his son Garcia, who succeeded him as king of Galicia in 1065,
                    maintained Nuno Mendes, count of Oporto, and Sesnando, a renegade Arab wazir,
                    count of Coimbra, as feudal vassals of his court. In 1073 Alphonso VI., the
                    second son of Ferdinand the Great, united once more his father’s three kingdoms,
                    and for a time rivalled his father’s successes, until a fresh outburst of
                    Mohammedan fanaticism ended in the rise of the Almoravide dynasty, and the
                    defeat of the Christian king at Zalaca in 1086 by Yüsuf ibn Teshufin. To resist
                    this revival of the Mohammedan power, Alphonso VI. summoned the chivalry of
                    Christendom to his aid, and among the knights who came to his assistance were
                    Counts Raymond and Henry of Burgundy. In the days of his success Alphonso had
                    compelled Motawakkil of Badajoz to cede to him both Lisbon and Santarem, but the
                    fortune of war had changed, and Sir, the general of the Almoravide caliph
                    Yιisuf, retook both cities. Alphonso felt the need of a valiant warrior on his
                    Galician frontier, and in 1094 he combined the fiefs of Coimbra and Oporto into
                    one great county and conferred it upon Henry of Burgundy with the hand of his
                    illegitimate daughter Theresa, while to Raymond he gave Galicia and his
                    legitimate daughter and heiress Urraca.</p>

                    first duke of Burgundy, and was in every way a typical knight of his century, a
                    brave restless warrior, and a crusader; but when once firmly established in his
                    county he thought much more about his chances of succeeding his father-in-law as
                    king than of trying to carve a kingdom for himself out of the dominions of the
                    Mohammedan caliphs. When, therefore, Alphonso VI. died in 1109 and left his
                    thrones to his daughter Urraca, and nothing to Henry, the Burgundian at once
                    invaded Leon. For five years the Christian princes, Henry of Burgundy, Alphonso
                    Raimundes (the son of Count Raymond), 2ilph0ns0 of Aragon, and Queen Urraca,
                    fought together, while Sir was consolidating the Almoravide power, until Count
                    Henry died suddenly at Astorga in 1112, leaving his wife Theresa to rule the
                    county of Portugal during the minority of his infant son, Affonso Henriques.</p>
                <p>Theresa, who ruled at Guimarâens during her son’s minority, was a beautiful and
                    accomplished woman, who devoted all her energies to building up Affonso’s
                    dominions into an independent state, and under her rule, while the Christian
                    states of Spain were torn by civil wars, the Portuguese nobles were prevented
                    from interfering, and began to recognize Portugal as their country, and to cease
                    from calling themselves Galicians. Her regency was a stormy one in spite of all
                    her efforts to maintain peace: in 1116 she was persuaded by Gelmires, bishop of
                    Santiago, to try and extend her frontier towards the north, and seized Tuy and
                    Orense; in 1117 she was besieged by the Mohammedans in Coimbra; and in 1121 her
                    sister Urraca took her prisoner, but, through the interposition of Bishop
                    Gelmires and Mauricio Burdino, archbishop of Braga, peace was quickly made
                    between them. For the next few years a curious parallelism appears between the
                    careers of the two sisters: Urraca showered favours on her lover, Pedro de Lara,
                    until her young son Alphonso Raimundes, or Alphonso VII. of Leon and Castile,
                    with the help of Bishop Gelmires, revolted against her; and with equal blindness
                    Theresa favoured her lover, Fernando Peres de Trava, whom she made governor of
                    the cities of Oporto and Coimbra, until she was detested by the boy Affonso
                    Henriques, and Paio, archbishop of Braga. They did not, however, break out into
                    open revolt until after a successful invasion by Alphonso VII. of Leon and
                    Castile, who forced Theresa to recognize his supremacy in 1127. Her son refused
                    to ratify her submission, and rose in rebellion with Archbishop Paio, Sueiro
                    Mendes, Sancho Nunes, and others; and at the battle of San Mamede on 14th June
                    1128 Theresa was taken prisoner, and then wandered about in Galicia with her
                    lover until her death in 1130.</p>
                <p>Affonso Henriques, who at the age of seventeen assumed the government, was one of
                    the heroes of the Middle Ages; he succeeded to the rule of the county of
                    Portugal when it was still regarded as a fief of Galicia, and after nearly sixty
                    years’ incessant fighting he bequeathed to his son a powerful little kingdom,
                    whose independence was unquestioned, and whose fame was spread abroad throughout
                    Christendom by the reports of the victories of its first king over the
                    Mohammedans. The four wars of independence which Affonso Henriques waged against
                    Alphonso VII. lasted more than twelve years, and were fought out on the Galician
                    frontier with varying success, until the question of Portuguese independence was
                    peaceably established and confirmed by the valour of the Portuguese knights, who
                    overcame those of Castile in the famous tournament of Valdevez, and Affonso
                    Henriques assumed the title of the king of Portugal. The independence of
                    Portugal from Galicia being thus finally achieved, Affonso Henriques abandoned
                    the idea of extending his dominions towards the north, and devoted the next
                    twenty-five years of his life to one long crusade against the Mohammedans, and
                    to extending his frontier towards the south. The state of the Mohammedan power
                    in Spain was particularly favourable to his enterprise. The wave of Moslem
                    fanaticism which had created the Almoravide dynasty had exhausted itself, and
                    independent chiefs had established themselves again in the different provinces,
                    while in Africa 'Abd al-Mumen, the successor of the Almohade mahdi, was
                    destroying the power of the Almoravides by means of yet another wave of
                    fanaticism. As early as 1135 Affonso had built the castle of Leiria to protect
                    his capital, Coimbra, but for some years he left the task of attacking the
                    Mohammedans to the Knights Templars and Knights Hospitallers, who made incessant
                    incursions from their headquarters at Soure and Thomar. But the castle of Leiria
                    had soon fallen; and in 1139, after the flower of Mohammedan Spain had crossed
                    over to Africa under Teshufin, the last Almoravide caliph, to fight the
                    Almohades, and when Alphonso VII. was making his second incursion into the heart
                    of Andalusia, Affonso Henriques collected his whole army and invaded the
                    province of the Kasr ibn Abi Dânes. Advancing to the south of Beja, he met the
                    united forces of all the neighbouring cities under a wâli named Ismar, and
                    completely routed him at Orik or Ourique on 25th July. This battle has been
                    surrounded with a mass of legends: it was solemnly asserted two hundred years
                    afterwards that five kings and 200,000 Mohammedans were utterly defeated, and
                    that after the battle Affonso was proclaimed king by his soldiers. Such legends
                    hardly need contradiction; the victory was a great one, but it was obtained over
                    provincial emirs; and it was not by victories over Mohammedans but by struggles
                    with his Christian cousin Alphonso VII. that independence was to be won. Of
                    still later invention was the fiction of the cortes of Lamego, and the passing
                    of the fundamental laws of the monarchy, on which Vertot and other writers have
                    expended so much eloquence. Of great significance with regard to the legendary
                    splendour of the victory is the fact that in the very next year Ismar or Omar,
                    the emir who was defeated at Ourique, was able to take the field again, when he
                    once more seized the castle of Leiria, and destroyed it. In 1143 a regular peace
                    was concluded between Alphonso VII. and Affonso Henriques at Zamora through the
                    mediation of the cardinal Guy de Vico, when Affonso Henriques was finally
                    recognized as <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> king, and promised to be a vassal
                    of the pope, and to pay him four ounces of gold annually. For many subsequent
                    years the history of Portugal is merely a narration of wars against the
                    Mohammedans. Abù Zakaria, wazir of Santarem and Mohammedan leader in the Belatha
                    (a district including the banks of the Tagus and the cities of Lisbon, Santarem,
                    and Cintra), defeated the Templars at Soure in 1144, but in 1147 Santarem itself
                    was surprised and taken on 15th March. Of still more importance was the capture
                    of Lisbon in the same year. A number of German crusaders from the Rhine and
                    Flanders under Count Arnold of Aerschot and Christian Ghistell, and of English
                    crusaders under their constables, Hervey Glanvill, Simon of Dover, Andrew of
                    London, and Saher d’Arcellis, put in at Oporto on their way to Palestine, and
                    were persuaded by the bishop to commence their holy work by assisting in the
                    siege of Lisbon. With their help the ancient city, which claimed to have been
                    founded by Ulysses, and which had three times—in 792, in 851, and in 1093—been
                    taken by the Christians and held for a short time, was finally captured on 24th
                    October by Affonso Henriques, who also persuaded many of the crusaders to settle
                    and form colonies in Portugal. The series of conquests continued: Cintra,
                    Palmella, and Almada quickly surrendered, and at last, after a failure in 1152,
                    the great city of Alcâcer <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0562-0541"/> do Sal was taken in 1158. In 1161 Affonso
                    Henriques met with his first important check. The Almohade caliphs, having at
                    last triumphed in Africa, determined to extend their power to Spain, and on the
                    arrival of their troops the Portuguese king was defeated. Then the character of
                    the war changed. A disputed succession weakened the Almohade caliphate, and
                    independent bands of “salteadors,” who were little better than brigands or
                    free-lances, began to establish themselves in the cities of Alemtejo; such was
                    Giraldo Sempavor, who took Evora in 1166.</p>
                <p>Affonso Henriques became ambitious to win the great city of Badajoz, although by
                    a treaty signed at Celia Nova with Alphonse VII. he had undertaken to confine
                    his conquests to the right bank of the Guadiana. No doubt it was owing to the
                    death of his cousin and the separation of the kingdoms of Castile and Leon that
                    he believed he could effect his purpose. But his son-in-law, Ferdinand of Leon,
                    would not allow such a breach of treaty, and determined to oppose it; and
                    Affonso Henriques made the fatal mistake of again mixing himself up in Spanish
                    affairs by invading Galicia in 1167. At last, in 1169, he formed the siege of
                    Badajoz; Ferdinand at once invested the besieger in his camp, and the Portuguese
                    hero was severely wounded and taken prisoner. To gain his freedom he was
                    compelled to surrender his conquests in Galicia, and Ferdinand nobly inflicted
                    no harsher terms; nevertheless the old king never recovered from the effect of
                    his wound, and the remaining exploits of his reign were the work of his son Dorn
                    Sancho. By 1169 the internal dissensions of the Mohammedans were over, and the
                    new Almohade caliph, Yùsuf Abù Ya'kùb, crossed over to Spain with a large army.
                    He speedily reconquered all the Portuguese acquisitions in Alemtejo, and in
                    1171, after a vain attempt to take Santarem, made a truce for seven years with
                    Affonso Henriques, who in the following year admitted his son Sancho as king
                    with himself, and left him all the duties of war. Dorn Sancho proved himself the
                    worthy son of his father, and for twelve years Alemtejo was one great
                    battle-ground. The greatest struggle was in 1184, when Yusuf brought over fresh
                    forces from Africa, and again besieged Santarem; but pestilence defended the
                    city, and on 4th July Sancho utterly defeated the fever-stricken army of the
                    besiegers, Yùsuf himself being mortally wounded in the battle. This triumph
                    worthily closed the reign of the great crusader king, Affonso Henriques, who
                    died on 6th December 1185.</p>
                <p>The fame of Dorn Sancho I., “the Povoador <hi rend="italic">” or “</hi>
                    Citybuilder,” rests more on his internal administration than on his early
                    exploits as a soldier. But before he had time to obey his inclinations he had to
                    continue a war of life and death with the Mohammedans. In 1189 he conquered
                    Algarves and took Silves, the capital of the province, with the help of some
                    Enghsh, Dutch, Danish, and Frisian crusaders; but the conquest was not final,
                    for in 1192 Yùsuf Abù Ya'kùb reconquered not only Algarves but the whole
                    province of Alemtejo, including Alcâcer do Sal, failing only before Santarem.
                    Finding the Mohammedans under their great Almohade caliph too dangerous to
                    attack again, Dorn Sancho made peace with them, and for some years, until 1200,
                    concerned himself with the affairs of Spain, waging continuous war against
                    Alphonse IX. of Leon without any particular result. His internal administration
                    was far more important. During his father’s reign there had been nothing but
                    fighting, and, except in Lisbon and Oporto, where a large trade for that period
                    had arisen, and in the northern provinces of Entre Minho e Douro and
                    Tras-os-Montes, where agriculture survived, the scanty population lived chiefly
                    on the spoils taken in their yearly incursions on the Mohammedans. Sancho
                    therefore both encouraged the growth of towns and fostered agriculture. The
                    Portuguese towns had almost without exception preserved their old Roman local
                    self-government, which had been taken advantage of by the Mohammedans; and
                    Sancho wisely followed their example, while he encouraged the increase of
                    population by wise laws, and furthered immigration, especially from the
                    crusaders of England, France, and the north of Europe. The country districts he
                    treated on a different principle. He granted large tracts of land to noblemen
                    and cities and the military orders, on condition that they should be cultivated
                    and occupied. The later years of Sancho’s reign were filled with disputes with
                    Pope Innocent III. This struggle bears a curious resemblance to the quarrels of
                    Henry II. with the pope, which had raged a few years earlier in England. Dorn
                    Sancho had insisted on priests accompanying their flocks to battle, and also on
                    making them amenable to the secular courts. This seemed monstrous to Innocent,
                    who sent legate after legate to demand Sancho’s submission and the payment of
                    the tribute to the Holy See. But the king had in his chancellor Juliâo the first
                    Portuguese student who studied the revival of Roman law at Bologna, and who had
                    imbibed broad views there as to the papal power, and he in Sancho’s name
                    asserted the king’s full right even to dispose of the estates of the church in
                    his kingdom if he liked. This general quarrel was complicated by the behaviour
                    of Martinho Rodrigues, bishop of Oporto, who was hated -alike by his chapter,
                    the king, and the people of his city, and who, after being besieged in his
                    palace for five months, escaped to Rome, and claimed the pope’s protection in
                    1209. Sancho was now in weak health and in no mood to continue the struggle, so
                    in 1210 he yielded to all the demands of the pope and the bishops; then, after
                    giving large estates to his sons and daughters, he retired to the convent of
                    Alcobaça, where he died in 1211, leaving a reputation as a warrior and a
                    statesman only second to that of his father.</p>
                <p>The reign of Affonso II. “the Fat” is chiefly important in the constitutional
                    history of Portugal, and for one memorable feat of arms, the recapture of
                    Alcâcer do Sal. On his father’s death, Affonso, probably by the advice of the
                    chancellor Juliâo, summoned a cortes or parliament, consisting of the bishops,
                    “fidalgoes,” and “ricos homens” of the realm, which is the first on record, as
                    that at Lamego in 1143 is apocryphal. The king assented to the final compact
                    which his father had made with the church, and propounded a law of mortmain,
                    probably drawn up by Juliâo, by which the church could receive no more legacies
                    of land, because it could not perform military service. Affonso himself proved
                    to be no warrior, but he was very tenacious of the wealth and power of the
                    crown, and refused to hand over to his brothers the large legacies which Dorn
                    Sancho had left to them; and it was not until after a long civil war, in which
                    Alphonso IX. of Leon joined, that he gave his sisters their legacies, at the
                    same time taking care that they all became nuns, while his brothers went into
                    exile, and never obtained their lands at all. Though Affonso himself was no
                    soldier, the Portuguese infantry showed how free men could fight at the battle
                    of Navas de Tolosa in 1212; and his ministers, bishops, and captains took
                    advantage of the weakness of the Almohades after this great defeat to reconquer
                    Alemtejo, and in 1217 they retook Alcâcer do Sal, and defeated the wâlis of
                    Andalusia with the help of a body of crusaders. In this expedition the king took
                    no part; he was more bent upon filling his treasury, which soon brought him
                    again into conflict with the church. His chancellor, Gonçalo Mendes, inherited
                    the policy of Juliâo, and encouraged him to lay hands on the lands of the
                    archbishop of Braga, Estevâo Soares, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n563/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0563-0542"/> whereupon Pope Honorius III. excommunicated the
                    king and laid an interdict upon the kingdom until Affonso should make
                    compensation and should expel his chancellor from court. This Affonso refused to
                    do, and he was still under the interdict of the church when he died in 1223.</p>
                <p>Sancho II. was only thirteen when he succeeded his father, and, as might have
                    been expected during a minority, the turbulent nobility and intriguing bishops
                    tried to undo the late king’s labours to consolidate the royal power. The old
                    statesmen of Affonso II.—Gonçalo Mendes, the chancellor, Pedro Annes, the
                    “mordomo mor” or lord steward, and Vicente, dean of Lisbon—saw that it was
                    necessary to get the interdict removed if there was to be peace during the
                    king’s minority, and so they prudently retired into the background. Estevâo
                    Soares, the archbishop of Braga, then became the most powerful man in the
                    kingdom, and, with Abril Peres, the new mordomo mor, he agreed with· Alphonso
                    IX. of Leon that the Portuguese should attack Elvas at the same time that the
                    Spaniards laid siege to Badajoz. The siege of Elvas was completely successful;
                    the young king greatly distinguished himself, and in the following year, 1227,
                    felt strong enough to reinstate his father’s old friends in office, making
                    Vicente chancellor, Pedro Annes once more mordomo mor, and Martim Annes “alferes
                    mor” (standard-bearer). This change of power greatly disconcerted the bishops
                    and clergy, who began to intrigue for the overthrow of the young king, but he
                    wisely continued to occupy himself with fighting the Mohammedans, knowing well
                    that the pope would not dare to attack a crusading monarch. He endeavoured to
                    imitate closely his cousin St Louis of France, and his wise policy secured him
                    the protection of the pope, who in 1228 sent John of Abbeville as legate, with
                    full powers to rebuke the Portuguese bishops. The legate made the chancellor,
                    Vicente, bishop of Guarda, and highly commended the favour shown by the king to
                    the friars, who had been introduced into Portugal by his aunts, and to the
                    military orders. But in 1237 Dorn Sancho II. had another serious quarrel with
                    the church, and an interdict was laid on the kingdom; but prompt submission to
                    Pope Gregory IX. secured immediate pardon. Meantime his old and wise councillors
                    had mostly died, and his court was thronged with gay young knights and
                    troubadours. He again attacked the Mohammedans, and invaded Algarves; and in
                    1239 he took Mertola and Ayamonte, in 1240 Cacello, and in 1244 Tavira.
                    Unfortunately in the interval between 1240 and 1244 the king fell in love with a
                    Castilian lady, Donna Mencia Lopes de Haro, the widow of Alvares Peres de
                    Castro, whom he probably married. This union was most distasteful to the
                    Portuguese people, and furnished the bishops with a pretext for forming a party
                    and overthrowing him, provided they could find a leader and obtain the
                    assistance of the pope. In 1245 the king’s brother, Affonso, who had settled at
                    the court of his aunt, Blanche of Castile, queen-dowager of France and mother of
                    Louis IX., and who had there married the heiress of Boulogne, offered himself as
                    a leader to the Portuguese malcontents. The pope at once issued a bull, deposing
                    Sancho, and Joâo Egas, archbishop of Braga, Tiburcio, bishop of Coimbra, and
                    Pedro Salvadores, bishop of Oporto, went to Paris and offered Affonso of
                    Boulogne the crown of Portugal on certain conditions, which he accepted and
                    swore to obey. In 1246 Affonso arrived at Lisbon, and solemnly declared himself
                    the defender of the kingdom; and for two years a civil war raged, which ended in
                    Dom Sancho’s retiring to Toledo, where he died on 8th January 1248.</p>
                <p>With such a commencement it might have been expected that the reign of Affonso
                    III. would have been a period of civil war and internal dissension, or at least
                    of complete submission to the church and the feudal nobility, but, on the
                    contrary, it was from a constitutional point of view the most important of all
                    the early reigns, and also that in which Portugal concluded its warfare with the
                    Mohammedans and attained to its European limits. In short, Affonso III. was
                    essentially a politic king, if not a high-principled man. On his brother’s death
                    he exchanged his title of “visitador” or “curador” of the kingdom for that of
                    king, and at once prepared to complete the conquest of Algarves. Aided by his
                    uncle Dorn Pedro and the Knights Hospitallers under Gonçalo Peres Magro, he
                    speedily reduced the remainder of the province. This rapid extension of the
                    Portuguese territory was by no means agreeable to Alphonso X. “the Wise,” king
                    of Leon and Castile; but, after a short war, Affonso III. consented to marry
                    Alphonso’s illegitimate daughter, Donna Beatrice de Gusman, and to hold Algarves
                    in usufruct only. He then turned his attention to his own position in Portugal,
                    and determined to bridle the power of the bishops, in spite of his oath at
                    Paris. Perceiving that this could only be done with the help of the mass of the
                    people, he summoned a cortes at Leiria in 1254, to which representatives of the
                    cities were elected and sat with the nobles and higher clergy. With the help of
                    this cortes—one of great importance in the constitutional history of Portugal—he
                    dared the interdict laid upon the kingdom for having married again (the daughter
                    of Alphonso the Wise) whilst his first wife (Matilda, countess of Boulogne) was
                    alive. Finally, however, on the petition of the archbishops and bishops of
                    Portugal, Pope Urban IV. legalized the disputed marriage in 1262 and legitimated
                    his elder son, Dorn Diniz, while in 1263 Alphonso X. made over to him the full
                    sovereignty of Algarves. On the other hand, the people made use of their power,
                    and in a full cortes at Coimbra in 1261 the representatives of the cities boldly
                    denounced Affbnso’s tampering with the coinage, and compelled recognition of the
                    fact that taxes were not levied by the inherent right of the king but by the
                    free consent of the people. After a prosperous and successful reign Nemesis came
                    upon Affonso in the rebellion of his eldest son Diniz in 1277, which continued
                    until 1279, in which year the king died.</p>
                <p>The period of war and of territorial extension in the: Peninsula was now over,
                    and the period of civilization was to dawn. Territorially and constitutionally
                    Portugal was now an established kingdom; it remained for it to become civilized
                    and thoroughly homogeneous before the great heroic period of exploration and
                    Asiatic conquest should begin. No better man for such work than the new king,
                    Dorn Diniz, could have been found: he was himself a poet and loved letters; he
                    was a great administrator and loved justice; above all he saw the need of
                    agriculture and the arts of peace to take the place of incessant wars, and nobly
                    earned the title of the “Ré Lavrador,” or “Denis the Labourer.” From all these
                    points of viexv his reign is of vast importance in the history of Portugal,
                    though, like all reigns of peaceful progress, it is not signalized by many
                    striking events. It began with a civil war between Diniz and his brother
                    Affonso, who disputed his legitimacy, which ended in a compromise; and in 1281
                    Diniz married Isabel, daughter of Pedro III. of Aragon, who for her pure and
                    unselfish life was canonized in the 16th century. His reign is only marked by
                    one war with Sancho IV. and his successor, Ferdinand IV., of Castile and Leon,
                    which was terminated in 1297 by a treaty of alliance, according to the terms of
                    which Ferdinand IV. married Constance, daughter of Diniz, while Affonso, the
                    heir to the throne of Portugal, married Beatrice of Castile, sister of
                    Ferdinand. Still more interesting are the king’s relations with Edward I. of
                    England, with whom he exchanged many letters, and with whom he made a commercial
                    treaty in 1294. He corresponded also often with <pb break="no"

                    1311 that the Knights Templars had been greatly maligned; and on their
                    suppression by Clement V., recollecting the great services which the military
                    orders had rendered to Portugal and their great power, Dorn Diniz founded the
                    Order of Christ, and invested it with the lands of the Templars, thus at once
                    obeying the pope and avoiding a serious disturbance at home. The king showed his
                    love of agriculture by the foundation of agricultural schools and homes for
                    farmers’ orphans, as well as by encouraging improved farming, and by
                    establishing the pine forest of Leiria, his love of justice by wise laws,
                    checking, though not abolishing, the feudal courts, and by the appointment of
                    royal corregidors in every town of which the crown possessed the franchise, and
                    his love for commerce by his commercial treaty with England, and by the
                    foundation of a royal navy, of which a Genoese, named Emmanuel Pessanha, was the
                    first admiral. But his real affection was for literature: he encouraged a school
                    of Portuguese poets at his court, and established a university at Lisbon, which,
                    after many changes, found a permanent home at Coimbra. At the end of this reign
                    war broke out between the king and the heir-apparent, and a pitched battle was
                    only prevented in 1323 by St Isabel riding between the armies and making a peace
                    between her husband and her son, which lasted until the death of the great
                    peace-monarch, the Ré Lavrador, in 1325.</p>
                <p>Affonso IV. pursued his father’s policy of making family alliances with the kings
                    of Aragon and Castile, and in 1328 married his daughter, Donna Maria, to
                    Alphonso XI. of Castile, who neglected her, and for her sake Affonso IV.
                    declared war against Castile. Peace was made through the intervention of St
                    Isabel in 1340, when Dorn Pedro, son of Affonso, married Constance Manuel,
                    daughter of the duke of Penafiel, and Affonso IV. himself promised to bring a
                    strong Portuguese army to the help of Alphonso XI. against the emir of Morocco,
                    Abu Hamem, who had crossed the straits to assist the sultan of Granada. The
                    united Christian armies won a decisive victory at the river Salado, in which
                    Affonso especially distinguished himself, and earned the title of “the Brave”;
                    from that time he remained at peace with Castile, and further strengthened his
                    position in Spain in 1347 by marrying his daughter, Donna Leonora, to Pedro IV.
                    of Aragon. The later years of the reign of Affonso IV. were stained by the
                    tragedy of Donna Ines de Castro. (See vol. v. p. 202.)</p>
                <p>The first act of Dom Pedro on ascending the throne in 1357 was to punish the
                    murderers of Ines; and further, to show his love for her, he had her dead body
                    disinterred and crowned, and afterwards solemnly buried with the kings and
                    queens of Portugal in the convent of Alcobaça. The spirit of stern, revengeful
                    justice which had marked the commencement of his reign continued to show itself
                    in all matters of administration; he punished priest and noble with equal
                    severity, and the people gave him the title of “Pedro the Severe.” Like his
                    grandfather, he greatly valued the friendship of England, and was on intimate
                    terms with Edward III., who in 1352 had ordered his subjects by proclamation
                    never to do any harm to the Portuguese. A curious sequel to the commercial
                    treaty of 1294 was executed in 1353, when Affonso Martins Alho, on behalf of the
                    maritime cities of Portugal, signed a treaty with the merchants of London
                    guaranteeing mutual good faith in all matters of trade and commerce. This is the
                    most interesting feature of Dorn Pedro’s short reign.</p>
                <p>The accession in 1367 of Ferdinand, the only son of Pedro by Constance, marks a
                    crisis in the history of the Portuguese monarchy. As a natural result of the
                    long peace which had succeeded the final conquest of Algarves, the people of
                    Portugal had grown richer, more cultivated, and more conscious of their
                    nationality, while the court had grown more and more dissolute and more out of
                    consonance with the feelings of the people. If the Portuguese monarchy was to
                    continue to exist, it was obvious that it must become again a truly national
                    monarchy, as it had been in the days of Affonso Henriques, and that the kings
                    must remember their duties and not think only of their pleasures. The life and
                    reign of Dorn Ferdinand are marked, like those of his father, by a romantic
                    amour, which, if not so tragic as the story of Ines de Castro, had far greater
                    political importance. Ferdinand was a weak and frivolous but ambitious king,
                    who, after binding himself to marry Leonora, daughter of the king of Aragon,
                    suddenly claimed the thrones of Castile and Leon in 1369 on the death of Pedro
                    the Cruel, through his grandmother, Beatrice of Castile, and was favourably
                    received at Ciudad Rodrigo and Zamora. But the majority of the Castilian nobles
                    did not wish to see a Portuguese monarch on their throne, and welcomed the
                    illegitimate Henry of Trastamare as Henry II. of Castile. The contest ended in
                    1371 through the intervention of Pope Gregory XI., Ferdinand agreeing to
                    surrender his claims on Castile and to marry Leonora, daughter of Henry II.
                    However, in spite of the pope, this treaty was never carried out; Ferdinand had
                    seen and fallen passionately in love with Donna Leonora Telles de Menezes,
                    daughter of a nobleman in Tras-os-Montes and wife of Joao Lourenço da Cunha,
                    lord of Pombeiro. For love of this lady, whom he eventually married, he refused
                    to fulfil his treaty with Castile; but Henry II. strongly resented this insult,
                    and taking up arms invaded Portugal and laid siege to Lisbon. Ferdinand entered
                    into negotiations with John of Gaunt, who also claimed Castile through his wife
                    Constance (daughter of Pedro the Cruel), and he signed a treaty of alliance
                    through his ambassador, Joâo Fernandes Andeiro, with Edward III. of England.
                    Donna Leonora, however, did not approve of the English alliance, and in 1374
                    Ferdinand made peace with Castile through the mediation of Cardinal Guy of
                    Boulogne. The queen was now supreme, and terrible in her tyranny. She had not
                    even the merit of constancy, for she fell in love with Andeiro, the late
                    ambassador to England, and induced the king to make him count of Ourem.
                    Ferdinand himself continued to aspire to the throne of Castile; and in 1380,
                    after the death of Henry II., he again sent Andeiro to England to procure
                    assistance for a new war against Henry’s successor, John I. Richard II. of
                    England received the ambassador graciously, and in 1381 the earl of Cambridge,
                    brother of John of Gaunt, arrived with a powerful force, and his son Edward was
                    betrothed to Donna Beatrice, Ferdinand’s only child, who had been recognized as
                    heiress to the throne by a cortes at Leiria in 1376. But the Portuguese king, as
                    usual, failed to keep faith, and in 1383, under the influence of the queen, he
                    deserted the English, who then ravaged Portugal and made peace with John I. of
                    Castile at Salvaterra. By this treaty John I. engaged to marry Donna Beatrice,
                    and it was arranged that Queen Leonora should be regent of Portugal until
                    Beatrice’s eldest son came of age. Six months afterwards, on 2 2d October, King
                    Ferdinand died, and Donna Leonora assumed the regency.</p>
                <p>But she did not hold it long. The whole Portuguese people detested her, and their
                    feeling of nationality was outraged by the contemplated union of their crown
                    with that of Castile. Dorn John, grandmaster of the Knights of St Bennett of
                    Aviz, and an illegitimate son of Pedro the Severe, shared both the personal
                    hatred for the queen and the political desire for independence, and on 6th
                    December he headed an insurrection at Lisbon and slew the queen’s lover,
                    Andeiro, in the precincts of the palace. Leonora fled to Santarem and summoned
                    John I. of Castile to her <pb break="no"

                    Portugal, Joâo das Regras being appointed chancellor and Nuno Alvares Pereira
                    constable. Dorn John sent to England for assistance, which was promised him, and
                    put the capital in a state of defence. In 1384 John of Castile entered Portugal
                    and formed the siege of Lisbon. The resistance was worthy of the cause; the
                    archbishop of Braga fought like a knight; but a pestilence in the besiegers’
                    camp did them more mischief than even the bravery of the besieged, and John I.
                    had to retire defeated. Before doing so he discovered that Donna Leonora had
                    plotted to poison him, so he seized her and imprisoned her in the convent of
                    Tordesillas, where she died in 1386. But it availed little to have repulsed one
                    Castilian army; the relative sizes of Portugal and Castile made it obvious that
                    the struggle λvould be a severe one; the independence of Portugal was at stake,
                    and the Portuguese fought as men fight for their existence as a nation. The
                    heroic constable, who won the surname of the “Holy Constable,” defeated the
                    Castilians at Atoleiro and Trancoso. On 6th April 1385 a cortes assembled at
                    Coimbra, and declared the crown of Portugal to be elective, choosing, at the
                    instance of the chancellor, Dom John to be king of Portugal. King John then
                    called afi his chivalry together, with the freemen of his cities, and, with the
                    help of 500 English archers, utterly defeated a superior Castilian army at
                    Aljubarrota on 14th August, and in the following October the Holy Constable
                    destroyed another army at Valverde. These blows greatly weakened the prestige of
                    Castile and increased that of Portugal, and when John of Gaunt arrived the
                    following year with 2000 lances and 3000 archers the king of Castile sued for
                    peace. King John of Portugal perceived the advantage of the friendship and
                    alliance of England, and on 9th May 1386 was signed the treaty of Windsor, by
                    which the two countries were to be allies for ever in every transaction. He drew
                    the alliance still closer in 1387 by marrying Philippa of Lancaster, a daughter
                    of John of Gaunt by his second marriage; and a truce was made between Portugal
                    and Castile, and renewed at intervals until a final peace was signed in 1411.
                    The only attempt made to disturb King John I. was an incursion by the eldest son
                    of Ines de Castro, Dorn Diniz, in 1398, assisted by Henry III. of Castile, but
                    the legitimate claims of the prince carried no weight against the conqueror of
                    Aljubarrota, and he retired discomfited. The long reign of John I. was, like
                    that of King Diniz, a reign of peaceful development: Diniz had settled and
                    united the country after the Moorish wars; John did the same after the obstinate
                    war with Castile, and at the end of his reign saw Portugal beginning to expand
                    beyond the sea. The keynotes of his foreign policy were friendship with England
                    and peace with Castile. Henry IV., Henry V., and Henry VI. of England all
                    successively ratified the treaty of Windsor; Richard II. sent troops to help
                    King John against Dorn Diniz in 1398; Henry IV. made him a knight of the Garter
                    in 1400; and Henry V. sent him help in the expedition to Ceuta in 1415. John’s
                    internal government was not so happy, for, though personally a clever
                    administrator, he had had, in order to maintain himself when he claimed the
                    crown, to grant vast privileges and estates to the nobles, who became more and
                    more powerful, and, by their exercise of full feudal rights, almost independent.
                    It was at the earnest request of his three elder sons, Dorn Duarte or Edward,
                    Dorn Pedro, and Dorn Henry, that he consented to invade Africa in 1415. The
                    young princes desired to win their knightly spurs; there were no enemies at
                    home; and what could be more proper than to attack the old hereditary foes of
                    Portugal, the Moors, in Morocco itself? The queen from her deathbed sent her
                    blessing; the princes proved themselves worthy sons of their father; and by the
                    occupation of Ceuta the</p>
                <p>Portuguese made their first conquest beyond the limits of their country. The
                    expedition over, the elder princes each followed his own bent: Dorn Edward
                    assisted his father in the labours of government; Dorn Pedro, who was made duke
                    of Coimbra, travelled throughout Europe, and showed himself everywhere a learned
                    and accomplished as well as brave knight; and Dorn Henry, who was master of the
                    Order of Christ, governor of Algarves, and duke of Viseu, established himself at
                    Sagres, and devoted his life to the encouragement of maritime exploration, for
                    an account of which see vol. x. pp. 179, 180. Portuguese discoveries thus made
                    illustrious the closing years of the reign of King John, who died in 1433.</p>
                <p>Contrary to expectation, the reign of King Edward (so called after Edward III. of
                    England) proved, in spite of his own great qualities, but short, and was marked
                    by one signal disaster. On ascending the throne he summoned a full cortes at
                    Evora and secured the passing of the Lei Mental, or the provision which was
                    supposed to be in the mind of King John when he gave his extensive grants to the
                    nobility, namely, that they could only descend in the direct male line and on
                    failure should revert to the crown. By this means Edward hoped to check the
                    excessive power of the nobles, many of whom fled to Castile. He supported his
                    father’s policy, married a princess of Aragon, and, after confirming the treaty
                    of Windsor, was made a knight of the Garter in his father’s room. He also
                    encouraged the explorations of Dorn Henry; but the king’s life was shortened and
                    Dorn Henry’s explorations were checked for a time by the fatal expedition to
                    Tangiers in 1436. At the earnest request of his youngest brother Dorn Ferdinand
                    and of Dorn Henry himself, and in spite of the remonstrances of the pope and Dom
                    Pedro, the king sent a fleet to attack Tangiers; the army was cut off, and it
                    was only by sacrificing Dorn Ferdinand as a hostage that the troops were allowed
                    to retire to their ships. The imprisonment of his brother preyed on King
                    Edward’s mind, and he died in 1438, while Dorn Ferdinand, after a long and cruel
                    captivity at Fez, borne with such exemplary piety as to win him the title of
                    “the Constant Prince,” died from ill-treatment in 1443.</p>
                <p>The new king, Affonso V., was a minor, and his reign . began with a struggle for
                    the regency between his mother, Donna Leonora, and his uncle, Dorn Pedro, duke
                    of Coimbra. The people of Lisbon supported the latter, who was recognized as
                    regent; and his conduct justified the choice. He pursued his brother’s policy of
                    curbing the pretensions of the nobles, and encouraged Dom Henry’s work of
                    discovery, which advanced every year. Dorn Pedro’s power was seemingly at its
                    height in 1447 when Affonso V. was declared of age and at the same time married
                    his cousin Leonora, daughter of Dorn Pedro; but the duke of Braganza poisoned
                    the king’s mind against his uncle, and schemed his dismissal from court. Then,
                    not satisfied with this, he marched against him with a royal army, largely
                    recruited by the nobility, who hated the duke of Coimbra. The two forces met at
                    Alfarrobeira on 20th May 1449, when the regent was slain, to the great regret of
                    the Portuguese people. The young king fell more and more under the influence of
                    the duke of Braganza and his sons, who humoured his desire for knightly fame and
                    his dream of sitting on the throne of Castile, and who secured to themselves
                    vast grants of royal property. This knightly idea appears in Affonso’s three
                    expeditions to Africa, which won him the surname of “the African”: in 1458 he
                    took Alcâcer Seguier; in 1461 he failed; and in 1471 he took Arzilla and
                    Tangiers. Meanwhile maritime exploration went on apace; but in 1460 Dorn Henry
                    the Navigator, the heart and soul of these maritime enterprises, died. The “Ré

                    winning Castile; for that purpose he married in 1475 his own niece, the infanta
                    Joanna, only daughter of Henry IV. of Castile, and claimed the kingdom; but the
                    Castilians preferred the infanta Isabella, who had married Ferdinand, king of
                    Aragon. The rival parties took up arms; and the king of Portugal was utterly
                    defeated at Toro in 1476, which sent him hurriedly to France to beg help from
                    Louis XI.; but his mission was in vain, and he saw no alternative save signing
                    the treaty of Alcantara (1478), by which his newly-won wife was sent to a
                    convent. He remained inconsolable at his loss, and alternately abdicated and
                    returned until his death in 1481.</p>
                <p>His successor, John II., was a monarch of a very different type: though he had
                    proved himself a brave and valiant soldier at the battle of Toro, he pursued the
                    old policy of the house of Aviz, that of peace and family alliances with Castile
                    and of commercial intimacy with England. But he was also a typical king of this
                    period, and followed the example of Louis XI. in France and Henry VII. in
                    England in breaking the power of the nobles, with the hearty acquiescence of the
                    people. Besides political reasons for this policy, he remembered that he was the
                    grandson of the great duke of Coimbra, and bound to revenge his murder at
                    Alfarrobeira. The first act of his reign was to summon a full cortes at Evora,
                    at which it was decreed that the royal corregidors should have full right to
                    administer justice in all the feudal dominions of the nobility. This act brought
                    him of course into direct conflict with the nobility, who were headed by
                    Ferdinand, duke of Braganza, to the king’s great delight, for, as he said, the
                    wanton liberality of his father had left him only the high roads of Portugal for
                    his inheritance. Hence the duke of Braganza was naturally the first object of
                    the king’s attack. He was the wealthiest nobleman not only in Portugal but in
                    the whole Peninsula; his brothers held the high offices of constable and
                    chancellor of the kingdom, and they too had all assisted in the overthrow of the
                    duke of Coimbra. He believed himself to be safe because he and the king had
                    married sisters, but he was promptly arrested for high treason, and after a very
                    short trial executed at Evora on 22d June 1483. His own and the king’s
                    brother-in-law, Ferdinand, duke of Viseu, a grandson of King Edward, succeeded
                    to the leadership of the nobles; but John II., imitating Louis XI.’s policy of
                    not sparing his own family, stabbed him with his own hand at Setubal on 23d
                    August 1484, and afterwards executed some eighty of the leading nobles, breaking
                    the feudal power of the class for ever. This terrible struggle over, he occupied
                    himself with such success in administration that he won the surname of “the
                    Perfect King.” But he did not intend to keep the Portuguese in idleness. He was
                    surrounded by the gallant knights who had been trained by his father, and who,
                    though now frightened out of treason, yet needed some occupation, and at his
                    court were the famous navigators trained by Dorn Henry. In 1484 he built a fort
                    at La Mina or Elmina to cover the increasing trade with the Gold Coast, and in
                    1486 Bartholomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope and reached Algoa Bay. The
                    king was full of plans for reaching India and discovering Prester John; besides
                    despatching a special expedition for this purpose in 1487, he sent Pedro de
                    Evora and Gonçalo Annes to Timbuctoo, and Martim Lopes to Nova Zembla to find a
                    north-east road to Cathay. With all his perspicacity, he made the great mistake
                    of dismissing Columbus in 1493 as a visionary; but he was occupied to the very
                    last day of his life in getting ready the fleet with which Vasco de Gama was to
                    find out the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope (see vol. x. p. 181 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.).</hi> It was in his reign, in 1494, that the pope issued his
                    famous bull dividing the undiscovered parts of the world between Spaniards and
                    Portuguese. A great sorrow darkened the later years of John II. in the death of
                    his only son Affonso, who in 1490 had married Isabella, eldest daughter of
                    Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain; and he himself died in the flower of his age in
                    1495.</p>
                <p>The reign of Emmanuel “the Fortunate,” brother of the murdered duke of Viseu, is
                    the heroic period of Portuguese history. The great men and brave knights of the
                    reigns of Affbnso V. and John II. were still living, and Vasco de Gama,
                    Francisco de Almeida, and Affbnso de Albuquerque were to make their king’s reign
                    for ever glorious. Yet Emmanuel personally contributed L <hi rend="superscript">
                    ι</hi> t little to this glory; his one idea was to sit on the throne of Castile.
                    To gain this end he proposed to marry Isabella, eldest daughter of Ferdinand and
                    Isabella and widow of Dorn Affbnso, and to win her hand he consented to expel
                    the Jews from Portugal, although they were the richest and most useful class of
                    people in the kingdom, and had been faithfully protected ever since the days of
                    Affbnso Henriques. He married Isabella in 1497, and was on a progress through
                    Spain in the following year for the purpose of being recognized as heir to the
                    throne, when βhe died suddenly at Toledo, and with her disappeared his great
                    hopes. Even then he did not despair, but in 1500 married his deceased wife’s
                    sister, Maria, though her elder sister Joanna was also married, and had a son,
                    who was afterwards the emperor Charles V. While the king was thus occupied great
                    things were being done in Asia by his subjects. In 1497 Vasco de Gama had
                    crossed the Indian Ocean and reached Calicut; in 1500 Pedro Alvares Cabral
                    discovered Brazil on his way to India; in 1502 Vasco de Gama paid his second
                    visit to the Malabar coast; in 1503 Duarte Pacheco defended Cochin and with 900
                    Portuguese defeated an army of 50,000 natives; and in 1505 Francisco de Almeida
                    was appointed first viceroy of India. This is not the place to dilate on the
                    great deeds of <hi rend="smallcaps">Albuquerque</hi> (ç.v.) and of the
                    Portuguese in India; it is enough here to mark the dates of a few of the most
                    important discoveries and feats of arms which illustrate the reign of Emmanuel.
                    In 1501 Joâo da Nova discovered the island of Ascension and Amerigo Vespucci the
                    Rio Plata and Paraguay; in 1509 Diogo Lopes de Sequieira occupied Malacca; in
                    1510 Affbnso de Albuquerque occupied Goa; in 1512 Francisco Senâo discovered the
                    Moluccas; in 1515 Lopes Soares built a fort at Colombo in the island of Ceylon;
                    in 1517 Fernando Peres Andrada established himself at Canton, and made his way
                    to Peking in 1521; and in 1520 Magalhâes (Magellan), a Portuguese sailor, though
                    in the Spanish service, passed through the straits which bear his name.</p>
                <p>The reign of John III., who succeeded Emmanuel in 1521, is one of rapid decline.
                    The destruction of the feudal power of the nobility by John II. had not been an
                    unmixed good: it had fatally weakened the class of leaders of the people; the
                    nobility lost all sense of patriotism and intrigued for “moradias,” or court
                    posts; and, in short, their position was much the same as that of the French
                    nobility before the Revolution of 1789. The overthrow of their power had also
                    made the king absolute; having now no feudal nobility to combat, he had no need
                    of the support of the people, and the newly-created Indian trade brought him an
                    income greater than that of any prince in Europe, so that he had no need of
                    taxes. There was, however, a more serious cause of the declining power of
                    Portugal than the absolutism of the government, and that was the rapid
                    depopulation of the country. Alemtejo and Algarves had never been thoroughly
                    peopled; the devastation produced by constant war could not be easily repaired;
                    and, though the exertions of Diniz the Labourer had made <pb break="no"

                    the kingdom was chiefly in the hands of the military orders, who did not
                    sufficiently encourage immigration. The great discoveries of the 15th century
                    quickened the depopulation of Portugal. Not only did the bulk of the young men
                    gladly volunteer as soldiers and sailors to go in search of wealth and honour,
                    but whole families emigrated to Madeira and the Brazils. Also the Portuguese who
                    did continue to live in their native country flocked to Lisbon, which trebled in
                    population in less than eighty years, owing to the large fortunes which could be
                    made there in trade. The king, the nobles, and the military orders were quite
                    unconcerned at this extensive emigration, for their large estates were
                    cultivated much more cheaply by African slaves, who were imported from the time
                    of the first voyages of Dom Henry in such numbers that Algarves was entirely
                    cultivated by them, and even in Lisbon itself they outnumbered the freemen by
                    the middle of the 16th century. In this respect the condition of Portugal
                    resembled that of Italy at the time of the decline of the Roman empire, as the
                    wealth of Lisbon resembled that of imperial Rome, while in another respect the
                    utter corruption of the officials in the factories and Indian settlements too
                    far resembled the peculation and corruption of the Roman proconsuls. While the
                    Portuguese nation was exhibiting these signs of a rapid decline, another factor
                    was added by the religious zeal of John III. This king inherited his father’s
                    bigotry and fanaticism, and was anxious to introduce the Jesuits and the
                    Inquisition into Portugal. The Church of Rome was not likely to hinder his pious
                    desire, but for several years the “neo-Christians ”—the name given to the
                    halfhearted converts made from the Jews as the condition of their remaining in
                    Portugal—managed to ward off the blow. But the king’s earnest wish was gratified
                    at last, and in 1536 the tribunal of the Holy Office was established in Portugal
                    with the bishop of Ceuta as first grand inquisitor, who was soon succeeded by
                    the king’s brother, the cardinal Henry. The Inquisition quickly destroyed all
                    that was left of the old Portuguese spirit, and so effectually stamped out the
                    Portuguese revival of literature that, while towards the close of the 16th
                    century all Europe was becoming civilized under the influence of the
                    Renaissance, Portugal fell back and her literature became dumb. The king had his
                    reward for his piety: he was permitted to unite the masterships of the orders of
                    Christ, Santiago, and Aviz with the crown, and to found new bishoprics at
                    Leiria, Miranda, and Porto Alegre; but it was left to St Francis Xavier to show
                    the real beauty of Christianity in his mission to the Indies.</p>
                <p>It was in India that the decline of the Portuguese was most perceptible. Nuno da
                    Cunha, son of the discoverer Tristan da Cunha, governed the Indian settlements
                    worthily till 1536, and then corruption undermined all prosperity until the
                    arrival of Dorn Joâo de Castro in 1545. He was a Portuguese hero of the noblest
                    type; and for three years the friend of St Francis Xavier revived the glories of
                    Albuquerque by winning the battle of Diu, and then died in the missionary’s
                    arms. Everything went afterwards from bad to worse, till even observers like the
                    Dutchman Cleynaerts saw that, in spite of all its wealth and seeming prosperity,
                    the kingdom of Portugal was rotten at the core and could not last. King John
                    III., satisfied with peace and the establishment of the Inquisition in his
                    kingdom, did nothing to check the decline; and he endeavoured to secure his aims
                    by the marriage of his only surviving son John to his niece Joanna, a daughter
                    of Charles V., but he had the misfortune to outlive his son, who died in 1554.
                    When he himself died in 1557 he left the crown to his grandson, a child of three
                    years old, the ill-fated Dom Sebastian.</p>
                <p>Nothing could be more disastrous for Portugal than the succession of a minor at
                    this juncture. Under the will of John III. the regency was assumed by Queen
                    Catherine and the cardinal Henry, his widow and his brother, but all power was
                    exercised by the brothers Luis and Martini Gonçalves Camara, of whom the former
                    was the young king’s tutor and confessor and the latter prime minister. In 1568
                    Dorn Sebastian was declared of age by the Camaras, who thus excluded the
                    cardinal from even a semblance of power. As the king came to take more interest
                    in affairs, the mixture of imperiousness, fanaticism, and warlike ambition which
                    made up his character began to make its mark upon his reign. He tried to check
                    the luxury of his people by a sumptuary edict that no one might have more than
                    two dishes for dinner; he encouraged the Inquisition; and he dreamt of a new
                    crusade in Africa for the conquest and conversion of the Moors. His crusading
                    ardour was most objectionable to his people, who had highly approved of John
                    III.’s surrender of all ports in Africa except Ceuta, Tangiers, Arzilla, and
                    Mazagan, but the Jesuits and young courtiers about his person encouraged him in
                    his wild ideas. In 1574 he paid a short visit to Ceuta and Tangiers, and in
                    1576, to his great delight, Mouley Ahmed ibn 'Abdallâh, after being disappointed
                    in his application to Philip II. for help against Mouley 'Abd al-Melik, sultan
                    of Morocco, applied to Sebastian. The king proceeded to raise money by harsh
                    taxes on the converted Jews and by partial bankruptcy, and set sail for Africa
                    on 24th June 1578 with 15,000 infantry, 2400 cavalry, and 36 guns; of this army
                    only some 10,000 were Portuguese, the rest consisting of Spanish and German
                    volunteers and mercenaries, and 900 Italians, under Sir Thomas Stukeley, whom,
                    when on his way to deliver Ireland from Elizabeth, Sebastian had stopped. On
                    reaching Africa the Portuguese king was joined by Mouley Ahmed with 800
                    Mohammedans. He at first amused himself with hunting, and then, just as Dorn
                    Ferdinand had done in 1436, he foolishly left his base of operations, his fleet,
                    and the sea, and began to march over the desert to attack Larash (El-Araish).
                    Mouley 'Abd al-Melik, who had previously endeavoured to dissuade the young king
                    from his purpose, collected an army of 40,000 cavalry, 15,000 infantry, and 40
                    guns, and, feeling that he was himself on the point of death from a mortal
                    disease, ordered an instant attack upon the Portuguese at Al cheer Quibir, or
                    Al-kasr al-Kebir, on 4th August 1578. Dorn Sebastian behaved like a brave
                    knight, though he had not been a prudent commander, and when all was lost he was
                    determined to lose his own life also. According to the most trustworthy account,
                    Christovâo de Tavora, his equerry, had shown a flag of truce, and had offered to
                    surrender with the fifty horsemen who still remained about the king, when
                    Sebastian suddenly dashed on the Moorish cavalry, who, irritated by this breach
                    of faith, instantly slew him and the brave equerry who had followed his master.
                    The slaughter was terrible; Mouley 'Abd al-Melik died during the action; Mouley
                    Ahmed was drowned; Sir Thomas Stukeley was killed, with many of the chief
                    Portuguese nobles and prelates, including Don Jayme de Braganza (brother of the
                    sixth duke of Braganza), the duke of Aveiro (who had commanded the cavalry), and
                    the bishops of Coimbra and Oporto, while among the prisoners were the duke of
                    Barcellos and Duarte de Menezes. The sad news was brought to Lisbon by the
                    admiral of the fleet, Dorn Diogo de Sousa, and the cardinal Henry was proclaimed

                    five to Emmanuel can be best perceived from the following table :—It clearly
                    appears that the heiress to the throne was Catherine, duchess of Braganza, and
                    failing her heirs the duke of Parma, and that the claims of Philip II. and of
                    the duke of Savoy were only valid in case of the extinction of the line of Dorn
                    Edward. Yet, though the university of Coimbra declared in favour of the duchess
                    of Braganza, Philip II. set to work to win over the majority of the cortes.
                    Money and lavish promises assisted the eloquence of his two chief supporters,
                    Christovào de Moura and Antonio Pinheiro, bishop of Leiria; and when the
                    cardinal-king died on 31st January 1580 the cortes was quite ready to recognize
                    Philip, although the people, or rather that small portion of the inhabitants who
                    were really Portuguese, felt their old disinclination towards the union of Spain
                    and Portugal. Philip prevented any movement on the part of the duke of Braganza
                    by promising him Brazil with the title of king, and a marriage between the
                    prince of the Asturias and his daughter, which, as the duke hated war and loved
                    ease, were readily accepted; but to Philip’s surprise a competitor whom he had
                    taken no account of, Antonio, the prior of Crato, declared himself king at
                    Santarem, and then entered Lisbon and struck money. Portugal, however, enervated
                    by wealth, oppressed by the Inquisition, and reduced in free population, felt no
                    inclination to make a powerful stand against Philip, who had all the prestige of
                    being the son of Charles V., while the hotheaded but incapable prior of Crato
                    could not be compared to the great John I.; and the cortes, which had in 1385,
                    under the honeyed words of Joâo das Regras, enthusiastically fought for
                    Portugal, in 1580 listened to the promises of Christovâo de Moura and rejected
                    the prior of Crato. The duke of Alva entered Portugal at the head of a Spanish
                    army and easily defeated Dorn Antonio at Alcantara, after which Philip was
                    declared king of Portugal.</p>
                <p>The other candidates were obliged to acquiesce in Philip’s success; the duke of
                    Braganza, though greatly disappointed at receiving only the office of constable
                    and the order of the Golden Fleece instead of the whole of Brazil, was, like the
                    majority of his countrymen, too apathetic to strike a blow. Philip pledged
                    himself to recognize the individuality of Portugal in a cortes held at Thomar in
                    1581, when he promised that he would maintain the rights and liberties of the
                    people, that the cortes should be assembled frequently, that all the offices in
                    the realm should be given to Portuguese alone, that no lands or jurisdiction in
                    Portugal should be given to foreigners, and that there should be a Portuguese
                    council, which should accompany the king everywhere and have entire charge of
                    all Portuguese affairs. But the lower classes refused to believe that Dorn
                    Sebastian was dead,—a belief encouraged by the stratagem of a λvounded noble on
                    the evening of the battle of Al-kasr al-Kebfr to gain admission into the city of
                    Tangiers by asserting that he was the king; and four successive impostors arose,
                    who assumed the name of the dead monarch. The first two, who were mockingly
                    called the “king of Pennamacor” and the “king of Ericeira,” were Portuguese of
                    low birth, who were recognized by a few people in the vicinity of their native
                    villages, and easily captured in 1584 and 1585; the third, Gabriel Espinosa, was
                    given out as Dorn Sebastian by a Portuguese Jesuit, and introduced as such to
                    Donna Anna, a natural daughter of Don John of Austria, who believed in him, but
                    he was executed in 1594; while the fourth, a poor Calabrian named Marco Tullio,
                    who could not speak a word of Portuguese, asserted his pretensions at Venice as
                    late as 1603, twenty-five years after Dorn Sebastian’s death, and, after
                    obtaining some success in Italy, was also captured, sent to the galleys, and
                    afterwards executed. Of more importance were the renewed attempts of the prior
                    of Crato to assert his claims with the assistance of foreign allies. In 1582 he
                    proceeded to the Azores with a strong French fleet under Philip Strozzi, but his
                    ill-fortune followed him: Strozzi was defeated and killed in a battle with the
                    Spanish admiral Don Alvaro de Bacam, and Dorn Antonio fled to England. There
                    Elizabeth received him kindly, and in 1589 she sent a strong fleet under Drake
                    and Norris to help him win back his “kingdom”; but Drake and Norris quarrelled,
                    Portugal showed no willingness to receive him, nothing was done, and the English
                    retired. The unfortunate prior, finding that Elizabeth would do nothing more for
                    him, again returned to Paris, where he died in poverty in 1594.</p>
                <p>“The sixty years’ captivity,” as the domination of Spain over Portugal from 1580
                    to 1640 is called, was a time of disaster for the country: not only did the
                    English sack Faro in 1595, but Dutch, English, and French all preyed upon its
                    great colonial possessions; the Dutch in particular, after beating the
                    Portuguese in India, took from them the greater part of the lucrative Indian
                    trade. This they did with the more ease since, with the true commercial spirit,
                    they not only imported merchandise from the East to Holland but also distributed
                    it through Dutch merchants to every country of Europe, whereas the Portuguese in
                    the days of their commercial monopoly were satisfied with bringing over the
                    commodities to Lisbon, and letting foreign nations come to fetch them. The Dutch
                    incursion into the Indies was directly caused by Philip’s closing the port of
                    Lisbon to them in 1594; and in 1595 Cornelius Houtman, a Dutchman, who had been
                    employed by the Portuguese as an Indian pilot and then imprisoned by the
                    Inquisition, offered to lead a Dutch fleet to the Indies, and in 1597 they
                    erected a factory in Java. They speedily extended their sphere of operations by
                    occupying the Moluccas and Sumatra, and in 1619 they built Batavia as a rival
                    commercial capital in the East to Goa. The English quickly followed their
                    example; in the reign of Elizabeth the English captains had been content to
                    ravage Pernambuco in 1594-95, Fort Arguin in 1595, and the Azores in 1596, and
                    in the reign of James I. the East India Company was established in the Indies at
                    Surat. The French also settled themselves in Brazil and opened a flourishing
                    trade with South America and the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n569/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0569-0548"/> west coast of Africa; and even the Danes struck a
                    blow against the monopoly of the Portuguese by building a factory at Tranquebar.
                    To make up for these losses, what had Portugal received from Spain? The promises
                    made to the cortes at Thomar were all broken; the cortes was only summoned once
                    in 1619 to recognize Philip, the eldest son of King Philip III., as the heir to
                    the throne on the occasion of his only visit to Lisbon; Lerma and Olivares, the
                    all-powerful ministers of Philip III. and Philip IV., appropriated to themselves
                    large territories within the realm of Portugal; and, whenever it was possible,
                    Spaniards were installed in Portuguese bishoprics and civil offices.</p>
                <p>At last a blow was struck against this supremacy of Spain in the revolution of
                    1640 and the elevation of the house of Braganza to the throne of Portugal.
                    Things had been tending towards a revolution for a long time, but the final
                    impulse came from the energy of certain noblemen, conjoined with the weakness of
                    Spain and the hope of assistance from France.</p>
                <p>The general discontent was shown by risings in Lisbon in 1634 and in Evora in
                    1637, where for a short time the mob ruled the city; and, when Spain was
                    hampered by the Catalan revolt and the French war, the opportunity seemed
                    favourable for the Portuguese. The difficulty was to find a leader; the eighth
                    duke of Braganza, grandson of the infanta Catherine, daughter of Dorn Edward,
                    was a pleasure-loving, easy-tempered man, fond of music and hunting, quite happy
                    in his palace at Villa Viçosa; but the energy of his wife, Luiza de Guzman,
                    Castilian though she was, secured his passive co-operation, and his confidential
                    adviser, Joâo Pinto Ribeiro, soon formed a powerful band of conspirators among
                    the Portuguese noblemen, when the news arrived in 1640 that the arrière-ban of
                    Portugal was summoned to fight against the Catalans. Portugal was at that time
                    under the nominal government of Margaret of Savoy, duchess of Mantua, who was
                    surrounded with Spaniards and Italians; but the real government was in the hands
                    of the tyrannical secretary of state, Miguel de Vasconcellos de Brito. Ribeiro
                    had no difficulty in collecting together many daring and discontented noblemen,
                    of whom the chief were Miguel de Almeida, Pedro de Mendon ça Furtado, Antonio
                    and Luis de Almada, Estevâo and Luis da Cunha, Rodrigo and Emmanuel de Sâ, and
                    Jorge de Mello; and the archbishop of Lisbon himself, Rodrigo da Cunha, if not
                    actually a conspirator, certainly must have had a knowledge of what was going on
                    through his relatives the Almadas and Da Cunhas. The plot was carefully
                    elaborated, parts being assigned to the leading conspirators, and the day fixed
                    was the 1st of December. The plot was completely successful; the archbishop of
                    Lisbon was appointed lieutenant-general of the kingdom, with Almeida, Mendonça,
                    and A. de Almada for councillors, and expresses were sent off to the duke of
                    Braganza to inform him of all that had passed and to offer him the crown. He was
                    at first unwilling to accept the honour thrust upon him, but the duchess, on
                    whom a prophecy that she should be a queen had had a great effect, persuaded him
                    to go to Lisbon, where he was crowned as King John IV. on 13th December 1640.
                    The whole of Portugal at once rose and expelled the Spaniards, and on 19th
                    January a full cortes met at Lisbon, which recognized King John as king of
                    Portugal, and his son Theodosius as heir-apparent.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese knew well that, in spite of the Catalan rebellion and the terrible
                    wars in which Spain was engaged, they were not strong enough to maintain their
                    independence without foreign help, and at once sent ambassadors to France,
                    Holland, and England. Richelieu was charmed with the success of the revolution,
                    hoping to make Portugal a thorn in the side of Spain, such as Scotland had been
                    to England in former days, and he at once sent a fleet under De Brezé to the
                    Tagus; the Dutch also sent a fleet under Gylfels; but Charles I. of England was
                    too much occupied with his quarrels with his parliament to do more than merely
                    recognize the new king.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese were at first successful, owing to the many wars in which Spain
                    was involved, and, after the defeat which Mathias de Albuquerque inflicted on
                    the baron of Molingen at Montijo on 26th May 1644, felt at their ease in spite
                    of the serious plot of the duke of Caminha and the archbishop of Braga, until it
                    became obvious that Mazarin would desert them without compunction if it suited
                    his purpose. The old Portuguese colonies at once declared for their fatherland,
                    and this brought about a colonial war with Holland, in which indeed the
                    Portuguese generals won many successes, but which deprived them of the
                    assistance of the Dutch in Europe. Mazarin’s refusal to insist on their
                    independence at the congress at Münster, though he protected their envoys
                    against the Spaniards, made them despondent; and a very curious letter of
                    Mazarin’s (4th October 1647), offering the crown of Portugal to the duke of
                    Longueville, exhibits at once the feeble character of John IV., the despair of
                    the Portuguese, and their dependence on France. Mazarin’s desertion did not at
                    first do great harm, for the war between France and Spain continued, though
                    peace was made with the empire. In the midst of this universal war John IV. died
                    in 1656.</p>
                <p>As the prince of Brazil, Dom Theodosio, the eldest son of the late king, had
                    predeceased him, his second son Affonso, a boy of thirteen, succeeded to the
                    throne as Affonso VI. under the regency of his mother. The queen-regent, who had
                    always been more energetic than her husband, determined to pursue the war with
                    Spain with more vigour and summoned Marshal Schomberg to organize her armies.
                    The result of Schomberg’s presence soon appeared, and on 14th January 1659 Dorn
                    Antonio Luis de Menezes, count of Cantanhede, won a victory over Don Luiz de
                    Haro at Elvas. This victory in one way injured the Portuguese cause, for it so
                    incensed Don Luiz de Haro that, during the famous conferences at the Island of
                    Pheasants with Mazarin which led to the signature of the treaty of the Pyrenees
                    in 1659, he not only would not hear of any intercession for the Portuguese but
                    insisted on the insertion of a secret article in the treaty to the effect that
                    France would promise to entirely abandon them. Neither Mazarin nor Louis XIV.
                    intended to keep this secret article and give up the advantage of having such a
                    useful ally in the Peninsula, and they accordingly looked about for some means
                    to evade it. England offered the opportunity; Charles II. was seeking a wife and
                    gladly accepted the suggestion that he should marry Catherine of Braganza,
                    sister of the king of Portugal, both because Portugal had sheltered his cousins
                    Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice in 1650, and because the colonial cessions
                    which the queenregent offered as her daughter’s dowry would be very popular in
                    England. The marriage was accordingly agreed upon in 1661, and in 1662 the earl
                    of Sandwich came to bring the bride from Lisbon, while the English occupied
                    Tangiere, Bombay, and Galle as her dowry, and promised to send troops to
                    Portugal, and to make peace between the Dutch and the Portuguese. Before,
                    however, the English soldiers arrived and the final struggle with Spain began, a
                    family revolution had taken place in Portugal. The young king, a feeble vicious
                    youth, was very wroth that his mother had exiled a favourite valet to the
                    Brazils, and by the advice of two noblemen about his person suddenly declared
                    himself of age in 1662 and transferred the government to the able hands of Luis

                    retired to a convent chagrined, but Castel Melhor continued her policy, and
                    formed the English soldiers, who had arrived under the earl of Inchiquin, some
                    French and German volunteers and mercenaries, and the newly-organized Portuguese
                    levies into a powerful army, of which Schomberg was the real, though not the
                    ostensible, commander. With this army a series of victories were won, which
                    caused Affonso VI. to be surnamed “Affonso the Victorious,” though his own
                    successes, such as they were, were confined to the streets of Lisbon. On 8th
                    June 1663 the count of Villa Flor with Schomberg by his side utterly defeated
                    Don John of Austria, and afterwards retook Evora; on 7th July 1664 Pedro Jacques
                    de Magalhàes defeated the duke of Ossuna at Ciudad Rodrigo; on 17 th June 1665
                    the marquis of Marial va destroyed a Spanish army under the marquis of Carracena
                    at the battle of Montes Claros, and Christovâo de Brito Pereira followed up this
                    victory with one at Villa Viçosa. These successes entirely broke the power of
                    Spain, and peace was only a matter of time, when Castel Melhor decided to
                    increase both his own power and that of Portugal by marrying the king to a
                    French princess. Such an alliance was highly approved of by Louis XIV., and the
                    bride selected was Marie Françoise Elisabeth, Mademoiselle d’Aumale, daughter of
                    the duke of Savoy-Nemours and granddaughter of Henry IV. of France. The marriage
                    was celebrated in 1666; but Castel Melhor found that, instead of increasing his
                    power, it worked his ruin. The young queen detested her husband, and fell in
                    love with his brother Dorn Pedro; and after fourteen months of a hated union she
                    left the palace and applied for a divorce on the ground of non-consummation to
                    the chapter of the cathedralchurch of Lisbon, while Doni Pedro shut up King
                    Affonso in a portion of the palace and assumed the regency. He was recognized as
                    regent by the cortes on 1st January 1668, and at once signed a peace with Spain
                    on 13th February, by which the independence of Portugal was recognized in return
                    for the cession of Ceuta. This peace, signed at Lisbon, was chiefly negotiated
                    by the earl of Sandwich and Sir Richard Southwell, the English ambassadors at
                    Madrid and Lisbon. On 24th March the queen’s divorce was pronounced and
                    confirmed by the pope, and on 2d April she married the regent. His rule was
                    gladly submitted to, for the people of Portugal recognized his sterling
                    qualities, which compared favourably with those of the unfortunate Affonso VI.
                    Castel Melhor fled to France, and the king—for Dorn Pedro only called himself
                    “regent ”—was imprisoned, first in the island of Terceira and then at Cintra,
                    till his death in 1683, the very same year in which the queen also died.</p>
                <p>As long as Affonso VI. lived, Dorn Pedro’s power was not thoroughly established,
                    but in 1683 he was proclaimed king as Pedro II. His reign was marked by good
                    internal administration, the breaking out of the War of the Spanish Succession,
                    and the Methuen treaty. His good administration kept him from being short of
                    money, and enabled him to dispense with the cortes, which never met between 1697
                    and 1828; but the war of the succession almost emptied his treasury. He had in
                    1687, at the earnest request of the duke of Cadaval, his most intimate friend,
                    consented to marry again in order to have an heir, and had selected Maria Sophia
                    de Neuburg, daughter of the elector palatine, rather to the chagrin of Louis
                    XIV., who, in the prospect of the death of Charles II. of Spain, had counted on
                    the support of Pedro’s first wife, a French princess, and who now sought to form
                    a strong party at the court of Lisbon. He was so far successful that on the
                    death of Charles II. King Pedro not only recognized Louis XIV.’s grandson as
                    Philip V. of Spain but in 1701 protected a French fleet in the Tagus under the
                    count of Chastenau against Sir George Rooke. The great Whig ministry of England
                    was not likely to submit to this desertion on the part of England’s ancient
                    ally, and sent the Right Honourable John Methuen in 1703 to Lisbon with full
                    powers to make a treaty, both political and commercial, with Portugal. On 27th
                    December 1703 he signed the famous Methuen treaty, by which Portuguese wines
                    were to be imported into England at a lower duty than those from France or
                    Germany, in return for a similar concession to English textile fabrics. The
                    immediate result was that Pedro acknowledged the archduke Charles, and the
                    ulterior that Englishmen drank port wine instead of claret or hock throughout
                    the last century, while the Portuguese imported nearly everything they wanted
                    from England and remained without manufactures. On 7th March 1704 Sir George
                    Rooke arrived at Lisbon, convoying 10,000 English troops under Lord Galway and
                    the archduke Charles himself. The English army at once advanced with a
                    Portuguese auxiliary force and took Salvaterra and Valença. In the following
                    year but little was done on the Portuguese frontier, because the archduke had
                    sailed round to Barcelona, and Dorn Pedro, who was slowly dying, handed over the
                    regency to his sister Catherine, queen-dowager of England. Had he been conscious
                    he might have learned of the great successes of the allied army under Joâo de
                    Sousa, marquis das Minas, and Lord Galway, who in rapid succession took
                    Alcantara, Coria, Truxillo, Placencia, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Avila, and even for a
                    short time occupied Madrid, and of their equally rapid retreat; he never
                    recovered sufficiently, however, to know of these movements; he gradually sank,
                    and died at Alcantara on 9th December 1706.</p>
                <p>The long reign of John V., who assumed the royal state at once from the regent
                    Catherine, resembles the reign of John III. At its commencement he left the
                    power in the hands of his father’s friend, the duke of Cadaval, who continued
                    Dorn Pedro’s policy and prosecuted the war against Philip V. Cadaval bound the
                    king more surely to the Anglo-Austrian party by marrying him to the archduchess
                    Marianna, daughter of the deceased emperor Leopold I., who was escorted to
                    Lisbon by an English fleet under Admiral Byng in 1708. Yet the war itself did
                    not go favourably for the allies in Spain, for the Spaniards had become
                    enthusiastic partisans of Philip V.; and in 1709 a Portuguese army under the
                    marquis of Fronteira was beaten at Caia, while in 1711 Duguay Trouin took and
                    sacked Rio de Janeiro, afterwards the capital of Brazil. The war languished all
                    over Europe after the accession of the archduke Charles to the empire, and on
                    6th February 1715, nearly two years after the treaty of Utrecht, peace was
                    signed between Portugal and Spain at Madrid by the secretary of state, Lopes
                    Furtado de Mondonça, count of Côrte-Real. The king, as soon as he began to pay
                    more attention to affairs, exhibited his attachment to the papacy, and in 1717
                    sent a fleet at the pope’s bidding on a crusade against the Turks, which won a
                    naval victory off Cape Matapan. The king declined to join the war against
                    Alberoni, and disclosed a tendency to imitate Louis XIV., especially in
                    building. The only indication of policy he showed was his determination to
                    maintain peace by a close alliance with Spain: his daughter Maria Barbara was
                    married to the infant Don Ferdinand, eldest son of Philip V., who succeeded to
                    the throne of Spain as Ferdinand VI., while the Spanish infanta Marianna was
                    married to the Portuguese heir-apparent, Dorn Joseph. The enormous sums of money
                    which John V. lent to the pope, to the real impoverishment of his country,
                    brought him rewards which were of no real value, but which were such as he
                    highly esteemed; namely, the archbishopric of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n571/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0571-0550"/> Lisbon was erected into a patriarchate, and the
                    title of “Fidelissimus” or “Most Faithful” was conferred upon the kings of
                    Portugal, to correspond with those of “Most Christian” and “Most Catholic”
                    attributed to the kings of France and Spain respectively.</p>
                <p>Joseph, who succeeded his father in 1750, had the merit of perceiving the
                    pre-eminent powers of Sebastiâo de Carvalho, who governed Portugal throughout
                    this reign, and who, under his title of the marquis of Pombal (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pombal),</hi> ranks among the very greatest of 18th-century
                    statesmen. In everything—in his great internal and administrative reforms, in
                    his financial reforms, in the reorganization of the army, in the abolition of
                    slavery, and in the great struggle with the Jesuits—Joseph supported his
                    minister. Pombal made the king more absolute than ever, and exalted the royal
                    prerogative while using it for purposes of reform; and in return the king
                    maintained Pombal in power in spite of the violent protests of the priests and
                    the opposition of his wife. Circumstances greatly helped the minister to
                    establish an ascendency over the king’s mind: his conduct at the time of the
                    great earthquake on 1st November 1755 secured him his high position over the
                    other two secretaries of state; the Tavora plot gave him the influence which
                    enabled him to overthrow the Jesuits in 1759; and the second attempt on the
                    king’s life in 1769 strengthened his hands in his negotiations with Rome and
                    ensured the suppression of the order in 1773. The only war in -which Portugal
                    was engaged during this reign was caused by the close alliance λvith England,
                    for, -when Choiseul made the Family Compact and Spain entered upon the Seven
                    Years’ War, a Spanish army under the marquis of Sarria invaded Portugal and took
                    Braganza and Almeida in 1762. Pombal immediately applied to England for help,
                    when the count of Lippe-Bückeburg came over with a body of English troops and
                    set to work to organize the Portuguese army; and, mainly owing to the brilliant
                    services of BrigadierGeneral Burgoyne, the Spaniards were defeated at Valencia
                    de Alcantara and Villa Velha, and peace -was made on 10th February 1763. The
                    close of the reign was disturbed by disputes with Spain as to the possession of
                    Sacramento in South America, which were still unsettled when King Joseph died on
                    20th February 1777, leaving four daughters, of whom the eldest, Donna Maria
                    Francisca, had married the king’s brother, Dom Pedro.</p>
                <p>The accession of Donna Maria -was the signal for the overthrow of the great
                    marquis and the reversal of his policy. The new queen was a weak woman, and her
                    husband, Dom Pedro, who was proclaimed king, was a weak man; coins were struck
                    in the names of Pedro III. and Maria I., but both sovereigns were ruled by the
                    queendowager, who hated Pombal, and eventually sentenced him never to come
                    within twenty leagues of the court. The incapacity of his successor soon became
                    manifest, while the queen, who was completely under the sway of her confessor,
                    Dorn Ignacio de San Caetano, found her greatest happiness in raising and sending
                    large sums of money to the Latin convent at Jerusalem. Such was the state of
                    Portugal when the great crisis in the -world's history caused by the French
                    Revolution was at hand; and, when in 1792 it became evident that affairs could
                    no longer go on in this haphazard fashion, it was also evident that the queen
                    was no longer fit even for the slight fatigue she had to undergo. Her brain had
                    given way in 1788, after the successive deaths of her husband, of her eldest son
                    Dorn Joseph, who had married his aunt, Donna Maria Benedicta, and of her
                    confessor, and Dorn John found it necessary to take the management of affairs
                    into his own hands, though he was not actually declared regent until 1799.</p>
                <p>About the time that Dorn John became regent the wish to check the spread of the
                    principles of the French Revolution, which were as much feared in Portugal as in
                    all other Continental states, led to the great activity of Dorn Diogo Ignacio de
                    Pina Manique, the intendantgeneral of police. He eagerly hunted down all
                    Portuguese gentlemen suspected of encouraging French principles or of being
                    freemasons, expelled all Frenchmen from the kingdom, and kept a jealous eye on
                    the American consul, Edward Church, and a merchant named Jacome Ratton, whom he
                    declared to be at the head of a republican conspiracy. Moreover, the Portuguese
                    ministers not only combated the dreaded French principles at home, they also
                    believed it a holy duty to join in the general war against France, and therefore
                    a corps of 5000 men was sent into the eastern Pyrenees to serve under General
                    John Forbes Skelater, and four ships under the marquis of Niza joined the
                    English fleet in the Mediterranean. The Portuguese force under Forbes Skelater
                    served in all the actions in the eastern Pyrenees, shared in the successes of
                    General Ricardos, and in the defeats of the count de la Union and General
                    Urrutia; but nevertheless the Spanish Government, then under the influence of
                    Godoy, the Prince of the Peace, did not hesitate to desert Portugal and make a
                    separate peace -with the French republic at Basel in July 1795. This naturally
                    drove Portugal into a still closer alliance with England; and, when, after the
                    treaty of San Ildefonso (1796), by which Spain declared war against England, and
                    the secret convention between Pérignon and Godoy to divide Portugal between
                    them, Spanish troops were massed on the Portuguese frontiers, an urgent
                    supplication for help was sent to England. In response the House of Commons
                    voted Portugal a subsidy of £200,000; a force of 6000 men was despatched under
                    Major-General Sir Charles Stuart, which deterred the Spaniards from attempting
                    an invasion; and the prince of Waldeck, like the count of Lippe in former days,
                    was sent to reorganize the Portuguese army. Yet the English party was not strong
                    enough to carry the day entirely; Sir Charles Stuart was soon withdrawn, and an
                    effort made to secure peace with France through the mediation of Spain. But the
                    concessions of the French party were of no avail; the First Consul -was as
                    violently opposed to Portugal, as being a province of England, as the Convention
                    and Directory had been, and in 1800 Lucien Bonaparte was sent to Madrid with
                    instructions from his brother to insist on the abandonment of the English
                    alliance, on the opening of Portuguese ports to France and the closing of them
                    to England, on the extension of French Guiana to the Amazons, on the cession of
                    a portion of Portugal to Spain, until the recovery from England of Trinidad,
                    Port Mahon, and Malta, and on the payment of a large sum of money, and he was
                    authorized to offer to Spain a corps of 15,000 Frenchmen if these hard terms
                    -were rejected. The Portuguese ministers did reject them, and immediately
                    Leclerc’s corps entered Spain. The campaign lasted but a few days. Olivenza and
                    Campo Mayor fell into the hands of the Spaniards, who also won bloodless
                    victories at Arronches and Flor da Rosa. Peace was made at Badajoz with Spain,
                    by which Portugal ceded Olivenza, and at Paris with France, by which it
                    consented to the extension of French Guiana to the Amazons, and promised a large
                    indemnity. Napoleon Bonaparte was anything but satisfied with the treaty of
                    Badajoz, and received Lucien on his return with but little favour, for his aim
                    was utterly to destroy Portugal as a nation; and it was with a full intention to
                    excite her to war that he sent one of the roughest and least educated of his
                    generals, Lannes, as ambassador to Lisbon. Lannes acted fully up to his chief’s
                    expectations: he ordered the dismissal of all the ministers who favoured
                    England, and <pb break="no"

                    dislike of England owing to her high-handed naval policy. Even this humble
                    submission of the regent did not satisfy Napoleon, and in 1804 he replaced
                    Lannes by Junot, whom he ordered to insist upon Portugal’s declaring war against
                    England. Then for a time he desisted from executing his plans against the
                    country owing to his great campaigns in Europe, and made a treaty of neutrality
                    with the Portuguese Government. At length in 1807, having beaten Austria,
                    Prussia, and Russia, Napoleon again turned his thoughts to his project for the
                    annihilation of Portugal, which had become more than ever a thorn in his side,
                    since it refused to co-operate in his Continental schemes for ruining England.
                    He resolved at first to act with Spain and Godoy, as Pérignon had done in 1797,
                    and on 29th October 1807 signed the treaty of Fontainebleau, by which it was
                    arranged that Portugal should be conquered and divided into three parts: the
                    northern portion should be given to the* king of Etruria in the place of his
                    Italian kingdom, which Napoleon desired to annex, while the southern portion was
                    to be formed into an independent kingdom for Godoy, and the central provinces
                    were to be held by France until a general peace. The signature of the treaty was
                    followed by immediate action: Junot moved with an army rapidly across Spain,
                    and, together with a Spanish force under General Caraffa, entered Portugal from
                    the centre, while General Taranco and General Solano with two other Spanish
                    armies occupied the Minho and Alemtejo. With amazing rapidity Junot accomplished
                    the march, and the Portuguese hardly knew that war was imminent until on 27th
                    November Colonel Lecor rushed into Lisbon with the news that the French were in
                    possession of Abrantes. This alarming intelligence unnerved the regent, who
                    listened to the strongly-worded advice of Sir Sidney Smith, commander of the
                    English ships in the Tagus, to abandon his kingdom for the Brazils, and leave
                    the English to defend Portugal; and on 27th November Dorn John, after naming a
                    council of regency, went on board the English fleet with his whole family,
                    including the queen Maria I. The English ships had hardly left the Tagus when a
                    small force of wearied French soldiers, who were all that remained from the
                    terrible fatigues of the march, entered Lisbon on 30th November.</p>
                <p>Nothing proves more certainly the widely-spread existence of what were called
                    French principles—that is to say, democratic ideas—in Portugal than the hearty
                    reception which Junot met with from the first. At Santarem a deputation of the
                    freemasons of Portugal, who were there, as in other Continental countries, a
                    secret society for the propagation of democratic principles, welcomed him; the
                    marquis of Alorna with the army instantly submitted to him; and the council of
                    regency, knowing the temper of the citizens, made no attempt to hold Lisbon
                    against him. But Junot showed no desire to grant the Portuguese a constitution,
                    and after seizing all the money in the royal treasury he divided the country
                    into military governments under his generals, issuing, on 1st February a
                    proclamation that the house of Braganza had ceased to reign. He then began to
                    hope that he himself might succeed the Braganzas, and for this purpose sought to
                    conciliate the Portuguese by reducing the requisition demanded by Napoleon from
                    forty millions of francs to twenty millions, and commenced a negotiation with
                    the radical or French party in Portugal through Luca de Scabra da Silva to
                    induce them to send a petition or deputation to the emperor, asking for Junot to
                    be their king. But his attempts at conciliation were of no avail; and, when the
                    Spanish general Bellesta, who had succeeded Taranco at Oporto, seized the French
                    governor, General Quesnel, declared for the regent, and marched into Galicia,
                    Junot departed from Lisbon, leaving the city in the hands of a regency, headed
                    by the bishop of Oporto. The bishop at once sent to England for help, and
                    encouraged fresh revolts all over the kingdom, till nearly every city in
                    Portugal rose against the French and established its own junta of government.
                    Meanwhile the English Government had willingly listened to the request of the
                    bishop of Oporto, and ordered the small army which had been collected at Cork,
                    under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley, for an expedition
                    to South America, to proceed to Portugal. Sir Arthur landed at the mouth of the
                    Mondego river, advanced towards Lisbon, and, after defeating Laborde’s division
                    at Roliça on 17th August 1808, routed Junot himself at Vimieiro on 21st August.
                    These victories were followed by the convention of Cintra, by which Junot agreed
                    to vacate Portugal and give up all the fortresses in his possession; this
                    convention, however disappointing from a military point of view, was eminently
                    satisfactory to the Portuguese people, who saw themselves as speedily delivered
                    from the French as they had been conquered by them. The regency was again
                    established, and at once despatched Domingos Antonio de Sousa Coutinho, a
                    brother of the count of Lin-hares, to London, to ask that an English minister
                    with full powers should be sent to Lisbon, and that Sir Arthur Wellesley might
                    be appointed to reorganize their army. Their requests were complied with: the
                    Right Honourable J. C. Villiers was sent to Lisbon, and, as Sir Arthur Wellesley
                    could not be spared, Major-General Beresford, who had learned Portuguese when
                    governor of Madeira, which he had occupied in the preceding year, was sent to
                    command their army. Portugal, however, was not yet safe from the French; Sir
                    John Moore’s advance to Salamanca and his retreat to Corunna had left the
                    country but slightly garrisoned, and, in spite of the braggadocio of the bishop,
                    Oporto quickly fell into the hands of Marshal Soult. Fortunately Soult, like
                    Junot, -was led away by the idea of becoming king of Portugal, and did not
                    advance on Lisbon, thus giving time for Sir Arthur Wellesley again to arrive in
                    the country with a powerful army. In the interval the Portuguese, in spite of
                    some spirited fights by General Silveira, had shown how little they could do in
                    their disorganized state, and the English Government determined to send out
                    English officers to organize them and to take 10,000 Portuguese into English
                    pay. Meanwhile Sir Arthur Wellesley had driven Soult from Oporto, had advanced
                    into Spain, and won the battle of Talavera. From these successes of the English
                    general it is pitiable to turn to the Portuguese regency. With the departure of
                    the king all the able men of the royal party seemed to have left the country;
                    the leaders of the radical party were either in disgrace or had fled to France;
                    and none were left to compose the regency save a set of intriguers, whose chief
                    idea was to get as much money from England as possible. The best part of the
                    nation had entered the army, hence Marshal Beresford, aided by the
                    adjutantgeneral Manuel de Brito Mousinho, soon organized a force which at Busaco
                    proved itself worthy to fight beside the English soldiery. The regency got from
                    bad to worse, till neither Beresford nor Wellington could work with it, and the
                    English cabinet had to demand that Sir Charles Stuart (son of General Sir
                    Charles Stuart), their ambassador at Lisbon, should receive a place upon it. His
                    great ability and tact soon made him master, and a certain portion of the money
                    sent by England to pay the Portuguese troops did then find its way to its proper
                    destination. Yet the regency, even when thus strengthened, failed to make itself
                    popular; and that there was a large radical party in Lisbon is sufficiently
                    proved by the deputation of eighteen journalists to the Azores in September
                    1810. The troubles of Portugal were not yet over; the most formidable invasion
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n573/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0573-0552"/> of all was to come. During the time of Masséna’s
                    campaign in Portugal the Portuguese showed the valour of a truly heroic nation.
                    When Lord Wellington determined to retire to the lines of Torres Vedras, he
                    commanded all the peasants to desert their fields and leave nothing for the
                    French to subsist upon, and they obeyed him with touching fidelity. The
                    Portuguese troops fully proved their value as soldiers when led and trained by
                    such English generals as Pack and Ashworth, Bradford and John Hamilton, on every
                    battlefield in the Peninsula and the south of France, and especially at
                    Salamanca and the Nivelle. They well deserved the praise bestowed upon them by
                    Wellington and Beresford, and the enthusiastic reception which they met with
                    when they returned home in 1814.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the conclusion of the war, in 1816, the mad queen Maria I. died,
                    and the regent succeeded to the throne as King John VI. The English Government
                    earnestly pressed him to return to Lisbon, where dissensions in the regency and
                    the universal discontent urgently summoned him. But the new king was perpetually
                    hampered by his intriguing and ambitious wife, Cariota Joaquina, who, in order
                    to raise a party in her favour, had as early as 1805 promised a constitution to
                    the Portuguese, and in 1812 had plotted to become independent queen of Brazil.
                    The regency had become intensely unpopular, for Sir Charles Stuart and Marshal
                    Beresford ruled despotically; and the mass of the people, who had been willing
                    to endure the despotism of the English during the terrible war for existence, as
                    well as the army, which had willingly obeyed the English officers on the field
                    of battle, grew weary of foreign rule in time of peace and raised the cry of
                    Portugal for the Portuguese. Directly after the war, in 1817, the first rising
                    took place in Lisbon in the form of a pronunciamento of General Gomes Freire de
                    Andrade, who had commanded the Portuguese contingent in the Russian campaign of
                    1812; but it was instantly and cruelly suppressed by Beresford and the regency,
                    and the general and eleven others were executed. Yet the radical party was by no
                    means conquered, and when Beresford went to Rio de Janeiro in 1820 advantage was
                    taken of his absence by the people of Oporto, headed by certain officers in the
                    garrison, to raise the cry for reform; the regency, unable to act without
                    Beresford, gave way before a similar rising at Lisbon; the English officers were
                    everywhere expelled; a new regency was proclaimed; Beresford was not allowed to
                    land when he returned from Brazil; and a constituent assembly was summoned. The
                    new assembly, consisting largely of men of the most radical opinions, at once
                    abolished the Inquisition and the relics of feudalism, and proceeded to draw up
                    an impracticable constitution, which showed that they had studied the glowing
                    speeches of the men of the French Revolution and had not profited by a knowledge
                    of their mistakes. Prussia, Austria, and Russia withdrew their ambassadors, and
                    England insisted on John’s returning to his kingdom. He accordingly left the
                    Brazils to the government of his elder son Pedro, and set out for Portugal,
                    where in 1822, at the earnest request of that son, he solemnly swore to obey the
                    new constitution. He was at once met by the opposition of the queen and his
                    younger son Dorn Miguel, who refused to recognize the constitution; in
                    consequence they were expelled from Lisbon. This event, with the invasion of
                    Spain by the French to put down the rebellion of 1823, encouraged Francisco da
                    Silveira, count of Amarante, to raise a pronunciamento in Tras-os-Montes; but
                    the king at Lisbon declared, amid loud applause, that the constitution of 1822
                    was abrogated and his own absolutism restored, and he appointed the count of
                    Palmella, the head of the English or constitutional party, to be his minister.
                    But the absolutist party did not aim at a new form of constitutional government;
                    they were desirous to reinstate the old absolutism. The queen and Dorn Miguel
                    headed a new plot; the king’s friend, the marquis of Loulé, was assassinated;
                    Palmella was imprisoned and the king himself shut up in his palace. The united
                    action of the foreign ministers who had remained in Lisbon freed the king; the
                    new insurrection was suppressed; Palmella was again appointed minister; and the
                    king, with the two chief conspirators, the queen and Dom Miguel, left Portugal
                    once more for the Brazils. In the following year (1826) John VI. died, leaving
                    by his will his daughter, the infanta Isabel Maria, as regent, to the great
                    disappointment of Dorn Miguel, who had returned to Portugal with the expectation
                    of receiving it as his inheritance, while his brother Dorn Pedro ruled in
                    Brazil.</p>
                <p>The next twenty-five years are the darkest in the whole history of Portugal and
                    the most complicated to analyse, for the establishment of parliamentary
                    government was no easy task; it is almost impossible to follow the rapid changes
                    which succeeded each other, and quite impossible to understand the varying
                    motives of the different statesmen and generals. The keynote to the whole series
                    of the disturbances is to be found in the influence of the army. Beresford’s
                    creation was a grand fighting machine; but armies, and more particularly
                    generals, are almost certain to intrigue in times of peace. On ascending the
                    united thrones Dom Pedro IV. proceeded to draw up a charter containing the bases
                    of a moderate parliamentary government and sent it over to Portugal by the
                    English minister, Sir Charles Stuart, and then abdicated the crown of Portugal
                    in favour of his daughter, Donna Maria da Gloria, a child only seven years old,
                    on condition that she married his brother Dom Miguel, who was to recognize the
                    new constitution. The charter was received with joy by the parliamentary party,
                    and Palmella became prime minister; but in 1827 the king foolishly appointed Dom
                    Miguel to be regent in Portugal. This ambitious prince was exceedingly popular
                    with the old nobility, the army, and the poor; and, having declared himself
                    absolute king, he drove the whole constitutional or chartist party—Palmella,
                    Saldanha, Villa Flor, Sampaio, and their adherents—into exile. They fled to
                    England, where the young queen then was, but, although they found popular
                    opinion strongly in their favour, they found also that the duke of Wellington
                    and his Tory ministry highly approved of Dorn Miguel’s behaviour, and that they
                    persisted in confounding the moderate and the radical parties, and in believing
                    that Palmella was a democrat. Meanwhile the reign of Dorn Miguel had become a
                    reign of terror, and a new movement was begun by the conjoined chartist and
                    radical parties, who respectively advocated the charter of 1826 and the
                    constitution of 1822, but who sank their differences to oppose Dorn Miguel. The
                    island of Terceira (Azores) had never submitted to this prince, and there in
                    1829 the marquis of Palmella, the count of Villa Flor, and José Antonio
                    Guerreiro declared themselves regents for the young queen; and on 11th August
                    1830 they defeated in Praia Bay the fleet sent against them by Dorn Miguel. This
                    victory was the first ray of hope to the chartist party; all who could get away
                    from Portugal hastened to the Azores; and in 1831 Dorn Pedro, having resigned
                    the imperial crown of Brazil to his infant son, came to London to join his
                    daughter and prepare for a vigorous struggle against his brother. He met with
                    acquiescence, if not encouragement, from the Liberal Government of Earl Grey,
                    and managed to raise a large loan; then he betook himself with all the troops he
                    could raise to the Azores, where he appointed the count of Villa Flor
                    general-in-chief and Captain Sartorius of the English navy commander of the
                    fleet. In July 1832 Dorn Pedro arrived at Oporto with 7500 men, being
                    enthusiastically welcomed <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n574/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0574-0553"/> by the citizens; Dom Miguel instantly laid siege
                    to the city. The siege was a terrible one; want within the walls and cholera
                    among the besiegers decimated the armies, and the only real success gained was
                    the victory of Sartorius over the fleet of Dorn Miguel on 11th October. In 1833
                    more vigorous action began; Major-General Joào Carlos Saldanha de Oliveira e
                    Daun, count of Saldanha, an old officer of Beresford’s and a member of the
                    Palmella Government in 1825, took the command in Oporto and beat off the French
                    general Bourmont, who had been engaged by I)om Miguel to command his forces; the
                    count of Villa Flor sailed from Oporto to Algarves, defeated General Telles
                    Jordâo, and after a triumphal march northwards occupied Lisbon; and Captain
                    Charles Napier, who had succeeded Sartorius, destroyed Dorn Miguel’s fleet off
                    Cape St Vincent in 1833. In this year Queen Maria came to Lisbon and was
                    received with transports of delight, while Dorn Pedro as regent again proclaimed
                    the charter of 1826. The year 1834 was one of unbroken success for the
                    chartists; England and France recognized the queen, and the Spanish ministry of
                    Queen Isabella, knowing Dorn Miguel to be a Carlist, sent two corps under
                    Generals Rodil and Serrano to the help of Dorn Pedro. Saldanha defeated the
                    forces of the usurper at Torres Novas and Alamoster; Napier reduced Beira; Villa
                    Flor, who had been made duke of Terceira, reduced Tras-os-Montes and won a
                    victory at Asseiceira; Sâ de Bandeira reduced Alemtejo; the combined Spanish and
                    Portuguese armies surrounded the rest of Dorn Miguel’s adherents at Evora Monte;
                    and Dorn Miguel himself capitulated on 26th May. By the convention of Evora
                    Monte the usurper, on condition of receiving a pension, promised to leave
                    Portugal for ever; and the cortes at Lisbon not only declared him and his heirs
                    ineligible for the throne but forbade them to return to Portugal under penalty
                    of death. This same cortes attempted to arrange the finances, and abolished the
                    orders of the friars, who had hitherto kept alive the party of rebellion in the
                    villages, and finally, at Dorn Pedro’s request —for he felt his health
                    failing—declared the queen of age on 18th September 1834. Dorn Pedro, who had
                    throughout been the heart and soul of his daughter’s party, retired to Queluz
                    (near Lisbon), where he died six days afterwards from the effects of his great
                    labours and fatigues.</p>
                <p>The death of Dorn Pedro deprived Queen Maria II., who was now only fifteen, of
                    her greatest support, but a very strong ministry was formed, with the duke of
                    Palmella as president and the duke of Terceira at the war office. Such a
                    ministry might have lasted for a long time, but neither the queen, the nobility,
                    nor the people understood the principles of real constitutional government, and
                    the army was a constant source of danger. Members of different parties, while
                    not conceiving that all alike loved Portugal, believed sincerely in their own
                    opinions: the party in power proscribed and exiled its opponents, while the
                    party in opposition invariably appealed to arms instead of seeking to obtain
                    office by legitimate parliamentary means. In addition, the country was ravaged
                    by bands of brigands, who called themselves “Miguelites,” and who perpetually
                    escaped into Spain when attacked in force; and, as each Government refused to
                    recognize or pay interest upon the loans raised by its predecessors, the
                    financial credit of Portugal soon fell to a very low ebb in the money markets of
                    Europe. It is unprofitable to examine here the principles of the chief statesmen
                    of the time as new Governments quickly succeeded each other; it will be
                    sufficient to notice only the chief pronunciamentos and appeals to arms, and to
                    remark the gradual approach to real parliamentary government. Queen Maria da
                    Gloria’s reign is one of violent party struggles, for they can hardly be called
                    civil wars, so little did they involve, and that of King Luis the reign of
                    definite and peaceable parliamentary government. In her earlier years the queen
                    was chiefly under the influence of her stepmother, the second wife of Dorn
                    Pedro, Amelia of Bavaria, and in 1835 she married the queen-dowager’s brother,
                    Augustus Charles Eugène Napoleon, duke of Leuchtenberg, second son of Eugène
                    Beauharnais by the princess Augusta of Bavaria, who died two months after his
                    marriage, in March 1835. In the following January Maria married Prince Ferdinand
                    of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, nephew of Leopold, the first king of the Belgians; and it
                    was his nomination to the post of commander-in-chief that brought about the
                    first appeal to arms. In September 1836 Fernando Soares da Caldeira headed a
                    pronunciamento in Lisbon for the re-establishment of the constitution of 1822,
                    which was completely successful, and resulted in the drawing up of a new
                    constitution. The constitution of 1838, which was really that of 1822 slightly
                    modified, managed to work till 1842, when one of the radical ministers, Antonio
                    Bermudo de Costa Cabral, suddenly declared the charter of 1826 at Oporto. The
                    duke of Terceira headed a successful pronunciamento in favour of the charter,
                    and came into office with Costa Cabral as home secretary and virtual prime
                    minister. Costa Cabral, who in 1845 was created count of Thomar, made himself
                    very acceptable to the queen, and, interpreting the charter in the most royalist
                    sense, even attempted to check the freedom of the press. It was now the turn of
                    the radicals or Septembrists to have recourse to arms: after an attempt to place
                    Saldanha in office, the opposition broke out into open insurrection under the
                    viscount of Sâ de Bandeira, the count of Bomfim, and the count das Antas. This
                    new insurrection is known as the War of Maria da Fonte or “patuleia,” and was
                    not suj&gt;- pressed until the conclusion of the convention of Granada on 29th
                    June 1847, when a general amnesty was declared, Saldanha being continued in
                    power. Queen Maria da Gloria died on 15th November 1853, and her husband, the
                    king-consort, Dorn Ferdinand II., assumed the regency until his eldest son Dorn
                    Pedro V. came of age.</p>
                <p>The era of peaceful parliamentary government which succeeded the stormy reign of
                    Queen Maria II. has been one of prosperity for Portugal, and much of that peace
                    and prosperity is due to the great literary and historical revival which is
                    signalized by the names of Joâo Baptista de Almeida Garrett and Antonio
                    Feliciano de Castilho, of Alexandre Herculano de Carvalho e Araujo and Luis
                    Augusto Rebello da Silva. Men were not wanting in the early part of the 19th
                    century to advocate the formation of an Iberian republic or kingdom, comprising
                    the whole of the Peninsula; but the revival of national pride in recalling the
                    glorious past of Portuguese history, which has been the work alike of Herculano
                    and Almeida Garrett in diferent lines, has breathed afresh the spirit of
                    patriotism into a people who had been almost wearied out by continual
                    pronunciamentos. The only political event of any importance during the reign of
                    Dorn Pedro V., who came of age I and assumed the government in 1855, and who in
                    1857 married the princess Stephanie of Hohenzollern, was the affair of the
                    “Charles et Georges.” This French ship was engaged in what was undoubtedly the
                    slave-trade, though slightly disguised, off the coast of Africa, when it was
                    seized by the authorities of Mozambique, and, in accordance with the laws and
                    treaties against the slave-trade, its captain, Roussel, was condemned to two
                    years’ imprisonment. The emperor Napoleon III., glad to have a chance of posing
                    before the French people, and counting on his close alliance with England,
                    instantly sent a large fleet to the Tagus under Admiral Lavaud, and demanded
                    compensation, which, as England showed no signs of assistance, Portugal was
                    compelled to pay. The whole country, especially<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n575/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0575-0554"/> the city of Lisbon, was ravaged by cholera and
                    yellow fever during this reign, itself evidence of the extreme neglect of all
                    sanitary precautions; and on 11th November 1^61 the king, who refused to quit
                    the pestilence-stricken capital, died of cholera, and was speedily followed to
                    the grave by two of his brothers, Dorn Ferdinand and Dorn John.</p>
                <p>At the time of Dorn Pedro’s death his brother and heir, Dorn Luis, was travelling
                    on the Continent; and his father, Dorn Ferdinand, again assumed the regency
                    until his son’s return, soon after which Luis married Maria Pia of Savoy,
                    daughter of Victor Emmanuel, king of Italy. The new king followed his brother’s
                    policy and allowed his ministers to fight their battles in the chambers without
                    interference from himself. During his reign the old combatants of the reign of
                    Maria da Gloria died off one by one,—Palmella, Terceira, Thomar, Saldanha. and
                    Sâ de Bandeira. Their successors in political leadership, the duke of Loulé,
                    Aguiar, the marquis of Avila, and Antonio Manuel Fontes Pereira de Mello, though
                    not inferior in administrative ability, always avoided an appeal to arms, and
                    therefore, if they do not contribute striking pages to the history of Portugal,
                    certainly contributed more to the prosperity of the country. The last
                    pronunciamento, or rather attempt at a pronunciamento, of the last survivor of
                    Queen Maria’s turbulent statesmen, the duke of Saldanha, in 1870, only proved
                    how entirely the day of pronunciamentos had gone by. He conceived the notion
                    that the duke of Loulé, as a freemason and an advanced progressist, was a
                    favourite with the king, after the manner of the duke of Polignac and Charles X.
                    of France; so, recalling a few such historical examples to the king’s mind, he
                    insisted on the duke’s dismissal, and threatened an appeal to arms. The king,
                    perceiving that Saldanha was in earnest, and knowing the great influence of the
                    old man, consented to dismiss the duke of Loulé. After keeping Saldanha himself
                    in office for four months, Luis sent him as ambassador to London notwithstanding
                    his eighty years, where he could do no mischief, and where he died in 1876. The
                    steady prosperity of Portugal has been largely due to the present form of
                    government based on the charter of 1826, as modified in 1852, and is borne
                    witness to by the reconstitution of the House of Peers in 1878 from an
                    hereditary assembly to one of life peers. It is a notable fact that the two
                    loans raised by the Portuguese Government in 1880 and in 1882 were quickly
                    subscribed, and mainly within Portugal itself. Of recent years much attention
                    has been drawn to the Portuguese settlements in Africa, since the opening up of
                    the interior has made them of vast importance on both the east and the west
                    coast. The king, ministers, and people of Portugal are fully aware of the new
                    vista to their prosperity thus disclosed to them, and the Portuguese travellers
                    Serpa Pinto, Roberto Ivens, and Brito Capello have taken an important share in
                    the explorations which have opened up the interior of Africa and paved the way
                    for its development. Public works, however, have not been neglected, and Fontes
                    Pereira de Mello, the leader of the “regener-ador” party, who has been prime
                    minister three times— from 1871 to 1877, from 1878 to 1882, and from 1883— has
                    steadily improved and extended the railway and telegraph systems, and carried
                    out the more difficult labours of sanitary reform. Education also has not been
                    neglected, and a good system of secondary and primary education has been
                    established, mainly owing to the labours of the Portuguese poet, Antonio
                    Feliciano de Castilho. The share taken by the leaders of the great literary and
                    historical revival—which dates from the conclusion of the civil wars of 1846 and
                    the publication of the first volume of Herculano’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Portugal</hi> in 1848—in Portuguese political and social reform is a marked
                    feature of the modern parliamentary life of the country; and not only have the
                    poets Almeida Garrett and Mendes Leal and the historian Rebello da Silva held
                    office, but many of the most promising of the new generation of literary men,
                    such as Latino Coelho and Pinheiro Chagas, have distinguished themselves in
                    politics. Few countries so well realize the advantages of a constitutional and
                    parliamentary form of government as Portugal; socialism possesses there a
                    reforming, not a revolutionary force; unity of pride in their country inspired
                    by great wτiters has made the modern Portuguese ambitious to revive the glories
                    of the past, and united men of all shades of opinion in a common patriotism. The
                    Camoens celebration of 1880 showed that the Brazilians were still proud of their
                    mother-country, and that the Portuguese race all over the world was ready to
                    develop new energy and perseverance, and to prove its true descent from the men
                    who under Affonso Henriques overthrew the Moors, who under John I. and John IV.
                    rejected the rule of the Spaniards, under Affonso de Albuquerque and Joâo de
                    Castro conquered the East, and who by the voyage of Vasco de Gama created a new
                    era in the history of the world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bibliography.—</hi> The best continuous history of Portugal is

                    by J. L. Domingues de Mendonça (Lisbon, 1842-47), which quite eclipsed the very
                    ordinary works of Diogo Lemos (20 vols., 1786- 1820), Sousa Monteiro (10 vols.,
                    1838), and J. F. Pereira (3 vols., 1846-48), and the two chief English and
                    French histories up to that date,—J. Dunham’s (along with that of Spain) in

                    overthrew old legends and treated history scientifically. Owing, however, to the
                    persecution and libellous pamphlets of such men as Francisco Recreio, J. D.
                    Fonseca Pereira, and A. C. Pereira, he closed his work at the year 1279; but

                <p><hi> PART</hi> III.—LITERATURE.</p>
                <p>Portugal has a distinct literature as well as a distinct history, and one which
                    is intimately bound up with the growth of the nation. The biographies,
                    histories, and travels of the 16th century are unrivalled of their age in
                    brilliancy and vigour, while the poetry of a land where all men are singers is
                    not only admirable in itself but illustrates a continuous and undecided struggle
                    between native and foreign schools. The period of the growth of national
                    independence and of the victories over the Moors was that of the brilliant
                    poetry of the Portuguese troubadours, which became at last truly characteristic;
                    but the brilliancy speedily died aλvay with peace and national unity, to be
                    revived in the heroic period of Vasco de Gama and Albuquerque. For in the 16th
                    century, after the classical school of Sa de Miranda had given a polish to the
                    language, the national epics of Camoens and his followers were produced, which
                    might have yielded more lasting results had not the Spanish dominion paralysed
                    all national life. In more modern times the reaction against mere imitations of
                    foreign literature has resulted in the formation of a new native school by which
                    much good work both in poetry and in historical research has already been
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">12th to 14th Century.—</hi> The Portuguese, Gallegan, and Bable
                    dialects are subdivisions of that form of the Lingua Romana Rustica which was
                    spoken in Galicia and the western provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, and which
                    until the 15th'century was the literary language of Castile itself. The remains
                    of the early poets are necessarily scanty, but they are sufficient to show that
                    the courtly troubadours of Portugal and Castile were certainly not inferior to
                    the more noted singers of Provence. In some respects they were even superior,
                    since, not being tied to the forms of a merely literary language such as the
                    Provençal, they were able to borrow both form and matter from a vigorous
                    national poetry which can be traced through the different races which
                    successively occupied Portugal. The “alalâla,” which afterwards developed into
                    the “aravia,” the earliest form of the epic, is probably a legacy from the
                    original Turanian inhabitants; the “guayado,” a short lyric with the refrain
                    “ay” or “guai,” was derived from their Celtic successors; the “cantos de ledino
                    ’ are evidences of the Roman conquest, which in turn gave place to the
                    “chacones” or dance-songs of the Visigoths; while during the Arab dominion the
                    sensuous “serranilhas” and “cantos de amigo” found a place in the family
                    “cancioneiros,” which were then compiled in imitation of the divans or tribal
                    songs of the ruling race. This national poetry, however, was for long affected
                    in its literary form by foreign influences. From the beginning of the reign of
                    Affonso Henriques (1112) to the - death of Dorn Sancho II. (1248) the court was
                    under direct Provençal influence; anditisnot improbable that in!146 the
                    celebrated troubadour Marcabrun was himself attached to the suite of Donna
                    Matilda on her marriage with Affonso Henriques, since he was certainly a visitor
                    at the court in 1147. The poets Egas Moniz Coelho and Gonçalo Herminguez are
                    commonly, though erroneously, referred to the time of Affonso Henriques, who was
                    himself a poet; but the name (and poem) of only one undoubtedly Portuguese
                    troubadour of this period has survived, Joao Soares de Panha (1145-1204). The
                    history of Galician literature properly belongs to that of Spain, but it is
                    important to remember that Portugal is perhaps even more than Castile the heir
                    of its early efforts. Amongst the Galician poets who frequented the court of
                    Sancho I. (1185-1211) and formed a strong opposition to the Italo-Provençal
                    school were Affonso Gomez, Fernam Goncalves de Senabria, and Joao Soares de
                    Paiva. The most famous of their Provençal rivals, who doubtless were the more
                    readily welcomed owing to the king’s marriage with a daughter of Raymond
                    Berenger 1V., count of Provence and king of Aragon, were Peire Vidal, Peire
                    Valeira, and Gavaudan 0 Velho, who in a “sirvente” written about 1210 incited
                    the Christians to a crusade against the Moors. Affonso III. (1248-1279) returned
                    from his residence at the court of St Louis of France imbued with northern
                    rather than with southern sentiments, and consequently during his reign French
                    influences prevailed. The nobles who had accompanied him were “trouvères” rather
                    than “troubadours” and to one of them, Affonso Lopes de Bayam, belongs the
                    honour of writing the first Portuguese gesta, a <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Maldizer.</hi> Other celebrated poets of this Franco-Provençal
                    school were the “privados,” or court poets, Joâo de Aboim, the author of several
                    sirventes and tensons, but, like De Bayam, the writer also of cantos de amigo
                    and cantos de ledino, Fernâo Garcia Esgaravunha, and Joâo Garcia o Pinto, his
                    brother. The privados were in their turn satirized by Martim Moxa and Lourenço
                    and Diogo Pezelho, who belonged to the less privileged class of “segreis,” a
                    term applied to those singers who wandered from court to court. The king’s songs
                    have been lost, or at least cannot be identified, but he is reputed to have been
                    no mean poet, and a sirvente against Alphonso X. of Castile, which appears from
                    internal evidence to have been written by him, is still extant. To this period
                    also belonged the privados Fernâo Fernandes Cogominho, the writer of cantos de
                    amigo and serranilhas, and Estevam Coelho, of whose works two lovely serranilhas
                    remain of the purest Galician form and feeling. The works of these poets show
                    that, notwithstanding foreign influence, the national forms had already obtained
                    some degree of favour at court. Similarity in the literary language led to
                    considerable intercourse between Portugal and Castile, and the Galicians Pero da
                    Ponte and Affonso Eanes de Coton were entertained by Affonso III., while the
                    Portuguese poets Pero Gomes Barroso, Payo Gomes Charrinho, and Gonçalo Eanes do
                    Vinhal enjoyed the patronage of Alphonso the Wise. On the accession of Diniz
                    (1279-1325) the court literature showed the decided southern and Provençal
                    tendencies of this king, who from the number, variety, and beauty of his songs
                    was himself the greatest poet of his time. Educated by Aymeric d’Ebrard of
                    Cahors, afterwards bishop of Coimbra, he at first affected the mannerisms of the
                    decaying school of Provence. With the courts of Love which he introduced came
                    the Limousin decasyllabic in place of the national octosyllabic metre, and the
                    ancient forms were lost in the intricacies of the ritournelle. This king’s songs
                    are marked by an exaggerated subjectivism, but among them quaint and graceful ‘
                    ‘ pastorellas” are found, full of poetic life and truth, which show that the
                    king was not blind to the beauty of his people’s lyrics. Admiration led to
                    imitation, and the close of his reign is marked by a distinct literary revival
                    of the national poetry, which at his hands received a polish it had somewhat
                    lacked before. The effects of Diniz’s influence pervade the whole of Portuguese
                    poetry, for not only was he in his pastorellas the forerunner of the great
                    pastoral school, but by sanctifying to literary use the national storehouse of
                    song he perpetuated among his people, even to the present day, lyric forms of
                    great beauty. Dorn Diniz completely overshadows the poets who were his courtiers
                    and contemporaries, but amongst them the most notable were Estevam da Guarda,
                    Ayras Peres Veyturon, Ruy Gonçalves, Joâo Eanes, and Joâo de Guilharda, though
                    the last-named was rather a musician than a poet. Dorn Affonso Sanches, a
                    natural son of Dorn Diniz, wrote partly in the Limousin and partly in the
                    Galician style, and another son, Dorn Pedro, Conde de Barcellos, who compiled a
                    “livro das cantigas” and a “nobiliario” or peerage, was the author of several
                    poems, but in an affected strain, which marked the approaching decay of lyric
                    poetry. With the reign of Affonso IV. (1325-1357) began the reaction of the
                    Castilian language against the Portuguese, but the quarrels of Ferdinand
                    (1367-1383) with Henry II. of Castile were the fortunate cause of the formation
                    of a second national school. For amongst its founders were the Galician poets
                    who took refuge at the court of Portugal, and who were followers of Macias and
                    Padron, including Vasco Pires de Camoes, ancestor of the great Luis, while to
                    this period must be properly assigned the poems of Egas Moniz Coelho and Gonçalo
                    Herminguez.</p>
                <p>Epic poetry was in Portugal as in Provence a later literary development than
                    lyric. The popular aravias must have been numerous, to judge from the remains
                    which are still found in the Azores and in the provinces of Beira and Algarves;
                    and to the 13th century may be referred the <hi rend="italic">Loenda de

                    (1211-1223), and a few poems in this style with music attached were written by
                    him. The <hi rend="italic">Roman de Brut</hi> is also quoted by Diniz, but it
                    was through the marriage of John I. with Philippa of Lancaster (1387) that a
                    knowledge of the Arthurian cycle spread through the Peninsula and led to the
                    popularity of the <hi rend="italic">Prophecies of Merlin</hi> and kindred works
                    down to the 16th century. The patriotic pride of the people, which had before
                    found vent in the aravias or tales of contests with the Arabs, sought a new
                    literary expression for the rising national greatness, and the parent of
                    Camoes’s great epic is the poem in which Alfonso Giraldes celebrates the victory
                    won by the united armies of Portugal and Castile over the Moors at the battle of
                    the Salado (1340). Only a small portion is extant, but it shows considerable
                    vigour and foreshadows the development which national pride was afterwards to
                    take in the <hi rend="italic">Lusiads.</hi></p>
                <p>The revolt against the subjectivism of lyric poetry which appeared in the
                    narrative spirit of the epic showed itself now in another form, and to Alfonso
                    IV. belongs the credit of fully appreciating the new tendencies. Acting under
                    his instructions, Vasco de Lobeira (d. 1403) became the author of the first
                    Portuguese novel by turning into prose the romance of <hi rend="italic">Arnadis
                    of Gaul,</hi> which led the way for a host of imitations bearing a similar
                    title. The historical records of this period are comprised chiefly in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronica da Conquista do Algarve,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Livra</hi><hi rend="italic">velho das Linhagens,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nobiliario do</hi><hi rend="italic">Collegio</hi><hi rend="italic">dos
                    Nobres.</hi> The theological tendencies of the people are aptly illustrated by
                    works which, although in Latin, deserve mention. They are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Concordantiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Morales</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Interpretatio.Mystica</hi> by St Anthony of Lisbon (1195-1231), and the
                    writings of Cardinal Alvaro Paes (d. 1353). The most learned scholar, however,
                    of this period was Pedro Hispano, who became Pope John XXL (d. 1277), and whose
                    universal learning recalled the days of the great schoolmen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">15th Century. —</hi> During this century lyric poetry was under
                    the increasing influence of the Spanish school and of its leader Juan de Mena,
                    whose praises were sung in some couplets by the infante Dorn Pedro, son of J ohn
                    I. The chief imitators of this style were Luis de Azevedo, Ayres Telles (d.
                    1515), and Diogo Brandâo (d. 1530). The Arthurian romances of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dom</hi><hi rend="italic">Eurives</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Branca-Flor</hi>
                    maybe referred to this century; and the poems on the death of the infante Dom
                    Pedro by Luis de Azevedo, and on the death of John II. by Diogo Brandâo exhibit
                    the literary form of the epic. The constable, son of Dom Pedro, felt the
                    influence of the Italian Renaissance, and consequently became the founder of the
                    Dantesque or allegorical school. His <hi rend="italic">Satyra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">da</hi><hi rend="italic">felice e infelice</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Vida</hi> is an allegorical piece of some merit, but a better specimen of this
                    style is the <hi rend="italic">Visào</hi> by Duarte de Brito, a compound of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Roman de la Rose</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">Amore</hi> by Fernâo Brandâo also possesses many beauties.</p>
                <p>The principal prose works of the time are the <hi rend="italic">Book of the
                    Chase</hi> written for John I. (1383-1433), the vivid and interesting <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicles</hi> of Fernâo Lopes (1380-1459), the Froissart of
                    Portugal, and the <hi rend="italic">Chronicles</hi> of Gomes Eanes de Azurara
                    (d. 1473), Buy de Pina (1440-1520), and Duarte Galvâo (1445-1517). King Edward
                    himself (1433-1438) was the author of <hi rend="italic">The Faithful
                    Councillor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Instructions in Horsemanship,</hi> while a
                    <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Tactics</hi> with several other works showed the
                    powers of Affbnso V. (1438-1481) as a general mathematician and natural
                    philosopher, the cultivation of which may have been in part due to the lessons
                    learned from the <hi rend="italic">Cyropaedia</hi> translated for him by Vasco
                    de Lucena.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">16th and 17th Centuries.—</hi> The golden age of Portuguese
                    literature had now arrived, and to Bernardim Ribeiro (c. 1500) is due the honour
                    of founding its characteristic school of romantic pastoral poetry. The χ∙ivers
                    and mountains of his native land are the natural framework of a poet’s fancy,
                    and the revival of classical learning showed him in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eclogues</hi> of Virgil a model which he was not slow to imitate. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Eclogues,</hi> written in “redondilhas” (octosyllabic nine or
                    ten-lined stanzas), are accordingly the earliest in modern Europe, and, while
                    replete with the charms and conceits of versification of the troubadours, show a
                    truly poetic love of nature. He was also the writer of the first “sextinas” in
                    redondilhas, and of many beautiful cantigas and elegies. To the same school,
                    which was now the representative of all national feeling, belong Christovâo
                    Falcâo, whose smaller poems are quite equal to those of Ribeiro, Garcia de
                    Resende (1470-1554), compiler of the <hi rend="italic">Cancionciro Geral,</hi> a
                    magnificent collection of poems by almost three hundred writers, beginning with
                    Alfonso Henriques, Gil Vicente (1470-1536), Jorge Ferreira de Vasconcellos (d.
                    1585), and Fernâo Rodrigues Lobo Soroρita (c. 1600). The last-named is chiefly
                    known from three comic satires on the classical school and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction</hi> to the poems of Camoens, which formed the basis of Faria e
                    Sousa’s <hi rend="italic">Commentary.</hi> Except for the fact that a
                    master-mind belongs to no school, Camoens himself might be claimed by these
                    writers as a fellow-work er, for he was systematically either ignored or abused
                    by the opposing school of classicists. IIis works are treated of at length
                    elsewhere (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Camoens),</hi> but it is not out of place to
                    remark here that his beauties are those of the national school and his defects
                    the result of an imitation of the classicisms affected by his opponents. These
                    were the followers of the school founded by Francisco de Sa de Miranda
                    (1495-1558) on his return from Italy, where he acquired a love not only for the
                    Renaissance, whose influence had been already felt by Ribeiro, but for the forms
                    in which the new culture found expression. Much praise is due to him for the
                    polish he gave to his country’s literature, but by his classical affectations
                    and the favour he showed to the Spanish language, in which his best works were
                    written, he sowed the seeds of that decay which afterwards overtook Portuguese
                    poetry. The eclogues, epistles, odes, elegies, and sonnets of this school are
                    often perfect in form and contain much real poetry, but the classicisms which at
                    first are graceful in their novelty weary in the end by their unreality, and in
                    the hands of inferior artists degenerate into mere stage properties, used to
                    conceal the want of genius. The shepherds and shepherdesses are no longer the
                    idealized peasants of the troubadours but courtiers in masquerade, and the sense
                    of this lowering of the ideal is sufficient to destroy the pleasure which would
                    otherwise be derived from the polished language and poetic imagination. The
                    imitators of Miranda were very numerous; the chief among them were Antonio de
                    Ferreira (1528-1569), who was Hora tian rather than Virgilian in feeling, and
                    consequently produced but inferior eclogues, while his didactic epistles λvere
                    the earliest Portuguese examples of that style, Diogo Bernardes (d. 1599), whose
                    sacred songs are particularly good, Pedro de Andrade de Caminha(d∙ 1589), Fernâo
                    Alvares do Oriente (b. 1540), Don Manuel de Portugal (d. 1606), and Estevâo
                    Rodrigues de Castro (1559-1637). Among the lyric poets of the 17 th century the
                    chief of those who by their satirical and comic verses showed an inclination to
                    the national rather than the classical school were Thomas de Noronha (d. 1651)
                    and Jacinto Freire de Andrade (1597-1657), author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fabulas</hi><hi rend="italic">de Narciso</hi> and of various songs and sonnets
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Fenix Renascida</hi> (1716-1728). Antonio
                    Barbosa Bacellar (1610-1663) was the first writer of “saudades,” and was
                    followed in the same style by Simâo Torrezâo Coelho (d. 1642). Sonnets were of
                    course written by every man of culture, but they rarely rose above the standard
                    of mediocrity. Those of Manuel de Faria e Sousa (1590-1649), Duarte Ribeiro de
                    Macedo (1618-1680), and André Nunes da Sylva (1630-1705) may, however, be
                    reckoned among the best. The sacred poems of the last-named are also very good,
                    but are surpassed by the <hi rend="italic">Jardim do Ceo</hi> by Eloi de Sa
                    Sotomaior, and by the poems of Sister Violante do Céo (1601-1693). The didactic
                    epistles of Antonio Alvares da Cunha (1626-1690) are fair specimens of this
                    class of poem.</p>
                <p>The truly heroic life of Portugal during this period naturally demanded to be
                    sung in a fitting strain, and the 16th and 17th centuries were consequently the
                    era of epic poems. The earliest of these was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Creaçâo</hi><hi rend="italic">do Homcm</hi> by Andre Falcâo de Resende (d.
                    1598), which from its similarity in style has been often attributed to Camoens
                    (1524-1579), whose <hi rend="italic">Lusiads</hi> appeared in 1572. Though the
                    sole masterpiece of the country and the age, this last not unworthily eclipses
                    other epics in which the brilliant passages are more or less numerous. Such are
                    the <hi rend="italic">Primeiro Cerco de Diu</hi> by Francisco de Andrade
                    (1540-1614), the <hi rend="italic">Naufragio</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Sepulveda</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Segundo Cerco de Diu</hi> by Jeronymo
                    Côrte-Real (1540-1593), both rather above the average, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elegiada</hi> (1588) by Luis Pereira Brandâo, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Affonso</hi><hi rend="italic">Africano</hi> (1611) by Vasco Mousinho de
                    Quebedo, who shares with Côrte-Real the honour of ranking next after Camoens,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ulysséa</hi> by Gabriel Pereira de Castro (1571-1632), the
                    <hi rend="italic">Viriato Tragico</hi> by Braz Garcia Mascarenhas (1596-1656),
                    the <hi rend="italic">Malaca</hi><hi rend="italic">Conquisiada</hi> by Francisco
                    de Sa de Menezes (d. 1664), the <hi rend="italic">Ulyssipo</hi> by Antonio de
                    Souza de Macedo (1606-1682), and the <hi rend="italic">Destruiçâo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Hespanha</hi> (1671) by André da Silva Mascarenhas.</p>
                <p>The drama in Portugal was stifled in its birth. The miracle-plays of the people
                    attained a high degree of excellence in the “autos” or sacred Christmas plays of
                    Gil Vicente (1470-1536), but this writer was born half a century too soon for
                    his work. His comedies, of which the best is <hi rend="italic">Inez
                    Pereira,</hi> are full of the rough wit which is found in the early Latin
                    writers, but show a want of polish and dramatic conception which is fatal to
                    their claims to high rank as works of art. The comedies of his contemporaries,
                    Antonio Prestes, Jorge Pinto, and Jeronymo Ribeiro Soares, all show considerable
                    talent, and the <hi rend="italic">Eufrosina of</hi> Jorge Ferreira de
                    Vasconcellos (d. 1585) most nearly approaches to a modern standard of
                    excellence. Francisco Manuel de Mello (1611-1666) was the author in Portuguese
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Auto do Fidalgo Aprendiz</hi> as well as of several
                    poems, but most of his works are in the Spanish language. Among the classicists
                    Miranda was the author of the comedies <hi rend="italic">Os Estrangeiros</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Os Vilhalpandos,</hi> but his plays are inferior to those
                    of Ferreira, whose dramatic works are in some respects superior to his poems.
                    The chief of them, which was produced only a few years later than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sophonisba</hi> of Trissino, is the tragedy <hi rend="italic">Inez
                    de Castro,</hi> but, though his subject was so fine, his treatment of it was not
                    altogether satisfactory. There are also several plays by Camoens; but the
                    influence of the Spanish language was by this time irresistible, and the result
                    was that all serious dramas were written in Castilian, while Portuguese was
                    reserved only for the lighter and more popular pieces, the best of which were
                    collected <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n578/mode/1up"

                <p>In prose the imitations of <hi rend="italic">Amadis of Gaul</hi> were followed by
                    the school of the Palmeirims, which originated in the romance of chivalry <hi
                    rend="italic">Palmeirim d’Inglaterra.</hi> The first and second parts of this
                    work were probably by the Spaniard Hurtado, and were only translated by
                    Francisco de Moraes (d. 1572); the third and fourth parts were written by Diogo
                    Fernandes (c. 1580), and the fifth and sixth by Balthasar Gonçalves Lobato (c.
                    1600). But Moràes, though thus missing the honour of being an originator, was
                    probably the author of the scarcely less celebrated <hi rend="italic">Palmeirim
                    de Oliva.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Livro de Cavallaria</hi> by Fernâo Lopes da
                    Castanheda (d. 1559), the <hi rend="italic">Chronica do Emperador

                    in the <hi rend="italic">Menina e</hi><hi rend="italic">Moça</hi> by Bernardini
                    Ribeiro, a composition in prose and verse which gave rise through its imitation
                    in Spanish by Jorge de Monte Mor (d. 1561) to the school of the Dianas. This
                    style was in its turn imitated in Portuguese by Fernâo Alvares do Oriente (b.
                    1540) in the <hi rend="italic">Lusitania Transformada,</hi> and among other
                    examples maybe noted the <hi rend="italic">Ribeiros do Mondcgo</hi> (1623) by
                    Eloi de Sa Sotomaior, and the <hi rend="italic">Primavera, O Pastor</hi><hi

                    F. R. Lobo. The last-named was also the author of the more meritorious <hi

                    sort of <hi rend="italic">Friends in Council,</hi> which was afterwards imitated

                    Costanheira Turacem, the <hi rend="italic">nom-de-plume of</hi> Lucas de St
                    Catherina (1660-1740). To the pastoral novel succeeded the allegories, of which
                    <hi rend="italic">Grand Cyprus, Clelia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Astrea</hi>
                    are the best examples. The Inquisition, however, laid its ban upon them when
                    they showed mystical tendencies, as in the <hi rend="italic">Pé</hi><hi

                    >Pilgrim’s Progress</hi> was published by the inquisitor Alexandre de Gusmâo
                    (1629-1724), with a view to proving the efficacy of infant baptism, which was
                    certainly not the intention of Bunyan. The Decameronic tales took the form in

                    which found poetical expression in the epic also caused the rise of a great
                    school of historians. The older royal chroniclers were followed by Garcia de
                    Resende (1470-1554), Christovâo Rodrigues Acenheiro (b. 1474), and Damiâo de
                    Goes (1501-1573). Their chronicles are graphic and interesting, though inferior
                    in style to the works of their successor, who was the most brilliant early
                    historian Portugal can boast. This was Joâo de Barros (1496-1570), author of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Conquest of the Indies,</hi> which was afterwards continued in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Asia Portugueza</hi> by Manuel de Faria e Sousa
                    (1590-1649), a learned and facile writer, from whose pen are also the <hi
                    rend="italic">Europa, Africa,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">America
                    Portugueza,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Commentary</hi> on Camoens, and numerous
                    other works. The style of Barros is both elegant and energetic, and the
                    criticism and accuracy which he displays make him still an authority of the
                    first rank. The next greatest historian after Barros was the monk Bernardo de
                    Brito (1569-1617), author of <hi rend="italic">Monarchia Lusitana,</hi> of which
                    there is a continuation by Antonio Brandäo (1584-1637), and of the <hi

                    interesting historical material. To Antonio Barbosa Bacellar (1610-1663) is due

                    Oratorians. The scientific writers of the period are not numerous, being
                    represented chiefly by the cosmograρher Pedro Nunes (1492-1577), one of the
                    greatest mathematicians of his time, Estevâo Rodrigues de Castro (1559-1637),
                    author of a <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Hippocrates</hi> and various other
                    medical works, and the astronomer Manuel Boccarro Francez (1588-1662).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">18th Century.—-</hi> During the preceding century there had
                    been founded in imitation of the Italians numerous “arcadias” or literary clubs
                    under fantastic titles, such as “Ambientes,” “Solitarios,” &amp;c. Their
                    influence was insignificant, and their existence would call for no remark were
                    they not the forerunners of the academies, which duιing the 18th century saved
                    Portuguese literature from total extinction. In the year 1714 was founded the
                    Lisbon Royal Academy of Sciences, which was succeeded by the Portuguese Academy,
                    whose first president was the learned historian Francisco Xavier de Menezes,
                    count of Ericeira (1673-1743), author of the epic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Henriqueida.</hi> His numerous translations of the works of Boileau and other
                    French writers had considerable influence on Portuguese literature, and the
                    founding in 1757 of the “Arcadia de Lisbôa,” in which the great minister the
                    marquis of Pombal was supreme, led to a wider spread of the teachings of the
                    Encyclopaedists. The arcadia ceased to exist in 1774, but was followed in 1779
                    by the Royal Academy of Sciences, founded by the duke of Lafδes, and by the
                    “Nova Arcadia,” which flourished between 1790 and 1806. As regards poetry these
                    academies were little more than manufactories of verse, the only lyric poets of
                    the early part of the century being Thomas Pinto Brandäo (1664-1743) and Antonio
                    de Lima Barros Pereira (b. 1687); but their members, though wanting in poetical
                    originality, showed considerable industry in historical research. The <hi

                    Machado (1682-1772) is a complete biographical dictionary of the Peninsula, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Life of the Infante D.</hi><hi rend="italic">Henrique</hi>
                    by Francisco José Freire (1719-1773) and the <hi rend="italic">General History
                    of Portugal</hi> by Damiâo Antonio de Lemos (1715-1789) are standard works,
                    while the <hi rend="italic">Memorias</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Litteratura</hi> of the Royal Academy of Sciences contains much
                    information about the literature of the 16th and 17th centuries. But the real
                    founder of scientific history in Portugal, as opposed to mere collections of
                    legends and traditions, was Joao Pedro Ribeiro (1759- 1839), whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Researches in Portuguese Chronology</hi> show an historical
                    scepticism far in advance of his age. To the same group of workers for the
                    academy in the historical department belong Francisco de St Luis,
                    cardinal-archbishop of Lisbon (1766-1845), Francisco Manuel Trigoso (1777-1838),
                    and José Francisco Correa da Serra (1750-1823), who edited the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Early Portuguese Chronicles.</hi> In the latter half of this century a revival
                    in poetry also took place, and the works of Antonio Diniz da Cruz e Silva
                    (1731-1800), author of <hi rend="italic">Hyssope,</hi> acquired for him the
                    title of the Portuguese Boileau. With him were associated Pedro Antonio Corrêa
                    Garçâo (1724-1772), authoι of the comedy <hi rend="italic">Assemblea</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cantata de Dido,</hi> Domingos dos Reis Quita (1728-1770),
                    the best pastoral poet of the period, and the Brazilian Claudio Manuel da Costa
                    (1729-1789). But to Francisco Manuel do Nascimento (1734-1819), who wrote under
                    the <hi rend="italic">nom-dc-plume</hi> of Filinto Elysio, must be assigned the
                    honour of being the reviver of letters in Portugal, not only by his elegant
                    lyric poems but more especially by his miscellaneous writings and by his
                    opposition to foreign imitations. His school of “Filintists” found rivals in the
                    “Elmanists” led by Manuel Maria de Barbosa du Bocage (1766-1806), who, though
                    less original than Nascimento, had perhaps greater influence. His poetical works
                    are numerous, and he was, besides, the author of three tragedies, <hi
                    rend="italic">Viriatus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Affonso Henriques,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Vasco de Gama,</hi> which had some success. The poems of Antonio
                    Ribeiro dos Sanctos (1745-1818), the satires of Nicolau Tolentino de Almeida
                    (1741-1811), and the sonnets of Paulino Antonio Cabral de Vasconcellos (b. 1720)
                    are all reckoned among the good work of the 18th century. But the best as well
                    as the last work of this school is the epic <hi rend="italic">Oriente</hi>
                    (1814) by José Agostinho de Macedo (1761-1831), whose contemporary, José
                    Anastasio da Cunha, was condemned by the Inquisition for the heresy contained in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Ora&lt;ffo Universal.</hi> The tragedies <hi rend="italic"
                    >0smia,</hi> by Catharina de Sousa, countess of Vimieiro (1749-1824), and <hi

                    especial notice, as do the vaudevilles <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Esopaida</hi> by Antonio José da Silva (1705- 1739), while the
                    national taste further showed itself in the favourable reception given to the
                    comedies of his successor, Alexandre Antonio de Lima (b. 1699).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">19th Century.—</hi> The political troubles of 1820 led to the
                    expatriation of Joâo Baptista de Almeida Garrett (Jonio Duriense) (1799- 1854)
                    and Alexandre Herculano (1810-1879), and the retreat to a monastery of Antonio
                    Feliciano de Castilho (Memnide Egynense) (1800-1875). The first two were
                    followers of Nascimento, the last of Bocage; but, while the enforced studies of
                    Castilho only increased his classicist proclivities, the exile of Garrett and
                    Herculano brought them into contact with romanticism. The effects are seen in
                    Garrett’s <hi rend="italic">D. Branca,</hi><hi rend="italic">Joâo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Minimo,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Flores sem Fructo,</hi> and

                    collection of modern lyrics, marks the foundation of the school of Coimbra. Its
                    leader, Joâo de Lemos, the lyric poet, found fellow-workers in José Freire de
                    Serpa, the impressionable author of <hi rend="italic">Soldos,</hi> and José da
                    Silva Mendes Leal, author of the dramas <hi rend="italic">A Alva Estrella, A

                    >Marmore,</hi> and various lyric poems. The most popular modern poet Luis
                    Augusto Palmeirim, the dramatist A. Pereira da Cunha, Antonio de Serpa, and Joào
                    de Andrade Corvo, author of the novel <hi rend="italic">Um Anno da Cδrte,</hi>
                    all belong to this school, the prevailing characteristic of which at its
                    foundation was a profound admiration for Chateaubriand and his royalist and
                    religious opinions. The second phase of this school dates from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Novo Trovador,</hi> in which the influence of Aimé Martin and
                    Krause on its originator Soares de Passos is plainly visible. The poems of
                    Passos are tinged with a melancholy which presaged his early death, and he
                    philosophizes in the <hi rend="italic">Firmamento,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Escravo,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Morte</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Socrates</hi> somewhat in the same strain as the English Lake poets. The third
                    phase of the school of Coimbra is represented by the <hi rend="italic">Flores do
                    Campo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Folhas Soltas</hi> of Joâo de Deus, the poet of
                    love and revolution. Of the same school the <hi rend="italic">Visdo dos
                    Tempos</hi> by Theophilo Braga is an attempt at a new revelation, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odes</hi><hi rend="italic">Modernas</hi> by Anthero do Quental are
                    socialistic, but both writers show more than ordinary power. Other modern poets
                    are Alberto Telles, Sousa Viterbo, Candido de Figueiredo, Gomes Leal, Thomas
                    Ribeiro, A. J. Viale, and Guilherme de Azevedo. The plays of C. C. Branco and
                    Ernesto Biester are above the average, and King Luis has worthily followed the
                    traditions of his race in his translations of the plays of Shakespeare. The
                    historical novels of Herculano are much admired by his countrymen, as well as
                    those of L. A. Rebello da Silva; and the works of J. G. Gomes Coelho (Julio
                    Diniz), A. de Oliveira Marreca, Mendes Leal, Bernardim Ribeiro, Arnal do Gama,
                    Teixeira de Vasconcellos, and Camillo Castello Branco, with his accuracy of
                    description, have some reputation; but the best modern novel, judged by an
                    English standard, is <hi rend="italic">0 Crime do Padre Amaro</hi> by E&lt; <hi

                    was coeval with the work of the troubadours, and the discoveries and conquests
                    of the heroic age gave birth to the epic of Camoens, so, in like manner, the
                    political revival of the 19th century has given rise to a school of great
                    historians, the chief of whom was Alexandre Herculano. The exile of Herculano
                    had brought him into contact with both English and French romanticism, as
                    appears in his early poems and his historical novels, in which the influence of
                    Lamartine and Scott is plainly visible, but in later life he was attracted to
                    the new German school of historians founded by Ranke, and perceived that his
                    true vocation was scientific history. His chief work has been the
                    disentanglement of the early history of Portugal from the mass of legends which
                    had clustered round it, and his <hi rend="italic">History of Portugal</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">The Origin of the Inquisition in Portugal</hi> are lasting
                    monuments of industry and criticism. But Herculano perceived that, before a true
                    knowledge could be gained of Portuguese history, a critical study must be made
                    of early documents, so, using his official position, he commenced the
                    publication for the academy of a magnificent edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Origines</hi> of Portuguese history. The viscount of Saιιtal∙em began a similar
                    work in his collections of <hi rend="italic">Foedcra,</hi> though his fame will
                    rest rather on his researches into the history of the great maritime discoveries
                    of the 15th and 16th centuries/ L. A Rebello da Silva continued the work of
                    Santarem in the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Corpo Diplomatico,</hi> and
                    his <hi rend="italic">History of Portugal in the 17th and 18th Centuries</hi> is
                    only inferior to the great work of Herculano. These historians inspired many
                    others, among whom may be mentioned Fonseca Benevides, F. F. de la Figaniere,
                    Claudio de Chaby, and Simào José da Luz Soriano. The strength of this school is
                    no doubt partly due to the extreme vigour of the reactionaries who were first
                    called into existence by Herculano’s attacks on superstitious legends. Their
                    work is brilliant if not convincing, and it would not therefore be right to pass
                    over without mention such names as F. Recreio, Γinheiro Chagas, and Aflbnso
                    Ennes. In general literature the name of Francisco Alexandre Lobo (17t'3- 1844)
                    stands out prominently as the foremost man of the century, and the Portuguese
                    equal of De Maistre, whilst Thomas de Carvalho, Rodrigo da Fonseca, Cesar
                    Machado, Lopes de Mendonça, F. Adolplιo Coelho, Theophilo Braga, Innocencio
                    Francisco da Silva, and F. D. Vieira have all won a position as critics and
                    essayists. Political liberty has gone hand in hand with the freedom of the
                    press, and here again Herculano appears as the founder of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Panorama,</hi> in which he had the assistance of most of the writers
                    above-mentioned. Besides these the most influential journalists are Teixeira de
                    Vasconcellos, Rodrigues de Sampaio, and J. Μ. Latino Coelho. While the press
                    remains free and can boast of such writers Portuguese literature will certainly
                    increase in strength and vigour, and maintain the feeling of national pride and
                    independence which appears so strongly in the works of Garrett and Herculano,
                    and will always prevent a union with Spain.</p>
