                    in Arcadia, the youngest of Greek cities (Paus, viii. 9), but one which played
                    an honourable part in the last days of Greek freedom as a staunch member of the
                    Achaean league. Polybius’s father Lycortas was the intimate friend of
                    Philopoemen, himself also a citizen of Megalopolis, and on the death of the
                    latter, in 182 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> succeeded him as leader of the
                    league. The date of Polybius’s birth can only be fixed approximately. He tells
                    us himself that in 181 he had not yet reached the age (1 30 years, Polyb., xxix.
                    9) at which an Achaean was legally capable of holding office (xxiv. 6). We learn
                    from Cicero <hi rend="italic">(Ad Fam.,</hi> v. 12) that he outlived the
                    Numantine war, which ended in 132, and from Lucian <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Macrob.,</hi> 22) that he died at the age of eighty-two. We may therefore
                    follow the majority of authorities in placing his birth between 214 and 204 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Little is known of his early life. As the son of
                    Lycortas he was naturally brought into close contact with the leading men of the
                    Achaean league. With the foremost of them, Philopoemen, he seems to have been on
                    intimate terms. Plutarch (&lt;l <hi rend="italic">πpwβ.,</hi> 12) describeshim
                    as sitting at the feet of the great Achaean soldier, of whom Polybius himself
                    always writes in terms of affectionate admiration; and after Philopcemen’s
                    tragic death in Messenia (182) he was entrusted with the honourable duty of
                    conveying home the urn in which his ashes had been deposited (Plut., <hi
                    rend="italic">Phil.,</hi> 21). The next year (181) witnessed what seems to have
                    been his first entry into political life. Together with his father Lycortas and
                    the younger Aratus, he was appointed, in spite of his youth, a member of the
                    embassy which was to visit Ptolemy Epiphanes, king of Egypt,—a mission, however,
                    which the sudden death of Ptolemy brought to a premature end (xxv. 7). The next
                    twelve years of his life are a blank, but in 169 he reappears as a trusted
                    adviser of the Achaeans at a difficult crisis in the history of the league. In
                    171 war had broken out between Rome and the Macedonian king Perseus, and the
                    Achaean statesmen were divided as to the policy to be pursued: to side with
                    Macedon would have been suicidal; Lycortas himself was in favour of neutrality,
                    but there were good reasons for fearing that the Roman senate would regard
                    neutrality as indicating a secret leaning towards Macedon, and indeed both
                    Lycortas and Polybius himself had already incurred suspicion at Rome on this
                    ground. Polybius therefore declared for an open alliance with Rome, and his
                    views were adopted. It was decided to send an Achaean force to cooperate with
                    the Roman general. Polybius was selected to command the cavalry, and was at once
                    despatched to the Roman camp to announce the decision of the league (xxviii. 10
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> The Roman consul declined the proffered assistance,
                    but Polybius accompanied him throughout the campaign, and thus gained his first
                    insight into the military system of Rome. On his return home he was able to
                    render an important service to his countrymen by checking the unauthorized
                    attempt of a Roman officer to raise troops in Achaia (xxviii. 13). In the next
                    year (168) both Lycortas and Polybius were on the point of starting at the head
                    of 1200 Achaeans to take service in Egypt against the Syrians, when an
                    intimation from the Roman commander that armed interference was undesirable put
                    a stop to the expedition (xxix. 23). The success of Rome in the war with Perseus
                    was now assured, and it is possible that the readiness of Lycortas and Polybius
                    to serve abroad was partly due to a belief that the fate of Macedon must soon be
                    shared by Achaia. If this was so, the belief was but too well founded. The final
                    defeat of Perseus was rapidly followed by the arrival in Achaia of Roman
                    commissioners charged with the duty of securely establishing Roman interests
                    there. As a result of their proceedings 1000 of the principal Achaeans were
                    arrested and carried off to Italy. Polybius was among the number, but, while his
                    companions were condemned to a tedious incarceration in the country towns of
                    Italy, he obtained permission to reside in Rome. This privilege he owed to the
                    influence of Aemilius Paullus, and his two sous <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0427-0412"/> Scipio and Fabius (xxxii. 9), who seem to have
                    made his acquaintance in Macedonia. At any rate Polybius was received into
                    Aemilius’s house, and became the instructor of his sons (Appian, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pun.,</hi> 132). Between Scipio, the future conqueror of Carthage,
                    and himself a friendship soon sprung up which ripened into a lifelong intimacy.
                    To the last Scipio so constantly relied upon the advice and counsel of Polybius
                    that it could be said by the countrymen of the latter that Scipio never failed
                    when he followed the advice of his friend (Pausan., viii. 30). To Polybius
                    himself his friendship with Scipio was not merely the chief pleasure of his life
                    but of inestimable service to him throughout his career. It protected him from
                    interference, opened to him the highest circles of Roman society, and enabled
                    him to acquire a personal influence with the leading men, which stood him in
                    good stead when he afterwards came forward to mediate between his countrymen and
                    Rome. It placed within his reach opportunities for a close study of Rome and the
                    Romans such as had fallen to no historian before him, and secured him the
                    requisite leisure for using them, while Scipio’s liberality more than once
                    supplied him with the means of conducting difficult and costly historical
                    investigations (Pliny, <hi rend="italic">N. H.,</hi> v. 9). In 151, after
                    seventeen years of banishment, the few surviving exiles were allowed to return
                    to Greece. But the stay of Polybius in Achaia was brief. The estimation in which
                    he was held at Rome is clearly shown by the anxiety of the consul Mamilius (149)
                    to take him as his adviser on his expedition against Carthage. Polybius started
                    to join him, but broke off his journey at Corcyra on learning that the
                    Carthaginians were inclined to yield and that war was unlikely (xxxvi. 3). But
                    when, in 147, Scipio himself took the command in Africa, Polybius hastened to
                    join him, and was an eye-witness of the siege and destruction of Carthage
                    (Appian, <hi rend="italic">Pun.,</hi> 132). During his absence in Africa, the
                    Achaeans had made a desperate and ill-advised attempt to assert for the last
                    time their independence of Rome,—a passionate outbreak which Polybius had
                    dreaded, and which his presence might have prevented. As it was he returned in
                    146 to find Corinth in ruins, the fairest cities of Achaia at the mercy of the
                    Roman soldiery, and the famous Achaean league shattered to pieces (Pol. ap.
                    Strabo, p. 381). But there was still work to be done that he alone could do. AU
                    the influence he possessed was freely spent in endeavouring to shield his
                    countrymen from the worst consequences of their rashness. The excesses of the
                    soldiery were checked, and at his special intercession the statues of Aratus and
                    Philopoemen were preserved (xxxix. 14). An even more difficult task was that
                    entrusted to him by the Roman authorities themselves, of persuading the Achaeans
                    to acquiesce in the new régime imposed upon them by their conquerors, and of
                    setting the new machinery in working order. With this work, which he
                    accomplished so as to earn the heartfelt gratitude of his countrymen (xxxix.
                    16), his public career seems to have closed. The rest of his life was, so far as
                    we know, devoted to the great history which is the lasting monument of his fame.
                    He died at the age of eighty-two of a faU from his horse (Lucian, <hi
                    rend="italic">Macrob.,</hi> 22).</p>
                <p>Of the forty books which made up the history of Polybius, the first five alone
                    have come down to us in a complete form; of the rest we have only more or less
                    copious fragments. But as to the general plan and scope of the work there is no
                    room for doubt, thanks mainly to the clearness with which they are explained by
                    Polybius himself. The task which he set himself was that of making plain, for
                    the instruction of his own and future generations, how and why it was that “all
                    the known regions of the civilized world had fallen under the sway of Rome”
                    (iiι. 1). This empire of Rome, unprecedented in its extent and still more so in
                    the rapidity with which it had been acquired, was the standing wonder of the
                    age, and “who,” he exclaims (i. 1), “is so poor-spirited or indolent as not to
                    wish to know by what means, and thanks to what sort of constitution, the Romans
                    subdued the world in something less than fifty-three years ?” These fifty-three
                    years are those between 220 (the point at which the work of Aratus ended) and
                    168 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and extend therefore from the outbreak of
                    the Hannibalic war to the defeat of Perseus at Pydna. To this period then the
                    main portion of his history is devoted from the third to the thirtieth book
                    inclusive. But for clearness’ sake he prefixes in books i. and ii. such a
                    preliminary sketch of the earlier history of Rome, of the first Punic λVar, and
                    of the contemporary events in Greece and Asia, as will enable his readers more
                    fully to understand what follows. This seems to have been his original plan, but
                    at the opening of book iii., written apparently after 146, he explains that he
                    thought it desirable to add some account of the manner in which the Romans
                    exercised the power they had won, of their temperament and policy, and of the
                    final catastrophe which destroyed Carthage and for ever broke up the Achaean
                    league (iii. 4, 5). To this appendix, giving the history from 168-146, the last
                    ten books are devoted.</p>
                <p>Whatever fault may be found with Polybius, there can be no question that he had
                    formed a high conception of the task before him, and of the manner in which it
                    should be executed. He lays repeated stress on two qualities as distinguishing
                    his history from the ordinary run of historical compositions. The first of
                    these, its synoptic character, was partly necessitated by the nature of the
                    period with which he λvas dealing. The interests, fortunes, and doings of all
                    the various states fringing the basin of the Mediterranean had become so
                    inextricably interwoven that it was no longer possible to deal with each of them
                    in isolation. The historian must deal with this complex web of affairs as a
                    whole, if he would be able either to understand or to explain it properly.
                    Polybius therefore claims for his history that it will take a comprehensive view
                    of the whole course of events in the civilized world, within the limits of the
                    period with which it deals (i. 4). In doing so he marks a new point of departure
                    in historical writing, “for we have undertaken” he says “to record, not the
                    affairs of this or that people, like those who have preceded us, but all the
                    affairs of the known world at a certain time.” In other words, he aims at
                    placing before his readers at each stage a complete survey of the field of
                    action from Spain in the West to Syria and Egypt in the East. This synoptic
                    method proceeds from a true appreciation of what is now called the unity of
                    history, and to Polybius must be given the credit of having first firmly grasped
                    and clearly enforced a lesson which the events of his own time were especially
                    well calculated to teach. Posterity too has every reason to be grateful, for,
                    though, as will be seen later, this synoptic method frequently interferes with
                    the symmetry and continuity of his narrative, yet it has given us such a picture
                    of the 2d and 3d centuries before Christ as no series of special narratives
                    could have supplied.</p>
                <p>The second quality upon which Polybius insists as distinguishing his history from
                    all others is its “pragmatic” character. It deals, that is, with events and with
                    their causes, and aims at an accurate record and explanation of ascertained
                    facts. This “pragmatic method” (ix. 2) has a double value. First of all it makes
                    history intelligible by explaining the how and the why; and, secondly, it is
                    only when so written that history can perform its true function of instructing
                    and guiding those who study it. For the great use of history according to
                    Polybius is to contribute to the right conduct of human life (i. 35), by
                    supplying a storehouse of experience for the assistance of those who will use
                    it. But this it can only do if the historian bears in mind the true nature of
                    his task. Above all things he must not content himself with merely writing a
                    pleasant tale. He must remember that the historian should not write as the
                    dramatist does to charm or excite his audience for the moment but to edify and
                    instruct all serious students in the future (ii. 56). He will therefore aim
                    simply at exhibiting events in their true light, setting forth “the why and the
                    how” in each case, not confusing causes and occasions, or dragging in old wives’
                    fables, prodigies, and marvels (ii. 16; iii. 48). He will omit nothing which can
                    help to explain the events he is dealing with: the genius and temperament of
                    particular peoples, their political and military systems, the characters of the
                    leading men, the geographical features of the country, must all be taken into
                    account. To this conception of the aim and methods of history Polybius is on the
                    whole consistently faithful in practice. It is true that his anxiety to instruct
                    leads often to a rather wearisome iteration of his favourite maxims, and that
                    his digressions, such as that on the military art, are occasionally provokingly
                    long and didactic. But his comments and reflexions are for the most part sound
                    and instructive <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> those on the lessons to be learnt
                    from the revolt of the mercenaries in Africa, i. 65; from the Celtic raids in
                    Italy, ii. 35; and on the Roman character), while among his digressions are
                    included such invaluable chapters as those on the Roman constitution (book vi.
                    ), the graphic description of Cisalpine Gaul (book ii.), and the account of tne
                    rise and constitution of the Achaean league (ii. 38 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi>
                    To his anxiety again to trace back events to their first causes we owe, not only
                    the careful inquiry (book iii. ) into the origin of the <pb break="no"

                    early treaties between Rome and Carthage in iii. 22 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>
                    Among the many defects which he censures in previous historians, not the least
                    serious in his eyes are their inattention to the political and geographical
                    surroundings of the history (ii. 16; iii. 36), and their neglect duly to set
                    forth the causes of events (iii. 6).</p>
                <p>Polybius is equally explicit as regards the personal qualifications necessary for
                    a good historian, and in this respect too his practice is in close agreement
                    with his theory. He has a profound distrust of closet students and a profound
                    belief in the value of a personal knowledge of affairs. Without such experience
                    a writer will, he says, be guilty of endless blunders and omissions, and will
                    inevitably distort the true relations and importance of events. History, he
                    asserts, will not be satisfactorily written until either men of affairs
                    undertake to write it, not as a piece of bye-work but as an honourable and
                    necessary task, or until intending historians realize that some actual
                    experience of affairs is indispensable (xii. 28). Such experience would have
                    saved accomplished and fluent Greek writers like Timaeus from many of their
                    blunders (xii. 25a), but the shortcomings of Roman soldiers and senators like Q.
                    Fabius Pictor show that it is not enough by itself. Equally indispensable is
                    careful painstaking research. All available evidence must be collected,
                    thoroughly sifted, soberly weighed, and, lastly, the historian must be animated
                    by a sincere love of truth and a calm impartiality. What follows where any or
                    all of these conditions and qualifications are absent Polybius illustrates
                    abundantly in his frequent and scathing criticisms on previous writers. In the
                    case of Timaeus, against whom he seems to cherish a peculiar animosity, nearly
                    all that remains of book xii. is devoted to an exposition of his shortcomings.
                    Q. Fabius Pictor and Philinus are charged both with ignorance of important facts
                    and with partiality (i. 14; iii. 9), while in the second book Phylarchus’s
                    account of the war between the Achaean league and Cleomenes of Sparta is
                    mercilessly dissected.</p>
                <p>It is not possible here to discuss the question whether Polybius has been just to
                    his predecessors; it is more important to consider how far he himself comes up
                    to the standard by which he has tried others. In his personal acquaintance with
                    affairs, in the variety of his experience, and in his opportunities for forming
                    a correct judgment on events he is without a rival among ancient historians. A
                    great part of the period of which he treats fell within his own lifetime (iv.
                    2). He may just have remembered the battle of Cynoscephalae (197). He must have
                    been sixteen or seventeen years old at least when the power of Antiochus was
                    broken at Magnesia (189), while of the events from 168-146 he was, as he tells
                    us (iii. 4), not only an eye-witness but a prominent actor in them all. As the
                    son of Lycortas he lived from his early youth in immediate contact with the
                    foremost statesmen of the Peloponnesus, while between 181 and 168 he was himself
                    actively engaged in the military and political affairs of the Achaean league.
                    The period of his exile in Rome served to add largely to his stores of
                    experience: he was able to study at close quarters the working of the Roman
                    constitution, and the peculiarities of the Roman temperament; he made the
                    acquaintance of Roman senators, and l·ecame the intimate friend of the greatest
                    Roman of the day. Lastly, he was able to survey with his own eyes the field on
                    which the great struggle between Rome and Hannibal was fought out. He left Rome
                    only to witness the crowning triumph of Roman arms in Africa, and to gain a
                    practical acquaintance with Roman methods of government by assisting in the
                    settlement of his own beloved Achaia. When, in 146, his public life closed, he
                    completed his preparation of himself for his great work by laborious
                    investigations of archives and monuments, and by a careful personal examination
                    of historical sites and scenes. If to all this we add that he was deeply read in
                    the learning of his day (Aelian, <hi rend="italic">Tact,</hi> i., άμήρ
                    π0λυμαfl7⅞s), above all in the writings of earlier historians, we must confess
                    that, as at once scholar, statesman, soldier, and man of the world, he was above
                    all others fitted to write the history of the age of transition in which he
                    lived.</p>
                <p>Of Polybius’s anxiety to get at the truth no better proof can be given than his
                    conscientious investigation of original documents and monuments, and his careful
                    study of geography and topography —both of them points in which his
                    predecessors, as well as his successor Livy, conspicuously failed. Polybius is
                    careful constantly to remind us that he writes for those who are <hi
                    rend="italic">φιXoμaθets,</hi> lovers of knowledge, with whom truth is the first
                    consideration. He closely studied the bronze tablets in Rome on which were
                    inscribed the early treaties concluded between Romans and Carthaginians (see for
                    these <hi rend="italic">Rhein.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mus.,</hi> 32, 614; iii.
                    22-26). He quotes the actual language of the treaty which ended the First Punic
                    War (i. 62), and of that between Hannibal and Philip of Macedon <hi
                    rend="subscript"> v</hi> vii. 9). In xvi. 15 he refers to a document which he
                    had personally inspected in the archives at Rhodes, and in iii. 33 to the
                    monument on the Lacinian promontory, recording the number of Hannibal’s forces.
                    According to Dionysius, i. 17, he got his date for the foundation of Rome from a
                    tablet in the pontifical archives. As instances of his careful attention to
                    geography and topography we have not only the fact of his widely extended
                    travels, from the</p>
                <p>African coast and the Pillars of Hercules in the west to the Euxine and the
                    coasts of Asia Minor in the east, but also the geographical and topographical
                    studies scattered throughout his history, such as the description of Sicily (i.
                    42), of Cisalpine Gaul (ii. 14), and of the Euxine (iv. 10), the discussion of
                    Hannibal’s route over the Alps, and the graphic picture of the scene of the
                    battle of Lake Trasimene. Lastly, to judge from its extant fragments, book
                    xxxiv. seems to have been actually a treatise on geography in general.</p>
                <p>Next to the duty of original research, Polybius ranks that of impartiality. Some
                    amount of bias in favour of one’s own country may, he thinks, be pardoned as
                    natural (xvi. 14); but it must not be gratified at the expense of truth. It is
                    unpardonable, he says, for the historian to set anything whatever above the
                    truth. And on the whole Polybius must be allowed here again to have practised
                    what he preached. It is true that his own sympathies and antipathies are not
                    entirely concealed. His affection for and pride in Arcadia appear in more than
                    one passage (iv. 20, 21), as also does his dislike of the Aeolians (ii. 45; iv.
                    3, 16). His treatment of Aratus and Philopoemen, the heroes of the Achaean
                    league, and of Cleomenes of Sparta, its most constant enemy, is perhaps open to
                    severer criticism—it is at any rate certain that Cleomenes does not receive full
                    justice at his hands. Similarly his views of Rome and the Romans may have been
                    influenced by his firm belief in the necessity of accepting the Roman supremacy
                    as inevitable, and by his intimacy with Scipio, the head of the great patrician
                    house of the Cornelii. He has evidently a deep admiration for the great
                    republic, for her well-balanced constitution, for her military system, and for
                    the character of her citizens. He shares too the dislike of the Roman
                    aristocracy for such men of the people as Flaminius (ii. 21) and Varro (iii.
                    116). But, just as his patriotism does not blind him to the faults and follies
                    of his countrymen (xxxviii. 4, 5, 6), so he does not scruple to criticize Rome.
                    He notices the incipient degeneracy of Rome after 146 (xviii. 35). He endeavours
                    to hold the balance evenly between Rome and Carthage; he strongly condemns the
                    Roman occupation of Sardinia as a breach of faith (iii. 28, 31); and he does
                    full justice to the splendid generalship of Hannibal. Moreover, whether his
                    liking for Rome was excessive or not, there can be no doubt that he has sketched
                    the Roman character in a masterly fashion. Their ambition, their invincible
                    confidence in themselves, their dogged courage which made them more dangerous
                    the harder they were pressed, and their devotion to the state are all clearly
                    brought out. Nor does he show less appreciation of their practical sagacity,
                    their readiness to learn from other peoples, their quickness in adapting their
                    tactics both in war and diplomacy to changing circumstances, and their mastery
                    of the art of ruling.</p>
                <p>His interest in the study of character and his skill in its delineation are
                    everywhere noticeable. He believes, indeed, in an overruling Fortune, which
                    guides the course of events. It is Fortune which has fashioned anew the face of
                    the world in his own time (iv. 2), which has brought the whole civilized world
                    into subjection to Rome (i. 4); and the Roman empire itself is the most
                    marvellous of her works (viii. 4). But under Fortune not only political and
                    geographical conditions but the characters and temperaments of nationsand
                    individuals play their part. Fortune selects the best instruments for her
                    purposes. The Romans had been fitted by their previous struggles for the
                    conquest of the world (i. 63); they were chosen to punish the treachery of
                    Philip of Macedon (xv. 4); and the greatest of them, Scipio himself, Polybius
                    regards as the especial favourite of fortune (xxxii. 15; x. 5).</p>
                <p>The praise which the matter of Polybius’s history deserves cannot be extended to
                    its form, and in this respect he contrasts sharply with Livy, whose consummate
                    skill as a narrator has given him a popularity which has been denied to
                    Polybius. Some of the most serious defects which spoil Polybius’s history as a
                    work of art are due to an over-rigid adherence to those views of the nature of
                    the task before him which have been described above. His laudable desire to be
                    comprehensive, and to present a picture of the whole political situation at each
                    important moment, is fatal to the continuity of his narrative. The reader is
                    hurried hither and thither from one part of the field to another in a manner at
                    once wearisome and confusing. Thus the thrilling story of the Second Punic War
                    is broken in upon by digressions on the contemporary affairs in Greece and in
                    Asia. More serious, however, than this excessive love of synchronism is
                    Polybius’s almost pedantic anxiety to edify and to instruct. For grace and
                    elegance of composition, and for the artistic presentation of events, he has a
                    hardly concealed contempt. Hence a general and almost studied carelessness of
                    effect, which mars his whole work. On the other hand he is never weary ot
                    preaching. His favourite theories of the nature and aims of history, of the
                    distinction between the universal and special histories, of the duties of an
                    historian, sound as most of them are in themselves, are enforced again and again
                    at undue length and with wearisome iteration. No opportunity is lost of pointing
                    out the lesson to be learnt from the events described, and more than once the
                    reader is irritated, and the effect of a graphic picture is spoilt, by obtrusive
                    moralizing. Nor, lastly, is Polybius’s style itself such as to compensate<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n429/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0429-0414"/> for these defects. It is, indeed, often
                    impressive from the evident earnestness and sincerity of the writer, and from
                    his sense of the gravity of his subject, and is unspoilt by rhetoric or conceit.
                    It has about it the ring of reality; the language is sometimes pithy and
                    vigorous; and now and then we meet with apt metaphors, such as those borrowed
                    from boxing (i. 57), from cock-fighting (i. 58), from draughts (i. 84). But, in
                    spite of these redeeming features, the prevailing baldness of Polybius’s style
                    excludes him from the first rank among classical writers; and it is impossible
                    to quarrel with the verdict pronounced by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who places
                    him among those authors of later times who neglected the graces of style, and
                    who paid for their neglect by leaving behind them works “which no one was
                    patient enough to read through to the end” (,repl <hi rend="italic"
                    >συvθis.</hi><hi rend="italic">ονομάτων,</hi> 4).</p>
                <p>It is to the value and variety of his matter, to his critical insight, breadth of
                    view, and wide research, and not least to the surpassing importance and interest
                    of the period with which he deals, that Polybius owes his place among the
                    writers of history. What is known as to the fortunes of his histories, and the
                    reputation they enjoyed, fully bears out this conclusion. The silence respecting
                    him maintained by Quintilian and by Lucian may reasonably be taken to imply
                    their agreement with Dionysius as to his merits as a master of style. On the
                    other hand, Cicero <hi rend="italic">(De Off.,</hi> iii. 32) describes him as
                    “bonus auctor in primis”; in the <hi rend="italic">De Republica</hi> (ii. 14) he
                    praises highly his accuracy in matters of chronology, “nemo in exquirendis
                    temporibus diligentior”; and Cicero’s younger contemporary, Marcus Brutus, was a
                    devoted student of Polybius, and was engaged on the eve of the battle of
                    Pharsalia in compiling an epitome of his histories (Suidas, <hi rend="italic"
                    >s.υ.</hi>; Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Brut.,</hi> 4). Livy, however,
                    notwithstanding the extent to which he used his writings (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Livy),</hi> speaks of him in such qualified terms as to suggest
                    the idea that his strong artistic sensibilities had been wounded by Polybius’s
                    literary defects. He has nothing better to say of him than that he is “by no
                    means contemptible”(xxx. 45), and “not an untrustworthy author” (xxxiii. 10).
                    Posidonius and Strabo, both of them Stoics like Polybius himself, are said to
                    have written continuations of his history (Suidas, <hi rend="italic">s.v.</hi>;
                    Strabo, p. 515). Arrian in the early part of the 2d and Aelian in the 3d century
                    both speak of him with respect, though with reference mainly to his excellence
                    as an authority on the art of war. In addition to his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histories</hi> Polybius was the author of the following smaller works :—a life
                    of Philopcemen (Polyb., x. 24), a history of the Numantine War (Cic., <hi
                    rend="italic">Ad Fam.,</hi> v. 12), a treatise on tactics (Polyb., ix. 20;
                    Arrian, <hi rend="italic">Tactica</hi>; Aelian, <hi rend="italic">Tact.,</hi>
                    i.). The geographical treatise, referred to by Geminus, is possibly identical
                    with the thirty-fourth book of the <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> (Schweigh.,
                    <hi rend="italic">Preef.,</hi> p. 184.</p>
                <p>The complete books (i.-v.) of the <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> were first
                    printed In a Latin translation by Nicholas Peιotti in 1473. The date of the
                    first Greek edition, that by Obs'.paeus, is 1530. For a full account of these
                    and of later editions, as well as of the extant MSS., see Schweighäuser’s
                    Preface to his edition of Polybius. Our knoλvledge of the contents of the
                    fragmentary books is derived partly from quotations in ancient writers, but
                    mainly from two collections of excerpts; one, probably the work of a late
                    Byzantine compiler, was first printed at Basel in 1549 and contains extracts
                    from books vi.-xviii. (πepl <hi rend="italic">πpeσβ&lt;siωv, πεpι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">αρετής</hi><hi rend="italic">κal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >κακίας)</hi>; the other consists of two fragments from the “select passages”
                    from Greek historians compiled by the directions of Constantine Porphyrogenitus
                    in the 10th century. To these must be added the Vatican excerpts edited by
                    Cardinal Mai in the present century.</p>
                <p>The following are the more important modern editions of Polybius :—Ernesti (3
                    vols., 1763-64); Schweighäuser (8 vols., 1793, and Oxford, 1823); Bekker (2
                    vols., 1844); L. Dindorf (4 vols., 1866-68, 2d ed.,Teubner, 1882); Hultsch (4
