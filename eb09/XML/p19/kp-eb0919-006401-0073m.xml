                    Lat., <hi rend="italic">Placentia),</hi> a city of Italy, a bishop’s see, and
                    the chief town of a province, lies on the Lombard plain, 217 feet above
                    sea-level, not far from the right bank of the Po, just below the confluence of
                    the Trebbia. By rail it is 43 miles south-east of Milan and 3∙5∣ north-west of
                    Parma. Formerly a place of considerable strength, it is still surrounded by
                    walls with bastions and fosse in a circuit of 4 miles. The cathedral •was
                    erected between 1122 and 1233, in the Lombardo-Gothic style, under the direction
                    of Santo da Sambuceto, on the site of a church of the 9th century which had been
                    destroyed by earthquake. The west front has three doors with curious pillared
                    porches. The campanile is a massive square brick tower 223 feet high; the iron
                    cage attached to one of its windows was put up in 1495 by Ludovico il Moro for
                    the confinement of persons guilty of treason or sacrilege. The crypt is a large
                    church supported by one hundred columns. Sant’ Antonino, which was the cathedral
                    church till 877, and occupies the spot where it was reputed that St Barnabas
                    preached to the people, -was built by St Victor, the first bishop of Piacenza,
                    in 324, restored in 903, rebuilt in 1104, and altered in 1857. It was within its
                    walls that the deputies of the Lombard League swore to the conditions of peace
                    ratified in 1183 at Constance. The brick vestibule (Il Paradiso) on the north
                    side is one of the older parts of the building. San Francesco, a spacious
                    edifice begun by the Franciscans in 1278, occupies the site of Ubertino Landi’s
                    palazzo, and is famous as the place where Agostino Landi harangued the people
                    after the murder of Pierluigi, and where in 1848 the deputies of Piacenza
                    proclaimed the annexation of their city to the Sardinian kingdom. San Sisto,
                    which dates from 1499, and takes the place of the church founded in 874 by
                    Angilberga (consort of the emperor Louis II.) for the Benedictines, lost its
                    chief attraction when Raphael’s Sistine Madonna (now in Dresden) was sold by.the
                    monks in 1754 to Frederick Augustus III. San Sepolcro and Sta Maria della
                    Campagna are both after Bramante’s designs; the latter is rich in works of
                    Pordenone. Sant’ Anna, dating from 1334, was the church of the barefooted
                    Carmelites. Of the secular buildings in the city the most interesting is the
                    Palazzo Communale, begun in 1281. In the main front the lower story, constructed
                    of red and white marble, presents a series of five open pointed arcades; the
                    upper story, in brick, has six very rich round-arched windows, each of five
                    lights; and above the cornice rise forked battlements. The square in front is
                    known as the Piazza dei Cavalli, from the two bronze equestrian statues of
                    Ranuccio (1620) and his father Alexander, prince of Parma, governor of the
                    Netherlands (1625). Both were designed by Francesco Mocchi. The Farnese palace
                    was begun after Vignola’s designs by Margaret of Austria in 1558; but it was
                    never completed, and since 1800 it has been used as barracks. Other buildings or
                    institutions of note are the old and the new bishop’s palace, the fine theatre
                    designed by Lotario Tomba in 1803, the great hospital dating from 1471, the
                    library presented to the commune in 1846 by the marquis Ferdinande Landi, and
                    the Passerini library founded in 1685. About a mile to the east of the city is
                    the Collegio Alberoni, instituted in 1751 for the education of priests and
                    missionaries. At a distance of about 2 miles in the opposite direction the
                    Trebbia is crossed by a bridge of twenty-three arches, erected in 1825 at a cost
                    of £47,000; the Austrians blew up two of the arches in 1859. Piacenza is an
                    important point in the Italian railway system—the Lombardy, Piedmont, and
                    Ligurian lines meeting there with those of Central Italy. Silk, cotton, and
                    woollen goods, pottery, and hats are among the local manufactures. The
                    population of the commune (which in this case is almost exactly identical with
                    the city) was 34,985 in 1871 and 34,987 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Piacenza, originally, it is supposed, a Ligurian and afterwards a Gallic town,
                    was made a Roman colony in 219 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> While its walls
                    were yet unfinished it had to repulse an attack by the Gauls, whose hopes were
                    excited by the news of Hannibal’s approach, and in the latter part of 218 it
                    afforded protection to the remains of the Roman army under Scipio which had been
                    defeated by the Carthaginian general in the great battle on the Trebbia. In 207
                    it withstood a protracted siege by Hasdrubal, Hannibal’s brother, and thus
                    contributed largely to the ultimate success of the Romans. Seven years later the
                    Gauls surprised and burned the city; and the colony was so diminished in
                    strength that in 190 it had to be recruited with three thousand families. In 187
                    it was connected with Rimini and the south by the construction of the Aemilian
                    Way. During the later republic and the empire Placentia is named in connexion
                    with a defeat of the forces of Marius in the neighbourhood (82 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), a mutiny of Julius Caesar’s garrison (49 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), another mutiny under Augustus (41 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> ), the defence of the city by Spurinna, Otho’s
                    general, against Caecina, Vitellius’s general (69 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.),</hi> and the defeat of Aurelian by the Marcomanni outside the walls (271
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> In 546 Totila reduced Piacenza by famine.
                    Between 997 and 1035 the city was governed by its bishops, who had received the
                    title of count from Otho III. In the latter part of the 12th century it was one
                    of the leading members of the Lombard League. For the most part it remained
                    Guelph, though at times, as when it called in Galeazzo Visconti, it was glad to
                    appeal to a powerful Ghibelline for aid against its domestic tyrants. In 1447
                    the city was captured and sacked by Francesco Sforza. Having placed itself
                    directly under papal protection in 1512, it was in 1545 united with <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Parma</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.)</hi> to form an hereditary
                    duchy for Pierluigi Farnese, son of Paul III. In 1746 a battle between the
                    Franco-Spanish forces and the Austrians was fought under the city walls. In 1848
                    Piacenza was the first of the towns of Lombardy to join Piedmont; but it was
                    re-occupied by the Austrians and had to wait for its emancipation till 1859.
                    Lucius Calpurnius Piso (father-in-law of Julius Caesar), Pope Gregory X., and
                    Alexander Farnese, duke of Parma, were natives of the city. Among the local
                    historians are Boselli, Rossi, Bonara, and Gemmi.</p>
