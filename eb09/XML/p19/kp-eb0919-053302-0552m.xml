                    >Arnauld</hi> (g ’.v.), the Mère Angélique, the history of Port Royal presents
                    little of general interest until about ten years after the establishment (1626)
                    of the sister house in Paris, when the community fully came under the influence
                    of Duvergier de Hauranne (see vol. vii. p. 567), abbé of St Cyran, the friend of
                    Jansen, and leader of the anti-Jesuit movement in France. The religious views of
                    St Cyran spread rapidly in Port Royal de Paris, and among the members and
                    connexions of the Arnauld family; and it was under his influence that in 1637
                    Antoine Le Maître (1608-1658), a nephew of the Mère Angélique, resolved to
                    abandon his brilliant prospects as an advocate and seek a life of ascetic
                    retirement. He found a lodging for himself at Port Royal des Champs (as the
                    mother house came to be called for distinction’s sake), which since the
                    departure of the nuns in 1626 had been untenanted. In the following year he was
                    joined in his religious retreat by his younger brothers Simon de Séri-court
                    (1611-1658), who had served in the army, and Louis Isaac (1613-1684), better
                    known in the world of letters by his assumed name of De Sacy. They were at
                    various times joined by others until in 1646 the “solitaries of Port Royal,”
                    apart from merely occasional visitors, had risen to the number of twelve. From
                    almost the beginning of his sojourn Le Maître, carrying out the ideas of his
                    imprisoned master St Cyran, devoted a considerable part of his time to teaching;
                    the number of pupils and also of teachers gradually increased until in 1646 and
                    following years the “Petites Écoles,” as they were modestly called, around Port
                    Royal les Champs and in Paris, although destined to be short-lived, attained a
                    great and widespread success (compare vol. vii. p. 675). Of the regular teaching
                    staff probably the most distinguished were Claude Lancelot (1615-1695)<note

                    Mère Angélique with some of the nuns returned from Paris to Port Royal des
                    Champs, which in the interval had been considerably enlarged, while the
                    neighbourhood had been rendered more salubrious by the labours of the
                    solitaries, who now removed to the farmhouse of Les Granges on the height above.
                    In the same year Antoine <hi rend="smallcaps">Arnauld</hi> (y.τ ’.), the
                    apologist of the <hi rend="italic">Augustinus,</hi> came into residence, and
                    thenceforward the “gentlemen of Port Royal” became closely identified in the
                    public mind with the Jansenist cause. The open struggle, which began with the
                    publication in 1653 of the bull of Pope Innocent X. condemning the five
                    propositions (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Jansenism),</hi> came to a disastrous
                    crisis in 1656, when Arnauld was expelled the Sorbonne, and he, as well as Sacy,
                    Fontaine, and Nicole, had to go into hiding. The publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Provincial Letters</hi> in the course of the same year did not
                    tend to soothe the Jesuits,.but the timely “miracle of the Holy Thorn” (24th May
                    1656; see vol. xviii. p. 335) helped to postpone somewhat the evil days that
                    were coming on the Port Royalists. But only for a time; for in 1661 the young
                    and ardently orthodox Louis XIV. caused the Petites Écoles to be broken up and
                    the postulants and novices of the two religious houses to be dispersed. For
                    continued contumacy both houses were in 1664 laid under interdict, which was
                    only removed when the “peace of the church” was established by Clement IX. in
                    1669. In the same year, however, Port Royal de Paris was separated from the
                    parent house with a grant of one-third of the revenues, and placed under Jesuit
                    management. The nuns of the abbey of Port Royal des Champs were allowed to take
                    in children as pupils, but not to receive any accessions to their own number,
                    and the Petites Écoles were not resumed. The “peace,” such as it was, was again
                    destroyed by the bull of Clement XI. in 1705, and in 1708, the nuns proving
                    inflexible, a papal bull was granted for the final suppression of Port Royal des
                    Champs and the transference of the whole property to Port Royal de Paris. The
                    dispersion of the aged sisters took place in the following year: the <pb

                    and in 1711 the bodies (to the number, it is said, of nearly 3000) that lay
                    buried within the desecrated precincts were disinterred and removed to other
                    places. Port Royal de Paris continued to subsist in obscurity until 1790.</p>
