                <p><label type="entry">PORISM</label>. The subject of porisms is perplexed by the
                    multitude of different views which have been held by famous geometers as to what
                    a porism really was and is. This article must therefore be limited to a short
                    historical account (1) of the principal works of the Greek mathematicians which
                    we know to have been called <hi rend="italic">Porisms,</hi> and (2) of some of
                    the principal contributions to the elucidation of these works, and conjectures
                    as to the true signification of the term.</p>
                <p>The treatise which has given rise to the controversies on this subject is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Porisms</hi> of Euclid, the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements.</hi> For as much as we know of this lost treatise we are indebted to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Collection</hi> of Pappus of Alexandria, who mentions it
                    along with other geometrical treatises, and gives a number of lemmas necessary
                    for understanding it. Pappus states that the porisms of Euclid are neither
                    theorems nor problems, but are in some sort intermediate, so that they may be
                    presented either as theorems or as problems; and they were regarded accordingly
                    by many geometers, who looked merely at the form of the enunciation, as being
                    actually theorems or problems, though the definitions given by the older writers
                    showed that they better understood the distinction between the three classes of
                    propositions. The older geometers, namely, defined a theorem as <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">to</hi><hi rend="italic">προτεινόμενον</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >εις</hi><hi rend="italic">άπόδειξιν</hi><hi rend="italic">avτov τoυ

                    rend="italic">κατασκευήν αντοΰ τον προτεινομενου,</hi> and finally a porism as
                    το <hi rend="italic">προτεινόμενον εις</hi><hi rend="italic">πopισμδv</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">αντοΰ τον προτεινομενου.</hi> Pappus goes on to say that this last
                    definition was changed by certain later geometers, who defined a porism on the
                    ground of an accidental characteristic as <hi rend="smallcaps">to</hi> λ∈⅛ov <hi

                <p>Proclus gives a definition of a porism which agrees very well with the fact that
                    Euclid used the same word <hi rend="italic">πόρισμα</hi> in his <hi

                <p>Pappus gives a complete enunciation of a porism derived from Euclid, and an
                    extension of it to a more general case. This porism, expressed in modern
                    language, asserts that, <hi rend="italic">Given four straight lines of which
                    three turn about the points in which they meet the fourth, if two of the points
                    of intersection of these lines lie each on a fixed straight line,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi><hi rend="italic">remaining point of intersection will

                    straight line.</hi> The general enunciation applies to any number of straight
                    lines, say (n+ 1), of which <hi rend="italic">n</hi> can turn about as many

                    any <hi rend="italic">(n-</hi> 1) of their —- points of intersection lie on <hi

                    describes a straight line. Pappus gives also a complete enunciation of one
                    porism of the first book of Euclid’s treatise. This may be expressed thus: If
                    about two fixed points P, Q we make turn two straight lines meeting on a given
                    straight line L, and if one of them cut off a segment AM from a fixed straight
                    line AX, given in position, we can determine another fixed straight line BY, and
                    a point B fixed on it, such that the segment BM' made by the second moving line
                    on this second fixed line measured from B has a given ratio λ to the first
                    segment AM. The rest of the enunciations given by Pappus are incomplete, and he
                    merely says that he gives thirty-eight lemmas for the three books of porisms;
                    and these include 171 theorems.</p>
                <p>The lemmas which Pappus gives in connexion with the porisms are interesting
                    historically, because he gives (1) <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n539/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0539-0520"/> the fundamental theorem that the cross or
                    anharmonic ratio of a pencil of four straight lines meeting in a point is
                    constant for all transversals; (2) the proof of the harmonic properties of a
                    complete quadrilateral; (3) the theorem that, if the six vertices of a hexagon
                    lie three and three on two straight lines, the three points of concourse of
                    opposite sides lie on a straight line.</p>
                <p>During the last three centuries this subject seems to have had great fascination
                    for mathematicians, and many geometers have attempted to restore the lost
                    porisms. Thus Albert Girard expresses in his <hi rend="italic">Traité de
                    Trigonométrie</hi> a hope that he will be able to restore them. About the same
                    time Fermat wrote a short work under the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Porismatum</hi><hi rend="italic">Euclidaeorum</hi><hi rend="italic">renovata
                    doctrina</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">sub</hi><hi

                    >recentioribus</hi><hi rend="italic">geometris exhibita.</hi> He seems to have
                    concerned himself only with the character and object of Euclid’s work; but,
                    though he seems to assert that he has restored the work, the examples of porisms
                    which he gives have no connexion with those propositions indicated by Pappus.
                    Fermat’s idea of a porism was that it is nothing more, than a locus. We may next
                    mention Halley, who published the Greek text of the preface to Pappus’s seventh
                    book with a Latin translation, but with no comments or elucidations, remarking
                    at the end that he has not been able to understand this description of porisms,
                    which (he maintains) is made unintelligible by corruptions and lacunae in the
                    text. Robert Simson was the first to throw real light on the subject. His first
                    great triumph was the explanation of the only three propositions which Pappus
                    indicates with any completeness. This explanation was published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> in 1723; but Simson did not stop
                    there. After his first success he set himself to investigate the subject of
                    porisms generally, and the result appears in a work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >De porismatibus</hi><hi rend="italic">tractatus;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quo</hi><hi rend="italic">doctrinam</hi><hi rend="italic">porismatum

                    auctor.</hi> This work, however, was not published until after Simson’s death;
                    it appeared at Glasgow in 1776 as part of a volume, <hi rend="italic">Roberti

                    Simson’s treatise, <hi rend="italic">De porismatibus,</hi> begins with
                    definitions of theorem, problem, datum, porism, and locus. Respecting the porism
                    Simson says that Pappus’s definition is too general, and therefore he will
                    substitute for it the following: “Porisma est propositio in qua proponitur
                    demonstrare rem aliquam vel plures datas esse, cui vel quibus, ut et cuilibet ex
                    rebus innumeris non quidem datis, sed quae ad ea quae data sunt eandem habent
                    relationem, convenire ostendendum est affectionem quandam communem in
                    propositione descriptam. Porisma etiam in forma problematis enuntiari potest, si
                    nimirum ex quibus data demonstranda sunt, invenienda proponantur.” A locus (says
                    Simson) is a species of porism. Then follows a Latin translation of Pappus’s
                    note on the porisms, and the propositions which form the bulk of the treatise.
                    These are Pappus’s thirty-eight lemmas relating to the porisms, ten cases of the
                    proposition concerning four straight lines, twenty-nine porisms, two problems in
                    illustration, and some preliminary lemmas. Playfair’s memoir <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin.,</hi> vol. iii., 1794) may be said to be a sort of
                    sequel to Simson’s treatise, having for its special object the inquiry into the
                    probable origin of porisms,—that is, into the steps which led the ancient
                    geometers to the discovery of them. Playfair’s view was that the careful
                    investigation of all possible particular cases of a proposition led to the
                    observation that ( 1 ) under certain conditions a problem becomes impossible;
                    (2) under certain other conditions, indeterminate or capable of an infinite
                    number of solutions. These cases could be enunciated separately, were in a
                    manner intermediate between theorems and problems, and were called “porisms.”
                    Playfair accordingly defined a porism thus: “A proposition affirming the
                    possibility of finding such conditions as will render a certain problem
                    indeterminate or capable of innumerable solutions.” This definition, he
                    maintained, agreed both with Pappus’s account and Simson’s definition, the
                    obscurity of which he attempts to remedy by the following translation: “A porism
                    is a proposition in which it is proposed to demonstrate that one or more things
                    are given, between which and every one of innumerable other things not given,
                    but assumed according to a given law, a certain relation, described in the
                    proposition, is to be shown to take place.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This view of porisms is known exclusively by the name of
                    Playfair, though, as he himself says, Dugald Stewart had several years before
                    defined a porism to be “a proposition affirming the possibility of finding one
                    or more of the conditions of an indeterminate theorem.”</p></note> This
                    definition of a porism appears to be most generally accepted, at least in
                    England. However, in <hi rend="italic">Liouville</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">s Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    mathématiques pures et appliquées</hi> (vol. xx., July, 1855) P. Breton
                    published <hi rend="italic">Recherches nouvelles sur les porismes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Euclide,</hi> in which he propounded a
                    different theory, professedly based on the text of Pappus, as to the essential
                    nature of a porism. This was followed in the same journal by a controversy
                    between Breton and A. J. H. Vincent, who disputed the interpretation given by
                    the former of the text of Pappus, and declared himself in favour of the idea of
                    Schooten, put forward in his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical·</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">exercitationes</hi> (1657), in which he gives the name of “porism”
                    to one section. According to Schooten, if we observe the various numerical
                    relations between straight lines in a figure and write them down in the form of
                    equations or proportions, then the combination of these equations in all
                    possible ways, and of new equations thus derived from them, leads to the
                    discovery of innumerable new properties of the figure, and here we have a
                    porism. It must be admitted that, if we are to judge of the meaning by the
                    etymology of the name, this idea of a porism has a great deal to recommend it.
                    We must, however, be on our guard against applying, on this view, the term
                    “porism” to the <hi rend="italic">process</hi> of discovery. The Greek word
                    τr0ptoγχα should no doubt strictly signify the <hi rend="italic">result</hi>
                    obtained, but the name is still indicative of the process. The porism is the
                    result as obtained by the process, which is itself the cause of the name. So
                    great an authority as Chasles wrote in 1860 <hi rend="italic">(Les trois</hi><hi

                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Euclide)</hi> that, in spite of the
                    general assent which Playfair’s theory met with, he considered it to be
                    unfounded.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Porisms</hi> of Euclid are not the only representatives of
                    this class of propositions. We know of a treatise of Diophantus which was
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Porisms.</hi> But it is uncertain whether these lost
                    <hi rend="italic">Porisms</hi> formed part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arithmetics</hi> or were an independent treatise. Diophantus refers to them in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Arithmetics</hi> in three places, introducing a
                    proposition assumed as known with the words ∈χo∕χev <hi rend="italic">lv
                    τoι&lt;s</hi><hi rend="italic">πορίσ-μασιν.</hi> These propositions are not,
                    however, all similar in form, and we cannot by means of them grasp what
                    Diophantus understood to be the nature of a porism. So far as we can judge of
                    his treatise it seems to have been a collection of a number of ordinary
                    propositions in the theory of numbers, some of them being mere algebraical
                    identities. Again, Diophantus should probably be included among the veωτepot who
                    are said to have substituted a new definition for that of the ancients, looking
                    only to accidental not essential characteristics of a true porism. And yet, in
                    so far as Diophantus’s <hi rend="italic">Porisms</hi> had no connexion with
                    geometry, they do not in the least conform to the second definition of
                    Pappus.</p>
                <p>We have by no means exhausted the list of writers who have propounded theories on
                    the subject of porisms. It must, however, suffice merely tθjnention the chief
