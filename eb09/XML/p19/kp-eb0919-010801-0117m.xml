                    painters such as Bonfigli and Fiorenzo di Lorenzo. According to Vasari he was a
                    pupil of Perugino; and so in one sense no doubt he was, but rather as a paid
                    assistant than as an apprentice. The strong similarity both in design and
                    methods of execution which runs through the works of this later Perugian school,
                    of which Perugino was the oldest member, is very striking; paintings by
                    Perugino, Pinturicchio, Lo Spagna, and Raphael (in his first manner) may often
                    be mistaken one for the other. In most cases, especially in the execution of
                    large frescos, pupils and assistants had a large share in the work, either in
                    enlarging the master’s sketch to the full-sized cartoon, in transferring the
                    cartoon to the wall, or in painting backgrounds, drapery, and other accessories.
                    In this way the spirit and individuality of one man could impress itself
                    indelibly on a numerous school of younger artists.</p>
                <p>After assisting Perugino in the execution of his frescos in the Sistine Chapel,
                    Pinturicchio was employed by various members of the Della Rovere family and
                    others to decorate a whole series of chapels in the church of S. Maria del
                    Popolo in Rome, where he appears to have worked from 1484, or earlier, to 1492
                    with little interruption. The earliest of these is an altarpiece of the
                    Adoration of the Shepherds, in the first chapel (from the west) on the south,
                    built by Cardinal Domenico della Rovere; a portrait of the cardinal is
                    introduced as the foremost of the kneeling shepherds. In the lunettes under the
                    vault Pinturicchio painted small scenes from the life of St Jerome. The frescos
                    which he painted in the next chapel, that built by Card. Innocenzo Cibo, were
                    destroyed in 1700, when the chapel was rebuilt by Card. Alderano Cibo. The third
                    chapel on the south is that of Giov. della Rovere, duke of Sora, nephew of
                    Sixtus IV., and brother of Giuliano, who was afterwards Pope Julius II.</p>
                <p>This contains a fine altarpiece of the Madonna enthroned between Four Saints, and
                    on the east side a very nobly composed fresco of the Assumption of the Virgin.
                    The vault and its lunettes are richly decorated with small pictures of the life
                    of the Virgin, surrounded by graceful arabesques; and the dado is covered with
                    monochrome paintings of scenes from the lives of saints, medallions with
                    prophets, and very graceful and powerfully drawn female figures in full length,
                    in which the influence of Signorelli may be traced. In the fourth chapel
                    Pinturicchio painted the Four Latin Doctors in the lunettes of the vault. Most
                    of these frescos are considerably injured by damp, but happily have suffered
                    little from restoration; the heads are painted with much minuteness of finish,
                    and the whole of the pictures depend very largely for their effect on the final
                    touchings <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">secco.</hi> The last
                    paintings completed by Pinturicchio in this church were the frescos on the vault
                    over the retro-choir, a very rich and well-designed piece of decorative work,
                    with main lines arranged to suit their surroundings in a very skilful way. In
                    the centre is an octagonal panel of the Coronation of the Virgin, and round it
                    medallions of the Four Evangelists —the spaces between them being filled up by
                    reclining figures of the Four Sibyls. On each pendentive is a figure of one of
                    the Four Doctors enthroned under a niched canopy. The bands which separate these
                    pictures have elaborate arabesques on a gold ground, and the whole is painted
                    with broad and effective touches, very telling when seen (as is necessarily the
                    case) from a considerable distance below. No finer specimen of the decoration of
                    a simple quadripartite vault can anywhere be seen.</p>
                <p>In 1492 Pinturicchio was summoned to Orvieto, where he painted two Prophets and
                    two of the Doctors in the duomo. In the following year he returned to Rome, and
                    was employed by Pope Alexander VI. (Borgia) to decorate a suite of six rooms in
                    the Vatican, which Alexander had just built. These rooms, called after their
                    founder the <hi rend="italic">A ppart</hi><hi rend="italic">amenti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Borgia,</hi> now form part of the Vatican library, and five of
                    them still retain the fine series of frescos with which they were so skilfully
                    decorated by Pinturicchio. The upper part of the walls and vaults, not only
                    covered with painting, but further enriched with delicate stucco work in relief,
                    are a masterpiece of decorative design applied according to the truest
                    principles of mural ornament,—a much better model for imitation in that respect
                    than the more celebrated Stanze of Raphael immediately over the Borgia rooms.
                    The main subjects are—(1) the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Magi, and the
                    Resurrection; (2) Scenes from the lives of St Catherine, St Antony, and other
                    saints <hi rend="italic">; (3)</hi> allegorical figures of Music, Arithmetic,
                    and the like; (4) four figures in half length, with rich arabesques; (5) figures
                    of the planets, the occupations of the various months, and other subjects. The
                    sixth room was repainted by Perino del Vaga.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Though not without interruption, Pinturicchio, assisted by his pupils, worked in
                    these rooms from 1492 till 1498, when they were completed. His other chief
                    frescos in Rome, still existing in a very genuine state, are those in the
                    Cappella Bufalini at the south-west of St Maria in Ara Coeli, probably executed
                    from 1497 to 1500. These are well-designed compositions, noble in conception,
                    and finished with much care and refinement. On the altar wall is a grand
                    painting of St Bernardino of Siena between two other saints, crowned by angels;
                    in the upper part is a figure of Christ in a vesica-glory, surrounded by angel
                    musicians; on the left wall is a large fresco of the miracles done by the corpse
                    of St Bernardino, very rich in colour, and full of very carefully painted heads,
                    some being <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n118/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0118-0109"/> portraits of members of the Bufalini family, for
                    whom these frescos were executed. One group of three females, the central figure
                    with a child at her breast, is of especial beauty, recalling the grace of
                    Raphael’s second manner. The composition of the main group round the saint’s
                    corpse appears to have been suggested by Giotto’s painting of St Francis on his
                    bier in S. Croce at Florence. On the vault are four noble figures of the
                    Evangelists, usually attributed to Luca Signorelli, but certainly, like the rest
                    of the frescos in this chapel, by the hand of Pinturicchio. On the vault of the
                    sacristy of S. Cecilia in Trastevere, Pinturicchio painted the Almighty
                    surrounded by the Evangelists, a work which still exists in a fair state of
                    preservation and uurestored. During a visit to Orvieto in 1496 Pinturicchio
                    painted two more figures of the Latin Doctors in the choir of the duomo—now,
                    like the rest of his work at Orvieto, almost destroyed. For these he received
                    fifty gold ducats.</p>
                <p>Among his panel pictures the following are the most important. An altarpiece for
                    St Maria de’ Fossi at Perugia, painted in 1496-98, now moved to the picture
                    gallery, is a Madonna enthroned among Saints, graceful and sweet in expression,
                    and very minutely painted; the wings of the retable have standing figures of St
                    Augustine and St Jerome; and the <hi rend="italic">predella</hi> has paintings
                    in miniature of the Annunciation and the Evangelists. Another fine altarpiece,
                    similar in delicacy of detail, and probably painted about the same time, is that
                    in the cathedral of San Severino—the Madonna enthroned looks down towards the
                    kneeling donor. The angels at the sides in beauty of face and expression recall
                    the manner of Lorenzo di Credi or Da Vinci. The Vatican picture gallery has the
                    largest of Pinturicchio’s panels—the Coronation of the Virgin, with the apostles
                    and other saints below. Several well-executed portraits occur among the kneeling
                    saints. The Virgin, who kneels at Christ’s feet to receive her crown, is a
                    figure of great tenderness and beauty, and the lower group is composed with
                    great skill and grace in arrangement. Other important panel paintings by
                    Pinturicchio exist in the cathedral of Spello, in the Siena gallery, at
                    Florence, at Perugia, and in other collections.</p>
                <p>In 1501 Pinturicchio painted several fine frescos in S. Maria Maggiore at
                    Spello,—all very decorative, and full of elaborate architectural accessories.
                    One of them, the Annunciation, is signed “Bernardinvs Pintvrichivs Pervsinvs.”
                    They are much injured by damp and clumsy restoration. The most striking of all
                    Pinturicchio’s frescos, both for brilliance of colour and their wonderful state
                    of preservation, are those in the cathedral library at Siena, a large room built
                    in 1495 by Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini, afterwards Pius III. In 1502 the
                    cardinal contracted with Pinturicchio to decorate the whole room with arabesques
                    on the vault, and on the walls ten scenes from the life of Aeneas Sylvius
                    Piccolomini, Pius II., the uncle of Cardinal Francesco.</p>
                <p>The contract, given in full by Milanesi (Vasari, iii. p. 519), is a very
                    interesting one; it specially provides that the cartoons, their transference on
                    to the walls, and all the heads, were to be by Pinturicchio’s own hand, thus
                    contradicting Vasari’s assertion that the cartoons were the work of Raphael. In
                    fact when closely examined the evidence which would give Raphael an4mportant
                    share in the execution of these fine paintings amounts to very little. The
                    document provides for the price of these frescos, namely one thousand gold
                    ducats, to be paid in various instalments. The work was begun early in 1503, but
                    was interrupted for a while by the death of Pius III. His will, however,
                    provided for the completion of the work by his executors, aud the whole series
                    were finished in 1507. The subjects are (1) the journey of the young Sylvius
                    Piccolomini to the council of Basel, in the suite of Cardinal Capranica; (2) his
                    reception by James I. of Scotland as envoy from the council of Basel; (3) his
                    being crowned with the poet’s laurel by Frederick III.; (4) his reception by
                    Pope Eugenius IV. as ambassador from Frederick III.; (5) outside the wall of
                    Siena he presents to Frederick III. his bride Leonora, infanta of Portugal; (6)
                    he receives the cardinal’s hat from Pope Calixtus 111.; (7) he is borne in
                    procession after his election as Pope Pius II.; (8) he presides at a council at
                    Mantua; (9) he canonizes St Catherine of Siena; (10) he arrives in Ancona to
                    promote the crusade against the Turks. In addition to these there is, outside
                    the library, over the door, the Coronation of Pius III.</p>
                <p>Though this splendid series of paintings are laid in with true fresco-colours,
                    there is but little <hi rend="italic">fresco</hi><hi rend="italic">buono</hi>
                    visible; almost the whole is painted over <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">secco</hi> with colours much more brilliant in tone than could be
                    used on the wet stucco. This retouching, which was employed by all fresco
                    painters, was used by Pinturicchio more than by most artists. In the lower part
                    of the scene of St Catherine’s canonization he has introduced his own portrait,
                    and standing by him is a youth who bears some resemblance to Raphael. The
                    paintings are all finished with much care, but Pinturicchio has not kept to the
                    flat and simply decorative treatment of his earlier manner; there is much more
                    of aerial perspective and distance destroying the apparent solidity of the w all
                    surface.</p>
                <p>In 1508 Pinturicchio painted another panel of the Madonna enthroned among Saints
                    for the church of the Minori Conventual! at Spello. It is now over the altar in
                    the sacristy. On his return to Siena he painted a whole series of frescos on the
                    walls of the ,Palazzo Petrucci, now all destroyed except one scene of the return
                    of Ulysses to Penelope (or possibly Collatinus and Lucretia), which is now in
                    the National Gallery of London, transferred to canvas. One of his last works,
                    painted in 1513, the year of his death, is a very beautiful and highly finished
                    panel with Christ bearing His Cross, now in the Palazzo Borromeo in Milan.
                    Pinturicchio married Grania di Niccolo, and had by her two sons and four
                    daughters; there is probably no truth in the story of his being starved by his
                    wife during his last illness.</p>
                <p>The frescos in the Cappella Bufalini were engraved in ten plates by Fran.
                    Giangiacomo, and published by the Calcografia Camerale of Rome. The Siena
                    library series were engraved by Faucci in the the last century, and more
                    recently by Lasinio. Neither set is remarkable for fidelity or spirit. The Siena
                    frescos and those at Spello have been published in chromo-lithograph by the
                    Arundel Society of London.</p>
                <p>Pinturicchio’s worth as a painter has been for the most part undervalued, partly
                    owing to the very strong prejudice and dislike which tinges Vasari’s biography
                    of him. Even recent writers, such as Crowe and Cavalcaselle, have hardly done
                    him justice. A fairer estimate of his position in the history of art is given by
                    Vermiglioli, <hi rend="italic">Memorie di Pinturicchio,</hi> Perugia, 1837; and
                    in the valuable notes and appendix of Milanesi’s edition of Vasari, iii. p.
