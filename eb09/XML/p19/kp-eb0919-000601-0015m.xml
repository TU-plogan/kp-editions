                    in several forms and in about a dozen Eastern and Western languages. As nearly
                    all its imagery is taken from the animal world, it is also known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bestiary.</hi> There can be hardly a doubt about the time and
                    general circumstances of its origin. Christian teachers, especially those who
                    had a leaning towards gnostic speculations, took an interest in natural history,
                    partly because of certain passages of Scripture that they wanted to explain, and
                    partly on account of the divine revelation in the book of nature, of which also
                    it was man’s sacred duty to take proper advantage. Both lines of study were
                    readily combined by applying to the interpretation of descriptions of natural
                    objects the allegorical method adopted for the interpretation of Biblical texts.
                    Now the early Christian centuries were anything but a period of scientific
                    research. Rhetorical accomplishments were considered to be the chief object of a
                    liberal education, and to this end every kind of learning was made subservient.
                    Instead of reading Aristotle and other naturalists, people went for information
                    to commonplace books like those of Aelian, in which scraps of folk-lore,
                    travellers’ tales, and fragments of misapprehended science were set forth in an
                    elegant style for the enjoyment of the general reader. Theological writers with
                    a merely literary training were not in the least prepared to question the worth
                    of the marvellous descriptions of creatures that were current in the schools on
                    the faith of authorities vaguely known as “the history of animals,” “the
                    naturalists,” and “the naturalist” in the singular number (φυσιολόγο?).<note

                    So they took their notions of strange beasts and other marvels of the visible
                    world on trust and did their best to make them available for religious
                    instruction. In some measure we find this practice adopted by more than one of
                    the fathers, but it was only natural that the Alexandrian school, with its
                    pronounced taste for symbolism, should make the most of it. Clement himself had
                    declared that natural lore, as taught in the course of higher Christian
                    education according to the canon of truth, ought to proceed from “cosmogony” to
                    “the theological idea,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    that is left of the works of Origen we have two instances of the proceeding in
                    question. And yet the fact that these reappear in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physiologus</hi> would not suffice to stamp the work as a series of extracts
                    from Alexandrian writings, as parallels of the same kind can be adduced from
                    Epiphanius <hi rend="italic">(loc. cit.)</hi> and Ephraem Syτus <hi
                    rend="italic">{Opp. Syr.,</hi> ii. pp. 17, 130). Father Cahier would even trace
                    the book to Tatian, and it is true that that heresiarch mentions a writing of
                    his own upon animals. Still the context in which the quotation occurs makes it
                    evident that the subject-matter was not the nature of particular species nor the
                    spiritual lessons to be drawn therefrom, but rather the place occupied by animal
                    beings in the system of creation. On the other hand, the opinion of Cardinal
                    Pitra, who referred the <hi rend="italic">Physiologus</hi> to the more orthodox
                    though somewhat peculiar teaching of the Alexandrians, is fully borne out by a
                    close examination of the irregularities of doctrine pointed out in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Physiologus</hi> by Cahier, all of which are to be met with in
                    Origen. The technical words by which the process of allegorizing is designated
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Physiologus,</hi> like <hi rend="italic">epp∙ηveia,
                    θι,a&gt;ρia,</hi> αναγωγή, αλληγορία, are familiar to the students of
                    Alexandrian exegesis. It has, moreover, been remarked that almost all the
                    animals mentioned were at home in the Egypt of those days, or at least, like the
                    elephant, were to be seen there occasionally, whereas the structure of the
                    hedgehog, for instance, is explained by a reference to the sea-porcupine, better
                    known to fish-buyers on the Mediterranean. The fables of the phoenix and of the
                    conduct of the wild ass and the ape at the time of the equinox owe their origin
                    to astronomical symbols belonging to the Nile country.<note anchored="true"

                    confirmed by many of the sections opening with a text, followed up by some such
                    formula as “but the Physiologus says.” When zoological records failed,
                    Egypto-Hellenic ingenuity was never at a loss for a fanciful invention distilled
                    from the text itself, but which, to succeeding copyists, appeared as part of the
                    teaching of the original Physiologus. As a typical instance we may take the
                    chapter on the ant-lion,—not the insect, but an imaginary creature suggested by
                    Job iv. 11. The exceptional Hebrew for a lion <hi rend="italic">{layisK)</hi>
                    appeared to the Septuagint translators to call for a special rendering, and as
                    there was said to exist on the Arabian coast a lion-like animal called “myrmex”
                    (see Strabo, xvi. p. 774; Aelian, <hi rend="italic">N. A.,</hi> vii. 47) they
                    ventured to give the compound noun “myrmekoleon.” After so many years the
                    commentators had lost the key to this unusual term, and only knew that in common
                    Greek “myrmex” meant an ant. So the text “the myrmekoleon hath perished for that
                    he had no nourishment” set them pondering, and others reproduced their
                    meditations, with the following result: “The <hi rend="italic">Physiologus</hi>
                    relates about the ant-lion: his father hath the shape of a lion, his mother that
                    of an ant; the father liveth upon flesh, and the mother upon herbs. And these
                    bring forth the ant-lion, a compound of both, and in part like to either, for
                    his fore part is that of a lion, and his hind part like that of an ant. Being
                    thus composed, he is neither able to eat flesh like his father, nor herbs like
                    his mother; therefore he perisheth from inanition”; the moral follows.</p>
                <p>At a later period, when the church had learnt to look with suspicion upon
                    devotional books likely to provoke the scoffing of some and lead others into
                    heresy, a work of this kind could hardly meet with her approval. A synod of Pope
                    Gelasius, held in 496, passed censure, among others, on the “Liber Physiologus,
                    qui ab haereticis conscriptus est et B. Ambrosii nomine signatus, apocryphus,”
                    and evidence has even been offered that a similar sentence was pronounced a
                    century before. Still, in spite of such measures, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physiologus,</hi> like the <hi rend="italic">Church History</hi> of Eusebius or
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pastor of</hi><hi rend="italic">Hermas,</hi> continued to
                    be read with general interest, and even Gregory the Great did not disdain to
                    allude to it on occasion. Yet the Oriental versions, which had certainly nothing
                    to do with the Church of Rome, show that there was no systematic revision made
                    according to the catholic standard of doctrine. The book remained essentially
                    the same, albeit great liberties were taken with its details and outward form.
                    There must have been many imperfect copies in circulation, from which people
                    transcribed such sections as they found or chose, and afterwards completed their
                    MS. as occasion served. Some even rearranged the contents according to the
                    alphabet or to zoological affinity. So little was the collection considered as a
                    literary work with a definite text that every one assumed a right to abridge or
                    enlarge, to insert ideas of his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n16/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0016-0007"/> own, or fresh Scriptural quotations; nor were the
                    scribes and translators by any means scrupulous about the names of natural
                    objects, and even the passages from Holy Writ. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physiologies</hi> had been abandoned by scholars, and left to take its chance
                    among the tales and traditions of the uneducated mass. Nevertheless, or rather
                    for this very reason, its symbols found their way into the rising literature of
                    the vulgar tongues, and helped to quicken the fancy of the artists employed upon
                    church buildings and furniture.</p>
                <p>The history of the <hi rend="italic">Physiologus</hi> has become entwined from
                    the beginning with that of the commentaries on the account of creation in
                    Genesis. The principal production of this kind in our possession is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hexaemeron</hi> of Basil, which contains several passages very
                    like those of the <hi rend="italic">Physiologus.</hi> For instance, in the
                    seventh homily the fable of the nuptials of the viper and the conger-eel, known
                    already to Aelian and Oppian, and proceeding from a curious misreading of
                    Aristotle <hi rend="italic">(Hist. An.,</hi> v. 4, p. 540 b, Bekk.), serves to
                    point more than one moral. Notwithstanding the difference in theology, passages
                    of this kind could not but be welcome to the admirers of the Alexandrian
                    allegories. In fact a medley from both Basil and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physiologus</hi> exists under the title of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hexaemeron</hi> of Eustathius; some copies of the first bear as a title ∏epi
                    φυσιολογία?, and in a Milan MS. the “morals” of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physiologus</hi> are ascribed to Basil. The Leyden Syriac is supplemented with
                    literal extracts from the latter, and the whole is presented as his work. Other
                    copies give the names of Gregory Theologus, Epiphanius, Chrysostom, and
                    Isidore.</p>
                <p>As far as can be judged, the emblems of the original <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physiologus</hi> were the following: (1) the lion (footprints rubbed out with
                    tail; sleeps with eyes open; cubs receive life only three days after birth by
                    their father’s breath); <hi rend="italic">(2)</hi> the sun-lizard (restores its
                    sight by looking at the sun); (3) the charadrius (Deut. xiv. 16; presages

                    hides its head and abandons the rest of its body); (12) the ant (orderly and
                    laborious; prevents stored grain from germinating; distinguishes wheat from
                    barley on the stalk); (13) the sirens and onocentaurs (Isa. xiii. 21, 22;

                    odour); (17) the sea-tortoise (or aspidochelone; mistaken by sailors for an
                    island); (18) the partridge (hatches eggs of other birds); (19) the vulture
                    (assisted in birth by a stone with loose kernel); (20) the ant-lion (able
                    neither to take the one food nor to digest the other); (21) the weasel
                    (conceives by the mouth and brings forth by the ear); (22) the unicorn (caught
                    only by a virgin); (23) the beaver (gives up its testes when pursued); (24) the

                    land and killed by rain, or in the water without ever seeing the sun); (30) the

                    the tree called peridexion (protects pigeons from the serpent by its shadow);
                    (35) the pigeons (of several colours; led by one of them, which is of a purple

                    forgetful of its own eggs). Besides these, or part of them, certain copies
                    contain sections of unknown origin about the bee, the stork, the tiger, the
                    woodpecker, the spider, and the wild boar.</p>
                <p>The Greek text of the <hi rend="italic">Physiologus</hi> exists only in late

                    Armenian Pitra gave some thirty-two chapters from a Paris MS. (13th century).
                    The Aethiopic exists both in London and Paris, and was printed at Leipsic by Dr
                    Hommel in 1877. In Arabic we have fragments at Paris, of which Renan translated
                    a specimen for the <hi rend="italic">Spicilegium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Salesmens«,</hi> and another version of thirty-seven chapters at Leyden,
                    probably the work of a monk at Jerusalem, which Land translated and printed with
                    the Syriac. The Latin MSS. of Bern are, after the Vatican glossary of
                    Ansileubus, the oldest of which we know; there are others in several libraries,
                    and printed editions by Mai, Heider, and Cahier. Besides these a few fragments
                    of an old abridgment occur in Vallarsi’s edition of Jerome’s works (vol. xi.
                    col. 218). A metrical <hi rend="italic">Physiologus</hi> of but twelve chapters
                    is the work of Theobaldus, probably abbot of Monte Cassino (1022-1035 A.υ.).
                    From this was imitated the Old-English fragment printed by Th. Wright, and
                    afterwards by Maetzner; also the Old-French <hi rend="italic">Sensuyl</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">le bestiaire</hi><hi rend="italic">d’amours.</hi> The prose <hi
                    rend="italic">Physiologus</hi> was done into Old High German before 1000, and
                    afterwards into rhyme in the same idiom; since Von der Hagen (1824) its various
                    forms have found careful editors among the leading Germanists. The Icelandic, in
                    a Copenhagen MS. of the 13th century, was printed by Prof. Th. Mobius in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Analecta norroena</hi> (2d ed., 1877); at the same time he gave it
                    in German in Dr HommeΓs Aethiopic publication. Some Anglo-Saxon metrical
                    fragments are to be found in Grein’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliothek,</hi> vol. L
                    The Provençal (c. 1250), published in Bartsch’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrestomathie</hi><hi rend="italic">provençale,</hi> omits the “morals,” but is
                    remarkable for its peculiarities of form. Before this there had been
                    translations into French dialects, as by Philippe de Thaun (1121), by Guillaume,
                    “clerc de Normandie,” also, about the same period, by Pierre, a clergyman of
                    Picardy. All the Old-French materials have not yet been thoroughly examined, and
                    it is far from improbable that some versions of the book either remain to be
                    detected or are now lost past recovery. A full account of the history of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Physiologus</hi> should also embrace the subjects taken from it in
                    the productions of Christian art, the parodies suggested by the original work,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Bestiaire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d’Amour</hi> by Richard de Fournival, and finally, the traces left
                    by it upon the encyclopaedical and literary work of the later Middle Ages.</p>
