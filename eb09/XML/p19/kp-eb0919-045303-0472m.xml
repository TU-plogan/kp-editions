                    (1814-1867), French dramatist, was born at Vienne in Dauphiné on the 1st June
                    1814. He was bred a lawyer, and his first performance in literature was a
                    translation of <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> (1837). But the first important,
                    and indeed the most important, event of his life was the representation of his
                    play <hi rend="italic">Lucrèce</hi> at the Théâtre Français on the 1st April
                    1843. This date is a kind of epoch in literary and dramatic history, because it
                    has been supposed to mark a reaction against the romantic style of Dumas and
                    Hugo. In reality, however, Ponsard was only a romantic of a somewhat tamer
                    genius than those who had gone before him. It so happened that the tastes and
                    capacities of the most popular actress of the day, Rachel, suited his style of
                    drama, and this contributed greatly to his own popularity. He followed up <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucrèce</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Agnès de Méranie</hi> (1846),
                    <hi rend="italic">Charlotte Corday</hi> (1850), and others. Ponsard accepted the
                    empire, though with no very great enthusiasm, and received the post of librarian

                    remarkable dramatist. Unlike most men who have achieved considerable success on
                    the stage, he did not overwrite himself, and most of his plays hold a certain

                    popularity is in the main due to the fact that he found an actress ready to hand
                    for his pieces, and that his appearance coincided with a certain public
                    weariness of the grander but also more extravagant and unequal style of
                    1830.</p>
