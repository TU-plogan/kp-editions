                <p><label type="entry">PILOT</label>. The English Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 (17
                    &amp; 18 Vict. c. 104) defines a pilot as being a person duly licensed by any
                    pilotage authority to conduct ships to which he does not belong as one of the
                    crew. Pilots are in fact taken on board to superintend the steering of the
                    vessel, where the navigation is difficult and dangerous, in consequence of their
                    special knowledge of particular waters; and it is to this class alone that the
                    term now applies, whereas in early times the pilot was the steersman, or the
                    individual who conducted the navigation of a ship across the ocean and out of
                    sight of land. The word seems to be of Dutch origin, and to mean primarily a
                    person who conducts a ship by the sounding line <hi rend="italic"
                        >(peillood).</hi> Cowell <hi rend="italic">(Law Diet.),</hi> describing <hi
                        rend="italic">lodemanage,</hi> speaks of it as the hire of a pilot for
                    conducting a vessel from one place to another,—a <hi rend="italic">lodesman</hi>
                    (Ang. Sax. <hi rend="italic">ldd-man,</hi> a leader) being a pilot for harbour
                    and river duty. During the period of his charge the whole responsibility of the
                    safe conduct of the vessel devolves upon the pilot. Most systems of maritime law
                    have made the employment of pilots compulsory, though this does not usually
                    apply to ships of war. One effect of neglect or refusal on the part of the
                    master of a ship to take a pilot is to discharge the insurers from their
                        liability.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In a
                            measure before parliament in 1884, but not passed, it was contemplated
                            to wholly abolish compulsory pilotage, releasing owners or masters of
                            ships not employing pilots from all pilotage dues or rates and from any
                            penalty for not employing a pilot.</p></note> Excepting under
                    extraordinary circumstances (such as where it is evident that he is acting
                    rashly or is intoxicated, or is palpably incompetent) a master would not be
                    justified in interfering with the pilot in his proper vocation. In England,
                    societies or corporations have long been established for the appointment and
                    control of pilots in particular localities; and of these the Trinity House,
                    London, owing to the number of the pilots under its control, and the large
                    extent of its jurisdiction, may be deemed the principal. The laws relating to
                    pilotage were consolidated by 48 Geo. III. c. 104 (1808), which was amended by 6
                    Geo. IV. c. 125 (1825); further regulations were made by 16 &amp; 17 Viet, c.
                    129 (1853), which incorporated the Cinque Ports with the Trinity House pilots;
                    and all existing regulations on the subject were embodied in the Merchant
                    Shipping Act 17 &lt;fc 18 Vict. c. 104 (1854), already referred to, from which
                    pilotage authorities within the United Kingdom derive their jurisdiction, and
                    which regulates their powers, the licensing of pilots and their rights,
                    privileges, liabilities, and remuneration (Maude and Pollock, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Law of Merchant Shipping,</hi> 1861).</p>
                <p>The laws of pilotage in the United States are regulated by the individual States
                    according to the Acts of Congress.</p>
