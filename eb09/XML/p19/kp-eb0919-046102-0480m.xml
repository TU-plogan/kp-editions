                    and numerous spurs from the hills enter the district. To the east it opens out
                    into plains; but a considerable area is now being put under forest. Poona is
                    watered by many streams which, rising in the Sahyadri range, flow eastwards
                    until they join the Bhima, a river which intersects the district from north to
                    south. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway runs through it, and affords an outlet
                    for its produce through the Bhor Ghat to Bombay; another railway is about to be
                    commenced which will put the district into communication with the southern
                    Mahratta country. The Khadakvasla Canal, about 10 miles south-west of Poona,
                    which it supplies with water, is one of its most important works. Although the
                    district is not rich in minerals, trap rock suitable for road-making and stone
                    for building purposes are found. Only in the west are wild animals met with,
                    chiefly tigers, leopards, bears, and <hi rend="italic">sambhar</hi> deer. The
                    climate is dry and invigorating; the average annual rainfall is about 30
                    inches.</p>
                <p>The population of the district in 1881 was 900,621 (455,101 males and 445,520
                    females), of whom 834,843 were Hindus, 42,036 Mohammedans, 1574 Parsis, 10,880
                    Jains, 9500 Christians, and 1788 of other religions. The only towns with a

                    1,775,583 were cultivated during 1882-83. Of these 181,395 acres were fallow
                    land and occupied waste, leaving 1,594,188 acres under actual cultivation, of
                    which 28,035 were twice cropped. The chief products are cereals (chiefly jowari
                    and bajri) and pulse, and the principal manufactures of the district are silk
                    robes, coarse cotton cloth, and blankets; its brass and silver work is much
                    admired. The gross revenue in 1882-83 was £180,736, of which the land tax
                    yielded £111,740, stamps £18,790, and excise £31,160.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">^ History.</hi> —The district passed from the last Hindu
                    dynasty which reigned at Deogiri to the Mohammedans between 1294 and 1312, and
                    under the Bahmani kings the Ghat country was thoroughly subdued. On the
                    disruption of the Bahmani kingdom after the revolt of the governors of the
                    provinces, the district fell to the share of the Ahmednagar kings and from them
                    it passed to the Moguls, when the Nizamshahi dynasty finally came to an end in
                    1637. The country north of the Bhima, including Junnar, was annexed to the Mogul
                    territory, and that south of it was made over to Bijapur. The power of the
                    latter was, however, declining, and gave an opportunity to the Mahratta chiefs
                    to unite and assert themselves, and ended in their establishing a Mahratta
                    kingdom at Satara. Intrigues at the palace led to the supremacy of the peshwas
                    and the removal of the capital to Poona, where many stirring scenes in Mahratta
                    history have been enacted. Holkar defeated the peshwa under its walls, and his
                    flight to Bassein led to the treaty by which he put himself under British
                    protection; he was reinstated iιi 1802, but, unable to maintain friendly
                    relations, he attacked the British at Kirkee in 1817, and his kingdom passed
                    from him.</p>
