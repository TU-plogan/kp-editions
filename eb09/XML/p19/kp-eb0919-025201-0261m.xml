                    rend="italic">ch</hi> is pronounced hard, and the <hi rend="italic">o</hi> in
                    all of them generally long, is very uncertain. Cotgrave has <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pocheculieτ,</hi> which he renders “Shoueler,” now· a-days the name of a kind

                    >Pochard</hi> as a popular French word signifying drunkard. That this word would
                    in the ordinary way become the English Pochard or Poker may be regarded as
                    certain; but then it is not known to be used in French as a bird's
                    name.</p></note> names properly belonging to the male of a species of Duck (the
                    female of which is known as the Dunbird), the <hi rend="italic">Anas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ferina</hi> of Linnaeus, and <hi rend="italic">Fuligula</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Aethyia</hi><hi rend="italic">ferina</hi> of later
                    ornithologists—but names very often applied by writers in a general way to most
                    of the group or Subfamily <hi rend="italic">Fuligulinae,</hi> commonly called
                    Diving or Sea-Ducks <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Duck,</hi>
                    vii. p. 505). The Pochard in full plumage is a very handsome bird, with a
                    coppery-red head, on the sides of which sparkle the ruby irides of his eyes,
                    relieved by the greyish-blue of the basal half of his broad bill, and the deep
                    black of his gorget, while his back and flanks appear of a light grey, being
                    really of a dull white closely barred by fine undulating black lines. The
                    tail-coverts both above and below are black, the quill feathers brownish-black,
                    and the lower surface of a dull white. The Dunbird has the head and neck
                    reddish-brown, with ill-defined whitish patches on the cheeks and chin, the back
                    and upper tail-coverts dull brown, and the rest of the plumage, except the lower
                    tail-coverts, which are brownish-grey, much as in the Pochard. This species is
                    very abundant in many parts of Europe, northern Asia, and North America,
                    generally frequenting in winter the larger open waters, and extending its
                    migrations to Barbary and Egypt, but in summer retiring northward and inland to
                    breed, and is one that certainly seems to have profited by the legislative
                    protection lately afforded to it in Britain, for, whereas during many years it
                    had but a single habitual breeding-place left in England, it is now known to
                    have several, to some of which it resorts in no inconsiderable numbers. American
                    examples seem to be slightly larger and somewhat darker in colour, and hence by
                    some writers have been regarded as specifically distinct under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Fuligula americana;</hi> but America has a perfectly distinct
                    though allied species in the celebrated Canvas-back Duck, <hi rend="italic">F.
                    vallisneriana,</hi> a much larger bird, with a longer, higher, and narrower
                    bill, which has no blue at the base, and, though the plumage of both, especially
                    in the females, is very similar, the male Canvas-back has a darker head, and the
                    black lines on the back and flanks are much broken up and further asunder, so
                    that the effect is to give these parts a much lighter colour, and from this has
                    arisen the bird’s common though fanciful name. Its scientific epithet is derived
                    from the freshwater plant, a species of <hi rend="italic">Vallisneria,</hi>
                    usually known as “wild celery,” from feeding on which its flesh is believed to
                    acquire the delicate flavour that is held in so great a repute. The Pochard and
                    Dunbird, however, in Europe are in much request for the table (as the German
                    name of the species, <hi rend="italic">Tafelente,</hi> testifies), though their
                    quality in this respect depends almost wholly on the food they have been eating,
                    for birds killed on the sea-coast are so rank as to be almost worthless, while
                    those that have been frequenting fresh water are generally well-tasted.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The plant known in some parts
                    of England as “willow-weed — not to be confounded, as is done by some writers,
                    with the willowwort <hi rend="italic">(Epilobiuni)—</hi> one of the many species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Polygonum,</hi> is especially a favourite food with most
                    kinds of Ducks, and to its effects is attributed much of the fine flavour which
                    distinguishes the birds that have had access to it.</p></note></p>
                <p>Among other species nearly allied to the Pochard that frequent the northern
                    hemisphere may be mentioned the Scaup-Duck, <hi rend="italic">F. marila,</hi>
                    with its American representative <hi rend="italic">F. affinis,</hi> in both of
                    which the male has the head black, glossed with blue or green; but these are
                    nearly always uneatable from the nature of their food, which is mostly gathered
                    at low tide on the “scaups” or “scalps,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Cognate with <hi rend="italic">scallop,</hi> and the Dutch
                    <hi rend="italic">schelp,</hi> a shell.</p></note> —as the banks on which
                    mussels and other marine molluscs grow are in many places termed. Then there are
                    the Tufted Duck, <hi rend="italic">F. cristata</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    black with a crest and white flanks—and its American equivalent <hi
                    rend="italic">F. collaris,</hi> and the White-eyed or Castaneous Duck, <hi
                    rend="italic">F. nyroca,</hi> and the Red-crested Duck, <hi rend="italic">F.
                    rτιfina-</hi> both peculiar to the Old World, and the last, conspicuous for its
                    red bill and legs, well known in India. In the southern hemisphere the genus is
                    represented by three species, <hi rend="italic">F. capensis, F. australis,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">F.</hi><hi rend="italic">novae-zealandioe,</hi> whose
                    respective names indicate the country each inhabits, and in South America exists
                    a somewhat divergent form which has been placed in a distinct genus as <hi
                    rend="italic">Metopiana peposaca.</hi></p>
                <p>Generally classed with the <hi rend="italic">Fuligidinae</hi> is the small group
                    known as the Eiders,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Icelandic, <hi rend="italic">Aedur.</hi></p></note> which differ from them
                    in several respects: the bulb at the base of the trachea in the male, so largely
                    developed in the members of the genus <hi rend="italic">Fuligula,</hi> and of
                    conformation so similar in all of them, is here much smaller and wholly of bone;
                    the males take a much longer time, two or even three years, to attain their full
                    plumage, and some of the feathers on the head, when that plumage is completed,
                    are always stiff, glistening, and of a peculiar pale-green colour. This little
                    group of hardly more than half a dozen species may be fairly considered to form
                    a separate genus under the name of <hi rend="italic">Somateria.</hi> Many
                    authors indeed have—unjustifiably, as it seems to the present writer—broken it
                    up into three or four genera. The well-known Eider, <hi rend="italic">8.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mollissima,</hi> is the largest of this group, and, beautiful as
                    it is, is excelled in beauty by the King-Duck, <hi rend="italic">8.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">spectabilis,</hi> and the little »S'. <hi rend="italic"
                    >stelleri.</hi> Space fails here to treat of the rest, but the sad fate which
                    has overtaken one of them, <hi rend="italic">8. labradoria,</hi> has been before
                    mentioned <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 735); and only the
                    briefest notice can be taken of a most interesting form generally, but obviously
                    in error, placed among them. This is the Logger-head, Racehorse, or
                    Steamer-Duck, <hi rend="italic">Microptcrus</hi> (or more properly <hi
                    rend="italic">Tachycrcs)</hi><hi rend="italic">cinereus</hi> of the Falkland
                    Islands and Straits of Magellan—nearly as large as a tame Goose, and subject to
                    the, so far as known, unique peculiarity of losing its power of flight after
                    reaching maturity. Its habits have been well described by Darwin in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal of Researches,</hi> and its anatomy is the subject of an
                    excellent paper in the Zoological Society’s <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi>
                    (vii., pp. 493-501, pls. IviiL-lxii.) by Prof. R. 0. Cunningham. (A. N.)</p>
