                    >Porpus</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Porpesse).</hi> The word is apparently
                    derived from the French <hi rend="italic">pore</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >poisson,</hi> or the Italian <hi rend="italic">porco</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >pesce,</hi> and thus corresponds with some of the English vernacular
                    appellations, “hogfish,” “sea-hog,” “herring-hog,” and the German <hi
                    rend="italic">Meerschwein,</hi> whence the usual modern French name of the
                    animal, <hi rend="italic">marsouin.</hi> “Porpoise” is commonly used by sailors
                    to designate all the smaller cetaceans, especially those numerous species which
                    naturalists call “dolphins”; but in scientific language it is restricted to a
                    particular form constituting the genus <hi rend="italic">Phocaena</hi> of
                    Cuvier, of which the Common Porpoise of the British seas, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phocaena</hi><hi rend="italic">communis,</hi> Cuvier <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Delphinus</hi><hi rend="italic">phocaena,</hi> Linnaeus), is the type. The
                    essential characters by which the genus is separated from the other members of
                    the order <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> are described in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> (vol*, xv. p. 398).</p>
                <p>The common porpoise, when full grown, attains a length of 5 feet or a little
                    more. The dimensions of an adult female specimen from the English Channel were
                    as follows: —length in straight line from nose to median notch between the
                    flukes of the tail, 62 J inches; from the nose to the anterior edge of the
                    dorsal fin, 29 inches; height of dorsal fin, 4∣ inches; length of base of dorsal
                    fin, 8 inches; length of pectoral fin, 9∣ inches; breadth of pectoral fin, 3 J
                    inches; breadth of tail flukes, 13 inches. The head is rounded in front, and
                    differs from that of the true dolphins in not having the snout produced into a
                    distinct “beak” separated from the frontal eminence by a groove. The under jaw
                    projects about half an inch beyond the upper one. The aperture of the mouth is
                    tolerably wide, and is bounded by stiff immobile lips, and curves slightly
                    upwards at the hinder end. The eye is small, and the external ear represented by
                    a minute aperture in the skin, scarcely larger than would be made by the
                    puncture of a pin, situated about 2 inches behind the eye. The dorsal fin is
                    placed near the middle of the back, and is low and triangular. The pectoral fins
                    are of moderate size, and slightly falcate.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0541-0522"/>
                <p>The horizontally-expanded caudal fin is of the form common to all <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea.</hi> The external surface, as in the rest of the order,
                    is smooth, shining, and devoid of hair, though in the foetal condition a few
                    bristles are found near the nose. The upper parts are dark grey, or nearly
                    black, according to the light in which they are viewed, and the state of
                    moisture or otherwise of the skin; the under parts are pure white. The line of
                    demarcation between these colours is not distinct, washes or splashes of grey
                    encroaching upon the white on the sides, and varies somewhat in different
                    individuals. Usually it passes from the throat (the anterior part of which, with
                    the whole of the under jaw, is dark) above the origin of the pectoral fin, along
                    the middle of the flank, and descends again to the middle line before reaching
                    the tail. Both sides of the pectoral and caudal fins are black. The anterior
                    edge of the dorsal fin is often furnished with a row of small rounded horny
                    spines or rather tubercles of very variable number, which have been thought to
                    indicate a specific distinction between the animals possessing them <hi
                    rend="italic">(JPhocaena</hi><hi rend="italic">tυberculifera,</hi> Grey) and
                    those without them, but this has not been confirmed by other characters. One of
                    the most characteristic anatomical distinctions between the porpoise and other
                    members of the <hi rend="italic">Delphinidae</hi> is the form of the teeth,
                    which (numbering twenty-three to twenty-six on each side of each jaw) instead
                    of'the usual conical, sharp-pointed, recurved shape, all have expanded,
                    flattened, spade-like crowns, with more or less marked vertical grooves, giving
                    a tendency to a bilobed or often trilobed form (see fig. 2).</p>
                <p>The porpoise is sociable and gregarious in its habits, being usually seen in
                    small herds, and frequents coasts, bays, and estuaries rather than the open
                    ocean. It is the commonest cetacean in the seas around the British Isles, and
                    not unfrequently ascends the river Thames, having been seen as high up as
                    Richmond; it has also been observed in the Seine at Neuilly, near Paris. It
                    frequents the Scandinavian coasts, entering the Baltic in the summer; and it is
                    found as far north as Baffin’s Bay, and as far west as the coasts of the United
                    States. Southward its range is more limited than that of the common dolphin, as,
                    though very common on the Atlantic coasts of France, it is not known to enter
                    the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>It feeds on fish, such as mackerel, pilchards, and herrings, of which it devours
                    large quantities, and, following the shoals, is often caught by fishermen in the
                    nets along with its prey. In former times it was a common and esteemed article
                    of food in England and in France, but is now rarely if ever eaten, being
                    commercially valuable when caught only for the oil obtained from its blubber.
                    Its skin is sometimes used for leather and boot-thongs, but the so-called
                    “porpoise hides” are generally obtained from a different and larger species of
                    cetacean, the <hi rend="italic">Beluga</hi> of the northern seas.</p>
                <p>A closely similar if not identical species from the American coast of the North
                    Pacific has been described under the name of <hi rend="italic">Phocaena</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">υomerina,</hi> and another from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata
                    as <hi rend="italic">P. spinipennis.</hi> Another nearly allied form is <hi
                    rend="italic">N</hi><hi rend="italic">comeris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >phocoenoides,</hi> a small species from the Indian Ocean and Japan, with teeth
                    of the same form as those of the common porpoise, but fewer in number (eighteen
                    to twenty on each side of each jaw) and of larger size, and more distinctly
                    notched or lobed on the free edge. It is distinguished from the common porpoise
                    externally by its entirely black colour and the complete absence of a dorsal
                    fin.</p>
