                    at Lüneburg early in life, was engaged first as organist and later as
                    kapellmeister and secretary to the duke of Brunswick, and was eventually
                    rewarded for his long services with the priory of Ringelheim, near Goslar. He
                    died at Wolfenbüttel on 15th February 1621. Of his very numerous compositions
                    copies are now so scarce that it is doubtful whether a complete set is anywhere
                    to be found. The most important are— <hi rend="italic">Polyhymnia</hi> (15
                    vols.), <hi rend="italic">Musae Sioniae</hi> (16 vols.), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Musa</hi><hi rend="italic">Aonia</hi> (9 vols.), all written partly to Latin
                    and partly to German words. But more precious than all these is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Syntagma</hi><hi rend="italic">musicum</hi> (3 vols, and a cahier
                    of plates, 4to, Wittenberg and Wolfenbüttel, 1615-20). Only two copies of this
                    very rare work are believed to exist in England, one in the library of the Rev.
                    Sir F. A. Gore-Ouseley and the other in that of Mr Alfred Littleton. In the
                    original prospectus of the work four volumes were promised, but it is certain
                    that no more than three were ever published. The fourth volume mentioned in
                    Forkel’s catalogue is clearly nothing but the cahier of plates attached to vol.

                <p>The chief value of this very remarkable work lies in the information it gives
                    concerning the condition of instrumental music in the early years of the 17th
                    century. The plates include excellent representations of all the musical
                    instruments in use at the time they were published, together with many forms
                    even then treated only as antique curiosities. Many of these instruments are
                    known to us only through these representations and the descriptions with which
                    they are accompanied, the instruments themselves having long fallen into disuse,
                    and no real examples having been preserved to us. Among the most important
                    instruments described and figured are the whole family of flutes, oboes, and
                    bassoons; the different kinds of trombone, many of which exactly resemble those
                    now in use; trumpets and horns of all conceivable varieties; viols, violins, and
                    basses; the entire family of stringed and keyed instruments, including the
                    psaltery, the spinet, the harpsichord, and a curious combination of the
                    harpsichord and viol called the “Nurembergisch Geigenwerck,” known only through
                    this description; and finally the organ, to the historical and technical
                    description of which an entire section is devoted. The work thus throws a light
                    upon the earlier forms of instrumental music which to the historian is
                    invaluable. In fact, without the information bequeathed to us by Praetorius it
                    would be impossible to reconstruct in theory the orchestra of the earlier half
                    of the 17th century, during which the opera and the oratorio both sprang into
                    existence, or even to understand the descriptions left us by other less careful
                    writers.</p>
