                    market town and municipal and parliamentary .borough in the West Riding of
                    Yorkshire, England, finely situated on an eminence near the junction of the
                    Calder and Aire, and on three railway lines, 13 miles south-east of Leeds, and
                    14 north-west of Doncaster. The streets are wide and regular, and there are many
                    good houses and shops. A park over 300 acres in extent is used as a public
                    recreation ground. The most important of the antiquarian remains are the ruins
                    of the famous castle situated on a rocky height, originally covering with its
                    precincts an area of over 8 acres, and containing in all eight round towers. The
                    principal feature remaining is the keep. The castle is said to occupy the site
                    of a fortress erected by Ailric, a Saxon thane. It was founded by Ilbert de Lacy
                    shortly after the Conquest, and probably nearly completed by Ilbert de Lacy the
                    second, who died about 1141. From that time till its demolition in 1649 it was
                    the great stronghold of South Yorkshire. It was the cradle of the dukes of
                    Lancaster, and in it Richard II. was, after his deposition, “kept secretly” till
                    his death. Many persons of rank and influence have been confined in it as
                    political prisoners. During the wars of York and Lancaster it was a centre of
                    intrigue and conspiracy. In 1536 it surrendered to Aske, the leader of the
                    “pilgrimage of grace.” At the beginning of the Civil War it was garrisoned for
                    Charles, and it underwent four sieges, three of them by the Parliamentary <pb

                <p>forces, and one by the Royalists. After its capitulation to Lambert in March 1649
                    it was dismantled. Below the castle is All Saints church, which suffered
                    severely during the siege of the castle, but still retains some work of the 12th
                    century. In 1837 the tower and transepts were fitted up for divine service. The
                    church of St Giles, formerly a chapel of ease to All Saints, but made parochial
                    in the 18th century, is of Norman date, but most of the present structure is
                    modern. The 17th-century spire was removed in 1707, and replaced by a square
                    tower, which was rebuilt in 1797; the chancel was rebuilt in 1869. In Southgate
                    is an ancient hermitage and oratory cut out of the solid rock, which dates from
                    1396. On St Thomas’s Hill, where Thomas, earl of Lancaster, was beheaded in
                    1322, a chantry was erected in 1373, the site of which is now occupied by a
                    windmill built of its stones. At Monkhill there are the remains of a Tudor
                    building called the Old Hall, probably constructed out of the old priory of St
                    John’s. A grammar school of ancient foundation, renewed by Queen Elizabeth and
                    by George III., is now in abeyance. The town-hall was built in 1796 on the site
                    of one erected in 1656, which succeeded the old moot-hall, dating from Saxon
                    times. Among other buildings are the court-house, the market-hall, the assembly
                    rooms (a handsome building adjoining the town-hall), and the dispensary. The
                    principal alms-house, that of St Nicholas, dates from Saxon times. Trinity
                    Hospital was founded in the 14th century by the celebrated Sir Robert Knolles.
                    There are extensive gardens and nurseries in the neighbourhood, and liquorice is
                    largely grown for the manufacture of the celebrated Pomfret cakes. The town
                    possesses iron foundries, sack and matting manufactories, tanneries, breweries,
                    corn mills, and brick and terra-cotta works. The population of the municipal
                    borough (extended in 1875) in 1871 was 6432, and in 1881 it was 8798, the
                    population of the parliamentary borough (area 7316 acres) in the same years
                    being 11,563 and 15,322. The increase is mainly due to the fact that Pontefract
                    is now a military centre.</p>
                <p>There are indications that the Romans were stationed near the I »resent town,
                    which adjoins the Ermine Street. In Domesday it s called Tateshale, and is said
                    previously to have been held by the king (Edward the Confessor). It then
                    possessed a church and priest, one fishery, and three mills. Subsequently it is
                    mentioned as Kirkby. Of the cause of the change of the name to Pontefract
                    various unsatisfactory explanations are given. According to one account it was
                    because when William advanced to the conquest of the north his passage was
                    delayed by a broken bridge (but this was at Ferrybridge, 3 miles off); according
                    to a second the name was bestowed on it by its Norman possessor from Pontfrete
                    in Normandy (which, however, never existed); and according to a third the name
                    perpetuates the remarkable preservation from drowning of those who fell into the
                    river when the concourse of people made the bridge give way on the arrival of St
                    William of Canterbury in 1153 (although all contemporary historians call the
                    place Pontefract when Archbishop Thurstan died there in 1140). The town received
                    a charter from Roger de Lacy in 1194, and was incorporated in the time of
                    Richard III. As early as 1297 it returned two members to parliament; but there
                    was a long discontinuance in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. The practice
                    was revived under James I. The “redistribution” measure of 1885 deprives it of
                    one of its members. The municipal borough is divided into three wards, and is
                    governed by six aidermen and eighteen councillors.</p>
