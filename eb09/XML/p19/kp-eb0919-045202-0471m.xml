                    (1788-1867), mathematician, was born at Metz, July 1, 1788. From 1808 to 1810 he
                    attended the Polytechnic School, and afterwards, till 1812, the Practical School
                    at Metz. He then became lieutenant of engineers, and took part in the Russian
                    campaign, during which he was taken prisoner and was confined at Saratoff on the
                    Volga. It was during his imprisonment here that, “privé de toute espèce de
                    livres et de secours, surtout distrait par les malheurs de ma patrie et les
                    miens propres,” as he himself puts it, he began his researches on projective
                    geometry which led to his great treatise on that subject. This work, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Traité des Propriétés Projectives</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Figures,</hi> which was published in 1822 (2d ed., 1865), is occupied with the
                    investigation of the projective properties of figures, that is, such properties
                    as are not altered by projection. In his investigation he employs the ideas of
                    continuity, of homologous figures, and of reciprocal polars; and by means of
                    these, without any analysis, he was able to establish all the known properties
                    of lines and surfaces of the second degree, and to discover others unknown
                    before. This work entitles Poncelet to rank as one of the greatest of those who
                    took part in the development of the modern geometry of which Monge was the
                    founder. From 1815 to 1825 he was occupied with military engineering at Metz;
                    and from 1825 to 1835 he was professor of mechanics at the Practical School
                    there. In 1826, in his <hi rend="italic">Mémoire sur les Rôties Hydrauliques à
                    Aubes Courbes,</hi> he brought forward improvements in the construction of
                    water-wheels, which more than doubled their efficiency. In 1834 he became a
                    member of the Academy; from 1838 to 1848 he was professor to the faculty of
                    sciences at Paris, and from 1848 to 1850 commandant of the Polytechnic School,
                    where he effected a reform in the course of study. At the London International
                    Exhibition in 1851 he had charge of the department of machinery, and wrote a
                    report on the machinery and tools on view at that exhibition. He died December
                    22, 1867. Besides those referred to above, he wrote a number of works, and
                    contributed many papers to <hi rend="italic">Creliefs Journal,</hi> &lt;Stc., on
                    different branches of engineering and mathematics.</p>
