                    11th February 1786 at Ross in Herefordshire. His parents were of the Society of
                    Friends, and his career in after life partly turned on his not receiving the
                    then narrow course of school education, but a wider home training in modern
                    languages and general literature. Living at Bristol, he occupied himself much in
                    examining the natives of different countries who were to be met with amongst the
                    shipping of the port, and he would occasionally bring a foreigner to his
                    father’s house. Thus in early life he laid a foundation for his later
                    researches, and he was mainly led to adopt medicine as a profession from the
                    facilities which its study offered <pb break="no"

                <p>for the investigation of man. He took his degree at Edinburgh, afterwards reading
                    for a year at Trinity College, Cambridge, whence, joining the Church of England,
                    he migrated to St John’s College, Oxford, afterwards entering as a gentleman
                    commoner at Trinity College, Oxford, but seeking no degree in either university.
                    In 1810 he settled at Bristol as a physician, and in 1813 published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Researches into the Physical History of Man,</hi> in 2 vols.,
                    afterwards extended to 5 vols. The central principle of the book is the
                    primitive unity of the human species, acted upon by causes which have since
                    divided it into permanent varieties or races. Dr Prichard states that he was led
                    into this inquiry by the diversity of races being alleged as a disproof of the
                    Mosaic records; in argument, however, he endeavoured not to rely on theology,
                    but to proceed “by the ordinary method of observation and experience.” The work
                    is dedicated to Blumenbach, whose five races of man are adopted. But where
                    Prichard excelled Blumenbach and all his other predecessors was in his grasp of
                    the principle that people should be studied by combining all available
                    characters, and he, accordingly discusses them at large with regard at once to
                    bodily form, language, and state of civilization. One investigation begun in
                    this work requires special mention, the bringing into view of the fact,
                    neglected or contradicted by philologists, that the Celtic nations are allied by
                    language with the Slavonian, German, and Pelasgian (Greek and Latin), thus
                    forming a fourth European branch of the Asiatic stock (which would now be called
                    Indo-European or Aryan). Prichard, whose own Celtic descent is shown by his
                    name, was a fitting promulgator of this leading principle of Celtic research.
                    His special treatise containing Celtic compared with Sanskrit words appeared in
                    1831 under the title <hi rend="italic">Eastern Origin of the Celtic
                    Nations.</hi> It is remarkable that the essay by Adolphe Pictet, <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">Affinité des
                    Langues Celtiques avec le Sanscrit,</hi> which was crowned by the French Academy
                    and made its author’s reputation, should have been published in 1837 in evident
                    ignorance of the earlier and in some respects stricter investigations of
                    Prichard. His work has been re-edited since by Dr R. G. Latham (London, 1857),
                    with large additions of Celtic material. Prichard’s <hi rend="italic">Analysis
                    of Egyptian Mythology</hi> (London, 1819) had some popularity at the time, and
                    was translated into German with a preface by A. W. v. Schlegel; its comparison
                    of the Egyptian religion with Brahmanism is now obsolete, and its author was
                    unwise in bringing out a new edition in 1838, after Champoilion’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Grammar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> had opened the
                    actual Egyptian inscriptions to scholars. Dr Prichard’s last important book was
                    a revision and condensation of his researches into a <hi rend="italic">Natural
                    History of Man</hi> (London, 1843), which has gone through several editions, and
                    remains a standard work of the anthropologist’s library. Towards the end of his
                    life, in recognition of his services, he was made a commissioner of lunacy, and
                    in consequence removed from Bristol to London, where he died in 1848.</p>
