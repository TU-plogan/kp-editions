                    the United States. The plant is about a foot high, bearing two peltate,
                    deeply-divided leaves, which are about 5 inches in diameter, and bear in the
                    axil a solitary, stalked, white flower about the size and shape of the garden
                    anemone, with six or more petals and twice as many hypogynous stamens. The fruit
                    is ripe in May, and is an oval, yellowish, fleshy berry containing twelve or
                    more arillate seeds. The rhizome, as met with in commerce, occurs in cylindrical
                    pieces two or three inches long and about ⅛ inch in diameter, of a chocolate or
                    purplish brown colour, smooth and slightly enlarged where the juncture of the
                    leafy stem is indicated by a circular scar on the upper and a few broken
                    rootlets on the under side. The odour is heavy and disagreeable, and the taste
                    acrid and bitter.</p>
                <p>Podophyllin is a resinous powder obtained by precipitating an alcoholic tincture
                    of the rhizome by means of water acidulated with hydrochloric acid. It varies in
                    colour from greyish to bright yellow or greenish brown, the first-named being
                    the purest. The drug has been the subject of numerous chemical investigations,
                    the most recent of which (Podwyssotzki, in <hi rend="italic">Ztschr. f.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Russland,</hi> xx. 777) indicates that its activity is due to a
                    definite resinous compound which has been named by its discoverer <hi
                    rend="italic">podophyllotoxin</hi>; another constituent named <hi rend="italic"
                    >podophylloquercetin</hi> has neither emetic nor purgative properties, but
                    appears to be the cause of the griping pains which sometimes accompany the
                    action of podophyllin; a third substance, <hi rend="italic">podophyllic
                    acid,</hi> has no medicinal action. <hi rend="italic">Podophyllotoxin</hi> is a
                    bitter amorphous principle soluble in weak alcohol and in hot water, ether, and
                    chloroform, but insoluble in petroleum spirit. It is split up by the action of
                    alkalies into a resin-acid named picropodophyllic acid, which is inert, and a
                    very active substance, picropodophyllin, which crystallizes in delicate silky
                    needles. _ Picropodophyllin is insoluble in water, and almost insoluble in
                    spirit of less than 80 per cent., but is rendered soluble when united to the
                    picropodophyllic acid. <hi rend="italic">Podophylloquercetin</hi> crystallizes
                    in short needles of a yellow colour and metallic lustre. It is soluble in etheι∙
                    and alcohol, and forms a compound with acetate of lead which is soluble in
                    acetic acid and can be sublimed in shining yellow crystals, and which on
                    exposure to the air gradually becomes green. <hi rend="italic">Podophyllic
                    acid</hi> is insoluble in water and in ether, but soluble in alcohol. In
                    medicine podophyllin is employed for torpor of the liver and obstinate
                    constipation, arising from sedentary employment, imprudence in diet, and
                    irregularity of habits. In small doses it acts as a slow and gentle laxative,
                    especially if combined with henbane and belladonna, but in large doses it is an
                    irritant hydragogue cathartic, the action of which persists for some time. The
                    usual dose as a laxative and mild hepatic stimulant is about ⅜ of a grain, but
                    the samples met with in commerce vary considerably in strength, and act with
                    varying effect upon different individuals. Specimens having a greenish tint
                    should be avoided, since they probably contain podophylloquercetin and tend to
                    cause severe griping. In large doses it appears to lose its stimulant action on
                    the liver. Podophyllin is official in the pharmacopoeias of Great Britain,
                    India, France, Russia, and the United States.</p>
