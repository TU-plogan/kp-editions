                    doubt that his intercourse with the mathematicians of that school, more
                    particularly with Poncelet and Gergonne, greatly helped to determine the earlier
                    part at least of his career. In 1825 he was received as “privat-docent” at Bonn,
                    and after three years he was made professor extraordinary. The title of his

                    master of those general ideas of modern geometry whose development began with
                    the publication of the former of these works, Plucker’s actual labours lay more
                    in the direction of the latter. It was his aim to furnish modern geometry with
                    suitable analytical methods and thus to give it an independent analytical
                    development. In this effort he was as successful as were his great
                    contemporaries Poncelet and Steiner in cultivating geometry in its purely
                    synthetical form. From his lectures and researches at Bonn sprang his first
                    great work <hi rend="italic">Analytisch-Geometrische Entwickelungen</hi> (voL i.

                    which has become one of the characteristic features of modern analytical
                    geometry. The peculiarity of this method consists in this, that the letters used
                    in the equations of curves and surfaces represent, not coordinates of a point
                    with respect to arbitrary chosen axes, but straight lines, or it may be curves
                    or surfaces, intrinsically related to the figure <pb break="no"

                    investigate the properties of a conic section with respect to a pair of tangents
                    and their chord of contact, we write its equation <hi rend="italic">uυ +
                    w</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> l</hi> =0, where u = 0,
                    rø=0, w = 0 represent the two tangents and the chord of contact respectively.
                    This procedure has two great advantages. It enables us to greatly abridge the
                    necessary analytical equations, to arrive at them more easily, and thus to
                    lighten or altogether avoid the cumbersome algebraical calculations which had
                    broken the back of the old-fashioned Cartesian geometry and arrested its
                    progress altogether; and it greatly facilitates the geometrical interpretation
                    of analytical results whether intermediate or final. In the first volume of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Entwickelungen,</hi> Plücker applied the method of abridged
                    notation to the straight line, circle, and conic sections, and he subsequently
                    used it with great effect in many of his researches, notably in his theory of
                    cubic curves.</p>
                <p>In the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Entwickelungen,</hi> Plücker
                    clearly established on a firm and independent basis the great principle of
                    duality. This principle had originally been established by Poncelet as a
                    corollary on the theory of the pole and polar of a conic section. Gergonne
                    maintained the independent and fundamental nature of the principle, and hence
                    arose a violent discussion between him and Poncelet into which Pliicker was
                    drawn. He settled the matter in Gergonne’s favour by introducing the notion of
                    the coordinates of a line and of a plane, and showing that in plane geometry,
                    for example, we could wi th equal readiness represent a point either by means of
                    coordinates or by means of an equation, and that the same was true of a line.
                    Hence it appeared that the point or the line in plane geometry, and the point or
                    the plane in solid geometry, could with equal readiness and with equal reason be
                    taken as elements. It was thus made evident that any system of equations proving
                    a theorem regarding points and lines or regarding points and planes could at
                    once be read as proving another in which the words <hi rend="italic">point</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">line</hi> or the words <hi rend="italic">point</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">plane</hi> were everywhere interchanged.</p>
                <p>Another subject of importance which Pliicker took up in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Entwickelungen</hi> was the curious paradox noticed by Euler and Cramer, that,
                    when a certain number of the intersections of two algebraical curves are given,
                    the rest are thereby determined. Gergonne had shown that when a number of the
                    intersections of two curves of the <hi rend="italic">{p</hi> + g <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>)th degree lie on a curve of the ^th degree the rest
                    lie on a curve of the 7th degree. Pliicker finally <hi rend="italic">(Gergonne
                    Ann.,</hi> 1828-29) showed how many points must be taken on a curve of any
                    degree so that curves of the same degree (infinite in number) may be drawn
                    through them, and proved that all the points, beyond the given ones, in which
                    these curves intersect the given one are fixed by the original choice. Later,
                    simultaneously with Jacobi, he extended these results to curves and surfaces of
                    unequal order. Allied to the matter just mentioned was Pliicker’s discovery of
                    the six equations connecting the numbers of singularities in algebraical curves.
                    It will be best described in the words of Clebsch :—“Cramer was the first to
                    give a more exact discussion of the singularities of algebraical curves. The
                    consideration of singularities in the modern geometrical sense originated with
                    Poncelet. He showed that the class <hi rend="italic">k</hi> of a curve of the
                    nth order, which Gergonne by an extraordinary mistake had considered to be
                    identical with its order, is in general <hi rend="italic">n(n -</hi> 1); and
                    hence arose a paradox whose explanation became possible only through the theory
                    of the simple singularities. By the principle of duality the order <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> of a curve should be derived in the same way from the class
                    <hi rend="italic">k</hi> as <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is from <hi rend="italic"
                    >n.</hi> But if we derive <hi rend="italic">n</hi> in this way from <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> we return not to <hi rend="italic">n</hi> but to a much
                    greater number. Hence there must be causes which effect a reduction during this
                    operation. Poncelet had already recognized that a double point reduces the class
                    by 2, a cusp at least by 3, and a multiple point of the pth order, all of whose
                    tangents are distinct, by ⅛(p-l). Here it was that Pliicker took up the
                    question. By first directly determining the number of the points of inflexion,
                    considering the influence of double points and cusps, and finally applying the
                    principle of duality to the result obtained, he was led to the famous formulae
                    for the singularities of curves which bear his name, and which completely
                    resolve the paradox of Poncelet—formulae which already in the year 1854 Steiner
                    could cite as the ‘well known,’ without, however, in any way mentioning
                    Pliicker’s name in connexion with them. Pliicker communicated his formulae in
                    the first place to <hi rend="italic">Grelles</hi><hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi>
                    vol xii. (1834), and gave a further extension and complete account of his theory
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Theorie der Algebraischen Gurren,</hi> 1839.”</p>
                <p>In 1833 Pliicker left Bonn for Berlin, where he occupied for a short time a post
                    in the Friedrich Wilhelm’s Gymnasium. He was then called in 1834 as ordinary
                    professor of mathematics to Halle. While there he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">System</hi><hi rend="italic">der Analytischen Geometrie, auf neue
                    Betrachtungsweisen gegründet, und insbesondere eine Ausführliche Theorie der
                    Curven dritter Ordnung enthaltend,</hi> Berlin, 1835. In this work he introduced
                    the use of linear functions in place of the ordinary coordinates, and thereby
                    increased the generality and elegance of his equations; he also made the fullest
                    use of the principles of collineation and reciprocity. In fact he develops and
                    applies to plane curves, mainly of the third degree, the methods which he had
                    indicated in the <hi rend="italic">Entwickelungen</hi> and in various memoirs
                    published in the interim. His discussion of curves of the third order turned
                    mainly on the nature of their asymptotes, and depended on the fact that the
                    equation to every such curve can be put into the form <hi rend="italic">pqr +
                    μs</hi> = 0. He gives a complete enumeration of them, including two hundred and
                    nineteen species. In 1836 Plücker returned to Bonn as ordinary professor of
                    mathematics. Here he published his <hi rend="italic">Theorie der
                    Algebraischen</hi><hi rend="italic">Curven</hi> which formed a continuation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">System</hi><hi rend="italic">der Analytischen
                    Geometrie.</hi> The work falls into two parts, which treat of the asymptotes and
                    singularities of algebraical curves respectively; and extensive use is made of
                    the method of counting constants which plays so large a part in modern
                    geometrical researches. Among the results given we may mention the enumeration
                    of curves of the fourth order according to the nature of their asymptotes, and
                    according to the nature of their singularities, and the determination for the
                    first time of the number of double tangents of a curve of the fourth order
                    devoid of singular points.</p>
                <p>From this time Pliicker’s geometrical researches practically ceased, only to be
                    resumed towards the end of his life. It is true that he published in 1846 his
                    <hi rend="italic">System</hi><hi rend="italic">der Geometrie des Raumes in neuer
                    Analytischer Behandlungsweise,</hi> but this contains merely a more systematic
                    and polished rendering of his earlier results. It has been said that this
                    cessation from pure mathematical work was due to the inappreciative reception
                    accorded by his countrymen to his labours, and to their jealousy of his fame in
                    other lands; it seems likely, however, that it was due in some degree to the
                    fact that he was called upon to undertake the work of the physical chair at Bonn
                    in addition to his proper duties. In 1847 he was made actual professor of
                    physics, and from that time his wondrous scientific activity took a new and
                    astonishing turn.</p>
                <p>Pliicker now devoted himself to experimental physics in the strictest sense as
                    exclusively as he had formerly done to pure mathematics, and with equally
                    brilliant results. His first physical memoir, published in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poggendorffs</hi><hi rend="italic">Annalen,</hi> vol. lxxii., 1847, contains
                    his great discovery of magnecrystallic action. Then followed a long series of
                    researches, mostly published in the same journal, on the properties of magnetic
                    and diamagnetic bodies, establishing results which are now part and parcel of
                    our magnetic knowledge. It is unnecessary here to analyse these researches, of
                    which an account has been given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Magnetism</hi> (vol. xv. p. 262 s⅛.); it will be sufficient to say that in this
                    work Plücker was the worthy collaborateur, and, had it not been that their fast
                    friendship and mutual admiration renders the word inappropriate, we might have
                    said rival, of Faraday.</p>
                <p>In 1858 <hi rend="italic">(Pogg. Ann.,</hi> vol. ciii.) he published the first of
                    his classical researches on the action of the magnet on the electric discharge
                    in rarefied gases (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity,</hi> vol. viii. p. 74).
                    It is needless now to dilate upon the great beauty and importance of these
                    researches, which remain the leading lights in one of the darkest channels of
                    magnetic science. All the best work that has recently been done on this
                    important subject is simply development of what Plücker did, and in some
                    instances (notably in many of the researches of Crookes) merely reproduction on
                    a larger scale of his results.</p>
                <p>Plücker, first by himself and afterwards in conjunction with Hittorf, made many
                    important discoveries in the spectroscopy of gases. He was the first to use the
                    vacuum tube with the capillary part now called a Geissler’s tube, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n239/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0239-0230"/> by means of which the luminous intensity of
                    feeble electric discharges was raised sufficiently to allow of spectroscopic
                    investigation. He anticipated Bunsen and Kirchhoff in announcing that the lines
                    of the spectrum were characteristic of the chemical substance which emitted
                    them, and in indicating the value of this discovery in chemical analysis.
                    According to Hittorf he was the first who saw the three lines of the hydrogen
                    spectrum, which a few months after his death were recognized in the spectrum of
                    the solar protuberances, and thus solved one of the mysteries of modern
                    astronomy. For a fuller account of the important discoveries regarding the
                    influence of temperature and pressure on the nature of gaseous spectra made in
                    conjunction with Hittorf see <hi rend="smallcaps">Spectrum Analysis.</hi></p>
                <p>Hittorf, who had good means of knowing, tells us that Plücker never attained
                    great manual dexterity as an experimenter. He had always, however, very clear
                    conceptions as to what was wanted, and possessed in a high degree the power of
                    putting others in possession of his ideas and rendering them enthusiastic in
                    carrying them into practice. Thus he was able to procure from the Sayner Hütte
                    in 1846 the great electromagnet which he turned to such noble use in his
                    magnetic researches; thus he attached to his service his former pupil the
                    skilful mechanic Fessel; and thus he discovered and fully availed himself of the
                    ability of the great glass-blower Geissler, in conjunction with whom he devised
                    many of those physical instruments whose use all over the civilized world has
                    rendered the name of the artificer of Bonn immortal. It was thus also that, when
                    he felt his own want of chemical knowledge and manipulative skill, he sought and
                    obtained the assistance of Hittorf, one of the ablest of German
                    experimenters.</p>
                <p>Induced by the encouragement of his mathematical friends in England, Plücker in
                    1865 returned once more to the field in which he first became known to fame, and
                    adorned it by one more great achievement—the invention of what is now called
                    Line Geometry. A remark containing the fundamentally new idea of this new
                    geometry had, as Clebsch remarks, already been embodied in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >System</hi><hi rend="italic">der Geometrie des Raumes</hi>:—“A straight line
                    depends on four linear constants. The four magnitudes which we consider as
                    variables receive for any given line constant values, which may be easily
                    constructed and are the four coordinates of the straight line. A single equation
                    between these four coordinates does not determine a locus for the straight line,
                    but merely a law according to which infinite space is made up of straight
                    lines.” Here we have the new idea of the straight line considered as an element
                    of space, and of the “complex,” as Plücker afterwards called it, made up of a
                    threefold infinity of straight lines subject to a onefold relation. Space thus
                    becomes as it were four-dimensioned, and we have, instead of the three degrees
                    of freedom of space considered as an aggregate of points, four degrees of
                    freedom according as the linear element is (1) absolutely unconditioned, (2)
                    subject to a onefold, (3) subject to a twofold, or (4) subject to a threefold
                    relation. In the first case we have the complex of straight lines, in the second
                    the congruency of lines, in the third the regulus or ruled surface. The last of
                    these geometrical figures had been considered long before, and even the
                    congruency had been discussed before or independently of Plücker, notably by
                    Hamilton and Kummer. The general conception of the linear complex seems to be
                    entirely due to Plücker. At all events he developed the notion to such an extent
                    that he is entitled to be called the founder of Line Geometry, in which the
                    theory of the complex holds a fundamental position. His first memoir on the
                    subject was published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi>
                    of the Royal Society of London. It attracted much attention, and almost at once
                    became the source of a large literature in which the new science was developed.
                    Plücker himself worked out the theory of complexes of the first and second
                    order, introducing in his investigation of the latter the famous complex
                    surfaces of which he caused those models to be constructed which are now so well
                    known to the student of the higher mathematics. He was engaged in bringing out a
                    large work embodying the results of his researches in Line Geometry when he died
                    on the 22d May 1868. The work was so far advanced that his pupil and assistant
                    Klein was able to complete and publish it, thereby erecting the worthiest
                    monument to the genius of his master, whose wonderful scientific activity
                    endured to the very last. Of the very numerous honours bestowed on Plücker by
                    the various scientific societies of Europe it may suffice to mention here the
                    Copley medal, awarded to him by the Royal Society two years before his
                    death.</p>
