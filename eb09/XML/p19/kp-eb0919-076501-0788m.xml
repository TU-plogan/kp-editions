                <p><label type="entry">PRIVY COUNCIL</label>. In England the king almost of
                    necessity has been at all times guided by a council. The council, as it existed
                    in the Norman period under the name of <hi rend="italic">curia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">regis</hi> (a branch of the larger <hi rend="italic">commune
                    concilium</hi><hi rend="italic">regni),</hi> exercised judicial, legislative,
                    and administrative functions. It contained the germs of the courts of law and
                    equity, the Houses of Parliament, and the privy council. The Courts of King’s
                    Bench and Common Pleas were gradually separated from it and became only courts
                    of first instance, subject to appeal to the king’s council. From the time of
                    Edward I. the <hi rend="italic">concilium</hi><hi rend="italic">ordinarium,</hi>
                    the ordinary or standing council of the king, superseded the <hi rend="italic"
                    >curia</hi><hi rend="italic">regis.</hi> It exercised high judicial functions as
                    the ultimate court of appeal, as the adviser of suitors on petition what court
                    to choose for redress, and as the resort of those who failed to obtain justice
                    in the ordinary course. It was also the supreme administrative body, and as such
                    issued ordinances on matters of a local or temporary nature, with not infrequent
                    usurpations at a later period of jurisdiction belonging more properly to the
                    common law courts or to parliament. The council “consisted of the chief
                    ministers, the chancellor, treasurer, lord steward, lord admiral, lord marshall,
                    the keeper of the privy seal, the chamberlain, treasurer, and comptroller of the
                    household, the chancellor of the exchequer, the master of the wardrobe; and of
                    the judges, king’s serjeant, and attorneygeneral, the master of the rolls, and
                    justices in eyre, who at that time were not the same as the judges at
                    Westminster” (Hallam, <hi rend="italic">Middle Ages,</hi> vol. iii. p. 205). The
                    growing power of the ordinary council (it does not seem to have been called the
                    privy council until after the reign of Henry VI.) led to many complaints on the
                    part of the Commons, some of which found their expression in statutes. The most
                    worthy of notice is 25 Edw. III. st. 5, c. 4, characterized by Hallam as
                    probably the most extensively beneficial enactment in the -whole body of our
                    laws. Among other provisions it prohibited arbitrary imprisonment and the
                    determination of pleas of freehold before the council. The power of the council
                    expanded or contracted according to the vigour of the king. Its authority was
                    finally reduced by the Long Parliament in 1640 by means of 16 Car. I. c. 10.
                    Assumption of jurisdiction over freeholds was still a grievance, for the Act
                    specially declared that the king’s council has no jurisdiction over any man’s
                    land, goods, or chattels. From the beginning of Edward III.’s reign the council
                    and the House of Lords were often blended into one assembly, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">magnum concilium or</hi> great council. As it met only when
                    summoned by writ and not daily, like the ordinary council, it could scarcely
                    have exerted as much authority as the latter. It is therefore not surprising to
                    find it soon split permanently into its two component parts, each retaining both
                    judicial and legislative authority. The privy council still exercises authority
                    of both kinds, though not as completely as the House of Lords. The political
                    importance of the privy council has almost entirely disappeared since the duties
                    of government have been assumed by the cabinet. Its modern legislative
                    jurisdiction is of a subordinate character. Its position as a court of appeal
                    from the foreign possessions of the crown is a strictly logical one. It was
                    always the court for redress where no other redress could be obtained. For the
                    sake of convenience this jurisdiction in cases of what is now called equity was
                    exercised by the chancellor, originally the president of the ordinary council
                    when it sat as a court of justice. But in cases for which equity made no
                    provision, as being out of the bounds of the realm, the privy council still
                    exercises to the full one of the most ancient parts of its jurisdiction. Appeals
                    lay from foreign possessions by virtue of the prerogative, but are now generally
                    regulated by statute. The jurisdiction of the High Court of Delegates over
                    ecclesiastical and admiralty cases was transferred to the privy council in 1832.
                    The council lost its probate appeal jurisdiction in 1857, its admiralty
                    jurisdiction in appeals from England in 1875, from Ireland in 1877.</p>
                <p>At the present day members of the privy council become so at the will of the
                    crown, but it is understood that persons in certain positions have an <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio</hi> claim to be nominated. The council consists of
                    princes of the royal family or of some of the great officers of state, such as
                    the principal members of the Government, the archbishops and the bishop of
                    London, the judges of the House of Lords, the judicial committee, and the court
                    of appeal, diplomatists of high rank, &amp;c. Members of the privy council have
                    the title of “right honourable” and social precedence next after knights of the
                    Garter. Ireland has its own privy council. Scotland has had none of its own
                    since 6 Anne c. 40, which provided for one privy council for Great Britain. The
                    modern jurisdiction of the privy council may be divided into two branches,
                    administrative and judicial.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administrative.—</hi> This jurisdiction chiefly depends upon
                    statutory authority, which practically makes of the privy council a subordinate
                    legislature. It is exercised either by the whole council or by committees to
                    which matters are referred by the crown in council. Examples of the latter are
                    the board of trade, the committee of council on education, the local government
                    board (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Public Health),</hi> the universities committee,
                    with temporary powers under the Universities Act, 1877, and the committee of
                    council for the consideration of charters of incorporation under the Municipal
                    Corporations Act, 1882. Cases affecting the constitutional rights of the Channel
                    Islands are referred to a committee for the affaire of Jersey and Guernsey. The
                    committees report to the crown in council, and their report is adopted and
                    enforced by an order in council, published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gazette.</hi> Among other Acts conferring administrative powers upon the privy
                    council are the Pharmacy Act, 1852, as amended by 31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 121, the
                    Medical Act, 1858, the Foreign Enlistment Act, 1870, the Destructive Insects
                    Act, 1877, the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, the Dentists Act, 1878,
                    the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1881.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Judicial.—</hi> Up to 1833 the judicial authority of the privy
                    council was exercised by judicial committees appointed from time to time for the
                    hearing of appeals referred to them by the crown <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n789/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0789-0766"/> in council. In 1833 the judicial committee of the
                    privy council was established as a permanent court by 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 41.
                    Under this and later Acts the judicial committee now consists of the lord
                    president, the lord chancellor, and other persons who fill or have filled high
                    judicial offices (all unpaid), of two retired Indian or colonial judges who
                    receive an allowance for attending the sittings of the committee, and of paid
                    members, now two in number, appointed under 34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. 91. The
                    Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876, provides for what is in effect the union of
                    the House of Lords and of the privy council in their judicial capacities by the
                    lords of appeal in ordinary gradually becoming judges of both courts. After the
                    death or resignation of the present paid members these two high judicial bodies
                    will be practically combined, and a near approach will be made to the mediaeval
                    <hi rend="italic">magnum concilium</hi> in an ultimate court of appeal from the
                    whole of the British dominions.</p>
                <p>In proceedings under the Church Discipline Act archbishops and bishops who are
                    members of the privy council are members of the judicial committee, 3 &amp; 4
                    Vict. c. 86. In proceedings under the Public Worship Act, 1874, archbishops and
                    bishops attend as assessors according to rules made by order in council, 39
                    &amp; 40 Viet c. 59, § 14. The jurisdiction of the judicial committee is either
                    original or appellate. The original jurisdiction is the less important, and
                    consists of certain powers conferred by the Copyright, Patent, Endowed Schools,
                    and other Acts. The power most frequently exercised is that of extending the
                    term of patents. The appellate jurisdiction is entirely regulated by statute,
                    with the exception of the rarely occurring appeal from orders made by the lord
                    chancellor of Great Britain or of Ireland in exercise of powers conferred by
                    royal sign manual for the custody of idiots and lunatics. Appeals lie from the
                    Arches Court of Canterbury, from a vice-admiralty court abroad, and from the
                    Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, India, and the colonies. Appeals are either of
                    right or by leave. Appeals lie as of right when the value of the matter at issue
                    is of a certain amount (the amount varying according to the appeal rules of the
                    different foreign possessions), and in a few other cases. Appeals lie at the
                    discretion of the judicial committee, on leave being obtained by petition for
                    special leave to appeal. The proceedings in all cases alike, whether original or
                    appellate, are by petition (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Petition).</hi> The
                    petition is addressed to the crown in council in the first instance.</p>
