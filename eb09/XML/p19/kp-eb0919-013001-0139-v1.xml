                <p><label type="entry">PISISTRATUS</label>, citizen and afterwards tyrant of Athens,
                    was the son of Hippocrates, through whom he traced his pedigree to Neleus and
                    Nestor, princes of Messene in the Heroic Age. A branch of the family had reigned
                    at Athens in the persons of Codrus and his descendants. Pisistratus was second
                    cousin to Solon, their mothers having been cousins, and the early friendship
                    between the two men was not entirely broken off even by the wide political
                    differences which separated them in later life. Pisistratus, who was much junior
                    to Solon, was born about 605 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In his youth there
                    was a keen rivalry between Athens and Megara, and Pisistratus as general of
                    Athens contrived by stratagem to defeat the Megarians and capture their port
                    Nisaea (perhaps 570 or a little later).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            Other writers (Polyaenus, i. 20; Aelian, <hi rend="italic">Var.</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> vii. 19) erroneously attribute the
                            stratagem to Solon, and refer it to the expedition in which Solon
                            recovered Salamis. Plutarch <hi rend="italic">{Solon,</hi> 8) falls into
                            this mistake, and adds to it the blunder of representing Pisistratus as
                            having taken part in the expedition, which happened about 600 B.c. The
                            two events (Solon’s conquest of Salamis and Pisistratus’s capture of
                            Salamis) are distinguished by Justin (ii. 7, 8), and after him by
                            Dunckeτ <hi rend="italic">(θesch. des Alterthums,</hi> vi. pp. 145, 244)
                            and others, but they are confused by Thirlwall and Grote. From Plutarch
                                <hi rend="italic">(Solon,</hi> 8, 9) we may infer that the confusion
                            arose in popular tradition. The account of the stratagem itself in the
                            Greek writers Plutarch and Polyaenus differs somewhat from that in the
                            Latin writers Justin and Frontinus. Aelian follows (with some
                            variations) the latter account.</p></note> But Pisistratus was ambitious
                    of more than military triumphs, and in the internal condition of Attica he
                    discerned the road to power. The constitution which Solon had given to Athens a
                    few years before (594 B.c.) was too moderate to satisfy either of the extreme
                    parties. The wealthy nobles chafed at the political rights granted to the lower
                    classes, while the poor were dissatisfied with what they regarded as merely a
                    half measure of relief. The nobles themselves were divided into the parties
                    known as the Plain <hi rend="italic">(Pedieis)</hi> and the Coast <hi
                        rend="italic">(Paraloi),</hi> the former inhabiting the western lowlands of
                    Attica, the latter the level districts on the southern and eastern coasts.<note

                            political parties. It is true that Plutarch <hi rend="italic"
                                >(Solon,</hi> 13) represents the Paraloi as a moderate political
                            party, intermediate between the Pedieis (oligarchs) and the Diacrioi
                            (democrats), but this has the appearance of being a mere conjecture of
                            his own. His view is, however, accepted by Curtius and
                        Dunckcr.</p></note> The former were led by the noble Lycurgus, the latter by
                    Megacles, of the proud house of the Alcmaeonidae. Pisistratus took advantage of
                    their dissensions to form a third political party out of the men of the Mountain
                        <hi rend="italic">(Diacreis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Diacrioι),</hi> the
                    poor cottars and shepherds of the eastern and northern hills, among whom his own
                    estates lay. He easily won the affection of these simple highlanders. His
                    manners were captivating, his good humour imperturbable; his purse was ever at
                    the service of the needy; his fields and gardens stood open for their enjoyment.
                    Equality and fraternity, together with the maintenance of the constitution, were
                    the watchwords of this eloquent and handsome aristocrat, the people’s friend.
                    But his easy and affable deportment hid a boundless ambition. Solon detected his
                    schemes, and warned the people against him, but in vain. One day, not long after
                    a violent dispute with Megacles in the public assembly, Pisistratus drove into
                    the market-place, himself and his mules bleeding from wounds which he had
                    inflicted with his own hand, but which he pretended to have received from his
                    political enemies. The indignant people decreed a guard for the protection of
                    their champion. Of this guard the champion soon availed himself in order to
                    seize the Acropolis and make himself master of Athens (560). Megacles and the
                    Alcmaeonidae fled, but Solon remained and continued to lift his voice against
                    the usurper, who, however, treated the old man with the utmost deference, as a
                    valued friend and counsellor. Solon did not long survive his country’s freedom;
                    he died in the next year (559). The government of Pisistratus was marked by
                    great moderation; he maintained the existing laws, to which he exacted obedience
                    from all, and set the example of it himself. Being once accused of <pb

                    citizen to answer the charge, which, however, the accuser did not venture to
                    press. But before he had time to establish himself firmly on the throne, he was
                    expelled by a coalition of the Plain and Coast parties (perhaps in 555).<note

                    confiscated and sold by auction. But after five or six years Megacles, unable to
                    make head against the party of the Plain, proposed to Pisistratus to secure his
                    recall on condition that Pisistratus should marry his daughter Coesyra,
                    Pisistratus agreed, and his return was effected by a stratagem. A tall and
                    beautiful woman, Phya by name, was dressed as the goddess Athene, and drove into
                    Athens on a chariot with Pisistratus at her side, while heralds proclaimed that
                    Athene herself was bringing back Pisistratus. Thus restored, Pisistratus
                    fulfilled his part of the bargain by marrying Coesyra; but by his former
                    marriage he had already sons approaching manhood (Hippias and Hipparchus), and
                    he treated his young wife so slightingly that Megacles, feeling himself
                    affronted, made peace with his adversaries, and the united parties once more
                    compelled Pisistratus to quit Athens (perhaps in 549). But he did not renounce
                    his designs on the tyranny. The contributions which he received from various
                    cities, especially Thebes, enabled him to hire a body of Argive mercenaries,
                    with which he landed at Marathon in the eleventh year after his expulsion
                    (perhaps in 538). His partisans flocked to him, and he defeated the Athenians at
                    Pallene, and repossessed himself of the tyranny, which he thenceforward held
                    till his death. He now placed his power on a securer basis by keeping a body of
                    mercenaries in his pay, and levying a tax of a tenth or a twentieth on the
                    produce of the soil. A further revenue accrued to him from the Thracian mines,
                    and probably from the silver mines of Laurium, and the harbour and market dues.
                    He now developed his plans for the extension of the naval empire of Athens in
                    the Aegean. The island of Naxos was conquered by him, and handed over to
                    Lygdamis, a native of the island, who had zealously supported the restoration of
                    Pisistratus with men and money. In Naxos Pisistratus deposited the hostages he
                    exacted from those of his enemies who chose to remain at Athens. In Sigeum on
                    the Hellespont, which he conquered from the Mytilenians, he established as
                    tyrant Hegesistratus, his son by an Argive wife, whom he had married in his
                    second exile. The European side of the Hellespont was already in Athenian hands,
                    Miltiades having established an Athenian colony on the Thracian Chersonese
                    during the first tyranny, and with the consent of Pisistratus. Athens thus
                    commanded the straits through which passed the corn trade of the Black Sea.
                    Pisistratus further raised the reputation of Athens by purifying the sacred
                    island of Delos; all the graves within sight of the temple of Apollo were opened
                    and the dead removed to another part of the island. His rule was as wise and
                    beneficent at home as it was glorious abroad. He encouraged agriculture by
                    lending the poorer peasants cattle and seed, and he paid special attention to
                    the cultivation of the olive. He enacted or enforced a law against idleness, and
                    he required that the state should maintain its disabled soldiers. Under his rule
                    and that of his sons Attica was intersected by high roads, which, converging to
                    the capital, helped to unite the country and thus to abolish local feuds and
                    factions. To the tyrants Athens further owed those subterranean channels in the
                    rock which still supply it with drinking water from the hills Pisistratus also
                    adorned Athens with splendid public buildings. The temple of the Pythian Apollo
                    was his work; and he began, but did not finish, the great temple of Zeus, the
                    remaining columns of which still ' astonish the beholder. Modern

                    attributed to him by Theopompus, but to Pericles by the better authority of
                    Philochorus. He caused the Panathenaic festival to be celebrated every fourth
                    year with unusual magnificence.</p>
                <p>The well-known story that Pisistratus was the first to collect and publish the
                    poems of Homer in their present form rests on the authority of late writers
                    (Cicero being the earliest), and seems to be sufficiently disproved by the
                    silence of all earlier authorities (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Homer).</hi> The
                    statement of Aulus Gellius that Pisistratus was the, first to establish a public
                    library at Athens is perhaps equally void of foundation. The tyrant seems to
                    have been merciful and amiable to the last. It is not recorded of him that he
                    ever put an enemy to death, and the easy good humour with which he submitted to
                    affronts offered to himself and his family reminds us of Caesar. Solon’s
                    description of him appears to have been justified—that apart from his ambition
                    there was not a better-disposed man at Athens than Pisistratus. He died at an
                    advanced age in 527, and was succeeded by his sons Hippias and Hipparchus (the
                    Pisistratidae), who continued to rule Athens in the same moderate and beneficent
                    spirit. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">g. fr.)</hi></p>
