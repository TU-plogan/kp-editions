                    and his dexterity as a copyist of MSS. brought him into early notice with the
                    chief scholars of Florence. Coluccio Salutati and Niccolo de’ Niccoli befriended
                    him, and in the year 1402 or 1403 he was received into the service of the Roman
                    curia. His functions were those of a secretary; and, though he profited by
                    benefices conferred on him in lieu of salary, he remained a layman to the end of
                    his life. It is noticeable that, while he held his office in the curia through
                    that momentous period of fifty years which witnessed the councils of Constance
                    and of Basel, and the final restoration of the papacy under Nicholas V., his
                    sympathies were never attracted to ecclesiastical affairs. Nothing marks the
                    secular attitude of the Italians at an epoch which decided the future course of
                    both Renaissance and Reformation more strongly than the mundane proclivities of
                    this apostolic secretary, heart and soul devoted to the resuscitation of
                    classical studies amid conflicts of popes and antipopes, cardinals and councils,
                    in all of which he bore an official part. Thus, when his duties called him to
                    Constance in 1414, he employed his leisure in exploring the libraries of Swiss
                    and Swabian convents. The treasures he brought to light at Reichenau,
                    Weingarten, and above all at St Gall, restored many lost masterpieces of Latin
                    literature, and supplied students with the texts of authors whose works had
                    hitherto been accessible only in mutilated copies. In one of his epistles he
                    describes how he recovered Quintilian, part of Valerius Flaccus, and the
                    commentaries of Asconius Pedianus at St Gall. MSS. of Lucretius, Columella,
                    Silius Italicus, Manilius, and Vitruvius were unearthed, copied by his hand, and
                    communicated to the learned. Wherever Poggio went he carried on the same
                    industry of research. At Langres he discovered Cicero’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oration for Cεecina,</hi> at Monte Cassino a MS. of Frontinus. He also could
                    boast of having recovered Ammianus Marcellinus, Nonius Marcellus, Probus,
                    Flavius Caper, and Eutyches. If a codex could not be obtained by fair means, he
                    was ready to use fraud, as when he bribed a monk to abstract a Livy and an
                    Ammianus from the convent library of Hersfeld. Resolute in recognizing erudition
                    as the chief concern of man, he sighed over the folly of popes and princes, who
                    spent their time in wars and ecclesiastical disputes when they might have been
                    more profitably employed in reviving the lost learning of antiquity. This point
                    of view is eminently characteristic of the earlier Italian Renaissance. The men
                    of that nation and of that epoch were bent on creating a new intellectual
                    atmosphere for Europe by means of vital contact with antiquity. Poggio, like a
                    still more eminent humanist of his age, Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, was a great
                    traveller, and wherever he went he brought, like Aeneas Sylvius, enlightened
                    powers of observation trained in liberal studies to bear upon the manners of the
                    countries he visited. We owe to his pen curious remarks on English and Swiss
                    customs, valuable notes on the remains of antique art in Rome, and a singularly
                    striking portrait of Jerome of Prague as he <pb break="no"

                    the stake. It is necessary to dwell at length upon Poggio’s devotion to the task
                    of recovering the classics, and upon his disengagement from all but humanistic
                    interests, because these were the most marked feature of his character and
                    career. In literature he embraced the whole sphere of contemporary studies, and
                    distinguished himself as an orator, a writer of rhetorical treatises, a
                    panegyrist of the dead, a violent impugner of the living, a translator from the
                    Greek, an epistolographer and grave historian, and a facetious compiler of
                    fabliaux in Latin. Of his moral essays it may suffice to notice the
                    dissertations <hi rend="italic">On Nobility, On Vicissitudes of Fortune, On the
                    Misery of Human Life, On the Infelicity of Princes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >On Marriage in Old Age.</hi> These compositions belonged to a species which,
                    since Petrarch set the fashion, were very popular among Italian scholars. They
                    have lost their value, except for the few matters of fact embedded in a mass of
                    commonplace meditation, and for some occasionally brilliant illustrations.
                    Poggio’s <hi rend="italic">History of Florence,</hi> written in avowed imitation
                    of Livy’s manner, requires separate mention, since it exemplifies by its defects
                    the weakness of that merely stylistic treatment which deprived so much of
                    Bruni’s, Carlo Aretino’s, and Bembo’s work of historical weight. A somewhat
                    different criticism must be passed on the <hi rend="italic">Facetiae,</hi> a
                    collection of humorous and indecent tales expressed in such Latinity as Poggio
                    could command. This book is chiefly remarkable for its unsparing satires on the
                    monastic orders and the secular clergy. It is also noticeable as illustrating
                    the Latinizing tendency of an age which gave classic form to the lightest essays
                    of the fancy. Poggio, it may be observed, was a fluent and copious writer in the
                    Latin tongue, but not an elegant scholar. His knowledge of the ancient authors
                    was wide, but his taste was not select, and his erudition was superficial. His
                    translation of Xenophon’s <hi rend="italic">Cyropaedia</hi> into Latin cannot be
                    praised for accuracy. Among contemporaries he passed for one of the most
                    formidable polemical or gladiatorial rhetoricians; and a considerable section of
                    his extant works are invectives. One of these, the <hi rend="italic">Dialogue
                    against Hypocrites,</hi> was aimed in a spirit of vindictive hatred at the vices
                    of ecclesiastics; another, written at the request of Nicholas V., covered the
                    anti-pope Felix with scurrilous abuse. But his most famous compositions in this
                    kind are the personal invectives which he discharged against Filelfo and Valla.
                    All the resources of a copious and unclean Latin vocabulary were employed to
                    degrade the objects of his satire; and every crime of which humanity is capable
                    was ascribed to them without discrimination. In Filelfo and Valla Poggio found
                    his match; and Italy was amused for years with the spectacle of their indecent
                    combats. To dwell upon such literary infamies would be below the dignity of the
                    historian, were it not that these habits of the early Italian humanists imposed
                    a fashion upon Europe which extended to the later age of Scaliger’s contentions
                    with Scioppius and Milton’s with Salmasius. The greater part of Poggio’s long
                    life was spent in attendance to his duties in the papal curia at Rome and
                    elsewhere. But about the year 1452 he finally retired to Florence, where he was
                    admitted to the burghership, and on the death of Carlo Aretino in 1453 was
                    appointed chancellor and historiographer to the republic. He had already built
                    himself a villa in Valdarno, which he adorned with a collection of antique
                    sculpture, coins, and inscriptions. In 1435 he had married a girl of eighteen
                    named Vaggia, of the famous Buondelmonte blood. His declining days were spent in
                    the discharge of his honourable Florentine office and in the composition of his
                    history. He died in 1459, and was buried in the church of Santa Croce. A statue
                    by Donatello and a picture by Antonio del Pollajuolo remained to commemorate a
                    citizen who chiefly for his services to humanistic literature deserved the
                    notice of posterity.</p>
