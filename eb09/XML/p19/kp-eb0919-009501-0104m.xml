                    punishment as described by Strutt is nearly identical with the instrument which
                    eventually became known as the pillory. The etymology is not quite clearly made
                    out. It is most probably connected with <hi rend="italic">pillar,</hi> Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">pilier,</hi> Μ. H. German <hi rend="italic">Pfilaere,</hi> but
                    there are forms with an initial <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (Prov. <hi
                    rend="italic">espitlori,</hi> Low Lat. <hi rend="italic">spilorium)</hi> which
                    this derivation does not explain. The more usual French term is not <hi
                    rend="italic">pilori</hi> but <hi rend="italic">le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >carcan.</hi> The Germans have <hi rend="italic">Preller.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Heals-fang</hi> or <hi rend="italic">halsfang</hi> (Anglo-Saxon for a catching
                    of the neck) was the old English name. The word was also sometimes applied to
                    the pecuniary mulct paid in commutation of the punishment. No punishment has
                    been inflicted in so many different ways as that of the pillory. Sometimes the
                    machine was constructed so that several criminals might be pilloried at the same
                    time, but it was commonly capable of holding only one. Douce <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Illustrations of Shakespeare)</hi> gives six representations of distinct
                    varieties of this instrument. In Griffiths <hi rend="italic">(Chron. of
                    Newgate)</hi> and in a learned and exhaustive account of the pillory by Jewitt
                    <hi rend="italic">(Reliquary,</hi> April 1861), examples will also be found, and
                    notably of the pillory for women, which differed in form from that in use for
                    male offenders. It would <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n105/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0105-0096"/> appear that it had not always been customary to
                    subject women to this form of punishment; for them the thew or the tumbrel,
                    which latter was probably the same as the ducking or cucking stool often spoken
                    of in the early English laws in conjunction with the pillory, was reserved.
                    These varieties are all reducible, however, to the simplest form of the pillory
                    as ordinarily known, which consisted of a wooden post and frame fixed on a
                    platform raised several feet from the ground, behind which the culprit stood,
                    his head and his hands being thrust through holes in the frame so as to be
                    exposed in front of it. This frame in the more complicated forms of the
                    instrument consisted of a perforated iron circle or carcan (hence the French
                    name), which secured the heads and hands of several persons at the same
                    time.</p>
                <p>In the statutes of Edward I. it is enacted that every pillory or stretch-neck
                    should be made of convenient strength so that execution might be done on
                    offenders without peril of their bodies. It was customary to shave the heads
                    wholly or partially and the beards of men, and to cut off the hair and even in
                    extreme cases to shave the heads of female culprits. Some of the offences
                    punished in England by the pillory will be found enumerated in the statute 51
                    Hen. III. c. 6 (1266), comprehending chiefly indictable offences not amounting
                    to felony (commonly called misdemeanours), such as forestalling and regrating,
                    using deceitful weights and measures, perjury or subornation of perjury, libel,
                    seditious writings, &amp;c. Later on, the punishment of the pillory was ordained
                    for courtesans, common scolds, and brawlers and other like delinquents both male
                    and female, and in the later years of its existence, notably during the 17 th
                    and 18th centuries, it was much resorted to as a punishment for political
                    offenders, who on some occasions experienced the roughest treatment at the hands
                    of the mob, ill-usage resulting in some instances on record even in death. The
                    intention of setting a criminal in the pillory was that he should become
                    infamous and known as such afterwards by the spectators. Examples have not been
                    wanting, however, in which much sympathy has been both felt and expressed by the
                    populace for the individual subjected to this punishment. The duration of the
                    punishment was usually assigned at the discretion of the judge who passed the
                    sentence, though sometimes it was fixed by law. The form of the judgment was
                    that the defendant should “be set <hi rend="italic">in</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">upon</hi> the pillory”; he was consequently said to stand <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi> the pillory, not <hi rend="italic">at</hi> it.</p>
                <p>The pillory was abolished in Britain, so far as related to all offences save
                    perjury and subornation, in 1816 (56 Geo. III. c. 138), and finally altogether
                    by statute 7 Will. IV. and 1 Vict. c. 23 in 1837. In the former Act power had
                    been reserved to the court to pass sentence of fine or imprisonment or both in
                    lieu of the pillory. The punishment was done away with in France in 1832 upon
                    the revision of the penal code, and has now indeed been withdrawn from most of
                    the modern systems of penal law.</p>
