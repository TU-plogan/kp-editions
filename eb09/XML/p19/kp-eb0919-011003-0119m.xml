                    learned languages as well as with French, Italian, and Spanish—she was married
                    in 1763 to Henry Thrale, a brewer of Southwark, whose house was at Streatham on
                    the south-east corner of Tooting Beck Common. In this retreat she drew around
                    her many of the most distinguished men of letters of the age. She was introduced
                    to Johnson by Arthur Murphy in the year after her marriage, and for nearly
                    twenty years the sage remained on the closest intimacy with her. He travelled
                    with them in Wales in 1774, and visited France in their company in 1775.
                    Boswell’s first visit to Streatham took place in October 1769. Madame D’Arblay
                    was first received there in August 1778. In spite of this intercourse with the
                    principal writers of the day troubles grew upon her in her married life. Her
                    talents were not appreciated by her husband; he was always ill and frequently in
                    pecuniary anxiety; and when children were born to her they often succumbed to
                    sickness. After some years’ illness Mr Thrale died on April 4, 1781, and, as the
                    brewery in the borough sold for .£135,000, the widow found herself amply
                    provided for. At the time of Mr Thrale’s death Dr Johnson was in declining
                    health, and he soon began to think himself slighted, nor was his indignation
                    abated at the announcement in the spring of 1783 of her engagement to Piozzi, an
                    Italian musician. For a time the engagement was broken off, but it was quickly
                    resumed, and on the 25th of July 1784 they were married. The union provoked the
                    resentment of her children, and the undying denunciations of Dr Johnson; but,
                    when her husband was found to be a man of quiet and inoffensive manners and a
                    careful guardian of his wife’s resources, her children acquiesced in the
                    marriage and most of her friends returned to her. Baretti, always her enemy,
                    abused her, and Boswell ridiculed her, but her character has survived the
                    insinuations of the one and the open malevolence of the other, as well as the
                    satiric attacks of Peter Pindar. Piozzi died of gout at Brynbella, March 1809,
                    and from that time his widow’s life was chiefly spent in the social circles of
                    Bath and Clifton or in the retirement of Penzance. When long past seventy she
                    took a fancy to William Augustus Conway the actor, and the “love letters” which
                    she wrote to him have been published with a catchpenny title. She died at
                    Clifton, 2d May 1821.</p>
                <p>Mrs Piozzi was bright and witty, and possessed of manners which, if not refined,
                    never failed to attract. Several of her literary publications have long since
                    perished from want of vitality, but her little poem of “The Three Warnings”
                    forms a part of most selections of English poetry. Her <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anecdotes of Dr Johnson,</hi> now a scarce book, are contained, “as she herself
                    gave them to the world,” in the concluding volume of Napier’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Johnson</hi> (1884), and her notes to Wraxall’s <hi rend="italic">Historical
                    Memoirs</hi> are reprinted in the 1884 edition of that work. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Anecdotes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Letters to and from Dr
                    Johnson</hi> are inferior in interest only to the work of Boswell. Two editions
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> of Mrs Piozzi, under the editorship
                    of Abraham Hayward, have been issued, and the Rev. Edward Mangin published in
                    1833, under the disguise of “by a friend,” a thin volume of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Piozziana.</hi> Her features are reproduced in the lady’s countenance in
                    Hogarth’s picture of the Lady’s Last Stake.</p>
