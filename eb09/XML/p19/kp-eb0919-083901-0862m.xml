                <p>The forms here brought together include several genera (the first nineteen)
                    referred by Zopf to the Mycetozoa, some again (Vampyrella, Myxastrum, Nuclearia,
                    Monobia) which are by Biitschli associated with the Heliozoa, others
                    (Protamoeba, Gloidium) referred by the same authority to the Lobosa (Amoebaea)
                    and others (Colpodella, Protomonas) which might be grouped with the lower
                    Flagellata. By grouping them in the manner here adopted we are enabled to
                    characterize those higher groups more satisfactorily and to give a just
                    expression to our present want of that knowledge of the life-history both of
                    these forms and of the higher Gymnomyxa which when it is obtained may enable us
                    to disperse this heterogeneous class of Proteomyxa. The group has the same
                    function in relation to the other classes of Gymnomyxa which the group. Vermes
                    has been made to discharge in relation to the better defined phyla of the
                    Metazoa; it is a lumber-room in which obscure, lowly-developed, and
                    insufficiently known fonns may be kept until they can be otherwise dealt
                    with.</p>
                <p>It is true that, thanks to the researches of Continental botanists (especially
                    Cienkowski and Zopf), we know the life-history of several of these organisms;
                    but we are none the less unable to connect them by tangible characteristics with
                    other Gymnomyxa.</p>
                <p>Nearly all of the above-named genera are parasitic rather than “voracious,” that
                    is to say, they feed on the organized products of larger organisms both plants
                    and animals (Haplococcus is parasitic in the muscles of the pig), into whose
                    tissues they penetrate, and do not, except in a few cases (Protomyxa,
                    Vampyrella), engulph whole organisms, such as Diatoms, &amp;c., in their
                    protoplasm. Many live upon and among the putrefying debris of other organisms
                    <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> rotting vegetable stems and leaves, excrements of
                    animals), and like the Mycetozoa exert a digestive action upon the substances
                    with which they come in contact comparable to the putrefying and fermentative
                    activity of the Schizomycetes (Bacteria).</p>
                <p>Fig. II. illustrates four chief genera of Proteomyxa.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Protomyxa aurantiaca</hi> was described by Haeckel (1), who
                    found it on shells of Spirula on the coast of the Canary Islands, in the form of
                    orange yellow flakes consisting of branching an&lt;l reticular protoplasm
                    nourishing itself by the ingestion of Diatoms and Peridinia. This condition is
                    not a simple amoeba phase but a “plasmodium” formed by the union of several
                    young amoebae. The plasmodium under certain conditions draws itself together
                    into a spherical form and secretes a clear membranous cyst around itself, and
                    then breaks up into some hundreds of flagellulae or swarmspores (Fig. II. 2).
                    The diameter of the cystis *12 to *2 millimetre. The flagellulae subsequently
                    escape (Fig. II. 3) and swim by the vibratile movement of one end which is drawn
                    out in the form of a coarse flagellum. The swarm-spore now passes into the
                    amoeba phase (Fig. II. 4). Several of the small amoebae creeping on the surface
                    of the spirula-shell then unite with one another and form a plasmodium which
                    continues to nourish itself by “voracious” inception of Diatoms and other small
                    organisms. The plasmodia may attain a diameter of one millimetre and be visible
                    by the naked eye.</p>
                <p>A nucleus was not observed by Haeckel in the spores nor in the amoeba phase, nor
                    scattered nuclei in the plasmodium, but it is not improbable that they exist and
                    escaped detection in the living condition, in consequence of their not being
                    searched for by methods of staining, &amp;c., which have since come into use. A
                    contractile vacuole does not exist.</p>

                    (Fig. II. 5, 6, 7), is one of several species assigned to the genus Vampyrella,
                    all of which feed upon the living cells of plants. The nucleus previously stated
                    to be absent has been detected by Zopf (13). There is no contractile vacuole.
                    The amoeba phase has an actinophryd character <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi>
                    exhibits fine radiating pseudopodia resembling those of the sun-animalcule,
                    Actinophrys, one of the Heliozoa). This species feeds exclusively upon the
                    contents of the cells of Spirogyra, eflect-ing an entrance through the cell-wall
                    (Fig. II. 5), sucking out the contents, and then creeping on to the next cell.
                    In some species of Vampyrella as many as four amoeba-individuals have been
                    observed to fuse to form a small plasmodium. Cysts are formed which enclose in
                    this species a single amoeba-individual. The cyst often acquires a second or
                    third inner cyst membrane by the shrinking of the protoplasmic body after the
                    first encystment and the subsequent formation of a new membrane. The encysted
                    protoplasm sometimes merely divides into four parts each of which creeps out of
                    the cyst as an Actinophrys-like amoeba (Fig. II. 7); in other instances it forms
                    a dense spore, the product of which is not known.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Protogenes primordialis</hi> is the name given by Haeckel to a
                    very simple form with radiating filamentous pseudopodia which he observed in
                    sea-water. It appears to be the same organism as that described and figured by
                    Max Schultze as <hi rend="italic">Amoeba</hi><hi rend="italic">porrecta.</hi>
                    Schultze’s figure is copied in Fig. II. 12. No nucleus and no contractile
                    vacuole is observed in this form. It feeds voraciously on smaller organisms. Its
                    life-history has not been followed over even a few steps. Hence we must for the
                    present doubt altogether as to its true affinities. Possibly it is only a

                    observed by him in pond water and differs from Protogenes in having lobose
                    pseudopodia, whilst agreeing with it in absence of nuclei, contractile vacuoles,
                    and other differentiation of structure. The structureless protoplasmic network
                    described by Haeckel from spirit-preserved specimens of Atlantic ooze and
                    identified by him with Huxley’s (28) Bathybius, as also the similar network
                    described by Bessels (29) as Protobathybius, must be regarded for the present as
                    insufficiently known.</p>
                <p>It is possible that these appearances observed in the ooze dredged from great
                    depths in the Atlantic are really due to simple Protozoa. On the other hand it
                    has been asserted by Sir Wyville Thomson, who at one time believed in the
                    independent organic nature of Bathybius, that the substance taken for protoplasm
                    by both Huxley and Haeckel is in reality a gelatinous precipitate of calcium
                    sulphate thrown down by the action of alcohol upon sea-water. Other naturalists
                    have pointed to the possibility of the protoplasmic network which Bessels
                    studied in the living condition on board ship being detached portions of the
                    protoplasm of Reticularia and Radiolaria. The matter is one which requires
                    further investigation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Archerina Boltoni</hi> is the name given by Lankester (14) to a
                    very simple Gymnomyxon inhabiting freshwater ponds in company with Desmids and
                    other simple green Algae (Fig. II. 8 to 11). Archerina exhibits an amoeba phase
                    in which the protoplasm is thrown into long stiff filaments (Fig. II. 11),
                    surrounding a spherical central mass about τ <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> ∏ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> πr</hi> th inch in diameter (actinophryα form). A large
                    vacuole (non-eontractile) is present, or two or three small ones. No nucleus can
                    be detected by careful use of reagents in this or other phases. The protoplasm
                    has been seen to ingest solid food particles (Bacteria) and to assume a lobose
                    form. The most striking characteristic of Archerina is the possession of
                    chlorophyll corpuscles. In the actinophryd form two oval green-coloured bodies
                    <hi rend="italic">(b, b)</hi> are seen. As the protoplasm increases by nutrition
                    the chlorophyll corpuscles multiply by quaternary division (Fig. 11. 10) and
                    form groups of four or of four sets of four· symmetrically arranged. The
                    division of the chlorophyll corpuscles is not necessarily followed by that of
                    the protoplasm, and accordingly specimens are found with many chlorophyll
                    corpuscles embedded in a large growth of protoplasm (Fig. II. 8); the growth may
                    increase to a considerable size, numbering some hundreds of chlorophyll
                    corpuscles, and a proportionate development of protoplasm. Such a growth is not
                    a plasmodium, that is to say, is not formed by fusion of independent amoeba
                    forms, but is due to continuous growth. When nutrition fails the individual
                    chlorophyll corpuscles separate, each carrying with it an investment of
                    protoplasm, and then each such amoeba form forms a cyst around itself which is
                    covered with short spines (Fig. II. 9). The cysts are not known to give rise to
                    spores, but appear to be merely hypnocysts.</p>
                <p>The domination of the protoplasm by the chlorophyll corpuscles is very remarkable
                    and unlike anything known in any other organism. Possibly the chlorophyll
                    corpuscles are to be regarded as nuclei, since it is known that there are
                    distinct points of affinity between the dense protoplasm of ordinary nuclei and
                    the similarly dense protoplasm of normal chlorophyll corpuscles.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Further Remarks on Mycetozoa. —</hi> About two hundred species
                    of Mycetozoa have been described. Botanists, and especially those who occupy
                    themselves with Fungi, have accumulated the very large mass of facts now known
                    in reference to these organisms; nevertheless the most eminent botanist who has
                    done more than any other to advance our knowledge of Mycetozoa, namely, De Bary,
                    has expressed the view that they are to be regarded rather as animals than as
                    plants. The fact is that, once the question is raised, it becomes as reasonable
                    to relegate all the Gymnomyxa without exception to the vegetable kingdom as to
                    do so with the Mycetozoa. Whatever course we take with the latter, we must take
                    also with the Heliozoa, the Radiolaria, and the Reticularia.</p>
                <p>The formation of plasmodia, for which the Mycetozoa are conspicuous, appears to
                    be a particular instance of the general phenomenon of cell-conjugation. Small
                    plasmodia are formed by some of the Proteomyxa; but among the other Gymnomyxa,
                    excepting Mycetozoa, and among Corticate Protozoa, the fusion of two individuals
                    (conjugation <hi rend="italic">sensu stricto)</hi> is more usual than the fusion
                    of several. Zopf (13) has attempted to distinguish arbitrarily between
                    conjugation and plasmodium formation by asserting that in the former the nuclei
                    of the cells which fuse are also fused, whereas in the latter process the nuclei
                    retain their independence. Both statements are questionable. What happens to the
                    nucleus in such conjugations as those of the Gregarinae has not yet been made
                    out, whilst it is only quite recently that Strasburger (30) has shown that the
                    plasmodia of Mycetozoa contain numerous scattered nuclei, and it is not known
                    that fusion does not occur between some of these. There is no doubt that the
                    nuclei of plasmodia multiply by fission, though we have no detailed account of
                    the process.</p>
                <p>The Sorophora are exceptional in that the amoebae which unite to form a
                    cell-colony in their case do not actually fuse but only remain in close contact;
                    with this goes the fact that there are no large spore-cysts, but an
                    identification of spore and spore-cyst. The amoebae arrange themselves in
                    stalked clusters (sori), and each becomes encysted: one may, in this case,
                    consider the cyst equally as a spore or as a spore-cyst which produces but a
                    single spore. The amoebae described by various writers as inhabiting the
                    alimentary canal and the dung of higher animals (including man) belong to this
                    group. The form described by Cunningham in the <hi rend="italic">Quart. Jour.
                    Mier.</hi><hi rend="italic">Sei.,</hi> 1881, as <hi rend="italic">Protomyxomyces
                    coprinarius</hi> is apparently related to the <hi rend="italic">Copromyxa
                    (Guttulina) protea</hi> of Fayod (31).</p>
                <p>The spore-fruits of the Endosporeae occur in various degrees of elaboration.
                    Usually they are (1) spherical or pear-shaped cysts with or without an obvious
                    stalk (Fig. III. 19, 20, 21), and often have a brilliant colour, and are of a
                    size readily observed by the naked eye, the plasmodia which give rise to them
                    being by no means microscopic. But they may present themselves (2) as irregular
                    ridges growing up from the plasmodium, when they are termed serpula forms.
                    Lastly, the cysts may be united side by side in larger or smaller groups instead
                    of forming at various separate points of the plasmodium. These composite bodies
                    are termed “fruit-cakes’’ or “aethalia,” in view of the fact that the
                    spore-cysts of Fuligo, also called Aethalium—the well-known “flowers of tan”
                    —form a cake of this description.</p>
                <p>The capillitium or network of threads which lies between the spores in the
                    spore-cysts of Endosporeae is a remarkable structure which exhibits special
                    elaborations in detail in different genera, here not to be noticed for want of
                    space. Although definite in form and structure, these threads are not built up
                    by cells but are formed by a residual protoplasm (c/’. Sporozoa) which is left
                    in the cyst after the spores have been segregated and enclosed each in its
                    special coat. They are often impregnated by calcium carbonate, and exhibit
                    crystalline masses of it, as does also the cyst-wall.</p>
                <p>The spores of the Mycetozoa are as a rule about the <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>
                    ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi> th inch in diameter. They are produced by
                    millions in the large fruitcakes of such forms as Fuligo. Often the spore-coat
                    is coloured; it always consists of a substance which gives the cellulose
                    reaction with iodine and sulphuric acid. This has been sometimes considered an
                    indication of the vegetable nature of the Mycetozoa, but cannot be so regarded
                    since many animals (especially the Tunicata and various Protozoa) produce
                    substances giving this same reaction.</p>
                <p>Dryness, low temperature, and want of nutriment lead to a dormant condition of
                    the protoplasm of the plasmodium of many Mycetozoa and to its enclosure in
                    cyst-like growths known as “sclerotia,” which do not give rise to spores, but
                    from which the protoplasm creeps forth unaltered when temperature, nutrition,
                    and moisture are again favourable. The sclerotia are similar in nature to the
                    hypnocysts of other Protozoa.</p>
                <p>The physiological properties—chemical composition, digestive action, reaction to
                    moisture, heat, light, and other physical influences—of the plasmodia of
                    Mycetozoa have been made the subject of important investigations; they furnish
                    the largest masses of undifferentiated protoplasm available for such study. The
                    reader is referred to Zopf’s admirable treatise (13) as to these matters, and
                    also for a detailed account of the genera and species.</p>

                    bulgings of the surface to blunt finger-like processes, but never having the
                    character of filaments either simple, arborescent, or reticulate. Fusions of two
                    individuals (conjugation) have been observed in a few cases, but not fusions of
                    many individuals so as to form plasmodia; nevertheless the size attained by the
                    naked protoplasm? pure growth is in some cases considerable, forming masses
                    readily Visible by the naked eye (Pelomyxa). The presence of more than one
                    nucleus is a frequent character. A contractile vacuole may or may not be
                    present. The formation of sporocysts and of chlamydospores (coated spores) has
                    not been observed in any species, but naked spores (fiagelhilae or amoebulae)
                    have been with more or less certainty observed as the product of the breaking up
                    of some species (Amoeba? Pelomyxa). The cyst phase is not unusual, but the cyst
                    appears usually to be a hypnocyst and not a sporocyst. In the best observed case
                    of spore-production (Pelomyxa) the spores were apparently produced without the
                    formation of a cyst. Reproduction is undoubtedly most freely effected by simple
                    fission (Amoeba) and by a modified kind of bud-fission (Arcella). Freshwater and

                <p><hi rend="italic">Further remarks on the Lobosa.—</hi> The Lobosa do not form a
                    very numerous nor a very natural assemblage. Undoubtedly some of the forms which
                    have been described as species of Amoeba are amoeba forms of Mycetozoa; this
                    appears to be most probably the case in parasitic and stercoricolous forms. But
                    when these are removed, as also those Proteomyxa which have pseudopodia of
                    varying character, at one time lobose and at another filamentous, we have left a
                    certain small number of independent lobose Gymnomyxa which it is most convenient
                    to associate in a separate group. We know very little of the production of
                    spores (whether it actually obtains or not) or of developmental phases among
                    these Lobosa. The common Amoebae are referable to the species <hi rend="italic"
                    >A. princeps,</hi><hi rend="italic">A. lobosa,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >Ouramoeba</hi><hi rend="italic">villosa.</hi> Of none of these do we know
                    certainly any reproductive phenomena excepting that of fission (see Fig. IV. 1,
                    2, 3). Various statements have been made pointing to a peculiar change in the
                    nucleus and a production of spores having the form of minute Amoebae, arising
                    from that body; but they cannot be considered as established. Whilst the
                    observed cases of supposed reproductive phenomena are very few, it must be
                    remembered that we have always to guard (as the history of the Ciliata has
                    shown, see below) against the liability to mistake parasitic amoebulae and
                    flagellulae for the young forms of organisms in which they are merely parasitic.
                    The remarkable <hi rend="italic">Pelomyxa</hi><hi rend="italic">palustris</hi>
                    of Greeff (32) was seen by him to set free (without forming a cyst) a number of
                    amoebulae which he considers as probably its young. Mr Weldon of St John’s
                    College, Cambridge, has observed the same phenomenon in specimens of Pelomyxa
                    which made their appearance in abundance in an aquarium in the Morphological
                    Laboratory, Cambridge. It seems probable that the amoebulae in this case are not
                    parasites but spore-like young, and this is the best observed case of such
                    reproduction as yet recorded in the group.</p>
                <p>Arcella is remarkable for the production of bud-spores, which may be considered
                    as a process intermediate between simple fission and the complete breaking up of
                    the parent body into spores. As many as nine globular processes are
                    simultaneously pinched off from the protoplasm extruded from the shell of the
                    Arcella; the nuclei (present in the parent Arcella to the number of two or
                    three) have not been traced in connexion with this process. The buds then become
                    nipped off, and acquire a shell and a contractile vacuole (83).</p>
                <p>The presence of more than one nucleus is not unusual in Lobosa, and is not due to
                    a fusion of two or more uninuclear individuals, but to a multiplication of the
                    original nucleus. This has been observed in some Amoebae <hi rend="italic">(A.
                    princeps</hi> ?) as well as Arcella. Pelomyxa (Fig. IV. 6) has a great number of
                    nuclei like the Heliozoon, Actinosphaerium (Fig. VIII.).</p>
                <p>Pelomyxa is the most highly differentiated of the Lobosa. The highly vacuolated
                    character of its protoplasm is exhibited in a less degree by Lithamoeba and
                    resembles that of Heliozoa and Radiolaria. Besides the numerous nuclei there are
                    scattered in the protoplasm strongly refringent bodies (Fig. IV. 6, <hi
                    rend="italic">f),</hi> the significance of which has not been ascertained. The
                    superficial protoplasm is free from vacuoles, hyaline, and extremely mobile.

                    nourishment, though Labyrinthula has not.The Labyrinthulidea present strong
                    resemblances to the Mycetozoa. The genus Dactylostelium (Sorophora) would come
                    very close to Labyrinthula were the amoebae of its aggregation plasmodium set
                    upon a network of threads. Such a network, whether in the condition of soft
                    protoplasm or hardened and horny, is represented in the higher Mycetozoa by the
                    capillitium of the sporocysts.The most important difference between Archer’s
                    Chlamydomyxa and Cienkowski’s Labyrinthula is that in the former the threads</p>
                <p/>
                <p>out into very short fine filaments. Scattered in the protoplasm are a number of
                    minute cylindrical crystals, of unascertained compositi &gt;n. Pelomyxa is of
                    very large size for a Protozoon, attaining a diameter of ⅛th of an inch. It
                    takes into its substance a quantity of foreign particles, both nutrient organic
                    matter such as Rotifera and Diatoms and san&lt;l particles. It occurs not
                    uncommonly in old muddy ponds (such as duck-ponds), creeping upon the bottom,
                    and has a white appearance to the naked eye. Lithamoeba (Fig. V.) is
                    distinguished by its large size, disk-like form, the disk-like shape of its
                    pseudopodia, the presence of specific concretions, the vacuolation of its
                    protoplasm, and the block-like form and peculiar tessellated appearance of its
                    large nucleus, which has a very definite capsule. In Lithamoeba it is easy to
                    recognize a distinct pellicle or temporary cuticle which is formed upon the
                    surface of the protoplasm, anil bursts when a pseudopodium is formed. In fact it
                    is the rupture of this pellicle which appears to be the proximate cause of the
                    outflow of protoplasm as a pseudopodium. Probably a still more delicate pellicle
                    always forms on the surface of naked protoplasm, and in the way just indicated
                    determines by its rupture the form and the direction of the “flow” of protoplasm
                    which is described as the “protrusion” of a pseudopodium.</p>
                <p>The shells of Lobosa Testacea are not very complex. That of Arcella is remarkable
                    for its hexagonal areolation, dark colour, and firm consistence; it consists of
                    a substance resembling chitin. That of Difflugia has a delicate membranous
                    basis, but includes foreign particles, so as to resemble the built-up case of a
                    Caddis worm.</p>
                <p>Arcella is remarkable among all Protozoa for its power of secreting gas-vacuoles
                    (observed also in an Amoeba by Biitschli), which serve a hydrostatic function,
                    causing the Arcella to float. The gas can be rapidly absorbed by the protoplasm,
                    when the vacuole necessarily disappears and the Arcella sinks.</p>

                    >Chlamydomyxa,</hi> Archer.</p>
                <p>Cienkowski (35) discovered Labyrinthula on green Algae growing on wooden piles in
                    the harbour of Odessa (marine). It has an orange colour and forms patches
                    visible to the naked eye. Chlamydomyxa was discovered by Archer of Dublin (36)
                    in the cells of Sphagnum and crawling on its surface; hence it is a freshwater
                    form. Unlike Labyrinthula, the latter forms a laminated shell of cellulose (Fig.
                    VI. 2, c), in which it is frequently completely enclosed, and indeed has rarely
                    been seen in the expanded labyrinthine condition. The laminated cellulose shells
                    are very freely secreted, the organism frequently deserting one and forming
                    another within or adherent to that previously occupied. The network of
                    Chlamydomyxa appears to consist of hyaline threads of streaming protoplasm,
                    whilst that of Labyrinthula has a more homy consistence, and is not regarded by
                    Cienkowski as protoplasm.</p>
                <p>The spindle-shaped cells are much alike in form and size in the two genera; but
                    no nucleus was detected by Archer in those of Chlamydomyxa. The encysting of the
                    spindle-cells and their fission into spores has been seen only in Labyrinthula.
                    Chlamydomyxa is often of a brilliant green colour owing to the presence of
                    chlorophyll corpuscles, and may exhibit a red or mottled red and green
                    appearance owing to the chemical change of the chlorophyll.</p>

                    they are described as firm horny threads exuded by the spindle-cells. Neither
                    form has been re-examined since its discovery; and it is possible that this
                    apparent difference will be removed bv further study. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    in the stiff isolated condition characteristic of this group. It is questionable
                    whether Nuclearia should not be relegated to the Proteomyxa on account of the
                    mobility of its body, which in all other Heliozoa has a constant spherical

                    multiple fission, producing flagellate spores which may or may not be preceded

                    amoeba-phase, often of great size (an inch in diameter), has an irregular form,
                    and a tendency to throw out great trunks of branching and often anastomosing
                    filamentous pseudopodia, and an equally strong tendency to form a shell of
                    secreted membrane or secreted lime or of agglutinated sand particles (only in
                    one genus of secreted silex) into which the protoplasm (not in all ?) can be
                    drawn and out of and over which it usually streams in widely spreading lobes and
                    branches. One nucleus is present, or there are many. A contractile vacuole is
                    sometimes, but not as a rule, present (or at any rate not described).
                    Reproduction is by fission and (as in some other Protozoa) by the formation of
                    peculiar bud-spores which remain for a time after their formation embedded in
                    the parental protoplasm. No multiple breaking up into spores after or
                    independent of the formation of a cyst is known. Marine and freshwater.</p>
                <p>The Reticularia are divisible into several orders. The marked peculiarity of the
                    shell structure in certain of these orders is only fitly emphasized by grouping
                    them together as a sub-class Perforata, in contrast to which the remaining
                    orders stand as a sub-class Imperforata. The distinction, however, is not an
                    absolute one, for a few of the Lituolidea are perforate, that is, are sandy
                    isomorphs of perforate genera such as Globigerina and Rotalia.</p>

                    the living protoplasm has been observed; in the latter it has the appearance of
                    a yellowish cream, and its microscopic structure is imperfectly unknown (61). In
                    Haliphysema the network of expanded pseudopodia has been observed by Saville
                    Kent as drawn in Fig. X. 11. Lankester (59) discovered numerous vesicular nuclei
                    scattered in the protoplasm (Fig. X. 10, ri), and also near the mouth of the
                    shell reproductive bodies (probably bud-spores) embedded in the protoplasm (Fig.
                    X. 8). Haliphysema was described by Bowerbank as a Sponge, and mistaken by
                    Haeckel (60) for a very simple two-cell-layered animal (Enterozoon), to which he

                    structure, being divided by septa (each with a hole in it) into a series of
                    loculi which may follow one another in a straight line (Fig. X. 4) or the series
                    may be variously coiled (Fig. X. 1 and 3). The chambering of the test does not
                    express a corresponding cellsegmentation of the protoplasm; the latter, although
                    growing in volume as the new shell-chambers are formed, remains one continuous
                    cell-unit with many irregularly scattered nuclei (Fig. X. 2). The chambered and
                    septate structure results in this group and in the other orders from the fact
                    that the protoplasm, expanded beyond the last-formed chamber, forms a new test
                    upon itself whilst it lies and rests upon the surface of the old test. The

                    Thalamophora, pointing to the peculiar tendency which the larger members of the
                    group have to form chamber after chamber and so to build up a complex shell, has
                    been proposed by Hertwig (56) and adopted by many writers. The old name
                    Foraminifera (which did not refer to the fine perforations of the Perforata but
                    to the large pseudopodial aperture leading from chamber to chamber) has also
                    been extended by some so as to include the simpler Gromia-like forms. On the
                    whole Carpenter’s term Reticularia (62) seems most suitable for the group, since
                    they all present the character indicated. It has been objected that the
                    Radiolaria are also reticular in their pseudopodia, but if we except the pelagic
                    forms of Reticularia (Globigerina, Orbulina, &amp;c.), we find that the
                    Radiolaria are really distinguishable by their stiffer, straighter, radiating
                    pseudopodia. No doubt the Labyrinthulid Chlamydomyxa and the plasmodia of some
                    Mycetozoa are as reticular in their pseudopodia as the Reticularia, but they
                    possess other distinctive features which serve, at any rate in an artificial
                    system, to separate them.</p>
                <p>The protoplasm of the majority of the Reticularia is unknown, or only very
                    superficially observed; hence we have made a point of introducing among our
                    figures as many as possible which show this essential part of the organism. It
                    is only recently (1876) that nuclei have been detected in the calcareous-shelled
                    members of the group, and they have only been seen in a few cases.</p>
                <p>The protoplasm of the larger shell-making forms is known to be often strongly
                    coloured, opaque, and creamy, but its minute structure remains for future
                    investigation. Referring the reader to the figures and their explanation, we
                    would draw especial attention to the structure of the protoplasmic body of
                    Hastigerina (one of the Globigerinidea) as detected by the “Challenger”
                    naturalists. It will be seen from Fig. XII. 5 that the protoplasm extends as a
                    relatively enormous “bubbly” mass around the shell which is sunk within it; from
                    the surface of this “bubbly” (vacuolated or alveol-ated) mass the pseudopodia
                    radiate.</p>
                <p>The reader is requested to compare this with Fig. XIΠ., representing the “bubbly”
                    protoplasmic body of Thalassicolla. It then becomes obvious that the perforated
                    central capsule CK of the latter holds the same relation to the mass of the
                    protoplasm as does the central perforated shell of Globigerina (Hastigerina).
                    The extreme vacuolation of the protoplasm in both cases (the vacuoles being <pb

                <p>filled with sea-water accumulated by endosmosis) and the stiff radiating
                    pseudopodia are directly correlated with the floating pelagic life of the two
                    organisms. All the Radiolaria are pelagic, and many exhibit this vacuolation;
                    only a few of the Reticularia are so, and their structural correlation to that
                    habit has only lately been ascertained.</p>
                <p>The Reticularia are almost exclusively known by their shells, which offer a most
                    interesting field for study on account of the very great complexity of form
                    attained by some of them, notwithstanding the fact that the animal which
                    produces them is a simple unicellular Protozoon. Space does not permit the
                    exposition here of the results obtained by Carpenter in the study of the complex
                    shells of Orbitolites, Operculina, Nummulites, &amp;c.; it is essential that his
                    work <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Study of the Foraminifera</hi> (Ray
                    Society, 1862) should be consulted, and in reference to the sandy-shelled forms
                    the monograph by Brady, in the <hi rend="italic">Challenger Reports,</hi> vol.
                    ix., 1883; and it must be sufficient here to point out the general principles of
                    the shell-architecture of the Reticularia. Let us suppose that we have an
                    ever-growing protoplasmic body which tends to produce a calcareous shell on its
                    surface, leaving an aperture for the exit of its pseudopodia. It will grow too
                    large for its shell and accumulate outside the shell. The accumulated external
                    mass may then secrete a second chamber, resting on the first as chamber 1 rests
                    on chamber 0 in Fig. XII. 4. By further growth a new chamber is necessitated,
                    and so is produced a series following one another in a straight line, each
                    chamber communicating with the newer· one in front of it by the narrow
                    pseudopodial aperture (a, a <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>, a <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, a <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>). Now itis possible
                    for these chambers to be very variously arranged instead of simply as in Fig.
                    XII. 4. For instance, each new chamber may completely enclose the last, as in
                    Fig. XII. 3, supposing the protoplasm to spread all over the outside of the old
                    chamber before making a new deposit. Again the chambers need not succeed one
                    another in a straight line, but may be disposed in a spiral (Fig. XII. 1). And
                    this spiral may be a flat coil, or it may be a helicine spiral with a rising
                    axis; further it may be close or open. All these forms in various degrees of
                    elaboration are exhibited by Miliolidea and various Perforata.</p>
                <p>But the Perforata in virtue of their perforate shell-walls introduce a new
                    complication. The protoplasm issues not only from the mouth of the last-formed
                    chamber, but from the numerous pores in the wall itself. This latter protoplasm
                    exerts its lime-secreting functions; it gathers itself into coarse branching
                    threads which remain uncalcified, whilst all around a dense deposit of secondary
                    or supplemental shell-substance is thrown down, thus producing a coarsely
                    canalicular structure. The thickness and amount of this secondary shell and the
                    position it may occupy between and around the chambers of primitive
                    shell-substance vary necessarily in different genera according to the mode in
                    which the primitive chambers are arranged and connected with one another.
                    Calcarina is a fairly typical instance of an abundant secondary shell-deposit
                    (Fig. XII. 10), and it is the existence of structure resembling the chambers of
                    Calcarina with their surrounding primary and secondary shellsubstances which has
                    rendered it necessary to regard Eozoon (41) as the metamorphosed encrusting
                    shell of a pre-Cambrian Reticularian.</p>
                <p>The division of the Reticularia into Imperforata and Perforata which is here
                    maintained has no longer the significance which was once attributed to it. It
                    appears, according to the researches of Brady, that it is not possible to draw a
                    sharp line between these sub-classes, since there are sandy forms which it is
                    difficult to separate from imperforate Lituolidea and are nevertheless
                    perforate, in fact are “sandy isomorphs of Lagena, Nodosaria, Globigerina, and
                    Rotalia.” It does not appear to the present writer that there can be any
                    insurmountable difficulty in separating the Lituolidea into two groups—those
                    which are sandy isomorphs of the porcellanous Miliolidea, and those which are
                    sandy isomorphs of the hyaline Perforata. The two groups of Lituolidea thus
                    formed might be placed in their natural association respectively with the
                    Imperforata and the Perforata.</p>
                <p>The attempt to do this has not been made here, but the classification of Brady
                    has been adopted. In Biitschli’s large work on the Protozoa (9) the breaking up
                    of the Lituolidea is carried out to a logical conclusion, and its members
                    dispersed among the Miliolidea on the one hand and the various orders of
                    Perforata on the other hand.</p>
                <p>The calcareous shell-substance of the Miliolidea being opaque and white has led
                    to their being called “Porcellana,” whilst the transparent calcareous shells of
                    the smaller Perforata has gained for that group the synonym of “Hyalina.”</p>
                <p>The shells of the calcareous Reticularia and of some of the larger arenaceous
                    forms are found in stratified rocks, from the Palaeozoic strata onwards. The
                    Chalk is in places largely composed of their shells, and the Eocene Nummulitic
                    limestone is mainly a cemented mass of the shells of Nummulites often as large
                    each as a shilling. The Atlantic ooze is a chalky deposit consisting largely of
                    the shells of Globigerina, &amp;c.</p>

                    possible in the systematic summary above given to enumerate the immense number
                    of genera which have been distinguished by Haeckel (42) as the result of the
                    study of the skeletons of this group. The important differences in the structure
                    of the central capsule of different Radiolaria were first shown by Hertwig, who
                    also discovered that the spines of the Acanthometridea consist not of silica but
                    of an organic compound. In view of this latter fact and of the peculiar
                    numerical and architectural features of the Acanthometrid skeleton, it seems
                    proper to separate them altogether from the other Radiolaria. The Peripylaea may
                    be regarded as the starting point of the Radiolarian pedigree, and have given
                    rise on the one hand to the Acanthometridea, which retain the archaic structure
                    of the central capsule whilst developing a peculiar skeleton, and on the other
                    hand to the Monopylaea and Phaeodaria which have modified the capsule but
                    retained the siliceous skeleton.</p>

                    it does not appear to be a matter of great significance that some forms
                    (Polycyttaria) form colonies, instead of the central capsules separating from
                    one another after fission has occurred.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that the skeleton of silex or acanthin does not
                    corres]κ&gt;nd to the shell of other Gymnomyxa, which appears rather to be
                    represented by the membranous central capsule. The skeleton does, however,
                    appear to correspond to the spicules of Heliozoa, and there is an undeniable
                    affinity between such a form as Clathrulina (Fig. VII. 2) and the Sphaerid
                    Peripylaea (such as Heliosphaera, Fig. XIV. 14). The Radiolaria are, however, a
                    very strongly marked group, definitely separated from all other Gymnomyxa by the
                    membranous central capsule sunkin their protoplasm. Their differences <hi
                    rend="italic">inter se</hi> do not affect their essential structure. The
                    variations in the chemical composition of the skeleton and in the perforation of
                    the capsule do not appear superficially. The most obvious features in which they
                    differ from one another relate to the form and complexity of the skeleton, a
                    part of the organism so little characteristic of the group that it may be
                    wanting altogether. It is not known how far the form-species and form-genera
                    which have been distinguished in such profusion by Haeckel as the result of a
                    study of the skeletons are permanent <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> relatively
                    permanent) physiological species. There is no doubt that very many are local and
                    conditional varieties of a single Protean species. The same remark applies to
                    the species discriminated among the shell-bearing Reticularia. It must not be
                    supposed, however, that less importance is to be attached to the distinguishing
                    and recording of such forms because we are not able to assert that they are
                    permanent species.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">yellow cells</hi> (of spherical form, Ό05 to 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 15 of a millimetre in diameter) which occur very
                    generally scattered in the extracapsular protoplasm of Radiolaria were at one
                    time regarded as essential components of the Radiolarian body. Their parasitic
                    nature is now rendered probable by the observations of Cienkowski (43), Brandt
                    (44), and Geddes (45), who have established that each cell has a cellulose wall
                    and a nucleus (Fig. XIV. 6 to 13), that the protoplasm is impregnated by
                    chlorophyll which, as in Diatoms, is obscured by tire yellow pigment, and that a
                    starch-like substance is present (giving the violet reaction with iodine).
                    Further, Cienkθλvski showed, not only that the yellow cells multiply by fission
                    during the life of the Radiolarian, but that when isolated they continue to
                    live; the cellulose envelope becomes softened; the protoplasm exhibits amoeboid
                    movements and escapes from the envelope altogether (Fig. XIV. 13) and multiplies
                    by fission. Brandt has given the name <hi rend="italic">Zooxanthella
                    nutricola</hi> to the parasitic unicellular Alga thus indicated. He and Geddes
                    have shown that a similar organism infests the endoderm cells of Anthozoa and of
                    some Siphonophora in enormous quantities, and the former has been led, it seems
                    erroneously, to regard the chlorophyll corpuscles of <hi rend="italic"

                    parasitic Algae, for which he has coined the name Zoochlorella. The same
                    arguments which Brandt has used to justify this view as to animal chlorophyll
                    would warrant the creation of a genus “Phytochlorella” for the hypothetical Alga
                    which has hitherto been described as the “chlorophyll corpuscles” of the cells
                    of ordinary green plants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Zooxanthella nutricola</hi> does not, for some unknown reason,
                    infest the Acanthometridea, and it is by no means so universally present in the

                    recognized.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">streaming of the granules of the protoplasm</hi> has been
                    observed in the pseudopodia of Radiolaria as in those of Heliozoa and
                    Reticularia; it has also been seen in the deeper protoplasm; and granules have
                    been definitely seen to pass through the pores of the central capsule from the
                    intracapsular to the extracaρsular protoplasm. A feeble vibrating movement of
                    the pseudopodia has been occasionally noticed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">production of swarm-spores</hi> has been observed only in
                    Acanthornetra and in the Polycyttaria and Thalassicollidae, and only in the two
                    latter groups have any detailed observations been made. Two distinct processes
                    of swarm-spore production have been observed by Cienkowski (43), confirmed by
                    Hertwig (46)—distinguished by the character of the resulting spores which are
                    called “crystalligerous” (Fig. XIV. 15) in the one case, and “dimorphous <hi
                    rend="superscript"> f,</hi> in the other (Fig. XIV. 16). In both processes the
                    nucleated protoplasm within the central capsule breaks up by a more or less
                    regular cell-division into small pieces, the details of the process differing a
                    little in the two cases. In those individuals which produce crystalligerous
                    swarm-spores, each spore encloses a small crystal (Fig. XIV. 15). On the other
                    hand, in those individuals which produce dimorphous swarm-spores, the contents
                    of the capsule (which in both instances arc set free by its natural rupture) are
                    seen to consist of individuals of two sizes “macrospores” and “microspores,”
                    neither of which contain crystals (Fig. XIV. 16). The further development of the
                    spores has not been observed in either case. Both processes have been observed
                    in the same species, and it is suggested that there is an alternation of sexual
                    and asexual generations, the crystalligerous spores developing directly into
                    adults, which in their turn produce in their central capsules dimorphous
                    swarm-spores (macrospores and microspores), which in a manner analagous to that
                    observed in the Volvocinean Flagellata copulate (permanently i'us&gt;e) with me
                    another (the larger with the smaller) before proceeding to develop. The adults
                    resulting from this process would, it is suggested, produce in their turn
                    crystalligerous swarm-spores. Unfortunately we have no observations to support
                    this hypothetical scheme of a life-history.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> capillitium of Mycetozoa). Each piece acquires a
                    special chitin-like colourless coat, and is then a chlamydospore. Rarely one
                    spore oιdy is formed from the whole contents of a cyst. The spore-coat is
                    usually thick, and remarkable for processes and other accessory developments.
                    The included protoplasm of the chlamydospore frequently divides into several
                    pieces before hatching. These usually, when set free from the spore-coat, have

                    activity. With few (if any) exceptions, the falciform young thus characterized
                    penetrates a cell of some tissue of its host and there undergoes the first

                    never escapes from its cell host. In other cases it remains connected with the

                    appendage (the epimerite) growing from the protomerite. The epimerite serves to
                    attach the parasite to its host, and may for that purpose carry booklets. It is
                    always shed sooner or later. The phase in which it is present is called a
                    “cephalont,” the phase after it has broken off a “sporont” (see Fig. XIX. 22,

                <p>[The numerous genera which have been proposed at different times by Hammerschmidt
                    and others, and more recently by Aimé Schneider, appear to the present writer to
                    be unserviceable, owing to the fact that our knowledge is as yet very
                    incomplete. A good basis for generic or family distinctions might probably be
                    found in the greater or less elaboration of the cyst and the formation or not of
                    sporoducts. But of the majority of Septata we do not know the cysts or the
                    history of sporulation; we merely know that some have simple cysts with complete
                    sporulation leaving no residue of protoplasm, and that others form cysts with
                    double walls and elaborate tubular ducts, whilst a part of the protoplasm is not
                    sporulated but forms a capillitium (Fig. XIX. 2).</p>
                <p>Another possible basis for generic division of the Septata may be found in the
                    characters of the epimerite. This may be present or absent altogether. It may
                    exist only in the young condition or persist until growth is completed. It may
                    be simple, short, elongate, or provided with booklets. The presence of booklets
                    on the epimerite is the only character which at present seems to serve
                    conveniently for generic distinction. With regard to the other points mentioned
                    we are not sufficiently informed, since we know the complete history of
                    development from the young form set free from the spore in only one or two
                    cases.]</p>

                    leading to a penetration of a tissue-cell by the young form as in Gregarinidea.

                    discovered a third species with very remarkable spores, which are here figured
                    for the first time (Fig. XVII. 12).</p>

                    45, 46, 47), discovered by Lankester (50) in the Frog’s blood, is probably the
                    falciform young of a Coccidium parasitic in the Frog’s kidney, and discovered
                    there by Lieberkühn (51). A spore of this Coccidium is shown in Fig. XVII. 48;
                    whilst in 46 two Drepanidia which have penetrated a red-blood corpuscle of the
                    Frog are represented.</p>
                <p>The Polysporous Coccidiidea come very close to the Gregarinide genus Monocystis,
                    from which they may be considered as being derived by an arrest of development.
                    The spores and falciform young of the Coccidiidea are closely similar to those
                    of Monocystis, and the young in both cases penetrate the tissue-cells of their
                    host; but in Monocystis this is only a temporary condition, and growth leads to
                    the cessation of such “cell-parasitism.” On the other hand, growth is arrested
                    in the Coccidiidea, and the organism is permanently a cell-para site.</p>
                <p>Since the parasitism is more developed in the case of a cell-parasite than in the
                    case of a parasite which wanders in the body cavity, it seems probable that the
                    Coccidiidea have been derived from the Gregarinidea rather than that the reverse
                    process has taken place.</p>

                    The spores are highly characteristic, having each a thick coat which is usually

                    phase is a plasmodium formed by fusion of amoebulae set free from spores, though
                    it is possible that the many nuclei are the result of a division of an original
                    single nucleus, preparatory to sporulation.</p>
                <p>Their spores are more elaborate in structure than those of any other Protozoa,
                    and are more nearly paralleled by those of some species of Monocystis than by
                    those of Mycetozoa. The threadcapsules of the spores are identical in structure
                    with those of Hydrozoa, and probably serve as organs of attachment, as do the
                    furcate processes of the spore-case. It is not certain that a definite cyst is
                    always or ever formed, but as occurs rarely in some Gregarinidea, the spores may
                    be formed in a non encysted amoeba form.</p>
                <p>Although pseudopodia, sometimes short and thread-like, have been observed in the
                    amoeba phase, yet it is also stated that a distinction of cortical and medullary
                    substance obtains.</p>

                    rend="italic">S. Miescheri,</hi> Lank.), was first observed by Miescher in the
                    striated muscle-fibres of the Mouse; then by Rainey in a similar position in the
                    Pig, and taken by him for the youngest stage in the development of the cysts of
                    <hi rend="italic">Taenia</hi><hi rend="italic">solium;</hi> subsequently studied
                    by Beale and others in connexion with the cattle-plague epidemic, and
                    erroneously supposed to have a causal connexion with that disease. It is common
                    in healthy butcher’s meat. See Leuckart (47).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Further remarks on the Sporozoa.—</hi> The Sporozoa contrast
                    strongly with the large classes of Gymnomyxa, the Heliozoa, Reticularia, and
                    Radiolaria, as also with the Ciliate and Tentaculiferous Corticata, by their
                    abundant and rapidly recurrent formation of spores, and agree in this respect
                    with some Proteomyxa, with Mycetozoa, and some Flagellata. Their spores are
                    remarkable for the firm, chitin-like spore-coat and its varied shapes,
                    contrasting with the cellulose spherical spore-coat of Mycetozoa and with the
                    naked spores of Radiolaria and Flagellata.</p>
                <p>The protoplasm of the more highly developed forms (Gregarinidea) in the euglenoid
                    phase exhibits considerable differentiation. Externally a distinct cuticle may
                    be present, marked by parallel rugae <hi rend="italic">{Monocystis
                    serpulse)</hi> or by fine tubercles <hi rend="italic">(Monocystis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sipunculi).</hi> A circlet of hooks may be formed by the cuticle
                    at one end of the body. Below the cuticleôs sometimes developed a layer of
                    fibrils running transversely to the long axis of the body (Fig. XIX. 9 and 19),
                    which have been regarded as contractile, but are probably cuticular. The
                    cortical layer of protoplasm below these cuticular structures is dense and
                    refringent and sometimes fibrillated <hi rend="italic">(Monocystis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">pellucida,</hi> Fig. XVII. 15). It is the contractile substance of
                    the organism, and encloses the finely granular more liquid medullary substance.
                    The granules of the latter have been shown by Bütschli (9) to give a starch-like
                    reaction with iodine, &amp;c. Probably the protoplasm in which they lie is
                    finely reticulate or vacuolar, and when the granules are few it is actually seen
                    to be so. No contractile vacuole is ever present. In Myxosporidia the, medullary
                    protoplasm is coloured yellow by haematoidin derived from the blood of its host
                    or by absorbed bile-pigment, and also contains small crystals.</p>
                <p>The nucleus of the Gregarinidea is a large clear capsule, with a few or no
                    nucleolar granules. It has never been seen in a state of division, and it is not
                    known what becomes of it during sporulation, though sporulating Gregarinidea
                    have been observed with many minute nuclei scattered in their protoplasm,
                    presumably formed by a breaking up of the single nucleus.</p>
                <p>The habit of attaching themselves in pairs which is common in Gregarinidea is
                    perhaps a reminiscence of a more extensive formation of aggregation plasmodia
                    (compare Mycetozoa). The term “syzygium” is applied to such a conjunction of two
                    Gregarinidea; it is not accompanied by fusion of substance. The formation of
                    cysts is not connected with this pairing, since the latter occurs in young
                    individuals long before encystment. Also cysts are formed by single
                    Gregarinidea, as is always the case in the non-motile Coccidiidea.</p>
                <p>The encystment always leads to the formation of spores, but in rare cases
                    sporulation has been observed in unencysted Gregarinidea, and it occurs perhaps
                    normally without true cyst-formation in the Myxosporidia.</p>
                <p>The cell-parasitism of the young Sporozoa, and their flagellula-like (falciform)
                    young and active vibratile movement, are points indicating affinity with the
                    lower Gymnomyxa, and especially with those Proteomyxa, such as Vampyrella and
                    Plasmodiophora, which are cell-parasit es. Indeed it is probable that we have in
                    this fact of cell-parasitism, and especially of parasitism in animal cells, a
                    basis for the theoretical association of several unicellular organisms. The
                    Haplococcus of Zopf (regarded by him as a Mycetozoon) is parasitic in the
                    muscular cells of the Pig, and is probably related to Sarcocystis. Recently Von
                    Lendenfeld (53) has described in Australia an amoeba-like organism as parasitic
                    in the skin of Sheep, which will probably be found to be either a Sporozoon or
                    referable to those parasitic spore-producing Proteomyxa which are separated from
                    Sporozoa only by their negative characters (see previous remarks on the negative
                    characters of Proteomyxa).</p>

                    which have nothing in common with the Sporozoa. This was the case in regard to a
                    fungoid growth in human hair—the so-called “chignon Gregarine.” The Silk-worm
                    disease known as “pebrine” has also been attributed to a Gregarine. It seems
                    probable that the parasitic organism which causes that disease is (as is also
                    the distinct parasite causing the disease known as “tlaccidezza” in the same
                    animals) one of the Schizomycetes (Bacteria). No disease is known at present as

                    food particles are ingested through a distinct cell-mouth or aperture in the
                    cortical protoplasm, though in some an imbibition of nutritive matter by the

                <p>Many have a well-developed cuticle, which may form collar-like outgrowths or

                    colonies; in these colonies the protoplasmic organisms themselves produce new
