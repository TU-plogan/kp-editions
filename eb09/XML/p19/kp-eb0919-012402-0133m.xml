                    rend="smallcaps">ardus</hi> (Leonardo of Pisa), an Italian mathematician of the
                    13th century who has left the stamp of his name on a whole period in the history
                    of the science. Of Leonardo’s personal history few particulars are known. His
                    father was called <hi rend="italic">Bonaccio,</hi> most probably a nickname with
                    the ironical meaning of “a good stupid fellow,” while to Leonardo himself
                    another nickname <hi rend="italic">Bigollone</hi> (dunce, blockhead) seems to
                    have been given. The father was secretary in one of the numerous factories
                    erected on the southern and eastern coasts of the Mediterranean by the warlike
                    and enterprising merchants of Pisa. Where European and Arab merchants met was at
                    that time the right <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0134-0125"/> place for learning arithmetic, and it was
                    certainly with a view to this that the father had Leonardo sent to Bugia to
                    continue his education. But Leonardo aimed at something higher than to make
                    himself an accomplished clerk, and during his travels round the Mediterranean he
                    obtained such erudition as would have gained him the name of a great scholar in
                    much later times. In 1202 Leonardo Fibonacci (i.e., son of Bonaccio) was again
                    in Italy and published his great work <hi rend="italic">Liber Abaci,</hi> which
                    probably procured him access to the learned and refined court of the emperor
                    Frederick II. Leonardo certainly was in relation with some persons belonging to
                    that circle, when he published in 1220 another more extensive work <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Practica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Geometriae,</hi> which he dedicated to the imperial astronomer Dominicus
                    Hispanus. Some years afterwards (perhaps in 1228, as is related by an author on
                    the authority of a manuscript only once seen by him) Leonardo dedicated to
                    another courtier, the well known astrologer Michael Scott, the second edition of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Liber Abad,</hi> which has come down to our times, and has
                    been printed as well as Leonardo’s other works by Prince Bald. Boncompagni
                    (Rome, 1857-62, 2 vols.). The other works consist of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Practica</hi><hi rend="italic">Geometriae</hi> and some most striking papers of
                    the greatest scientific importance, amongst which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Quadratorum</hi> may be specially signalized. It
                    bears the notice that the author wrote it in 1225, and in the introduction
                    Leonardo himself tells us the occasion of its being written. Dominicus had
                    presented Leonardo to Frederick II.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The words “cum Magister Dominicus pedibus celsitudinis
                    vestrae me Pisis duceret praesentandum” have always been taken to mean that
                    Leonardo was presented to the emperor at Pisa, but the date of 1225 excludes
                    this interpretation, as Frederick II. certainly never was in Pisa before July
                    1226. The translation, therefore, oughtjto be— “when Magister Dominicus brought
                    me <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Pisa, &amp;c.,” the place where Leonardo met the
                    emperor remaining unknown.</p></note> The presentation was accompanied by a kind
                    of mathematical performance, in which Leonardo solved several hard problems
                    proposed to him by John of Palermo, an imperial notary, whose name is met with
                    in several documents dated between 1221 and 1240. The methods which Leonardo
                    made use of in solving those problems fill the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Quadratorum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Flos,</hi> and a <hi
                    rend="italic">Letter to Magister Theodore.</hi> All these treatises seem to have
                    been written nearly at the same period, and certainly before the publication of
                    the second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Liber Abaci,</hi> in which the <hi
                    rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Quadratorum</hi> is expressly
                    mentioned. We know nothing of Leonardo’s fate after he issued that second
                    edition, and we might compare him to a meteor flashing up suddenly on the black
                    background of the midnight sky, and vanishing as suddenly, were it not that his
                    influence was too deep and lasting to allow of his being likened to a phenomenon
                    passing quickly by.</p>
                <p>To explain this influence and the whole importance of Leonardo’s scientific work,
                    we must rapidly sketch the state of mathematics about the year 1200. The Greeks,
                    the most geometrical nation on the earth, had attained a high degree of
                    scientific perfection, when they were obliged to yield to the political
                    supremacy of Rome. From this time mathematics in Europe sunk lower and. lower,
                    till only some sorry fragments of the science were still preserved in the cell
                    of the studious monk and behind the counting-board of the eager merchant.
                    Geometry was nearly forgotten; arithmetic made use of the abacus with counters,
                    or with the nine characters the origin of which is still a matter of controversy
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Numerals);</hi> the zero was still unknown. Among the
                    Arabs it was quite otherwise. Greek mathematics found amongst them a second
                    home, where the science was not only preserved but came to new strength, and was
                    recruited from India, whence in particular came the symbol “zero” and its use,
                    which alone jenders possible numerical calculation in the modern sense of the
                    word. Ancient astronomy as well as ancient mathematics reappeared in Europe,
                    from the beginning of the 12th century onwards, in an Arabian dress. Two men
                    especially recognized the worth of these sciences and made it the task of their
                    life to propagate them amongst their contemporaries,—the German monk Jordanus
                    Nemorarius and the Italian merchant Leonardos Pisanus. Leonardo, as we have
                    said, travelled all round the Mediterranean gathering knowledge of every kind.
                    He studied the geometry of Euclid, the algebra of Mohammed ibn Musa Alcharizmi;
                    he made himself acquainted with Indian methods; he found out by himself new
                    theories. So runs his own account; and an exact comparison of Leonardo’s works
                    with older sources not only confirms the truth of his narrative, but shows also
                    that he must have studied some other authors,—for instance, Alkarchi. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Practica</hi><hi rend="italic">Geometriae</hi> plain traces of the
                    use of the Roman “agrimensores” are met with; in his <hi rend="italic">Liber
                    Abaci</hi> old Egyptian problems occur revealing their origin by the
                    reappearance of the very numbers in which the problem is given, though one
                    cannot guess through what channel they came to Leonardo’s knowledge. Leonardo
                    cannot now be regarded (as Cossali regarded him about 1800) as the inventor of
                    that very great variety of truths for which he mentions no earlier source. But
                    even were the predecessors to whom he is indebted mote numerous than we are
                    inclined to believe, were he the Columbus only of a territory the existence of
                    which was unknown to his century, the historical importance of the man would be
                    nearly the same. We must remember the general ignorance of his age, and then
                    fancy the sudden appearance of a work like the <hi rend="italic">Liber
                    Abaci,</hi> which fills 459 printed pages. These pages set forth the most
                    perfect methods of calculating with whole numbers and with fractions, practice,
                    extraction of the square and cube roots, proportion, éhain rule, finding of
                    proportional parts, averages, progressions, even compound interest, just as in
                    the completest mercantile arithmetics of our days. They teach further the
                    solution of problems leading to equations of the first and second degree, to
                    determinate and indeterminate equations, not by single and double position only,
                    but by real algebra, proved by means of geometric constructions, and including
                    the use of letters as symbols for known numbers, the unknown quantity being
                    called <hi rend="italic">res</hi> and its square <hi rend="italic">census.</hi>
                    We may well wonder, not that the impression caused by a work of such
                    overwhelming character was so deep, but that it made any impression at all, and
                    that the unprepared soil could receive the seed. The second work of Leonardo,
                    his <hi rend="italic">Practica</hi><hi rend="italic">Geometriae</hi> (1220), is
                    still more remarkable, sinep it requires readers already acquainted with
                    Euclid’s planimetry, who are able to follow rigorous demonstrations and feel the
                    necessity for them. Among the contents of this book we simply mention a
                    trigonometrical chapter, in which the words <hi rend="italic">sinus versus
                    arcus</hi> occur, the approximate extraction of cube roots shown more at large
                    than in the <hi rend="italic">Liber Abaci,</hi> and a very curious problem,
                    which nobody would search for in a geometrical work, viz., to find a square
                    number which remains a square number when 5 is added to it. This problem
                    evidently suggested the first question put to our mathematician in presence of
                    the emperor by John of Palermo, who, perhaps, was quite enough Leonardo’s friend
                    to set him such problems only as he had himself asked for. The problem was :—To
                    find a square number remaining so after the addition as well as the subtraction
                    of 5. Leonardo gave as solution the numbers ll <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ¾
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi><hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>, 16 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ¾, and 6⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi>,—the squares of 3⅛, 4⅛, and 2⅛ and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Quadratorum</hi> gives the method of
                    finding them, which we cannot discuss here. We observe, however, that the kind
                    of problem was not new. Arabian authors already had found three square numbers
                    of equal difference, but the difference itself had not been assigned in
                    proposing the question. Leonardo’s method, therefore, when the difference was a
                    fixed condition of the problem, was necessarily very different from the Arabian,
                    and, in all probability, was his own discovery. The <hi rend="italic">Flos</hi>
                    of Leonardo turns on the second question set by John of Palermo, which required
                    the solution of the cubic equation ≈ <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> + 2x <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + 10ic = 20. Leonardo, making use of fractions of the
                    sexagesimal scale, gives z=l <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> 22 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> 7 <hi rend="superscript"> li</hi> 42 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> iii</hi> 33 <hi rend="superscript"> iv</hi> 4 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> v</hi> 40 <hi rend="superscript"> τl</hi>, after having
                    demonstrated, by a discussion founded on the 10th book of Euclid, that a
                    solution by square roots is impossible. It is much to be deplored that Leonardo
                    does not give the least intimation how he found his approximative value,
                    outrunning by this result more than three centuries. Genocchi believes Leonardo
                    to have been in possession of a certain method called <hi rend="italic">regula
                    aurea</hi> by Cardan in the 16th century, but this is a mere hypothesis without
                    solid foundation. In the <hi rend="italic">Flos</hi> equations with negative
                    values of the unknown quantity are also to be met with, and Leonardo perfectly
                    understands the meaning of these negative solutions. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letter to Magister Theodore</hi> indeterminate problems are chiefly worked, and
                    Leonardo hints at his being able to solve by a general method any problem of
                    this kind not exceeding the first degree. We have enumerated the main substance
                    of what appear to be Leonardo’s own discoveries, and the experienced reader will
                    not hesitate to conclude that they prove him to have been one of the greatest
                    algebraists of any time. As for the influence he exercised on posterity, it is
                    enough to say that Luca Pacioli, about 1500, in his celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Summa,</hi> leans so exclusively to Leonardo’s works (at that time known in
                    manuscript only) that he frankly acknowledges his dependence on them, and states
                    that wherever no other author is quoted all belongs to Leonardus Pisanus. (Μ.
