                    Pestilentia).</hi> This name has been given to any epidemic disease causing a
                    great mortality, and in this sense was used by Galen and the ancient medical
                    writers, but is now confined to a special disease, otherwise called Oriental,
                    Levantine, or Bubonic Plague, which may be shortly defined as a specific febrile
                    disease, transmissible from the sick to healthy persons, accompanied usually by
                    buboes and sometimes by carbuncles. This definition excludes many of the
                    celebrated pestilences recorded in history,—such as the plague of Athens,
                    described by Thucydides; that not less celebrated one which occurred in the
                    reign of Marcus Aurelius and spread over nearly the whole of the Roman world

                    is referred to, though not fully described, by the contemporary pen of Galen;
                    and that of the 3d century (about 253), the symptoms of which are known from the

                    >major,</hi> in which the general disturbance is very severe. Cases which are
                    rapidly fatal from the general disturbance without marked local symptoms have
                    been distinguished as fulminant plague <hi rend="italic">(pestis</hi><hi

                <p>1. In the minor form of the disease spontaneous swellings of the glands occur,
                    chiefly in groins and armpits, but also in neck or other parts, which either
                    undergo resolution or suppurate. There is a certain amount of fever; the
                    temperature is rarely high, but has been known to be 104° Fahr. The duration of
                    the disease is ten to twenty days usually, but may be eight weeks, for most of
                    which time the general health is little impaired and the patient able to go
                    about as usual. It rarely, if ever, causes death, the only fatal case at
                    Astrakhan in 1877 having been so through a complication. The disease is not
                    obviously contagious; whether it is propagated by infection or not is unknown.
                    It is possibly rather of a miasmatic character. This form of disease has
                    sometimes preceded or followed severe epidemics, as in Mesopotamia (Irak) on
                    several occasions, 1873-78, and in Astrakhan, 1877; its importance in relation
                    to the origin of plague has only lately been appreciated.<note anchored="true"

                <p>It might be expected that gradations would be found connecting this form with the
                    severe epidemic form; but this appears to be not usually the case, the latter
                    form appearing somewhat suddenly and abruptly. Hence the minor form has probably
                    often been regarded as a distinct disease, even when observed in plague
                    countries.</p>
                <p>2. As regards <hi rend="italic">pestis</hi><hi rend="italic">major,</hi> or
                    severe plague, the symptoms appear to have been nearly the same in all great
                    epidemics for several centuries, if not for two thousand years, but will be best
                    given from modern observations, such as those of Surgeon-Major Colvill, Dr
                    Cabiadis, and others in Irak, and recent observers in India. The early symptoms
                    are sometimes like those of ague (shivers, often long continued, and pains in
                    the limbs), but combined with nervous symptoms. The patient becomes distracted,
                    tosses about in constant fear of something he cannot describe, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n169/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0169-0160"/> has a difficulty in understanding the questions
                    put to him, and is slow in answering. He is often described as staggering like a
                    drunken man. There is severe headache, intense thirst, and severe pain in the
                    epigastrium. The eyes are red and turbid; the tongue swollen, dry, and fissured,
                    sometimes black, sometimes remarkably white (Colvill). This condition may pass
                    into coma even before fever sets in. In other cases bilious vomiting is the
                    earliest symptom. The fever which sets in may last twenty-four to thirty hours,
                    or more. The temperature maybe 100° to 107° Fahr., or even higher; but in the
                    most rapidly fatal cases there may be little or no fever. Generally there is
                    obstinate constipation, but sometimes diarrhoea. Besides these symptoms there
                    are certain special ones especially characteristic of plague.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> Buboes or glandular swellings are observed in all
                    except very rapidly fatal cases. They occur in 45 or 50 per cent, of the cases
                    in the groin, in 35 per cent, in the axilla, also less frequently in the neck or
                    other parts. These swellings may occur before the fever, simultaneously with it,
                    or some hours after it has set in. A sudden pain like that of a stab is felt in
                    some region of the body, which has given rise to the superstition that the
                    unfortunate victim was wounded by the arrow of an invisible demon,—a belief
                    recorded in Constantinople in the 6th century, and said still to survive in
                    Mohammedan countries. The buboes may suppurate, and free discharge of matter
                    from them has in all times been held to be a favourable sign and conducive to
                    recovery.</p>
                <p>(ό) Carbuncles were observed in about 2⅜ or 3 per cent, of the cases in recent
                    epidemics in Irak. They are always an unfavourable sign.</p>
                <p>(c) Petechiae or haemorrhagic spots on the skin have always been regarded as
                    signs of the worst omen. Under the name of “tokens” they were considered in the
                    English epidemics of the 16th century as the infallible signs of approaching
                    death. <hi rend="italic">“They</hi> appear generally only a few hours before
                    death” (Colvill). Hodges (1665) noticed hardness which showed the existence of
                    haemorrhage under the skin. The skin is sometimes so covered with petechiae as
                    to become of a dark livid hue after death, recalling the name Black Death
                    (Cabiadis).</p>
                <p>The occurrence of the above symptoms, especially the first, in an idiopathic
                    fever attacking many persons at one time is sufficient to make the diagnosis of
                    plague.</p>
                <p>A very notable and fatal form of the disease is that in which haemorrhages from
                    the lungs, stomach, bowels, nose, &amp;c., occur. These are of the worst omen,
                    and are seen in some cases where there are no buboes, and which are rapidly
                    fatal. This was observed in Irak in recent epidemics, in the outbreak on the
                    Volga in 1878-79, and in the plague of India. It was a noticeable symptom in the
                    black death, and was observed even in the plague of the 6th century. The
                    bleeding is mostly from the lungs, and is sometimes associated with other
                    symptoms of lung affection. This form of the disease appears, however, to have
                    no distinct historical or geographical limit. A similar haemorrhagic form has
                    been observed in small-pox and scarlet fever, and is always extremely fatal.</p>
                <p>In all plague epidemics cases occur in which death takes place very rapidly, even
                    within twenty-four hours, without the development of the special symptoms of the
                    disease. Such cases are reported by Diemerbroek, Hodges, and others in the 17th
                    century, and have been observed in recent epidemics in Irak, as well as in the
                    recent plague on the Volga. Some are more like cases of poisoning than of
                    infection, and much resemble the instances of death from the exhalations of dead
                    bodies (cadaveric poisoning) which are met with from time to time. It is these
                    which have given rise to the expression fulminant plague.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Duration.—</hi> The duration of an attack of plague may be from
                    some hours to a month. Three-fifths of the cases observed by Mr Colvill were
                    fatal on the third day, and the majority of cases in India had the same
                    termination (Francis). Five-sixths of fatal cases end by the fifth day. Most of
                    those who survive the fifth day get well; after the seventh day a patient in
                    Baghdad was considered by his friends safe; and in Mr Colvill’s cases only 4 per
                    cent, of fatal cases died after the tenth day. In non-fatal cases with
                    suppurating buboes the disease may be protracted to two or three weeks or a
                    month.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mortality.—</hi> Plague is the most fatal of all known diseases
                    which affect large numbers of people. The mortality, according to official
                    registers in Baghdad, was 55 ’ 7 per cent, of those attacked. Dr Cabiadis thinks
                    this too high, owing to many cases of recovery not being reported. But in some
                    epidemics the proportion of fatal cases is much higher. In Vetlanka it was about
                    90 per cent., and in some other villages on the Volga every person who took the
                    disease died. The older accounts do not give the proportion of deaths and
                    attacks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Morbid Anatomy.—</hi> Examinations after death have not done
                    much to elucidate the nature of plague, except negatively. The appearances are
                    those of death from an acute infective disease, and resemble those of typhus,
                    except for the special affection of the lymphatic glands. The brain and the
                    lungs are found to contain excess of blood; the right side of the heart
                    distended, the blood darkcoloured and undergoing rapid decomposition.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This post-mortem
                    decomposition of the blood is doubtless the cause of some appearances described
                    with great particularity in the older accounts.</p></note> The spleen is found
                    enlarged, and in a less degree the liver. The stomach and intestinal canal often
                    show signs of inflammation and haemorrhage, sometimes ulceration. The
                    characteristic swelling of the lymphatic glands, both external and internal, is
                    often accompanied by inflammation of the cellular tissue around. Petechial
                    patches are sometimes found on the internal organs.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Our knowledge of the morbid anatomy of plague
                    is derived almost entirely from the observation of the French physicians in
                    Egypt during the epidemic in 1835-36. Earlier observations are of no value, and
                    in later epidemics of Irak and Russia none have been made. In India Drs Pearson
                    and Francis made a few autopsies. Clot-Bey, <hi rend="italic">De la</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">Pathology of Plague.—</hi> All that is known of plague goes to
                    show that it is a specific febrile disease depending on the reception into the
                    body of a specific organic contagion, which becomes multiplied in the body of
                    the patient. Analogy makes it very probable that this contagion is a living
                    organism of the class <hi rend="italic">Bacteria,</hi> but the suspected
                    organism has not yet been discovered. The nearest ally of plague is typhus
                    fever, so that some authorities have spoken of it as the typhus of hot climates,
                    modified by temperature, &amp;c., but this opinion does not appear to have ever
                    been held by any competent physician who has examined the disease at first hand.
                    It appears to be as distinct from typhus as this is from enteric fever, or other
                    so-called typhoid diseases. It has also been thought that plague is related to
                    intermittent or remittent malarious fevers; but the most recent observations
                    show that there is no real connexion between these diseases. In India, says Dr
                    Francis, neither intermission nor remission has ever been observed in plague. It
                    is quite distinct from and in no way modified by the types of fever that are
                    caused by malaria. Dr Cabiadis speaks to the same effect of plague in Irak, and
                    insists that the physical conditions which favour the production of marsh poison
                    are not necessarily favourable to plague.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">External Conditions of Plague.—</hi> The nature of the soil <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n170/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0170-0161"/> has little influence on plague. It may flourish
                    in alluvial deltas, on calcareous ridges or granitic mountains. Moisture in the
                    soil has generally been thought to be an important factor in its production,
                    but, though often found in marsh situations, such as the banks of the Nile, the
                    Euphrates, or even the Volga, it also occurs in India at elevations approaching
                    7000 feet, and in Kurdistan at 5000 to 6000 feet above the sea.</p>
                <p>The temperature most favourable to plague is a moderately high one. The disease
                    is unknown in the tropics. When prevalent in Egypt it was said never to
                    penetrate farther south than Assouan. It has not crossed the plains of India
                    within historic times. Where the disease does occur, a temperature of 80° to 85°
                    or more, combined with absence of moisture, usually stops the epidemic. In Egypt
                    it was observed to cease as an epidemic almost suddenly about the 2 2d to 24th
                    of June, and not to begin again till September. In Irak it dies out suddenly
                    during the summer. When the temperature rises above 86° it begins to diminish;
                    and it ceases abruptly at a temperature of 113°. In India it has been observed
                    by Dr Francis when the temperature of his tent was 83° to 95°, or in a grass hut
                    to 105°, while the air was moist; but he thinks a lower temperature with dryness
                    renders the poison inert.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, in northern countries, the disease is usually checked by the
                    cold of winter, starts up in the spring, and is most active in August and
                    September. To this rule there have been some remarkable exceptions, such as the
                    epidemic on the Volga in 1878-79, which raged during severe winter weather, and
                    the great plague of Moscow in 1770.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sanitary Conditions.—</hi> Of all the co-operating causes of
                    the plague, <hi rend="italic">uncleanliness</hi> is the most powerful,—meaning
                    by this the accumulation of decaying animal matter around human bodies or
                    dwellings. The saturation of the soil with filth is perhaps the most important
                    point. A plague seat in Mesopotamia is thus described by Colvill :—“The ground
                    is so saturated with moisture that the refuse of the village is neither absorbed
                    nor evaporated, but . . . acquires the form of a bluish-black oily fluid, which
                    surrounds the huts and covers the paths, and stains the walls 2 feet from the
                    ground; and in fact the village is in such a state of filth that it requires to
                    be seen to be believed.” Of the people among whom the Pali plague of India raged
                    it is said “they were filthy beyond conception” (Francis). There can be little
                    doubt that European cities in the Middle Ages, and down to the 17th century,
                    presented very similar conditions. These conditions may be considered to act by
                    supplying a suitable environment for the life and growth of the organized poison
                    (or bacterium) outside the human body. Where these are wanting one of the main
                    factors in the spread and permanence of the disease will be absent, a fact which
                    makes it probable that increased cleanliness is the chief cause of the
                    disappearance of plague from Europe.</p>
                <p>Overcrowded dwellings, especially with deficient ventilation, greatly favour the
                    spread of the disease; but this is not necessarily correlative with density of
                    population, and plague may flourish in thinly peopled countries.</p>
                <p>Of social conditions <hi rend="italic">poverty</hi> has by far the most powerful
                    influence on the spread and development of plague. Many plague epidemics have
                    followed on years of famine, or been connected with destruction of crops and
                    cattle. The races among which the disease is endemic are almost without
                    exception under-nourished, if not destitute. In the villages on the Volga there
                    appeared to the writer, in 1879, to be little destitution, though the diet of
                    the people was very meagre. In all city epidemics the poor are the chief or
                    almost the only sufferers. This is as true of Baghdad in the 19th century as it
                    was of London in the 17 th. Those of the upper classes who have been attacked
                    have been chiefly doctors, clergy, officials, and others whose occupations take
                    them among the sick.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Origin and Spread of Plague.—</hi> Although the above-mentioned
                    conditions are those in which plague originates, and may be considered in a
                    general way essential to its continued existence, it is plain that they do not
                    account for its origin. Poverty, overcrowding, filth, and marsh soil, with a
                    temperature suited to plague, occur in many parts of the world where this
                    disease has never been heard of or has ceased to exist. The geographical
                    distribution of diseases cannot, any more than the distribution of plants or
                    animals, be explained by climatic causes alone. With regard to plague it is
                    quite clear that there are some parts of the world where it is at home, or, as
                    the phrase is, “endemic.” In other parts it is probable (or, as some think,
                    certain) that its existence, and even its periodical recurrence, depend on
                    importation from an endemic centre. Although it is not always easy to
                    distinguish between these cases, they must be considered separately.</p>
                <p>In the case of an endemic disease we suppose that the poison is either kept in
                    existence by continued transmission from one case to another, or that it can
                    subsist outside the human body in soil, water, or otherwise. The first mode of
                    existence is that of a pure contagious disease, such as small-pox; and it is
                    plain that this mode of continued existence obtains in the case of plague also.
                    It is not, however, clear that the second may not also be one of the modes of
                    existence of plague, which would then be a so-called “miasmatic” disease like
                    ague, as well as a contagious one. In India, for instance, the disease appears
                    as if it depended on a poison in the soil, since it returns years after to the
                    same spot, appearing in many villages simultaneously; and some morbid influence
                    causes the death of animals (rats) which live under ground. Similar facts have
                    been observed in China; and, if further inquiry should confirm the hypothesis,
                    it would show that plague is (like anthrax or the “steppe murrain” of cattle)
                    both miasmatic and contagious. If so, there is no difficulty in supposing the
                    disease to be carried by contagion to a distant part, and there to be
                    established in the soil, for a longer or shorter period, as the conditions are
                    more or less favourable. The adoption of this hypothesis would remove many of
                    the difficulties attending the explanation of plague epidemics, and to some
                    extent reconcile the controversies of the last three centuries between the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> il</hi> contagionist” and “non-contagionist” schools. It has
                    been maintained by the former that European epidemics have always been caused by
                    the importation of the disease from its home in the East, by the latter that it
                    arose on European soil in the same way as in Egypt or Syria.</p>
                <p>In the case of an imported n on-endemic disease, the only question which arises
                    is how the importation is effected,—whether the disease may be brought by the
                    air alone, whether by infected persons only, or whether also by objects which
                    have been in close relation to infected persons. Transmission of the disease by
                    the air cannot be pronounced impossible: and there are facts to show that it is
                    even probable with distances measured by yards, or possibly even hundreds of
                    yards; but there is no evidence whatever that the disease has ever been carried
                    by the air over distances measured by miles. Transmission of the disease by
                    infected persons over longer or shorter distances, and from one country to
                    another, is an established fact. Transmission by infected objects over great
                    distances and from one country to another seems less clearly established. The
                    last two cases must be separately considered.</p>
                <p>1. It is clear that the first necessary condition to such transmission is <hi
                    rend="italic">contagion,</hi> or transference of the disease from the sick to
                    the healthy. The existence of contagion <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0171-0162"/> is shown by such facts as these :—when a case of
                    plague breaks out in a house the other inmates are extremely likely to take the
                    disease; and even in severe forms the plague does not cease till it has affected
                    all or nearly all the household. This is indisputably an almost universal law.
                    In the plague of London in 1603 it was said the disease entered Jιardly any
                    house but it seized all that lived in it. And in 1879, on the Volga, in one
                    village, as was ascertained by Mr Colvill and the present writer, the plague
                    attacked five houses containing thirty-three persons, all of whom except two
                    took the disease and died. In this respect plague resembles typhus. In the next
                    place the disease will spread from an infected house to persons who have close
                    relations with it. Thus in the villages on the Volga it was noticed that after
                    one family was affected cousins and relations by marriage were the next to be
                    attacked. Doctors and those visiting the house are also exposed to the risk,
                    though in a less degree. In Vetlanka on the Volga three physicians and six
                    surgical assistants died. On the other hand, doctors in some instances have
                    singularly escaped from being attacked by the disease. In Egypt, in 1835, out of
                    ten French physicians engaged one only died, nor was this immunity secured by
                    any precautions. These experiences do not prove that the disease is not
                    contagious, but they modify the exaggerated notions which have been held on the
                    subject. The facts appear to be expressed by saying that it may undoubtedly be
                    communicated from one person to another, but chiefly by breathing the air of the
                    sick room, and this generally from prolonged not from momentary exposure,— so
                    that the possibility of communication by chance meetings and similar
                    contingencies may be disregarded. This view is that of Dr Cabiadis and others
                    who have studied plague in Irak where no doctor or assistant, with one
                    exception, suffered from the disease. It is not inconsistent with the experience
                    recorded in Egypt. But it is clear that the intensity of contagion varies
                    greatly in different epidemics. Modern experience contradicts the belief
                    formerly entertained that contact with plague patients was the only or even the
                    chief means of acquiring the disease. Everything tends to show that the
                    atmosphere immediately surrounding the patient is the most effectual conveyer of
                    contagion, and more effectual in proportion as the poison is concentrated.
                    Precisely the same relations are observed with regard to typhus.</p>
                <p>It has been disputed whether dead bodies convey infection of plague. Formerly the
                    contagion from this source was greatly dreaded, and the task of burying thought
                    to be specially dangerous. But the French in Egypt made more than a hundred
                    post-mortem examinations without precautions and without harm. In Mesopotamia
                    and in Russia no autopsies were made, but in the latter country some striking
                    instances were noted of those engaged in burying the dead themselves dying of
                    the plague. On the whole both facts and analogy lead to the belief that the
                    disease may be derived from touching or being near a dead body, but not that
                    there is any special danger of infection from this source.</p>
                <p>2. It is a very momentous question whether the contagion is capable of being
                    conveyed by clothes and other objects which have been in contact with the sick.
                    The very general belief that this is so has been controverted only by the French
                    physicians in Egypt, one of whom, Bulard, himself wore a shirt, taken direct
                    from the body of a plague patient, for two days. They also state that in Egypt
                    it was customary, when a plague epidemic was over, to sell the clothes and
                    effects of those who had died of plague, without, as is affirmed, communicating
                    the disease. In Constantinople they were customarily sold at once; and it is
                    alleged that the dealers in old clothes did not specially suffer. In 1835 the
                    hospital at Cairo, where 3000 plague patients had been treated, was used,
                    without even changing the bed coverings, immediately after the epidemic for
                    other patients, without harm. Negative instances of this kind might be
                    multiplied, but their importance is diminished by the consideration that the
                    communicability of plague, by whatever means, is always found to become
                    spontaneously weak at the decline of the epidemic, till it is extinct
                    altogether. While the epidemic influence lasts there is abundant evidence that
                    infected clothes, &lt;kc., are among the means by which the disease spreads. In
                    Egypt, in 1835, two criminals condemned to death were for the sake of experiment
                    placed in the clothes and beds of those who had died of plague, and both took
                    the disease, one dying. Instances are given by White <hi rend="italic">(Treatise
                    on the Plague,</hi> p. 161, London, 1847) of the disease spreading “like
                    wildfire” through the distribution of infected garments, and of those engaged in
                    disinfecting clothes and other objects being suddenly seized with the complaint,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> on opening a box containing infected garments.
                    While the reality of this mode of communication cannot reasonably be doubted, it
                    admits of some question whether the plague has ever been thus conveyed over
                    great distances, or from one country to another. The best known instance in
                    England is the alleged transmission of plague from London to the village of Eyam
                    in Derbyshire in 1665 by an infected parcel of clothes,—a story which cannot be
                    criticized at this distance of time, but which presents some weak points.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See W. Wood, <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Eyam,</hi> London, 1848.</p></note> Dr Cabiadis states
                    that he has seen plague thus conveyed in Irak to places outside the existing
                    focus of infection, but gives no details. On the whole we must consider the
                    exportation of plague by clothes over great distances, and into countries not
                    subject to the same epidemic conditions as the infected country, “not
                    proven.”</p>
                <p>The communication of plague by merchandise or objects not personal, coming from
                    an infected country, rests upon still more defective evidence, though at one
                    time generally believed. In virtue of this belief all goods, especially those
                    regarded as susceptible (as wool, furs, raw cotton, &lt;fcc.), were, when coming
                    from an infected or suspected country, subjected to disinfection under special
                    regulations. But there is really no evidence that plague was ever thus
                    transmitted or that these regulations kept it out. On the contrary there are
                    numberless instances of this supposed cause having failed to operate when it
                    might have been most expected to do so.</p>
                <p>During the plague at Alexandria in 1835, which destroyed 9000 persons in that
                    city, the exportation of cotton from the Government warehouses was never
                    interrupted, though the plague was most destructive in those very buildings. It
                    was loaded on English and other ships without any precautions whatever.
                    Twenty-five ships, eight of which were infected with plague, conveyed cotton
                    amounting to 31,000 bales to England. Nevertheless no case of plague is known to
                    have occurred among the quarantine officers or others engaged in unloading these
                    ships or disinfecting their cargoes in quarantine. Equally large quantities were
                    exported to Marseilles and Trieste, and smaller quantities to other ports, with
                    the same result. Further, no case of infection has occurred among quarantine
                    officers or persons employed to disinfect goods, from this cause alone, either
                    at Marseilles since 1720, or at any European lazaretto.<note anchored="true"

                    importation of plague by merchandise coming from an infected country rests on no
                    solid foundation.</p>

                    and that its spread is connected mediately or immediately, in most cases at
                    least, with human intercourse. But this diffusion appears to take place as a
                    rule slowly, and to be effected by the formation of new foci of contaminated
                    atmosphere. Such foci on land will be inhabited houses, and the disease will
                    creep in a gradual though irregular manner from house to house and street to
                    street. It was so in London in 1665; and in Russia in 1878, as has been said,
                    the disease was confined to one village for two months, though for great part of
                    the time communication was perfectly open. In 1834 plague existed eight months
                    at Alexandria before passing to Damietta and Mansoorah, though traffic was quite
                    uninterrupted. These new foci of disease are doubtless mostly produced by
                    persons infected with the disease, actually or in incubation, who form a
                    contaminated atmosphere around them in a place previously healthy.</p>
                <p>Transmission of the disease by sea may take place in the same manner,—a ship
                    forming a focus of disease as easily as a house, and being obviously specially
                    liable to concentrate the poison. It is by a floating atmosphere of plague, and
                    not by casual contaminated objects, that the disease has been conveyed, when it
                    has been, from one port to another of the Mediterranean. The reality of the mode
                    of transmission is shown by the fact that between 1720 and 1846 twenty-five
                    ships arrived at French and Italian ports with the plague among their crews; and
                    in the case of those arriving at Marseilles (ten in number), which were
                    carefully observed, there were several instances of plague being communicated in
                    the lazaretto to surgeons and others, or to those placed in charge of the ships.
                    Of these persons several died,—without, however, any exten sion of the disease
                    to the town. From this it is clear that plague may be transmitted by ships, and
                    may spread at the point to which it is conveyed, if the surrounding
                    circumstances are favourable. In all these cases the ships had left the infected
                    ports at a time when an epidemic of plague, and not merely sporadic cases,
                    prevailed there. No similar facts are on record as to the importation of plague
                    by ships to England,—the probable cause of this difference being the greater
                    length of the voyage from the Levantine ports, and the precautions taken at
                    those ports to prevent the shipment of infected persons or goods. Plague has
                    never been brought to an English quarantine station.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prus, <hi rend="italic">Rapport sur la

                <p>In such cases it must remain undetermined whether the disease would have spread,
                    had it not been interrupted by the quarantine. As we have seen, plague will
                    often die out in the cases which convey it without spreading; and hence some
                    have supposed (with Sydenham) that an “epidemic constitution” is necessary at
                    any particular time and place in order that the disease should become general,
                    but the practical value of this law is diminished by the fact that there is no
                    means of recognizing the epidemic constitution except by the actual production
                    of an epidemic.</p>
                <p>Plague, like all similar diseases, and in a specially high degree, is subject to
                    the law of periodicity. Even when it is most strictly endemic it seldoms
                    prevails continuously, but appears in definite outbreaks, or epidemics, with
                    intervals in which there are either no cases of plague or only so-called
                    sporadic cases. This may be partly due to the general law that the
                    susceptibility of the population to a special disease is exhausted by an
                    epidemic, partly to the immensely increased transmissibility of the disease
                    caused by the increased number of cases, so that when once a certain stage of
                    severity has been reached the disease progresses in a far more rapid ratio. In
                    most epidemics of plague there is at one time a sudden and alarming increase in
                    mortality; but, by a law not yet understood, each epidemic is liable to a
                    spontaneous decline, which is sometimes sudden. This may be connected with rise
                    or fall in the temperature of the air, but is not always so. The disease may be
                    dormant during the cold or hot weather (as the case may be) and reappear when
                    the temperature is favourable again, but not necessarily. It is generally agreed
                    that plague is transmissible to another country only when it is epidemic, and
                    not from sporadic cases.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Incubation.—</hi> It is a very important question what time may
                    elapse between a person receiving the poison and showing symptoms of the
                    disease. The usual time of incubation appears to be from three to five days. In
                    certain very malignant epidemics this period may be shortened, and, it is
                    thought, reduced to even less than a day. In rare cases incubation may be
                    prolonged to eight days. There are doubtful accounts of ten days’ incubation.
                    Generally a week’s observation<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    would show whether a suspected person was really affected or no. It has been
                    thought that articles contaminated by contact with plague patients may retain
                    the power of communicating the disease for weeks, months, or even years; but of
                    this there is no adequate proof.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Treatment.—</hi> No special line of treatment has proved
                    efficacious in checking the disease once established. Special symptoms are
                    treated in accordance with the ordinary rules of practice, and need not here be
                    considered. Free ventilation appears to be of the greatest service in preventing
                    the spread of the disease, and probably in promoting recovery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prevention.—</hi> There can be no doubt whatever of the
                    efficacy of hygienic measures in rendering a locality unsuitable for the spread
                    of plague. Such measures include, not only personal cleanliness, but especially
                    the removal of all foul organic matters, good drainage, and prevention of
                    overcrowding; all such measures might be looked upon by our readers generally as
                    matters of course, but are quite unknown in most of the homes of plague. Since
                    there is no doubt that plague may be carried from places where it prevails
                    epidemically, measures to prevent such importation cannot be neglected. The best
                    known of such measures is the system of quarantine first produced about 1480.
                    See <hi rend="smallcaps">Quarantine.</hi> The efficiency of quarantine has been
                    much discussed, and very strong opinions have been expressed for and against it.
                    The subject is too large for discussion here; but it would appear that, while
                    the system as originally applied in the Mediterranean, when traffic was
                    comparatively slow and infrequent, and when European cities presented an
                    extremely favourable soil for plague if introduced, was a real protection, the
                    regulations have long ceased to correspond to the actual state of medical
                    knowledge; and, in addition, it would be impossible to apply them to our crowded
                    traffic. The alternative is a system of medical inspection of all arrivals in
                    our ports, and strict isolation of ships in which plague has occurred or is
                    suspected. Such a ship should then be treated as an infected house.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prevention of the Spread of Plague.—</hi> When cases of plague
                    have once occurred in a town or on board a ship in port, the house or ship
                    should be emptied of its inhabitants, the sick removed to a hospital, the sound
                    placed in an isolated building and subjected to observation for at least a week,
                    or, better, ten days. The clothes of sick persons had better be burnt, their
                    bedding and furniture completely disinfected. The house should in the meantime
                    be rigidly closed until it has been disinfected. If these measures are taken in
                    time, there can be no objection to Allowing free emigration of the population.

                    speaks of the buboes called pestilential as being specially fatal, and as being
                    found chiefly in Libya, Egypt, and Syria. He refers to the testimony of a
                    physician Dionysius, who lived probably in the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> or earlier, and to Dioscorides and Posidonius, who fully described
                    these buboes in a work on the plague which prevailed in Libya in their time.
                    Whatever the precise date of these physicians may have been, this passage shows
                    the antiquity of the plague in northern Africa, which for centuries was
                    considered as its home. The great plague referred to by Livy (lx., Epitome) an
                    dιnore fully by Orosius <hi rend="italic">(Histor.,</hi> iv. 11) was probably
                    the same, though the symptoms are not recorded. It is reported to have destroyed
                    a million of persons in Africa, but is not stated to have passée! into
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>It is not till the 6th century of our era, in the reign of Justinian, that we
                    find bubonic plague in Europe, as a part of the great cycle of pestilence,
                    accompanied by extraordinary natural phenomena, which lasted fifty years, and is
                    described with a singular misunderstanding of medical terms by Gibbon in his
                    forty-third chapter. The descriptions of the contemporary writers Procopius,
                    Evagrius, and Gregory of Tours are quite unmistakable.<note anchored="true"

                    at Pelusium in Egypt in 542 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>; it spread over
                    Egypt, and in the same or the next year passed to Constantinople, where it
                    carried off 10,000 persons in one day, with all the symptoms of bubonic plague.
                    It appeared in Gaul in 546, where it is described by Gregory of Tours with the
                    same symptoms as <hi rend="italic">lues inguinaria</hi> (from the frequent seat
                    of buboes in the groin). In Italy there was a great mortality in 543, but the
                    most notable epidemic was in 565, which so depopulated the country as to leave
                    it an easy prey to the Lombards. In 571 it is again recorded in Liguria, and in
                    590 a great epidemic at Rome is connected with the pontificate of Gregory the
                    Great. But it spread in fact over the whole Roman world, beginning in maritime
                    towns and radiating inland. In another direction it extended from Egypt along
                    the north coast of Africa. Whether the numerous pestilences recorded in the 7th
                    century were the plague cannot now be said; but it is possible the pestilences
                    in England chronicled by Bede in the years 664, 672, 679, and 683 may have been
                    of this disease, especially as in 690 <hi rend="italic">pestis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">inguinaria</hi> is again recorded in Rome. For the epidemics of

                <p>It is impossible, however, to pass over the great cycle of epidemics in the 14th
                    century known as the Black Death. Whether in all the pestilences known by this
                    name the disease was really the same may admit of doubt, but it is clear that in
                    some at least it was the bubonic plague. Contemporary observers agree that the
                    disease was introduced from the East; and one eye-witness, Gabriel de Mussis, an
                    Italian lawyer, traced, or indeed accompanied, the march of the plague from the
                    Crimea (whither it was said to have been introduced from Tartary) to Genoa,
                    where with a handful of survivors of a Genoese expedition he landed probably at
                    the end of the year 1347. He narrates how the few that had themselves escaped
                    the pest transmitted the contagion to all they met.<note anchored="true"

                    especially old Russian chronicles, place the origin of the disease still further
                    to the east in Cathay (or China), where, as is confirmed to some extent by
                    Chinese records, pestilence and destructive inundations are said to have
                    destroyed the enormous number of thirteen millions. It appears to have passed by
                    way of Armenia into Asia Minor and thence to Egypt and northern Africa. Nearly
                    the whole of Europe was gradually overrun by the pestilence. It reached Sicily
                    in 1346, Constantinople, Greece, and parts of Italy early in 1347, and towards
                    the end of that year Marseilles. In 1348 it attacked Spain, northern Italy and
                    Rome, eastern Germany, many parts of France including Paris, and England; from
                    England it is said to have been conveyed to the Scandinavian countries. In
                    England the western counties were first invaded early in the year, and London in
                    November. In 1349 we hear of it in the midlands; and in subsequent years, at
                    least till 1357, it prevailed in parts of the country, or generally, especially
                    in the towns. In 1352 Oxford lost two-thirds of her academical population. The
                    outbreaks of 1361 and 1368, known as the second and third plagues of the reign
                    of Edward III., were doubtless of the same disease, though by some historians
                    not called the black death. Scotland and Ireland, though later affected, did not
                    escape.</p>
                <p>The nature of this pestilence has been a matter of much controversy, and some
                    have doubted its being truly the plague. But when the symptoms are fully
                    described they seem to justify this conclusion, one character only being thought
                    to make a distinction between this and Oriental plague, viz., the special
                    implication of the lungs as shown by spitting of blood and other symptoms. Guy
                    de Chauliac notes this feature in the earlier epidemic at Avignon, not in the
                    later. Moreover, as this complication was a marked feature in certain epidemics
                    of plague in India, the hypothesis has been framed by Hirsch that a special
                    variety of plague, <hi rend="italic">pestis Indica,</hi> still found in India,
                    is that which overran the world in the 14th century. But the same symptoms
                    (haemoptysis) have been seen, though less notably, in many plague epidemics,
                    even in the latest, that in Russia in 1878-79, and, moreover, according to the
                    latest accounts, are not a special feature of Indian plague. According to
                    Surgeon-General Francis <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Epidem. Soc,,</hi> vol. v. p.
                    398) “haemorrhage is not an ordinary accompaniment” of Indian plague, though
                    when seen it is in the form of haemoptysis. It seems, therefore, impossible to
                    make a special variety of Indian plague, or to refer the black death to any such
                    special form. Gabriel de Mussis describes it even in the East, before its
                    arrival in Europe, as a bubonic disease.</p>
                <p>The mortality of the black death was, as is well known, enormous. It is estimated
                    in various parts of Europe at two-thirds or three-fourths of the population in
                    the first pestilence, in England even higher, but some countries were much less
                    severely affected. Hecker calculates that one-fourth of the population of
                    Europe, or 25 millions of persons, died in the whole of the epidemics. It is
                    hardly necessary to dwell upon the social results of this terrible mortality. In
                    England great part of the country remained untilled, and the deficiency of
                    labourers was such as to cause a sudden rise of wages, which, in spite of
                    attempts to check it by legislation, is thought to have effected the final
                    emancipation of the labouring class. On the other hand a great transfer of
                    property to the church took place, with what results is well known.</p>
                <p>In the 15th century the plague recurred frequently in nearly all parts of Europe.
                    In the first quarter it was very destructive in Italy, in Spain (especially
                    Barcelona and Seville), in Germany, and in England, where London was severely
                    visited in 1400 and 1406, and again in 1428. In 1427 80,000 persons died in
                    Dantzic and the neighbourhood. In 1438-39 the plague was in Germany, and its
                    occurrence at Basel was described by Aeneas Sylvius, afterwards Pope Pius II. In
                    1448-50 Italy (Kircher), Germany (Lersch, from old chronicles), France, and
                    Spain were ravaged by a plague supposed to have arisen in Asia, scarcely less
                    destructive than the black death. England was probably seldom quite free from
                    plague, but the next great outbreak is recorded in 1472 and following years. In
                    1466 40,000 persons died of plague in Paris; in 1477-85 the cities of northern
                    Italy were devastated, and in 1485 Brussels. In the fifteenth year of Henry VII.
                    (1499-1500) a severe plague in London caused the king to retire to Calais.</p>
                <p>The 16th century was not more free from plague than the 15th. Simultaneously with
                    a terrible pestilence which is reported to have nearly depopulated China, plague
                    prevailed over Germany, Holland, Italy, and Spain in the first decade of the
                    century, and revivedat various times in the first half. In 1529 there was plague
                    in Edinburgh; in London in 1537-39, and again 1547-48; and also in the north of
                    England, though probably not absent before. Some of the epidemics of this period
                    in Italy and Germany are known by the accounts of eminent physicians, as Vochs,

                    of contagion first began to be raised, and also plague had to be distinguished
                    from typhus fever, which began in this"century to appear in Europe.</p>
                <p>The epidemic of 1563-64 in London and England was very severe, a thousand dying
                    weekly in London. In Paris about this time plague was an everyday occurrence, of
                    which some were less afraid than of a headache (Borgarucci). In 1570 200,000
                    persons died in Moscow and the neighbourhood, in 1572 50,000 at Lyons; in 1568
                    and 1574 plague was at Edinburgh, and in 1570 at Newcastle. When, however, in
                    1575 a new wave of plague passed over Europe, its origin was referred to
                    Constantinople, whence it was said to have spread by sea to Malta, Sicily, and
                    Italy, and by land through the Austrian territories to Germany. Others contended
                    that the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n174/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0174-0165"/> disease originated locally; and, indeed,
                    considering previous history, no importation of plague would seem necessary to
                    explain its presence in Europe. Italysufferedseverely(Venice,inl576,lost
                    70,000); the north of Europe not less, though later; London in 1580-82. In 1585
                    Breslau witnessed the most destructive plague known in its history. The great
                    plague of 1592 in London seems to have been a part of the same epidemic, which
                    was hardly extinguished by the end of the century, and is noted in London again
                    in 1599. On the whole, this century shows a decrease of plague in Europe.</p>
                <p>In the first half of the 17th century plague was still prevalent in Europe,
                    though considerably less so than in the Middle Ages. In the second half a still
                    greater decline is observable, and by the third quarter the disease had
                    disappeared or was disappearing from a great part of western Europe. The
                    epidemics in England will be most conveniently considered in one series. From
                    this time onwards we have the guidance of the “Bills of Mortality” issued in
                    London, which, though drawn up on the evidence of ignorant persons, are
                    doubtless roughly true. The accession of James I. in 1603 was marked by a very
                    destructive plague which killed 38,000 in London. In this and subsequent years
                    the disease was widely diffused in England—for instance, Oxford, Derbyshire,
                    Newcastle. It prevailed at the same time in Holland, and had done so some years
                    previously in northern Germany. In the same year (1603) one million persons are
                    said to have died of plague in Egypt. This plague is said to have lasted eight
                    years in London. At all events in 1609 we have the second great plague year,
                    with a mortality of 11,785. After this there is a remission till about 1620,
                    when plague again began to spread in northern Europe, especially Germany and
                    Holland, which was at that time ravaged by war. In 1625 (the year of the siege
                    of Breda in Holland) is the third great London plague with 35,417 deaths,—though
                    the year 1624 was remarkably exempt, and 1626 nearly so. In 1630 was the great
                    plague of Milan, described by Ripamouti.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Josephus Ripamoιιti s, <hi rend="italic">De Peele anni</hi>
                    1630, Milan, 1641, 4to.</p></note> In 1632 a severe epidemic, apparently plague,
                    was in Derbyshire. 1636 is the fourth great plague year in London with a
                    mortality of 10,400, and even in the next year 3082 persons died of the same
                    disease. The same year 7000 out of 20,000 inhabitants of Newcastle died of
                    plague; in 1635 it was at Hull. About the same time, 1635-37, plague was
                    prevalent in Holland, and the epidemic of Nimeguen is celebrated as having been
                    described by Diemerbroeck, whose work <hi rend="italic">(Tractatus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Peste,</hi> 4to, 1641-65) is one of the most important on the
                    subject. The English epidemic was widely spread and lasted till 1647, in which
                    year, the mortality amounting to 3597, we have the fifth epidemic in London. The
                    army diseases of the Civil Wars were chiefly typhus and malarial fevers, but
                    plague was not unknown among them, as at Wallingford Castle (Willis, “Of Fea
                    vers,” <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> ed. 1681, p. 131) and Dunstar Castle. From
                    this time till 1664 little was heard of plague in England, though it did not
                    cease on the Continent. In Ireland it is said to have been seen for the last
                    time in 1650.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For this

                <p>In 1656 one of the most destructive of all recorded epidemics in Europe raged in
                    Naples; it is said to have carried off 300,000 persons in the space of five
                    months. It passed to Rome, but there was much less fatal, making 14,000 victims
                    only—a result attributed by some to the precautions and sanitary measures
                    introduced by Cardinal Gastaldi, whose work, a splendid folio, written on this
                    occasion <hi rend="italic">(Tractatus</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi

                    historically one of the most important on the subject of quarantine, &amp;c.
                    Genoa lost 60,000 inhabitants from the same disease, but Tuscany remained
                    untouched. The comparatively limited spread of this frightful epidemic in Italy
                    at this time is a most noteworthy fact. Minorca is said to have been
                    depopulated. Nevertheless the epidemic spread in the next few yeàrs over Spain
                    and Germany, and a little later to Holland, where Amsterdam in 1663-64 was again
                    ravaged with a mortality given as 50,000, also Rotterdam and Haarlem. Hamburg
                    suffered in 1664.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Great Plague of London.—</hi> The preceding enumeration
                    will have prepared the reader to view the great plague of 1664-65 in its true
                    relation to others, and not as an isolated phenomenon. The preceding years had
                    been unusually free from plague, and it was not mentioned in the bills of
                    mortality till in the autumn of 1664 (November 2d) a few isolated cases were
                    observed in the parishes of St Giles and St Martin’s, Westminster, and a few
                    occurred in the following winter, which was very severe. About May 1665 the
                    disease again became noticeable, and spread, but somewhat slowly. Boghurst, a
                    contemporary doctor, notices that it crept down Hol-bqrn and took six months to
                    travel from the western suburbs (St Giles) to the eastern (Stepney) through the
                    city. The mortality rapidly rose from 43 in May to 590 in June, 6137 in July,
                    17,036 in August, 31,159 in September, after which it began to decline. The
                    total number of deaths from plague in that year, according to the bills of
                    mortality was 68,596, in a population estimated at 460,000,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Graunt, <hi rend="italic">Observations on the
                    Bills of Mortality,</hi> 3d ed., London, 1665.</p></note> out of whom two-thirds
                    are supposed to have fled to escape the contagion. This number is likely to be
                    rather too low than too high, since of the 6432 deaths from spotted fever many
                    were probably really from plague, though not declared so to avoid painful
                    restrictions. In December there was a sudden fall in the mortality which
                    continued through the winter; but in 1666 nearly 2000 deaths from plague are
                    recorded.</p>
                <p>According to some authorities, especially Hodges, the plague was imported into
                    London by bales of merchandise from Holland, which came originally from the
                    Levant; according to others it was introduced by Dutch prisoners of war; but
                    Boghurst regarded it as of local origin. It is in favour of the theory that it
                    spread by some means from Holland that plague had been all but extinct in London
                    for some seventeen years, and prevailed in Holland in 1663-64. But from its past
                    history and local conditions, London might well be deemed capable of producing
                    such an epidemic. In the bills of mortality since 1603 there are only three
                    years when no deaths from plague are recorded. The uncleanliness of the city was
                    comparable to that of Oriental cities at the present day, and, according to
                    contemporary testimony (Garencières, <hi rend="italic">Angliae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Flagellum,</hi> London 1647, p. 85), little improved since Erasmus
                    wrote his well-known description. The spread of the disease only partially
                    supported the doctrine of contagion, as Boghurst says:—“The disease spread not
                    altogether by contagion at first, nor began only at one place and spread further
                    and further as an eating sore doth all over the body, but fell upon several
                    places of city and suburbs like rain.” In fact dissemination seems to have taken
                    place, as usual, by the conversion of one house after another into a focus of
                    disease, a process favoured by the fatal custom of shutting up infected houses
                    with all their inmates, which was not only almost equivalent to a sentence of
                    death on all therein, but caused a dangerous concentration of the poison. The
                    well-known custom of marking such houses with a red cross and the legend ‘ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> God have mercy upon us !” was no new thing: it is
                    found in a proclamation in the possession of the present writer dated 1641; and
                    it was probably older still. Hodges testifies to the futility and injurious
                    effects of these regulations. The lord mayor and magistrates not only carried
                    out the appointed administrative measures, but looked to the cleanliness of the
                    city and the relief of the poor, so that there was little or no actual want; and
                    the burial arrangements appear to have been well attended to. The college of
                    physicians, by royal command, put forth such advice and prescriptions as were
                    thought best for the emergency. But it is clear that neither these measures nor
                    medical treatment had any effect in checking the disease. Early in November with
                    colder weather it began to decline; and in December there was so little fear of
                    contagion that those who had left the city “crowded back as thick as they fled.”
                    As has often been observed in other plague epidemics, sound people could enter
                    infected houses and even sleep in the beds of those who had died of the plague
                    “before they were even cold or cleansed from the stench of the diseased”
                    (Hodges). The symptoms of the disease being such as have been generally observed
                    need not be here considered. The disease was, as always, most destructive in
                    squalid, dirty neighbourhoods and among the poor, so as to be called the “poor’s
                    plague.” Those who lived in the town in barges or ships did not take the
                    disease; and the houses on London Bridge were but little affected. Of those
                    doctors who remained in the city some eight or nine died, not a large
                    proportion. Some had the rare courage to investigate the mysterious disease by
                    dissecting the bodies of the dead. Hodges implies that he did so, though he left
                    no full account of his observations. Dr George Thomson, a chemist and a disciple
                    of Van Helmont, followed the example, and nearly lost his life by an attack
                    which immediately followed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The plague of 1665 was widely spread over England, and was generally regarded as
                    having been transmitted from London, as it appeared mostly later than in the
                    metropolis, and in many cases the importation by a particular person could be
                    traced. Places near London were earliest affected, as Brentford, Greenwich,
                    Deptford; but in July or August 1665 it was already in Southampton, Sunderland,
                    Newcastle, &amp;c. A wider distribution occurred in the next year. Oxford
                    entirely escaped, though the residence of the court and in constant
                    communication with London. The exemption was attributed to cleanliness and good
                    drainage.</p>
                <p>After 1666 there was no epidemic of plague in London or any part of England,

                    plague in London was attributed to the Great Fire, but no such cause existed in
                    other cities. It has also been ascribed to quarantine, but no effective
                    quarantine was established till 1720, so that the cessation of plague in England
                    must be regarded as spontaneous.</p>
                <p>But this was no isolated fact. A similar cessation of plague was noted soon after
                    in the greater part of western Europe. In 1666 a severe plague raged in Cologne
                    and on the Rhine, which was prolonged till 1670 in the district. In the
                    Netherlands there was plague in 1667-69, but there are no definite notices of it
                    after 1672. France saw the last plague epidemic in 1668, till it reappeared in
                    1720. In the years 1675-84 a new plague epidemic appeared in North Africa,
                    Turkey, Poland, Hungary, Austria, and Germany, progressing generally northward.
                    Malta lost 11,000 persons in 1675. The plague of Vienna in 1679 was very severe,
                    causing 76,000 or probably more deaths. Prague in 1681 lost 83,000 by plague.
                    Dresden was affected in 1680, Magdeburg and Halle in 1682,—in the latter town
                    with a mortality of 4397 out of a population of about 10,000. Many North German
                    cities suffered about the same time; but in 1683 the plague disappeared from
                    Germany till the epidemic of 1707. In Spain it ceased about 1681; in Italy
                    certain cities were attacked till the end of the century, but not later
                    (Hirsch).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plague in the</hi> 18iΛ <hi rend="italic">Century.—</hi> At the
                    beginning of this period plague was very prevalent in Constantinople and along
                    the Danube. In 1703 it caused great destruction in the Ukraine. In 1704 it began
                    to spread through Poland, and later to Silesia, Lithuania, Prussia, and a great
                    part of Germany and Scandinavia. In Prussia and Lithuania 283,000 persons
                    perished; Dantzic, Hamburg, and other northern cities suffered severely.
                    Copenhagen was attacked in 1710. In Stockholm there was a mortality of 40,000.
                    Certain places near Brunswick (10° E. long.) marked the western limit of the
                    epidemic; and cholera was arrested at the same spot in later years (Haeser).</p>
                <p>At the same time the plague spread westward from the Danube to Transylvania and
                    Styria, and (1713) appeared in Austria and Bohemia, causing great mortality in
                    Vienna. Thence it passed to Prague and Ratisbon—to the former, possibly to the
                    latter, almost certainly conveyed by human intercourse. This city (12° E. long.)
                    was the western limit reached in this year. Haeser states that the plague
                    disappeared everywhere in Europe after the great hurricane of February 27,
                    1714.</p>
                <p>In 1717 plague raged severely in Constantinople; and in 1719 it made a fresh
                    progress westwards into Transylvania, Hungary, Galicia, and Poland, but not
                    farther (about 20° E. long.). It thus appears that each successive invasion had
                    a more easterly western limit, and that the gradual narrowing of the range of
                    plague, which began in the 17th century, was still going on.</p>
                <p>This process suffered a temporary interruption by the outbreak of plague of
                    southern France in 1720-22. In 1720 Marseilles became affected with an epidemic
                    plague, the origin of which was attributed by some to contagion through the ship
                    of a Captain Chataud which arrived, May 20, 1720, from Syria, where plague at
                    that time prevailed, though not epidemically when he sailed. Six of the crew had
                    died on the voyage to Leghorn, but the disease was declared not to be plague.
                    Cases of plague occurred, however, on the ship, and on June 22 among porters
                    unloading the cargo. Hence, according to believers in contagion, the disease
                    passed to families in the “old town,” the poorest and unhealthiest quarter. In
                    the meantime other ships had arrived from Syria, which were put in quarantine.
                    According to others the plague arose in Marseilles from local causes; and
                    recently discovered data show that suspicious cases of contagious disease
                    occurred in the town before the arrival of Chataud’s ship.<note anchored="true"

                    the evidence appears even now nearly balanced, though the believers in contagion
                    and importation gained the victory in public opinion. The pestilence was
                    fearfully severe. Thousands of unburied corpses filled the streets, and in all
                    40,000 to 60,000 persons were carried off. In December 1721 the plague passed
                    away, though isolated cases occurred in 1722. It passed to, or at least broke
                    out in, Arles and Aix in 1720, causing great mortality, but in Toulon not till
                    1721, when it destroyed two-thirds of the population. The epidemic spread
                    generally over Provence, but not to other parts of France, notwithstanding that,
                    as confessed by D’Antrechaus, consul of Toulon, a believer in the exclusive
                    power of contagion, there were abundant opportunities. The disease was in fact,
                    as in other cases, self-limited. In all 87,659 persons are said to have died out
                    of a population of nearly 250,000.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>This great epidemic caused a panic in England, which led to the introduction
                    (under Mead’s advice) of quarantine regulations, never previously enforced, and
                    also led to the publication of many pamphlets, &amp;c., beside Mead’s well-known

                    Messina in 1743 is important, not only for its fatality, but as one of the
                    strongest cases in favour of the theory of imported contagion. Messina had been
                    free from plague since 1624, and the Sicilians prided themselves on the rigour
                    of the quarantine laws which were thought to have preserved them. In May 1743 a
                    vessel arrived from Corfu, on board of which had occurred some suspicious
                    deaths. The ship and cargo were burnt, but soon after cases of a suspicious form
                    of disease were observed in the hospital and in the poorest [»arts of the town;
                    and in the summer a fearful epidemic of plague developed itself which destroyed
                    40,000 or 50,000 persons, and then became extinct without spreading to other
                    parts of Sicily.</p>

                    to exhibit the above-mentioned law of limitation. In 1738-44 the disease was in
                    the Ukraine, Hungary, the borders of Carniola, Moravia, and Austria, extending
                    along the Carpathians as far as Poland (20° E. long.), and also in Bukowina (25°
                    E. long.). It lasted till 1745, and then disappeared from those parts for
                    fifteen years. In 1755-57 plague prevailed in parts of European Turkey, whence
                    it on one occasion extended into Transylvania, in the neighbourhood of
                    Cron⅛tadt, where it was checked (25° '5 E. long.).<note anchored="true"

                <p>In 1770 a destructive plague arose in Moldavia during the Russo-Turkish War, and
                    shortly afterwards in Wallachia, apparently endemic in the former country at
                    least. It affected also Transylvania and part of Hungary, and still more
                    severely Poland, but was confined to Podolia, Volhynia, the Ukraine, and the
                    eastern part of Galicia (25° E. long.), not even penetrating as far as Warsaw.
                    After destroying, it is said, 300,000 persons, and without being checked by any
                    quarantine regulations, the plague died out finally in March 1771, being
                    remarkable for its short duration and spontaneous limitation (Haeser).</p>
                <p>In another direction the plague spread over Little Russia in 1770, and desolated
                    Kieff, while in the next year it broke out in Moscow and produced one of the
                    most destructive epidemics of modern times. More than 50,000 persons, nearly
                    one-fourth of the population, were carried off.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The remaining European plague-epidemics of the 18th century were inconsiderable,
                    but on that very account noteworthy. Transylvania was again affected in 1785,
                    Slavonia and Livonia (a district of eastern Galicia) in 1795-96 (25°E. long.),
                    Volhynia in 1798. The disease, while reappearing in the seats of the terrible
                    earlier epidemics, was more limited in its range and of shorter duration.<note

                    and the Caucasus, and in 1803-6 began to spread from the north of the Caucasus
                    into Russia, till in 1806 it was established at or near Astrakhan, and in 1807
                    reached Zareff, 200 miles higher up the Volga. These localities are interesting
                    as being near those where plague appeared in 1877-78. It is also said to have
                    entered the government of Saratoff, but probably no great distance.<note

                <p>In 1808 plague was at Constantinople, in 1809 at Smyrna. In 1812 was a more
                    general epidemic affecting these places and also Egypt. An outbreak at Odessa is
                    supposed to have been brought from Constantinople and thence to have passed to
                    Transylvania. In 1813 a severe plague at Bucharest is supposed to have been
                    brought from Constantinople. About the same time plague prevailed in Bosnia, and
                    is supposed to have passed thence to Dalmatia in 1815. In 1814-15 it again
                    appeared in Egypt, and once more invaded the continent of Europe in Albania and
                    Bosnia. Two insular outbreaks, Malta in 1813 and Corfu in 1815, attracted much
                    attention as being both thought to be cases of importation by sea-traffic,<note

                    imported from the opposite coast of Dalmatia, though no definite history of
                    contagion ιvas established; according to others, it originated endemically in
                    that place. It remained, however, strictly confined to a small district, perhaps
                    in consequence of the extraordinarily rigorous measures of isolation adopted by
                    the Italian Government. In 1828 an isolated epidemic appeared in Greece in the

                    connected with the campaign of the Russian army against Turkey in 1828-29.
                    Moldavia, Wallachia, and Bessarabia were widely affected; the disease broke out
                    also in Odessa and the Crimea, and isolated cases occurred in Transylvania. The
                    most northerly points reached by the plague were near Czernowitz on the frontier
                    of Bessarabia, and Bukowina, and its limitation was as before attributed to the

                <p>The plague-epidemics in Egypt between 1833 and 1845, when it was last observed in
                    that country, are very important in the history of plague, since the disease was
                    almost for the first time scientifically studied in its home by skilled European
                    physicians, chiefly French. The disease was found to be less contagious than
                    reported to be by popular tradition, and most of the French school went so far
                    as to deny the contagiousness of the disease altogether. The epidemic of 1834-35
                    was not less destructive than many of those notorious in history; but in 1844-45
                    the disease disappeared, and it has never been seen since in the country which
                    was for centuries regarded as its native home. This result can hardly be
                    attributed to quarantine, though it is probable that increased attention to
                    sanitary measures under the influence of educated medical officials may have had
                    much to do with it. But on the large scale it is a part of the great eastward
                    recession of the plague, which is an undoubted fact, however it is to be
                    explained. In 1840 Dalmatia (17° E. long.), in 1841 Constantinople (29° E.
                    long.), in 1843-44 the eastern parts of Egypt (31° E. long.), were the western
                    boundaries of plague. The same law has, with one notable exception, been
                    observed since.</p>
                <p>1853-84.—Since the apparent extinction of plague in Egypt in 1845, it has
                    appeared in several points of Asia and Africa, and once in Europe.</p>
                <p>In 1853 plague appeared in a district of western Arabia, the Asir country in
                    North Yemen, and it is known to have occurred in the same district in 1815, as
                    it did afterwards in 1874 and 1879. In 1874 the disease extended within four
                    days’ march of Mecca. From the scantiness of population the mortality has not
                    been great, but it is clear that this is one of the endemic seats of
                    plague.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>J. N. Radcliffe,

                <p>In June 1858 intelligence was received in Constantinople of an outbreak of
                    disease at the small town Benghazi, in the district of Barca, province of
                    Tripoli, North Africa, which though at first misunderstood was clearly bubonic
                    plague. From later researches there is reason to believe that it commenced in
                    1856 or in 1855. The disease did not spread, and ceased in the autumn, to return
                    with less violence in 1859, when it died out. In the autumn of 1873 it returned,
                    but apparently came again to a spontaneous termination. At all events it has not
                    been heard of since.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>After the epidemic of Benghazi in 1856-59, plague was next heard of in the
                    district of Maku, in the extreme north-west of Persia in November 1863. It
                    occurred in a scattered population, and the mortality was not absolutely
                    large.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>J. Netten

                <p>In 1867 an outbreak of plague was reported in Mesopotamia (Irak), among the
                    marshes of Hindieh bordering on the lower Euphrates; and, as it has prevailed at
                    intervals up to the present time in the same country, great importance attaches
                    to its history. The epidemic began in December 1866 (or probably earlier) and
                    ceased in June 1867. But numerous cases of non-fatal mild bubonic disease (mild
                    plague or <hi rend="italic">pestis</hi><hi rend="italic">minor')</hi> occurred
                    both before and after the epidemic, and according to Tholozan similar cases had
                    been observed nearly every year from 1856 to 1865.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The next severe epidemic of plague in Irak began in December 1873. But facts
                    collected by Tholozan show that <hi rend="italic">pestis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >minor,</hi> or sporadic cases of true plague, had appeared in 1868 and
                    subsequent years. The outbreak of 1873-74 began about 60 miles from the origin
                    of that of 1867. It caused a much greater mortality and extended over a much
                    wider area than that of 1867, including the towns of Kerbela and Hilleh. After a
                    short interval it reappeared at Diyanieh in December 1874, and spread over a
                    much wider area than in the previous epidemics. This epidemic was carefully
                    studied by Surgeon-Major Colvill.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See his report cited by Radcliffe, <hi rend="italic">Papers
                    on Levantine Plague,</hi> 1879.</p></note> He estimated the mortality at 4000.
                    The epidemic ceased in July, but broke out again early in 1876, and in this year
                    extended northwards to Baghdad and beyond. The whole area now affected extended
                    250 miles from north-west to south-east, and the total number of deaths was
                    believed to be 20,000. In 1877 plague also occurred at Shuster in south-west
                    Persia, probably conveyed by pilgrims returning from Irak, and caused great
                    mortality.</p>
                <p>After its customary cessation in the autumn (a pause attributed as before to the
                    efficiency of quarantine regulations), the epidemic began again in October 1876,
                    though sporadic cases occurred all the summer. The disease appeared in 1877 in
                    other parts of Mesopotamia also with less severity than in 1876, but over a
                    wider area, being now announced at Samara, a town 70 miles above Baghdad on the
                    Tigris. Since then the existence of plague in Baghdad or Mesopotamia has not
                    been announced till the year 1884, when accounts again appeared in the
                    newspapers, and in July the usual official statement occurs that the plague has
                    been stamped out. The above account of plague in Irak is the most complete
                    history of a succession of epidemics in one country which we have had of late
                    years.</p>
                <p>To complete the history of plague in Persia it should be stated that in 1870—71
                    it appeared in a district of Mukri in Persian Kurdistan to the south of Lake
                    Urumiah (far removed from the outbreak of 1863). The epidemic appears, however,
                    to have died out in 1871, and no further accounts of plague there have been
                    received. The district had suffered in the great epidemic of plague in Persia in
                    1829-35. In the winter 1876-77 a disease which appears to have been plague
                    appeared in two villages in the extreme north of the province of Khorasan, about
                    25 leagues from the south-east angle of the Caspian Sea. In March 1877 plague
                    broke out in Resht, a town of 20,000 inhabitants, in the province of Ghilan,
                    near the Caspian Sea at its south-west angle, from which there is a certain
                    amount of trade with Astrakhan. In 1832 a very destructive plague had carried
                    off half the inhabitants. In 1877 the plague was very fatal. From March to
                    September 4000 persons were calculated to have died. The disease continued till
                    the spring of 1878. In 1877 there was a doubtful report of the same disease at
                    Astrabad, and also in some parts near the Perso-Afghan frontier. In 1878 plague
                    again occurred in Kurdistan in the district of So-uj-Bulak, said by Dr Tholozan
                    to be the same as in the district of Mukri where it occurred in 1870-71. These
                    scattered outbreaks of plague in Persian territory are the more remarkable
                    because that country has been generally noted for its freedom from plague (as
                    compared with Asiatic Turkey and the Levant).</p>
                <p>It has since been known that a few cases of plague occurred in January 1877 at
                    Baku on the west shore of the Caspian, in Russian territory.<note

                    Astrakhan and in the city itself, which was clearly a mild form of plague <hi

                    only one due to a complication) and died out apparently spontaneously. An
                    official physician, Dr Kastorsky, who investigated the matter for the
                    Government, declared the disease to be identical with that prevailing in the
                    same year at Resht in Persia; another physician, Dr Janizky, even gave it the

                    Astrakhan on the right bank of the Volga, which seem to have puzzled the
                    physicians who first observed them, but on November 30th were recognized as
                    being but the same mild plague as had been observed the year before near
                    Astrakhan by Dr Döppner, chief medical officer of the Cossacks of Astrakhan. His
                    report on the epidemic is the only original one we have. At the end of
                    November<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>ι The dates are
                    all reduced to new style.</p></note> the disease became suddenly more severe,
                    and most of those attacked died; and from the 21st December it became still more
                    malignant, death occurring in some cases in a few hours, and without any buboes
                    being formed. No case of recovery was known in this period. At the end of the
                    year it rapidly declined, and in the first weeks of January still more so. The
                    last death was on January 24. In the second half of December, when the disease
                    had already lasted two months, cases of plague occurred in several neighbouring
                    villages, all of an extremely malignant type, so that in some places all who
                    were attacked died. In most of these cases the disease began with persons who
                    had been at Vetlanka, though this was not universally established. The
                    inhabitants of these <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n177/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0177-0168"/> villages, terrified at the accounts from
                    Vetlanka, strictly isolated the sick, and thus probably checked the spread of
                    the disease. But it evidently suffered a spontaneous decline. By the end of
                    January there were no cases left in the district except at one village
                    (Selitren-noye), where the last occurred on the 9th February. The total number
                    of cases in Vetlanka, out of a population of about 1700, was 417, of whom 362
                    died. In the other villages there were about 62 deaths from plague, and not more
                    than two or three cases of recovery. In consequence of the alarm excited by this
                    last appearance of plague upon European soil, most European Governments sent
                    special commissions to the spot. The British commissioners were Surgeon-Major
                    Colvill and the present writer, who, like all the foreign commissioners, reached
                    the spot when the epidemic was over. With respect to the origin of this
                    epidemic, the possibility of its having originated on the spot, as in Resht and
                    on the Euphrates in very similar situations, is not to be denied. An attempt was
                    made to show that the contagion was brought home by Cossacks returning from the
                    Turkish War, but on absolutely no evidence. In the opinion of the writer the
                    real beginning of the disease was in the year 1877, in the vicinity of
                    Astrakhan, and the sudden development of the malignant out of a mild form of the
                    disease is no more than has been observed in other places. The Astrakhan disease
                    may have been imported from Resht or Baku, or may have been caused concurrently
                    with the epidemics of these places by some cause affecting the basin of the
                    Caspian generally. But the conditions under which these mild or miasmatic forms
                    of plague are spread are as yet unknown.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plagia:</hi><hi rend="italic">in India,.—</hi> It used to be
                    held as a maxim that plague never appeared east of the Indus; nevertheless it
                    has been observed during this century in more than one distinct centre in India.
                    So long ago as 1815 the disease appeared in Guzerat, Kattywar, and Cutch, “after
                    three years of severe famine.” It reappeared early next year, in the same
                    locality, when it extended to Sind as far as Hyderabad, and in another direction
                    south-east as far as Ahmedabad and Dhollerah. But it disappeared from these
                    parts in 1820 or early in 1821, and was not heard of again till July 1836, when
                    a disease broke out into violence at the town of Pali in Mar war in Raj pu tana.
                    It spread from Pali to the province of Meywar, but died out spontaneously in the
                    hot season of 1837, and has never been heard of again in that part of India. The
                    origin of these two epidemics was obscure. No importation from other countries
                    could be traced.</p>
                <p>In 1823 (though not officially known till later) an epidemic broke out at
                    Kedarnath in Gurwhal, a sub-district of Kumaon on the south-west of the
                    Himalayas, on a high situation. In 1834 and 1836 other epidemics occurred, which
                    at last attracted the attention of Government. In 1849-50, and again in 1852,
                    the disease raged very severely and spread southward. In 1853 Dr Francis and Dr
                    Pearson were appointed a commission to inquire into the malady. In 1876-77
                    another outbreak occurred, since which time no accounts of the epidemic have
                    been received. The symptoms of this disease, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >maha</hi><hi rend="italic">murree</hi> by the natives, are precisely those of
                    Oriental plague. The feature of blood-spitting, to which much importance has
                    been attached, appears to be not a common one. A very remarkable circumstance is
                    the death of animals (rats, and more rarely snakes), which occurs at the
                    outbreak of an epidemic. The rats bring up blood, and the body of one examined
                    after death by Dr Francis showed an affection of the lungs. Maha murree is
                    intensely communicable, but does not show much tendency to spread, since
                    pilgrims who visit the mountain shrines are not affected and do not convey the
                    disease. It is doubtless connected with uncleanliness and poverty, but Dr
                    Francis believes that the poison exists in the soil, which becomes more and more
                    contaminated with it. The disease is pretty clearly endemic, not imported.<note

                <p>It is remarkable that of late years reports have come of the occurrence of
                    Oriental plague in China. It has been observed in the province of Yunnan since
                    1871, and also at Pakhoi, a port in the Tong-king Gulf, as lately as 1882,—but
                    said to have prevailed there at least fifteen years. In Yunnan it appears to be
                    endemic, though there are rumours of its having been brought from Burmah, and
                    become more noticeable after the suppression of a rebellion in that province.
                    The climate is temperate and the country partly mountainous. Some regard the
                    disease as being conveyed from Pakhoi to Yunnan. In both places the symptoms
                    were the same, of undoubted bubonic plague. It has always been noticed, as in
                    India, that rats leave their holes and die at the beginning of an epidemic; and
                    the same mortality has been observed among cats, dogs, cattle, ponies, deer,
                    &amp;c. At Pakhoi it recurs nearly every year.<note anchored="true"

                <p>It thus appears that at the present time plague exists, or has existed within ten
                    years, in the following parts of the world :—(1) Benghazi, Africa; (2) Persian
                    Kurdistan; (3) Irak, on the Tigris and Euphrates; (4) the Asir country, western
                    Arabia; (5) on the lower Volga, Russia; (6) northern Persia and the shores of
                    the Caspian; (7) Kumaon and Gurhwal, India; (8) Yunnan and Pakhoi, China. Except
                    Benghazi all these places show an eastward recession as compared with the old
                    seats of plague known to us.</p>
