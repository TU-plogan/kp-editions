                <p><label type="entry">POLICE</label>. The branch of criminal justice which
                    comprises a methodical system for the prevention and detection of crime is
                    commonly known by the name of “Police.” With the system having these objects is
                    combined the execution of many duties not strictly involved in the popular
                    definition of crime, but materially affecting the security and convenience of
                    the public. Bentham, more comprehensively, says that police is in general a
                    system of precaution either for the prevention of crime or of calamities. It is
                    destined to prevent evils and provide benefits. The system for the attainment of
                    these objects and the introduction and establishment of that system in the
                    United Kingdom form the main subject of this article; some account will
                    afterwards be given of the police in other states.</p>
                <p>In this view the definition and use of the word “police,” as meaning the
                    regulation and government of the city and country in relation to the
                    inhabitants, are not sufficiently close. When Blackstone says that by the public
                    police and economy he means “the due regulation and domestic order of the
                    kingdom, whereby the individuals of the state, like members of a well governed
                    family, are bound to conform their general behaviour to the rules of propriety,
                    good neighbourhood, and good manners, and to be decent, industrious, and
                    inoffensive in their respective stations,” the definition is capable of an
                    interpretation at once too wide and too narrow for the present purpose. It is
                    vain to look for an accurate description of police, as a system, in writers of a
                    period when the thing sought for had no existence. The system is of recent
                    growth, and it is necessarily more associated with personal instruments for the
                    attainment of objects than with the objects to be attained. An observation of
                    Gibbon, referring to the aediles and quaestors of the Roman empire, that
                    officers of the police or revenue easily adapt themselves to any form of
                    government, correctly presents the idea of distinctive personal elements. A
                    system of police administration includes neither the making of the law nor the
                    law itself. Officers of police are neither legislators nor (in the usual sense)
                    magistrates. They are the instruments by which conformity to the rules of the
                    commonwealth is attained.</p>
                <p>Apart from the repression of crime as generally understood, it is plain that, at
                    least in crowded cities, a power ought to exist for the suppression of noise and
                    disorder, the regulation of locomotion and traffic, the correction of indecency,
                    and the prevention of a numerous class of annoyances and impositions which can
                    only be restrained by cognizance being taken of them at the instant. To these
                    may be added a number of petty disputes the immediate settlement of which tends
                    materially to the public peace. Over such subjects as these it is obviously for
                    the general advantage the police should have a summary control. Any apprehension
                    of danger to liberty can only be founded on its abuse and not upon its proper
                    exercise.</p>
                <p>The employment of persons in these various duties, as well as in the prevention
                    and detection of graver matters of crime, constitutes a division of state
                    labour. Therefore, while it is perfectly correct to speak of the various
                    legislative and other measures for good order as “matters of police,” the
                    organization and management of the police forces constitute a distinct
                    subject.</p>
                <p>The essential features of the established police system, alike in Great Britain
                    and in foreign states, in cities and towns as in countries and village
                    communities, comprise the following matters :—</p>
                <p>I. A body of persons in relation to the state enforcing obedience to the criminal
                    law, the prevention and detection of crime, and the preservation of order, over
                    a defined area, generally divided and subdivided for the purpose of distribution
                    and immediate government of the force, but having one jurisdiction
                    throughout.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n348/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0348-0333"/>
                <p>II. The division of that force into classes of various rank, comprising, in
                    general, in ascending order, constables, sergeants, inspectors, and
                    superintendents (or their equivalents),—the constables being the most numerous
                    and themselves divided into classes.</p>
                <p>III. General control of the entire body by heads, whether styled commissioners or
                    chiefs, having power to make regulations for the government of the force,
                    subject in turn to the control of state-authorities.</p>
                <p>IV. Patrol day and night of the streets, roads, and publiρ places,—the “beats”
                    and “tours of duty” of constables being prescribed by regulations, and actual
                    performance and compliance being secured by the sergeants and inspectors.</p>
                <p>V. The payment of the force, including establishment charges, out of public funds
                    provided for the purpose.</p>
                <p>In dealing with these subjects as nearly as may be in the order indicated, the
                    relationship of the policé force to the state is of primary importance. A
                    general control by the executive Government of a state of the police forces, for
                    the legitimate objects for which they are established, seems essential. In Great
                    Britain every member of the force, from an ordinary constable upwards, stands in
                    the direct position of a servant of the crown. On admission he makes a
                    promissory declaration (recently substituted for an oath) that he will serve the
                    sovereign; and it is upon the fact that a police constable has the powers,
                    duties, and privileges of a peace officer of and for the crown that many of the
                    incidents of his service depend, although the immediate power of dismissal is
                    vested in heads of a force, whose orders he is bound to obey.</p>
                <p>The state employs the police forces for the public welfare only. “There is not in
                    England,” remarked the late Chief-Justice Cockburn, “any more than in America,
                    any system of espionage or secret police to pry into men’s secret actions or to
                    obtain information for the Government by underhand and unworthy means.” The
                    truth of this is exemplified in the present position of police administration in
                    the metropolitan police district of England acting under the immediate control
                    of the secretary of state. The fear expressed, and no doubt felt, on the first
                    establishment of a regularly organized system of police, that the freedom of
                    holding meetings and the utterance of opinion at them would be suppressed, has
                    been dispelled. The police are expressly enjoined not to interfere with persons
                    attending political meetings unless specially ordered, and such orders are not
                    given unless disorder or a breach of the peace is imminent. Public addresses,
                    even in some of the royal parks, are permitted, provided they do not cause any
                    obstruction, and are not of an unlawful character. There are no Government
                    police to watch the delivery of mere political opinion or the tenor of its
                    reception by the auditory. The press is also free from Government interference,
                    through the police, in matters short of crime or not directly incentive to
                    crime.</p>
                <p>The sphere of action of the police force in relation to the state has been
                    extended by legislative enactments providing that criminals who have escaped to
                    or from colonies may be followed and removed by process of law, and tried where
                    the crime originated. The practical execution of the law as to these fugitive
                    offenders rests with the police. The same observation applies to the province of
                    police under extradition treaties. But the general action of the police force of
                    a country is bounded by its shores. As the open sea is not the territory of any
                    one nation, it is not competent to any one nation to preserve order or remove
                    all delinquents on its surface, as it is in the ports, rivers, and lakes of a
                    state. When Lord Castlereagh at the congress of Vienna spoke of the “police” to
                    be exercised over ships carrying slaves, Talleyrand asked the precise meaning of
                    the expression; and, on the English statesman explaining that he intended to
                    refer to what every Government exercised in virtue of its sovereignty or under
                    treaties with other powers, Talleyrand would not admit the existence of any
                    maritime police, except that of each power over its own vessels.</p>
                <p>The supervision of the police by the Government stands thus. The commissioner of
                    police of the metropolis of London is appointed by and acts under the immediate
                    direction of the secretary of state for the home department. The commissioner of
                    police of the city of London is in communication with the corporation, who
                    appoint him. There is, however, a power of approval of regulations in the
                    secretary of state. In the counties of England the appointment of the chief
                    constable is by the county magistrates subject to the approval of the secretary
                    of state. In municipal corporations the police, including the chief or head
                    constable, are appointed by the watch committee. In all these cases except in
                    the metropolis the secretary of state leaves the immediate control to local
                    authorities and disclaims responsibility. In Scotland the secretary of state has
                    a voice in the rules for the government, pay, and necessaries of the force. The
                    appointment of the chief constable is subject to his approval, but practically
                    there is no interference called for in this respect. In Ireland great authority
                    is vested in the lord lieutenant both with respect to the police of Dublin and
                    the royal Irish constabulary. The immediate government is vested in the heads of
                    the forces, and the parliamentary responsibility is in the chief secretary for
                    Ireland. Reports and returns as to the police forces of Great Britain and
                    Ireland are laid before parliament. The immediate control and responsibility of
                    a cabinet minister for the police of the metropolis of London makes a very
                    important distinction between the position of that force and of the other police
                    forces of the empire. There is, however, a general relationship of the police
                    forces of the country to the state, arising from the contribution (not now
                    limited to a particular proportion) made by parliament to the expenditure for a
                    police force. Under an Act of 1856 the crown appoints three persons as paid
                    inspectors to visit and inquire into the state and efficiency of the police
                    appointed for every county and borough in England and Wales, and to see whether
                    the provisions of the Acts under which they are appointed are duly observed and
                    carried into effect; and upon the secretary of state’s certificate of
                    efficiency, laid before parliament, the contribution is made. In the same way an
                    inspector for Scotland reports annually.</p>
                <p>It is to be observed that the contribution cannot be made to a borough police not
                    consolidated with the county police where the population is less than 5000. In
                    England the state, except in the city of London, contributes about half the pay
                    of forces which submit to certain regulations, to inspection, and to a definite
                    amount of imperial control. In Scotland the state also contributes. About
                    two-thirds of the cost of the Dublin metropolitan police is met by the treasury.
                    The balance in all the above cases comes from the locality. The royal Irish
                    constabulary is the only force whose ordinary strength is entirely supported by
                    imperial taxation, subject, however, to payment by districts where special
                    services are necessary.</p>
                <p>To prevent political influence being brought to bear upon the police, they cannot
                    vote at elections of members of parliament within their district <hi
                    rend="italic">; and</hi> the chief officers are disqualified from sitting in
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>The relationship of the police forces of the country to the army as a state force
                    is satisfactory. The police is a civil force. Although constables constantly
                    speak of the public as “civilians,” the police are in turn styled civilians by
                    soldiers. It is now only on rare occasions that soldiers <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n349/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0349-0334"/> are required to intervene in the case of riot or
                    tumult, as fortunately the police force is generally sufficient for the
                    preservation of the peace of the country. If disturbance is apprehended in any
                    district, special constables are called upon to aid. It is no less due to the
                    improved temper and habits of the people than to the existence of the police
                    force that military display is rarely needed to suppress riots. In state
                    processions and on some other occasions the police and household troops together
                    maintain the line of route, and where troops assemble for inspection the police
                    sometimes aid in keeping the ground. The police, as constables, are required to
                    carry out the law as to billeting and the impressment of carriages,—at one time
                    a very heavy incident of duty, but considerably lightened by the practice of
                    conveying troops by railway. The police apprehend deserters on reasonable
                    suspicion. Police in charge of a station must receive prisoners, including
                    deserters and absentees subject to military law, if duly sent there by military
                    authority; and, as a person subject to military law is usually left to be dealt
                    with by the ordinary civil tribunal for offences, he is taken by the police
                    before a magistrate. On the other hand no person subject to military law,
                    whether an officer or a private, can neglect or refuse to deliver over to the
                    civil magistrate any officer or soldier accused of an offence punishable in the
                    ordinary mode, or to assist the police in his lawful apprehension; an adjustment
                    of military and civil law is therefore effected.</p>
                <p>The duties devolving on a police force require a fuller notice than the general
                    remarks already made.</p>
                <p>A constable on ordinary patrol duty has to attend to every circumstance that a
                    keen eye and ready ear bring under his notice. In a carefully drawn statute,
                    although not now in general use, the general sphere of observation and duty by
                    constables is thus summarized :—</p>
                <p>“During the time they shall be on duty, use their utmost endeavours to prevent
                    any mischief by fire, and also to prevent all robberies, burglaries, and other
                    felonies and misdemeanors, and other outrages, disorders, and breaches of the
                    peace; and to apprehend and secure all felons, rogues, vagabonds, and disorderly
                    persons who shall disturb the public peace, or any party or persons wandering,
                    secreting, or misbehaving himself, herself, or themselves, or whom they shall
                    have reasonable cause to suspect of any evil designs; and to secure and keep in
                    safe custody any such person, in order that lie or she may be conveyed as soon
                    as conveniently may be before a justice of the peace, to be examined and dealt
                    with according to law; and it shall and may be lawful to and for the said
                    watchmen, serjeants of the watch, patrols, and other person or persons to call
                    and require any person or persons to aid and assist them in taking such felons,
                    rogues, vagabonds, and all disorderly or suspected persons as aforesaid” (3
                    &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 90, § 41).</p>
                <p>Police action jn relation to the serious matters constituting crime is familiar
                    knowledge. It is essential to bear in mind that the powers of the police in
                    arresting and otherwise dealing with criminals in a variety of ways is derived
                    from and depends on police constables having been expressly invested with the
                    powers and duties of the old parish constables. Every police force has been
                    given these powers and duties of constables, and the possession of them is so
                    essential that, however they may be supplemented by modern legislation, without
                    them no police force could exist for a day.</p>
                <p>A statistical or other inquiry into crime is necessarily beyond the limits of
                    this article. A few facts, however, bear on the efficiency of the police
                    forces.</p>
                <p>The returns indicate that the apprehensions in 1881-82 were (omitting fractions)
                    in the proportion of 41 per cent, to the number of crimes committed in England
                    and Wales, against a like proportion in 1880-81, 42 per cent, in 1879-80, 45 in
                    1878-79, 44 in 1877-78, 46 for 1876-77, and 47 per cent, for 1875-76.</p>
                <p>The director of criminal investigations reported for the year 1882 that a
                    comparison of the statistics—which are prepared by an independent service with a
                    scrupulous regard to accuracy—with those of foreign cities shows that the
                    metropolis of London (metropolitan police district), with a territory nearly 700
                    square miles in extent, covered by more than 700,000 separate houses, and
                    inhabited by a population barely less than 5,000,000, is the safest capital for
                    life and property in the world.</p>
                <p>Although criminal procedure does not admit of being fully treated here as part of
                    the police system, yet as the police by duty as well as practice are in fact
                    prosecutors in the majority of criminal cases, the important part taken by the
                    police force requires notice.</p>
                <p>The efficiency of the police, as well as the exigencies of cases, has led to the
                    arrest of offenders or suspected persons in the great majority of felonies and
                    other crimes, where the power exists, without applying to magistrates for
                    warrants in the first instance. Although there are some advantages attendant
                    upon a practice under which magistrates do not hear of the matter until the
                    accused is actually before them, it is undoubtedly better, as recently declared
                    by the commissioners reporting on the criminal code, for the police officer to
                    obtain a warrant where circumstances admit of his doing so. When he arrests,
                    whether with or without a warrant, it is his duty to take the prisoner before a
                    magistrate.</p>
                <p>Without attempting to enter fully into the rights and duties of the police in
                    relation to arrest, it may be mentioned that, while the important action of the
                    police is derived from and wholly dependent (except in some cases where recent
                    legislation has found a place) on the older powers, science has been made
                    subservient in facilitating the application of those powers to police duties. As
                    in old times the reasonable suspicion giving the right to arrest may still be
                    founded on personal observation and information in the ordinary mode; but the
                    electric telegraph and the photograph now lend their aid as recognized agents in
                    favour of justice and truth far more than in aid of fraud and deception.</p>
                <p>If an arrest is without a warrant, it is the officer’s duty to show that he acted
                    rightly by establishing at least that he proceeded on reasonable information.
                    His task is generally much more. He or some police officer, whether acting under
                    a warrant or not, has to adduce all the evidence to justify a committal for
                    trial, or, if the case is one in which the court of summary jurisdiction has the
                    power, for a conviction. In carrying out this duty even in simple cases a
                    multitude of matters have to be attended to in which a number of police officers
                    take a part. Whether the arrest is made by a constable on his beat or under
                    other circumstances, the ordinary duty involves taking the prisoner to the
                    police station, where the charge is entered. He is then taken before the
                    magistrate, or, in some cases, bailed. If the charge be one of felony it
                    generally involves a remand, not only for the attendance of witnesses, but to
                    ascertain the prisoner’s antecedents; and these remands are often multiplied in
                    complicated eases. Every remand involves the conveyance of the prisoner to and
                    from the prison or “lock-up,”— generally the former. Detective police attend at
                    the prison to ascertain whether the accused has been previously convicted or
                    charged. Witnesses must be seen and their attendance secured. If the prisoner is
                    eventually committed for trial it is the duty of the inspector or other officer
                    having charge of the case to aid the magistrate’s clerk in making out the
                    certificate of costs, so that the proper amounts for the allowance of witnesses
                    are inserted. Although in ordinary cases there is a nominal “prosecutor” (the
                    person who has been wounded or lost his property), if he enters into a
                    recognizance before the magistrate, he leaves everything to the police, who have
                    to inform him even when and where he must attend for the trial, and the police
                    are required in many cases to give the necessary instructions for the
                    indictment; and, when the proper time arrives for the trial at the sessions or
                    assizes (of which public notice is given), the police must inform the witnesses
                    and arrange for their conveyance and prompt attendance in the precincts of the
                    court, first before the grand jury, afterwards on the trial. A police officer
                    must attend the taxing officer, give the necessary particulars as to the
                    witnesses, and see that they receive their allowances.</p>
                <p>The responsibilities and duties of the police may be varied, but on the whole are
                    scarcely diminished, if there is a solicitor for a private or for the public
                    prosecutor; the Act of 1884 relating to the public prosecutor regards the police
                    as essential parties, and it is certain that no general system of prosecution
                    can be carried on with diminished police intervention.</p>
                <p>The duties of police to accused persons are too important to be passed over in
                    complete silence. To say that they involve perfect fairness ought to be a
                    sufficient guide, but it is right to add that the indirect as well as the direct
                    extortion of statements, either by threat or promise, is forbidden. On the other
                    hand to caution accused persons is not the province of the police; as on the one
                    hand a police officer ought not in general to put questions, so on the other
                    hand he ought not to prevent voluntary statements. · His general duty is to
                    listen, and to remember accurately what the accused says. It is often the duty
                    of an officer to give information to the accused, as for instance of the nature
                    of the charge on which he is arrested or to read the warrant; but information of
                    this kind should not be given interrogatively. It sometimes happens, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n350/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0350-0335"/> however, that in the course of inquiries a person
                    makes a criminatory statement to a police officer, in consequence of which it is
                    the duty of the officer to arrest him. This is distinct from questioning a
                    person whom the officer has not merely suspected but predetermined to
                    arrest.</p>
                <p>Some other duties, the growth of modern times and unknown until recently, devolve
                    on the police in relation to criminals. They arise from the release of offenders
                    sentenced to penal servitude before the expiration of the period, on certain
                    conditions, or of offenders sentenced, after the expiration of their sentence of
                    imprisonment, to be under police supervision for a given period. Both classes of
                    convicts involve the performance by the police of very responsible duties in
                    reference to reporting and giving notice of changes of residence, so as to make
                    the watch and supervision a real thing, and at the same time to give the
                    convicts the opportunity, as intended, of gaining an honest livelihood at some
                    labour or calling. It is a frequent source of complaint by the convicts that
                    they are so watched that they cannot obtain employment, and are driven into the
                    repetition of crime,—the police retorting that the allegations are untrue, and
                    that the fresh offence is the result of the habitual offender’s incurable love
                    for crime. Any constable in any police district may, if authorized so to do (in
                    writing) by the chief officer of police of that district, without warrant take
                    into custody any convict who is the holder of a licence if it appears to such
                    constable that such convict is getting his livelihood by dishonest means, and
                    may bring him before a court of summary jurisdiction. The system of “reporting”
                    is itself a branch of police administration of great importance, and requiring
                    considerable knowledge. Its headquarters may be said to be in the metropolis and
                    under the superintendence of the police of that district, but it involves
                    constant communication with other districts and observation throughout the
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>The extent of police duty in respect of such offenders is shown by the fact that,
                    according to the last published return, there were in England and Wales 1268
                    convicts on licence and persons under sentence of supervision.</p>
                <p>The police are in general the instruments for carrying out the statutory
                    provisions respecting certified industrial schools and reformatories. Not only
                    is the process for the most part directed to the police, but magistrates and
                    others interested look to the force for suggestions and assistance. In some
                    respects it would be desirable if industrial schools, as distinguished from
                    reformatories, could be worked without the intervention of police agency, but
                    that seems impracticable.</p>
                <p>An important police function relates to the execution of process, and is not
                    confined to subjects or cases in which the force is collectively or individually
                    concerned in the performance of their duty. Whether the process is a warrant or
                    a summons, its execution or service is in the hands of the police. Magisterial
                    warrants of apprehension and search are by law, in other than exceptional cases,
                    necessarily directed to the police as peace officers, whether their purport be
                    to bring the person before the tribunal or to convey him from it or from one
                    place to another; and in other warrants of execution, although parochial
                    officers are often joined, police are also included to prevent abuses of the law
                    to which the poor are so much exposed. Police officers are now expressly
                    required to have the direction of warrants of distress. The service of a
                    magisterial summons, although not in general prescribed to be effected by a
                    police officer, in practice properly devolves on the force. In the metropolitan
                    police district all police service must be by its officers. In a great variety
                    of matters where notice has to be given to persons, the duty of communicating it
                    either verbally or in writing or in print is thrown on the police. So convenient
                    a medium for the orderly administration of purely civil matters are the police
                    found that, at the request of the local government board, the police are allowed
                    to deliver and collect voting papers in the election of parochial officers.</p>
                <p>The increased area over which a police constable as compared with the old parish
                    constable has jurisdiction facilitates both arrests and service of process.
                    Although stationed within a defined area of limited jurisdiction, the duties of
                    the force often involve the operation of functions without geographical limits,
                    requiring the actual presence of its members outside as well as the performance
                    within the district of much that relates to the exterior.</p>
                <p>The service of process calls for constant communication between different police
                    forces. The law provides for the backing of warrants, by which a constable can
                    act beyond his ordinary jurisdiction or by which the warrants can be
                    transmitted. A magisterial summons for appearance does not require formal
                    transmission. It is addressed not to the police but to the defendant, and can be
                    served by an officer of any district; but, as until recently the proof of
                    service could only be given by the personal attendance of the serving officer at
                    the magistrate’s court, great expense was incurred in travelling to effect
                    service, and inconvenience in attending to prove it. This has been remedied in
                    most cases by allowing service to be proved by a declaration before a
                    magistrate.</p>
                <p>The transmission of process, declarations of service, payment of fees, and many
                    other incidents arising in apparently the most simple cases now involve constant
                    communication between police forces by whatever distance they may be
                    separated.</p>
                <p>A few lines must suffice on the general duties of the police force in relation to
                    a variety of other matters. Some of these are closely connected with crime,
                    others with municipal regulations only. The police, as having all the duties of
                    constables, act as coroner’s officers; they make minute inquiries as to
                    suicides, accidents of every kind, insane persons and their apprehension, and
                    deal with destitute persons and persons seized with sudden illness in the
                    streets, and with vagrants.</p>
                <p>In populous districts the adjustment of street traffic, of securing the comfort
                    as well as safety of persons in passing to and fro, whether on foot or
                    otherwise, forms a very important branch of the constable’s duty. This may be
                    and often is effected by the mere presence of the constable passing on his round
                    without greater exercise of his authority than a request to persons to move or
                    to wait at crossings. Unless in crowded parts, this highway branch of duty may
                    consist in preventing riding and driving furiously, or on footpaths. The general
                    or local laws of each district give ample scope for the exercise of the police
                    constable’s authority and the performance of his duties in such matters,
                    including obstructions of all kinds.</p>
                <p>In the metropolitan police district the commissioner has large powers, including
                    the power to prescribe special limits in the metropolis within which some acts
                    affecting the general ease and freedom of the public are forbidden which are
                    innocent elsewhere.</p>
                <p>On the police almost invariably devolve the licensing of public carriages and the
                    enforcement of the great variety of regulations respecting them. In the
                    metropolitan police district the licensing of public carriages is vested in the
                    secretary of state, who makes numerous regulations respecting the carriages and
                    their drivers and proprietors, and gives (under power vested in him by the
                    legislature for that purpose) the administration of this important branch of the
                    law to the commissioner of police. Elsewhere in England and Wales the
                    administration of the law in relation to hackney carriages is in the hands of
                    local authorities. The police have charge of the maintenance of good order in
                    houses and places licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquors, including
                    inquiries and notice as to all kinds of licences, renewals, and transfers, and
                    of course involving the conduct of numerous persons, not only of the licensed
                    persons and those in their service, but of persons frequenting their houses, not
                    excepting the members of the police force.</p>
                <p>The laws and regulations for common lodging-houses in the metropolis are under
                    the police. Other traders exercise their constant vigilance, including
                    pawnbrokers, marine-store dealers, pedlars, and chimney-sweepers.</p>
                <p>Among almost an infinity of offences may be enumerated those involving cruelty to
                    animals, prize fights so called, and all descriptions of unlawful brawls
                    (including brawling in places of public worship), gaming, gambling, and betting,
                    lotteries, disorderly houses, dangerous performances, the infraction of fence
                    months and seasons for birds and fish, the fraudulent removal of goods,
                    violations of cattle plague orders (which the police are expressly required to
                    observe and enforce, involving of late years most arduous duties), and the sale
                    of unwholesome food and of poisons. The police have also to deal with the care
                    and keeping of explosive substances, animals straying, and dogs reasonably
                    suspected to be mad or not under proper care.</p>
                <p>Some public offences, such as the use of inaccurate weights, adulteration of
                    articles of food, &amp;c., are generally dealt with by inspectors and other
                    special officers, although it is undoubtedly the duty of the police to aid in
                    enforcing the law, and to report to the proper quarter offences coming to their
                    knowledge. In the metropolis, smoke nuisances are dealt with as police
                    offences.</p>
                <p>The police aid the inland revenue in a variety of ways, and, although it is
                    generally undesirable for the police to take part in the collection or
                    enforcement of taxation, they are required in the metropolitan district, by
                    order of the secretary of state, to enforce as far as lies in their power the
                    payment of the dog tax, their other duties giving them greater knowledge on the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>In visiting places of amusement the police are often performing duties of a
                    multifarious character. In general the one object is the maintenance of good
                    order, but sometimes the observation extends to the character of the amusement
                    and the infringement of licences.</p>
                <p>Apart from the special duties as to the restoration of property left or lost in
                    public carriages, or with reference to prisoners’ property, for which there are
                    special provisions, the police exercise a reasonable rather than a specially
                    assigned duty in facilitating the recovery of lost and stray property by the
                    rightful owners.</p>
                <p>A very few words must suffice for notice of a subject which has been a vexed
                    question before as well as since the establishment of a police force in the
                    country, and down to the present moment— the action of'police powers as to
                    street prostitutes. Practically this action has nearly the same limits
                    throughout England and Wales. In the metropolitan police district and in the
                    City of London it is an offence for a common prostitute or night-walker to <pb

                    of prostitution or solicitation to the annoyance of the inhabitants or
                    passengers. Elsewhere the offence is in much the same terms included in the
                    Police of Towns’ Clauses’ Act, 1847, and is so applied to all urban authorities
                    under the Public Health Act, 1875.. In the practical application of the law it
                    is generally considered that there must be some evidence of a personal annoyance
                    by and to one or more persons to justify a conviction.</p>
                <p>The preceding survey of some of the multifarious functions of a police force
                    affords an illustration of Bentham’s classification of the business of police
                    into distinct branches :—police for the prevention of offences; police for the
                    prevention of calamities; police for the prevention of endemic diseases; police
                    of charity; police of interior communications; police of public amusements;
                    police for recent intelligence and information. No attempt, however, is made in
                    the present article to follow such classification. It would lead the reader
                    astray, where the object is to treat principally of the police force.</p>
                <p>As to the defined area of police action, for general purposes the legal rights
                    and powers of a police force (subject to the observations already made) are
                    coextensive with the police district. In the metropolitan police district the
                    members of the force have the powers of constables in the adjoining counties (10
                    Geo. IV. c. 44, § 4; 2 &lt;fc 3 Vict. c. 47, § 5).</p>
                <p>The determination of the geographical area of a police district is necessarily
                    governed by a variety of circumstances. Physical features have sometimes to be
                    taken into account as affecting the demarcations of intercourse, more frequently
                    the occupations of the people and the amount of the population. A district may
                    be too confined or too large for police purposes. The limited ideas of
                    simple-minded rustics of a former generation whose views of complete
                    independence consisted in inhabiting two adjacent rooms in different parishes,
                    so as to effectually baffle the visits of parochial officers, is probably a
                    notion of the past; but obstructions of a like kind may arise from too narrow
                    boundaries. On the other hand dense populations or long-accustomed limits may
                    outweigh convenience arising from a wide area.</p>
                <p>In any case the making of altogether new boundaries merely for police purposes is
                    very undesirable. The county, or divisions of a county or city, or the
                    combination of parishes, ought to be and are sufficient for determining the
                    boundaries of a police district. A boundary, moreover, that does not admit of
                    ready application for rating is impracticable.</p>
                <p>In England, Wales, and Scotland, with the exception of the metropolitan police
                    district and the area of the City of London (geographically included within but
                    distinct from it in police government), the police districts are for the most
                    part identical in area with the counties. Large towns have police forces
                    distinct from the county force surrounding them. There are 290 police forces in
                    the island,—a number liable to frequent variation, as separate forces are
                    created or existing forces are combined, for which powers exist</p>
                <p>By far the largest and most important force, as regards the character of both
                    area and numbers, is that of the metropolitan police district, comprising 20
                    divisions. The total number of the police (including of course the county
                    constabulary) for England and Wales for the year ending 29th September 1883 was
                    34,488, an increase on the previous year of 1315. During the last decade the
                    increase in the total number of the police, allowing for the augmented
                    population, is trifling.</p>
                <p>The following are the numbers composing the different forces in 1882-83</p>

                <p>The total gives one constable for every 774 of the population, according to the
                    census of 1881. In boroughs, &amp;c., there is 1 for every 758; in counties 1
                    for 1231; in the metropolitan police district (deducting 807, the number
                    employed in royal dockyards, and 446 paid for by public companies and private
                    individuals) 1 for every 413; and in the City of London 1 for every 57 of the
                    City population, as enumerated on the night of the census of 1881. The total
                    number, exclusive of the commissioner and assistant commissioners, belonging to
                    the metropolitan police force on the 1st January 1884 was 12,404,—comprising
                    10,741 constables, 1028 sergeants, 608 inspectors, 24 divisional
                    superintendents, 1 chief superintendent (of the criminal investigation
                    department), and 2 district superintendents.</p>
                <p>The strength of the police force in proportion to population varies considerably
                    in each county of Scotland, ranging for the year ended 15th March 1884 from 1 in
                    731 in Selkirk to 1 in 2438 in Banff. In burghs it varies from 1 in 532 in
                    Edinburgh and 1 in 535 in Glasgow to only 1 in upwards of 1500 of the population
                    in the smallest burghs.</p>
                <p>The strength of the royal Irish constabulary on the 1st July 1882, the
                    geographical area of which comprises all Ireland, consisted of 258 officers and
                    13,750 men, and it was subsequently increased to 14,601 of all ranks.</p>
                <p>The equal distribution of the force throughout a district— not a uniform
                    distribution either as to area or population, but equal in accordance with
                    wants—is one of the greatest difficulties in the administration of a police
                    force. It is not merely that recruits must be sought for to keep pace with
                    increase or variations of population, but daily and hourly events necessitate
                    daily and hourly changes of distribution. The duty is not merely to draw off men
                    from adjacent divisions to the spot for a few hours, where they can be best
                    spared, but to fill places where required. It must be remembered that extra work
                    by day incapacitates men for the night watch, and it takes days to restore the
                    equilibrium. It is needless to say that, although the services of the police
                    force may not be required to aid in the extinction of a fire, their presence is
                    required in great numbers to preserve order; and thus men are necessarily kept
                    on duty beyond their prescribed hours. Nor, in many of these cases, whether
                    foreseen or unforeseen, is the distribution of the force self-adjusting. Let all
                    do what they may in aid through all ranks of the force, inequalities must occur;
                    and before the gaps are made up a fresh displacement occurs. Much may be done
                    and is done by a system of reserves, and by averaging the yearly extra calls on
                    the time of a force; but after all there is no perfect equality. The peacefully
                    slumbering citizen may be startled by the announcement that, although the force
                    of the metropolitan police district has been under anxious management for
                    upwards of half a century, on no two nights since its formation have the beats
                    been patrolled to precisely the same extent.</p>
                <p>The police system of necessity involves the existence in a district of police
                    stations or lock-ups, for the temporary detention of prisoners; and magistrates
                    have generally the power to remand prisoners to these for short periods. Power
                    to make police stations occasional courts of summary jurisdiction has been
                    recently conferred on county magistrates. A police power of admitting arrested
                    persons to bail in petty cases, with a corresponding duty to exercise the power,
                    is vested in the police in authority at stations. This power has existed
                    throughout the metropolitan police district from the first establishment of the
                    police on its present footing, and also in the City of London and in many
                    populous places under local Acts; and the principle has been recently extended
                    to the country.</p>
                <p>The selection of persons for the force is a matter subject to general as well as
                    special regulations, varying in each district according to circumstances of
                    place and time. Testimonials as to character and antecedents should be and are
                    in practice always required. For health a medical examination is enforced; as to
                    general education, reading and writing are usually required; special education
                    for police duties is necessarily unattainable before entry, but in the
                    metropolitan police force of England approved <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n352/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0352-0337"/> candidates are admitted on probation, and
                    drilled. When finally approved of, on admission to the force they make a
                    declaration, as already stated, to duly serve.</p>
                <p>Discipline is enforced by dismissal, reprimand, fines, removal to another
                    division, or degradation in rank. Violation or neglect of duty may be punished
                    by summary conviction.</p>
                <p>For the detection of crime and offences it is obviously necessary that some
                    members of the force should perform their duties out of uniform. Some are
                    constantly employed as detectives, others doff their official dress on
                    emergencies. In the English metropolis the detective officers form a distinct
                    branch of the police service, called the criminal investigation department. One
                    of the assistant commissioners of the metropolitan police attends specially to
                    this department, to which a chief superintendent and a separate staff of
                    inspectors and sergeants are attached, having an office in Scotland Yard, with
                    officers of the department placed in the divisions of the district. The
                    qualifications of the principal officers are special, and they are selected for
                    their aptitude, knowledge of foreign languages, and a variety of circumstances
                    rendering the application of the ordinary routine of training undesirable and
                    impracticable. Constables and sergeants of the department are selected from the
                    general body of the force. Officers of the detective department of the
                    metropolis in the performance of their various duties travel all over the globe,
                    to foreign states as well as to the colonies. The number of detective officers
                    in England and Wales for 1882-83 was 551.</p>
                <p>The chiefs of the metropolitan police force are the commissioner and three
                    assistant commissioners, one acting in place of a director of criminal
                    investigations, who has recently retired. A legal adviser to the commissioners
                    is appointed by the secretary of state. Besides the divisional superintendents,
                    there are now two district superintendents, who visit the whole of the
                    divisions. All promotions in the service up to the rank of superintendent are
                    made from the next rank below. When vacancies occur the rule is to recommend to
                    the commissioner those best qualified in all respects, seniority of service
                    being duly considered; but an educational examination by the civil service
                    commissioners is requisite. A different standard and subject of examination is
                    provided for each rank :— (1) constables for sergeants; (2) sergeants for
                    inspectors; (3) inspectors for superintendents.</p>
                <p>Orders having the approval of the secretary of state for the government of the
                    police of the metropolis in a variety of matters are printed and issued daily
                    throughout the district. The majority of these orders relate to incidents and
                    contingencies of the passing hour, and affect particular divisions; others are
                    of a permanent character and require attention throughout the district. Such
                    orders form the practice of the police in almost all matters of detail either
                    not specifically regulated by Act of Parliament or requiring explanation and
                    elucidation; and, if they are carefully considered and prepared, their issue
                    must produce a uniform code of police procedure for the force.</p>
                <p>The cost of a police system is defrayed from a fund formed by local rates or by
                    imperial funds, or both, and in part by the appropriation of fines and the fees
                    payable by law in respect of the performance of individual duties, but not
                    permitted to be retained by the performer. This fund is collected and expended
                    through the medium of a receiver, treasurer, or other officer, and a staff of
                    clerks, with the aid of the superintendents, inspectors, and police officers.
                    The regulation and amount of the salaries (which are generally paid weekly or
                    monthly according to the class), depend of course on local and other
                    circumstances, but do not vary frequently. Where agriculture is the general
                    occupation the pay of members of the force is low. Where mining and manufactures
                    compete with agriculture it is higher; where they are the principal business
                    they create a demand for labour which raises the salary of the constable as well
                    as those of other workers. The pay of the constables of the metropolitan
                    district varies from &lt;£62, Ils. 6d. to &lt;£83, 8s. 7d. per annum, that of
                    the sergeants from £88, 12s. lid. to £146, of the inspectors from £88, 12s. lid.
                    to £351, 19s. 4d. The metropolitan police constable is subject to deductions for
                    pension, and he contributes on the average about 2d. a week to gratuities for
                    the widows or orphans of comrades who have recently died, and is under a rent of
                    about 3s. 6d. if single and living out of the section house, and about 6s. 6d. a
                    week if married. Analogous conditions exist in all the great city forces. The
                    Liverpool constable begins with 26s. 8d. a week; 8d. a week is deducted at
                    first, and 10d. after a short period, towards pension fund; an average of 4s. a
                    week is spent on the lodgings of a single, and from 5s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. on those
                    of a married man. Model scales of pay which were suggested by the secretary of
                    state in 1879 have been adopted by several county forces in Scotland, but not in
                    burghs.</p>
                <p>In addition to fixed salaries, the police system generally provides for rewards
                    for extraordinary diligence and gratuities out of the police fund. Gifts or
                    payments to individual officers by private persons ought to be controlled in a
                    well-regulated system, where good conduct and vigilance ought to be closely
                    watched to ensure promotion in due time. Specially meritorious acts, however,
                    are sometimes admitted for pecuniary recognition by magistrates, or
                    representative bodies. In England the police are not now permitted to
                    participate in Government or other rewards for the discovery of crime. Provision
                    is almost invariably made for pensions by a fund formed by a scale of deductions
                    from pay, as already stated, and to some extent by fines. The general subject of
                    superannuation is, however, too large to be entered upon here. For the ordinary
                    services of the police within their local jurisdiction no charge should fall on
                    particular persons who happen to derive special advantage from such police duty.
                    It is a general benefit for which in one form or another the inhabitants are
                    taxed.</p>
                <p>Other incidental expenditure in the performance of duties is met in various ways.
                    The heavy cost connected with the conveyance of prisoners to and from prison on
                    committal and remand is in England, except in Middlesex, borne by the state,
                    being paid by the prison commissioners. The preliminary cost attending the
                    arrest in the first instance is generally borne by the police fund. In some
                    exceptional cases where the police perform special duties beyond their district,
                    the cost is thrown on individuals putting the law in motion. Thus the costs
                    incurred under extradition treaties and under the Fugitive Offenders’ Act in
                    following criminals and bringing them back within the jurisdiction for trial
                    where the offence was committed or arose are not expressly provided for by
                    statute; but the regulations laid down by the secretary of state require all
                    costs to be paid by applicants in the case of fugitive offenders.</p>
                <p>The police have special powers in furtherance of their duties; even the exemption
                    from toll (not now of general value) has that aspect. They are not only exempted
                    but disqualified from various local offices as interfering with the time and
                    attention required for the full performance of their duties. Rules of the
                    service generally forbid constables following any trade or occupation of profit
                    even when not on actual duty, and in the metropolitan police district of London
                    this disqualification extends in practice to their wives. The police are
                    protected in the discharge of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0353-0338"/> their duties in a variety of ways. Assaulting,
                    resisting, or wilfully obstructing a peace officer in the due execution of his
                    duty or any person acting in aid of such officer, and assaults with intent to
                    resist or prevent lawful apprehension or detainer, are punishable summarily as
                    well as upon indictment. Refusing to assist a constable in the execution of his
                    duty in order to preserve the peace is an indictable misdemeanour at common law.
                    The law specially provides for offences by the police in stealing or embezzling
                    property entrusted to them in virtue of their employment (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c.
                    96, §§ 69, 70).</p>
                <p>Wearing a distinctive dress or uniform in the general performance of duty is a
                    matter of the highest importance. It commands and has a very great effect in
                    producing obedience and conformity to law and order, and in preventing violence,
                    without the use of even a word or threat; and it has a scarcely less important
                    effect in protecting the public from the illegal or irregular action of the
                    police when on duty, when the dress involves, as it ordinarily does, the
                    exhibition on its exterior of a letter and number.</p>
                <p>The extent to which the individual members of a police force are allowed or
                    required to be armed when on duty for the enforcement of the law or for their
                    own protection from violence is a matter of important discretion; for, although
                    the principles of law, entailing or withholding the right of peace officers or
                    private persons to employ weapons of offence, are comparatively well-defined,
                    the emergency depends on a variety of circumstances on which it is extremely
                    difficult for heads of forces to make regulations for the guidance of the men.
                    In general the only weapon carried about the person of a police constable is the
                    familiar wooden staff of office of the peace officer, and that not in the hands
                    openly, but in a sheath at his side and only drawn when required.</p>
                <p>The cost of the police in England and Wales for the year ending 29th September

                    horses, harness, forage, buildings, station-house charges, printing, stationery,
                    and other miscellaneous charges was &lt;£3,367,678, a net increase of £107,598
                    as compared with the previous year. The cost of the separate forces for the year
                    and the amounts contributed from the public revenue stand thus :—</p>

                <p>Deducting the City of London police, towards which no contribution is paid from
                    the public revenue, the proportion of the amount so contributed was 39'5. But if
                    the total charge for the metropolitan police is reduced by £131,560 received
                    from public departments for special services rendered by the police, the
                    proportion contributed from the public revenue, computed upon £1,185,743, was
                    42'8 per cent. All moneys received for the service of the metropolitan police
                    between 1st April 1883 and the 31st March 1884 amounted to £1,469,930, 4s. 5d.
                    Of this total the sum of £639,751, 7s. 4d. was derived from the metropolitan
                    police rate, and £510,933 as the contribution from moneys voted by parliament of
                    4d. per £1 upon £30,663,903, the assessed rental of property in the metropolitan
                    police district. The pay, clothing, and equipments of the force from constables
                    to superintendents was £1,024,587, 13s. 9d.</p>
                <p>In concluding this general account of the existing police system, it is well to
                    mention that the old system of parish constables no longer exists as a general
                    institution. As an auxiliary force, although not forming part of the
                    establishment of a police system, special constables form an important resource
                    in the preservation of the peace (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Constable).</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Introduction of the British Police System.</hi> —It
                    is a self-evident proposition that the duties of watch and ward, whether under
                    the Statute of Winchester or otherwise (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Constable),</hi> demanded greater attention in populous places than in
                    scattered hamlets. Nevertheless the inefficiency of the arrangements was
                    notorious from an early period, and is well illustrated by the “charge” of a
                    Dogberry and the graver complaints of Lord Burleigh of the dulness of
                    constables. In relation to London alone its state down to 1828 forms a subject
                    not without general interest (see <hi rend="smallcaps">London).</hi> Here it
                    must suffice to say that committees of the House of Commons in 1772, 1793, 1812,
                    1817, 1818, and 1822 produced facts tending to the formation, but with
                    hesitation, of a police establishment. To Dr Colquhoun, a magistrate, the chief
                    merit is due of having, before the close of the 18th century, in a treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Police of the Metropolis,</hi> drawn attention to the
                    subject. He pointed out that police in England may be considered as a new
                    science, the properties of which consist, not in the judicial powers which lead
                    to punishment, and which belong to magistrates alone, but in the prevention and
                    detection of crimes, and in those other functions which relate to internal
                    regulations for the well-ordering and comfort of civil society. His work went
                    through several editions in a very brief period. It was not, however, until 1828
                    that a committee of the House of Commons, appointed at the instance of Mr
                    (afterwards Sir Robert) Peel, the home secretary, to inquire into the cause of
                    the increase in the number of commitments and convictions in London and
                    Middlesex, and into the state of the police of the metropolis and of the
                    districts adjoining, reported that a decisive change should be made, and an
                    efficient system of police instituted for the adequate protection of property,
                    and for the prevention and detection of crime in the metropolis. In the
                    following year the famous Act for improving the police in and near the
                    metropolis was passed (10 Geo. IV. c. 44).</p>
                <p>The Act constituted a police district, excluding the City of London, with a
                    radius of 12 miles. Two persons were constituted justices of the peace
                    (afterwards called commissioners of police) to administer the Act under the
                    immediate direction of a secretary of state, and having a police office in
                    Westminster. This office, established in a room with a table and two chairs, in
                    an outlet from Whitehall, is the origin (as regards police associations) of the
                    far-famed “Scotland Yard,” with its now enlarged staff, but still inadequate
                    structural arrangements. A sufficient number of “able men” (at first about 3000)
                    constituted the force to whom were given, when sworn in, the common law powers,
                    privileges, and duties of constables for preserving the peace and preventing
                    robberies and other felonies, and apprehending offenders against the peace, with
                    the duty to obey the lawful commands of the commissioners. The district was
                    formed into divisions and sections, and ranks established on the same general
                    system as at present exists. A fund was created principally by rates on the
                    district for the maintenance of the force, with rewards for extraordinary
                    diligence and compensation for injuries.</p>
                <p>As might have been anticipated, the introduction of the new system of police
                    attracted great public attention. At <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0354-0339"/> this distance of time, with the experience of an
                    intervening half century, it is difficult to believe that the change by which
                    the police system became in a few years as much a necessity of towns as their
                    public lighting (and lighting and watching were of much the same age and
                    character, and were frequently coupled in legislation) was regarded otherwise
                    than with the approval of well-regulated minds. It substituted the vigorous
                    action of a really responsible and well-regulated body, acting in an enlarged
                    area, and independently of parochial authorities, for the partial and lax action
                    of a variety of ill-governed and inadequate bodies. Legitimate but passing
                    regrets might be natural as the introduction of vicarious action superseded the
                    necessity for self help and responsibility. No poet could thereafter compose, as
                    a sally of fancy, the adventures of a London citizen between Cheapside and
                    Edmonton mounted on a runaway horse with associated gentlemen galloping after a
                    presumed horsestealer. To arrest the horse, whether a runaway or stolen, only a
                    blue-coated policeman would thenceforward be seen on the track. The objections
                    raised to the new police were of a more serious although scarcely of a more
                    substantial kind. The assumption that a good police could only be attained at
                    the expense of liberty, and that it necessarily involved some arbitrary
                    principle opposed to the free constitution of the country, had been countenanced
                    even by the report of the committee of 1822, in which it was remarked that it
                    was difficult to reconcile an effective system of police with that perfect
                    freedom of action and exemption from interference which are the great privileges
                    and blessings of society in the country. With such sedate misgivings, it is not
                    to be wondered at, when the system was actually introduced a few years later,
                    that cries arose in the streets of “down with the new police,” and that the
                    constables were frequently followed by hooting crowds calling them obnoxious
                    names. By associating them with the statesman who introduced the measure, and
                    calling them “Peelers” and “Bobbies,” names perpetuated to the present day and
                    apparently likely to last, a compliment was really paid to the minister and to
                    the force. But at that time Peel was attacked in parliament and suspicion thrown
                    on the Act because the same minister had introduced Roman Catholic
                    emancipation.</p>
                <p>Within four years of the establishment of the police force the hostility seems to
                    have culminated. It was evinced by the result of a collision between the police
                    and a meeting of Chartists in Coldbath Fields in May 1833, in which three police
                    officers were stabbed and one killed with a dagger. At the inquest the coroner’s
                    jury returned a verdict of “justifiable homicide,” in the teeth of the evidence.
                    The crown thereupon adopted the strong but justifiable course of applying to the
                    Court of King’s Bench, and the inquisition was quashed. Committees were
                    appointed by the House of Commons to inquire into the circumstances of the
                    meeting, and also regarding an allegation of inhabitants of the Surrey side that
                    policemen were employed as spies, and a third committee was appointed to inquire
                    into the state of the police and crime in the district. The police system and
                    the force as a whole came out with credit, notwithstanding individual instances
                    of undue exercise of power calling for greater control.</p>
                <p>There was no hesitation as to the duty of maintaining the principle of the new
                    system, and the popular hostility gradually died away. After intermediate
                    parliamentary reports and legislation by way of extension, an important Act was
                    passed in 1839, reciting that the system of police established had been found
                    very efficient and might be yet further improved (2 &amp; 3 Vict. c. 47). The
                    metropolitan police district was extended to 15 miles from Charing Cross. The
                    whole of the River Thames (which had been in its course through London, so far
                    as related to police matters, managed under distinct Acts) was brought within
                    it, and the collateral but not exclusive powers of the metropolitan police were
                    extended to the royal palaces and 10 miles around, and to the counties adjacent
                    to the district. Various summary powers for dealing with street and other
                    offences were conferred.</p>
                <p>At the same time that the police were put on a more complete footing and the area
                    enlarged, provision was made for the more effectual administration of justice by
                    the magistrates of the metropolis (2 &amp; 3 Vict. c. 71). The changes that
                    occurred in magisterial functions are scarcely less remarkable than the
                    transition from the parish constable to the organized police. The misdirected
                    activity of the civil magistrate in the 17th century is illustrated by the
                    familiar literature of Butler, Bunyan, and others. The zeal of that age was
                    succeeded by apathetic reaction, and it became necessary in the metropolis to
                    secure the services of paid justices. The malpractices of the so-called “trading
                    justices” of the 18th century are described and exposed for all time by
                    Fielding, who honourably performed the duties of justice of the peace for
                    Middlesex and Westminster. At the beginning of the 19th century outside of the
                    City of London (where magisterial duties were, as now, performed by the lord
                    mayor and aidermen) there were various public offices besides the Bow Street and
                    the Thames police offices, where magistrates attended. To the Bow Street office
                    was subsequently attached the “horse patrol,” and each of the police offices had
                    a fixed number of constables attached to it, and the Thames police had an
                    establishment of constables and surveyors. The horse patrol was in 1836, as
                    previously intended, placed under the new police. It became desirable that the
                    horse patrol and constables allotted to the several police offices not
                    interfered with by the Act of 1828 should be incorporated with the metropolitan
                    police force. This was effected, and thus magisterial functions were completely
                    separated from the duties of the executive police; for, although the
                    jurisdiction of the two justices, afterwards called commissioners, as
                    magistrates extended to ordinary duties (except at courts of general or quarter
                    sessions), from the first they did not take any part in the examination or
                    committal for trial of persons charged with offences. No persons were brought
                    before them. Their functions were in practice confined to the discipline of the
                    force and the prevention and detection of offences, by having persons arrested
                    or summoned to be dealt with by the ordinary magistrates whose courts were not
                    interfered with.</p>
                <p>Important alterations have been made since 1839 in the arrangements affecting the
                    metropolitan police. In 1856 one commissioner and two assistant commissioners
                    were substituted for two commissioners, and a third assistant commissioner has
                    now (1884) been added. In 1866 jurisdiction was given to the metropolitan police
                    in the royal naval dock yards and principal military stations of the war
                    department in England and Wales, and within 15 miles, with the restriction that
                    the powers and privileges of the constables of the metropolitan police when
                    without the yards, naval and marine hospitals and infirmaries, and marine
                    barracks or stations, and not on board or in any ship, vessel, or boat belonging
                    to the queen or in her service, shall only be used in respect of the property of
                    the crown or of persons subject to naval or marine or military discipline (23
                    &amp; 24 Vict. c. 135).</p>
                <p>Under this Act the metropolitan police exercise jurisdiction and perform duties
                    extending from Chatham on the east and Dover and Portsmouth on the south to
                    Devonport, Portsmouth, and Pembroke on the west, and of course including
                    Aidershot. The expenses incurred are defrayed by parliament.</p>

                <p>Connected with the last-mentioned Act, and in consequence of it, has been the
                    exercise for eighteen years by the metropolitan police of the powers of the
                    Contagious Diseases Act, 1866, and the medical examination of women under it,—a
                    much debated and warmly contested power. The refusal in 1883 by the House of
                    Commons to provide money for the expenses of the Act led to the discontinuance
                    of action by the metropolitan police under it.</p>
                <p>The Metropolitan Streets Act, 1867, for regulating the traffic in the metropolis,
                    and for making provision for the greater security of persons passing through the
                    streets and for other purposes, gives great discretionary power to the
                    commissioner of police whether of the metropolis or of the City of London, in
                    relation to prescribing special limits, with the approval of a secretary of
                    state, within which regulations to prevent obstructions in the streets (without
                    interfering with other powers) may be made and enforced. Apart from the special
                    limits, general regulations are prescribed as to hackney carriages, stray dogs,
                    and various other matters.</p>
                <p>As already observed, the Acts noticed as to the metropolitan police district did
                    not apply to the City of London, which was and is left as an island surrounded
                    by the metropolis. The nightly watch and “bedels” within the City were
                    regulated, and rates imposed for the purpose, in the reign of George II. In
                    1839, on the same day that the Act of Parliament passed with respect to the
                    metropolitan police, a corresponding Act was passed for the City of London and a
                    salaried commissioner of the police for the City and its liberties appointed by
                    the common council. The power to make regulations relative to the general
                    government of the police is vested in the commissioner, subject to the
                    approbation of the mayor and aidermen and a secretary of state. In case of
                    emergency the secretary of state may, at the request of the lord mayor,
                    authorize the metropolitan police to act within the City of London under the
                    command of their own officers, and on the other hand the lord mayor may, at the
                    request of the secretary of state, in the like emergency, authorize the City
                    police to act under their own officers within the metropolitan police district.
                    The Act gives various special powers as to offences corresponding with the
                    Metropolitan Police Act of 1839. It provides for a police rate, and the
                    corporation is required to pay out of its revenues a fourth part of the expenses
                    of the police force. No rated person is liable to any watch or ward by virtue of
                    the Statute of Winchester (13 Edw. I.), and the ancient custom of electing ward
                    constables is suspended.</p>
                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">London</hi> (vol. xiii. p. 834) some
                    statistics are given as to the police courts of the metropolis, and the state of
                    crime and the proportion of police to the population under the last census.</p>
                <p>In considering the introduction of the police system into the rest of England, it
                    is to be borne in mind that in many towns and places an organized system of
                    watching by paid officers, whether constables, watchmen, or police, was
                    established by local Acts of Parliament, at various dates, but especially in the
                    early part of the present century.</p>
                <p>An attempt at a paid county force was made in 1829 (in the same year with the
                    Metropolitan Police Act), but not on corresponding lines, by a local Act to
                    enable the magistrates of the county palatine of Chester to appoint special high
                    constables and assistant petty constables (10 Geo. IV. c. 97). In 1830, and
                    again three years later, provision was made to facilitate voluntary lighting and
                    watching parishes throughout England and Wales. In 1835 the regulation of
                    municipal corporations included power (since renewed) to appoint, by a watch
                    committee, constables called “watchmen” paid by a watch rate.</p>
                <p>Great facilities having been given by the legislature for the appointment of
                    special constables (an auxiliary elsewhere noticed), provision was made in 1839
                    for the appointment of county paid constables where the ordinary officers for
                    preserving the peace were insufficient for that purpose and for the protection
                    of the inhabitants and for the security of property within the county. The
                    number recommended (not exceeding one man for every thousand of the inhabitants,
                    after deducting corporate boroughs already provided for, a restriction in after
                    years removed from the statute book) and the rates of payment were required to
                    be reported to the secretary of state, who made and laid before parliament rules
                    for the government, pay, clothing, accoutrements, and necessaries of such
                    constables; and thereupon the justices appointed, subject to the approval of the
                    secretary of state, a chief constable, who had the appointment, control, and
                    disposition (subject to the approval of the justices) of the other constables,
                    and a deputy and superintendent to be at the head of the constables in each
                    division of the county. On these constables were conferred all the powers and
                    duties of constables by the common law or statute.</p>
                <p>At first the salaries and allowances and expenses of the Act were paid out of the
                    county rate (2 &amp; 3 Vict. c. 93), but in the following year (1840) the Act
                    was amended and extended, and a separate police rate levied in the county.
                    Provision was at the same time made for a superannuation fund and for “station
                    houses and strong rooms,” and for consolidating the police of a borough with the
                    county; and on the other hand, as the number of constables needed may be
                    different in different parts of the same county, it might be divided into police
                    districts, each district paying for its own constables. Power is given to the
                    chief constable to appoint (with the approval of the justices) additional
                    constables at the cost of individuals, but subject to the orders of the chief
                    constable.</p>
                <p>In 1842 an important statute was passed enacting that for the future no
                    appointment of a petty constable, headborough, borsholder, tithing man, or peace
                    officer of the like description should be made for any parish at any court leet,
                    except for purposes unconnected with the preservation of the peace, and
                    providing, as a means of increasing the security of persons and property, for
                    the appointment by justices of the peace in divisional petty sessions of fit
                    persons or their substitutes to act as constables in the several parishes of
                    England, and giving vestries an optional power of providing paid constables. The
                    justices in quarter sessions were empowered to provide lock-up houses for the
                    confinement of persons taken into custody by any constable and not yet committed
                    for trial, or in execution of any sentence, or instead to appropriate for that
                    purpose existing lock-up houses, strong rooms, or cages belonging to any parish
                    (5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 109). Constables appointed under this Act were made subject
                    to the authority of the chief constable or superintendent, if any, appointed
                    under the Act of 1839.</p>
                <p>Under the Acts of 1839 and 1840 the establishment of a paid county police force
                    was optional with the justices. After a further interval of fifteen years it was
                    found expedient, for the more effectual prevention and detection of crime,
                    suppression of vagrancy, and maintenance of good order, that further provision
                    should be made for securing an efficient police force throughout England and
                    Wales, and the previous optional power became compulsory (the Police Act, 1856).
                    In every county in which a constabulary had not been already established under
                    the previous Acts for the whole of the county, the justices in quarter sessions
                    were required to proceed to establish a sufficient police force for the whole of
                    the county and to consolidate divisions so as to form one general county <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n356/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0356-0341"/> police establishment,—subject, however, to the
                    power by the queen in council to require the justices to form separate police
                    districts, as provided for in the earlier Acts. The privy council might arrange
                    terms of consolidation of a borough police with the county.</p>
                <p>In 1869 provision was made for the abolition of the old office of high constable
                    (the High Constables Act, 1869); and, the establishment of an efficient police
                    having also rendered the general appointment of parish constables unnecessary,
                    the appointment ceased, subject to the appointment by vestries of paid
                    constables who are subject to the chief constable of the county (the Parish
                    Constables Act, 1872). Thus under combined provisions the police system was
                    established and has since continued throughout England.</p>
                <p>In Scotland legislation for a system of police began early in the century by
                    local Acts for Edinburgh and Glasgow, some containing provisions of great
                    importance. The police of towns and populous places is now regulated chiefly by
                    the General Police and Improvement (Scotland) Act, 1862, and the county police
                    by an Act of 1857 (20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. 72), under which counties are formed
                    into police districts. Some details of the government, numbers, and cost have
                    been already given.</p>
                <p>The police in Ireland comprises two forces,—the Dublin metropolitan police and
                    the royal Irish constabulary. Dublin was in 1808 formed into a district called
                    “the police district of Dublin metropolis” (48 Geo. III. c. 140). After
                    intermediate amendments in 1836, concurrently with the consolidation of police
                    law for Ireland generally, the Dublin system was placed on the lines of Sir
                    Robert Peel’s Act of 1829 for the metropolis of London,—the chief secretary of
                    the lord lieutenant standing in the place of the secretary of state for the home
                    department (6 &amp; 7 Will. IV. c. 29); and six years later the systems were
                    further assimilated (5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 22). Several alterations were made
                    subsequently, and police courts regulated. The Dublin police is under the
                    immediate direction of one commissioner and an assistant commissioner and the
                    offices of receiver and secretary are consolidated. The royal Irish constabulary
                    dates from 1836, when the laws relating to the constabulary force in Ireland
                    were consolidated and a number of older Acts repealed (6 &amp; 7 Will. IV. c.
                    13). This Act, although often amended, is the foundation of the existing police
                    system in counties, towns, and baronies throughout Ireland except in the Dublin
                    metropolitan district. An inspector general, resident in Dublin and having an
                    office there, and appointed by the lord lieutenant, has the general direction of
                    the constabulary, and with the approbation of the lord lieutenant frames rules
                    for their general government, classification, and distribution. In this way a
                    uniform administration of police law prevails throughout Ireland without
                    interfering with the Dublin metropolitan police. Under the inspector general
                    there are a deputy inspector general and assistant inspectors general. The Irish
                    constabulary is regarded as a semi-military force. Every man lives in barracks.
                    It does not interfere with the Dublin metropolitan police, but a reserve force
                    is established at a depot in Dublin. The strength and pay of the force have been
                    already noticed.</p>
                <p>Police forces have been formed in all the British colonies, including the
                    Dominion of Canada, mainly on the lines established in the mother country,
                    having for their basis of action the common law existing there.</p>
                <p>The early legislation for Sydney followed very closely the metropolitan police
                    Acts, and some of the existing Acts of the Australian colonies exhibit great
                    skill. Colonial forces generally are sworn to serve the queen, and an Act of the
                    colonial legislature of New South Wales in 1853 made provision for the
                    engagement in Great Britain of persons to serve in the police force of New South
                    Wales. The general features of the Australian police comprise a chief
                    commissioner or other head for each colony or district, appointed by the
                    governor in council, with various grades of officers as at home, some appointed
                    by the governor and the rest by the head of the police. The expense of the
                    police establishments is borne by the colonial revenue (5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 76, §
                    46; 13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. 59, § 23).</p>
                <p>Nearly the whole of British India is divided into police districts,’ the general
                    arrangements of the system of the regular police resembling in most respects
                    those of the English police, but differing in details in the different
                    presidencies. All are in uniform, trained to the use of firearms, and drilled,
                    and may be called upon to perform military duties. The superior officers are
                    nearly all Europeans, and many of them are military officers. The rest are
                    natives, in Bombay chiefly Mohammedans. The organization of the police was not
                    dealt with by the criminal code which came into force in 1883, but the code is
                    full of provisions tending to make the force efficient. By that code as well as
                    by the former code the police have a legal sanction for doing what by practice
                    they do in England: they take evidence for their own information and guidance in
                    the investigation of cases, and are clothed with the power to compel the
                    attendance of witnesses and question them. The smallness of the number of the
                    European magistrates and other circumstances make the police more important and
                    relatively far more powerful in India than in England (Stephen). The
                    difficulties in the way of ascertaining the truth, and investigating false
                    statements and suppressed cases, are very great.</p>
                <p>As regards the rural police of India every village headman, and the village
                    watchman as well as the village police officer, are required by the code to
                    communicate to the nearest magistrate or the officer in charge of the nearest
                    police station, whichever is nearest, any information respecting offenders.</p>
                <p>Reports indicating an increase in the number of dacoities and crimes of violence
                    since 1880, especially in Rajputana, Central India, and Hyderabad, are cited as
                    proving the necessity for a system of detective police embracing the whole of
                    India. A scheme for that purpose has been matured and will probably be carried
                    out.</p>
                <p>Taking Lower Bengal as an illustration of the existing system throughout India,
                    the superior ranks of the police comprise an inspector general, deputies,
                    district superintendents of different grades, assistant superintendents, and
                    probationers. The subordinate officers consist of inspectors of four grades,
                    sub-inspectors (who are in charge of police stations), head constables, and
                    constables. The total budget grant for the year 1881-82 (the last examined) for
                    the police department was 3,695,572 rupees, on a sanctioned strength of 78
                    superior officers, 3081 subordinate officers, and 14,588 constables, excluding
                    the municipal police but including the civil police and frontier police of the
                    Chittagong hill tracts and the railway police. The strength of the municipal
                    police was 371 officers and 5702 constables. The cost of the force employed on
                    purely police work was 2,154,600 rupees,—the cost per head of the total
                    population being 6 '2 pice. The proportion of police to population was in Bengal
                    proper 1 to 3933. The number of offences reported during the year was 104,153.
                    The percentage of reported cases not inquired into is under four.</p>
                <p>In India generally, including Assam and British Burmah, the total regular police
                    of all kinds in 1881 was 147,200. The cost was £2,324,786, of which £2,075,525
                    was payable from imperial or provincial revenues, and the remainder from other
                    sources. The rural police are not paid by the state, but by village cesses.</p>
                <p>In Bengal and the Punjab there are 14 policemen to every 100 square miles, and in
                    the North-Western Provinces and Oudh 27. The ratio of these figures is explained
                    partly by the greater density of population and partly by the frequency of
                    cripιe.</p>
                <p>The police force of the British empire, metropolitan, municipal, and rural
                    together, is about 210,000. Of this total, 51,000 are in the United Kingdom and
                    147,000 in India, the remainder being in the colonies and dependencies. If to
                    this total be added the number of village police in India who are legally
                    recognized, whose number is not less than 350,000, the grand total of the police
                    for the empire is 560,000. Thus we have for the whole empire an average of one
                    policeman to every 571 of the people and to every 16 square miles (Sir Richard
                    Temple).</p>
                <p>The United States of America have a system of police closely resembling that of
                    England, and founded similarly on Acts of the legislature combined with the
                    common law applicable to peace officers. Congress as well as the States
                    separately may establish police regulations, and it is to be observed that the
                    criminal law of England has been reproduced in various shapes in nearly all the
                    States. The source of revenue for the maintenance of the police is taxation of
                    real and personal property. Every State and every city in a State has its
                    separate special administration. For the purposes of this article New York must
                    suffice. The regulations of the police of Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and other
                    cities present the same general features.</p>
                <p>The police department of the city of New York consists of a “board of police”
                    composed of four “commissioners” (appointed by the mayor with the consent of the
                    board of aidermen) and the ‘ ‘ police force” and officers appointed by the
                    board. The board, consisting of the commissioners, is the head of the police
                    department, and governs and controls its business; it is invested with and
                    exercises all the powers conferred by law upon the police department, makes
                    appointments, and by rules and regulations through a superintendent prescribes
                    the general discipline of the department. The orders cannot, however, conflict
                    with the constitution of the United States nor with the constitution or laws of
                    the State of New York.</p>
                <p>The police force of the city comprises officers ranking as follows :—
                    superintendent of the whole force, four inspectors (the whole area of the city
                    being divided into four inspection districts, subdivided into precincts, with an
                    inspector to each), sergeants, and roundsmen, who are visiting officers,—the
                    body of the force being termed “patrol men,” with “overmen” at stations and
                    prisons.</p>
                <p>The force (clothed in uniform) is divided into as many companies as there are
                    precincts, and such other companies and “squads” as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n357/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0357-0342"/> the board may order. The superintendent is the
                    chief executive officer of the force, subject to the orders, rules, and
                    regulations of the board, and it is his duty to enforce in the city all the laws
                    of the State and ordinances of the city, and the rules and regulations of the
                    police board. The superintendent promulgates written or printed orders to the
                    officers and members of the police force not inconsistent with law or the rules
                    and regulations of the board. It is the duty of the police force at all times of
                    the day and night within the city and county of New York, and they are
                    accordingly empowered, to especially preserve the public peace; prevent crime;
                    detect and arrest offenders; suppress riots and insurrections; protect the
                    rights of persons and of property; guard the public health; preserve order at
                    every primary and. public election; remove nuisances existing in public streets,
                    roads, places, and highways; repress and restrain disorderly houses and houses
                    of ill-fame; arrest all street beggars and mendicants; provide a proper police
                    attendance at every fire in order that the firemen, fire-engines, and property
                    exposed may be suitably assisted or protected; assist, advise, and protect
                    immigrants, strangers, and travellers in public streets, or at steamboat and
                    ship landings or railroad stations; enforce any law relating to the suppression
                    and punishment of crime, or to the observance of Sunday, or regarding
                    pawnbrokers, or mock auctions, or emigration, or elections, or gambling, or
                    intemperance, or lotteries, or lottery policies, or vagrants, or disorderly
                    persons, or the public health, or any ordinance or resolution of common
                    councils, within the said district, applicable to police, health, or criminal
                    procedure.</p>
                <p>Special regulations are made on these and other kindred subjects, such as the
                    regulation of traffic, preventing obstructions, the visitation of places of
                    amusement, public houses and drinking places, observation of servants in charge
                    of houses, and of suspicious persons, lost children, processions, balls and
                    parties, elections, &amp;c., and the attendance of an adequate number of police
                    at every assembly of citizens.</p>
                <p>The arrest of persons with or without process does not call for special notice as
                    distinguished from the common law and statute law in England, and the practice
                    as to the entry of charges and taking bail by the police is akin to the practice
                    in the English metropolis, but the rules are somewhat stricter. A squad is
                    organized for the sole purpose and duty of serving criminal process. Persons
                    making complaint of a felony or misdemeanour may be required to make affirmation
                    or oath which the police officers have power to administer. Charges against
                    police, whether by members of the force or citizens, are made and dealt with
                    under strict rules, and are tried upon written charges by one or more of the
                    commissioners in power, a committee dismissing charges or directing their trial.
                    Evidence is taken upon oath, and if the case is heard by less than three
                    commissioners no judgment can be acted on until the witness is brought before
                    and examined by all the commissioners. The board draws, by its president, on the
                    treasurer of the city for the cost of arrest and conviction of criminals and
                    others endangering the safety of the community and procuring information the use
                    of which may prevent crime and enable the department to perform its important
                    duties more successfully and with greater satisfaction to the public. The sum so
                    drawn is charged as a “secret service fund.” A place is provided in accordance
                    with statute law for the detention of such witnesses as are unable to furnish
                    security for their appearance in criminal proceedings.</p>
                <p>The detective force, called the “detective squad,” consists of a captain and
                    other members assigned by the board to detective duty. This portion of the force
                    has an office, as other portions of the police force, and is under the direct
                    orders of the superintendent, to whom reports are made, and who in turn reports
                    to the board. There is also a ‘ ’ special service squad” under the officer
                    commanding the detective force.</p>
                <p>There is a sanitary code, and a “sanitary police company” is set apart from the
                    police force by the board of police, performing duties assigned by the board.
                    The captain of the sanitary company assigns policemen to act as school officers.
                    There are harbour police, a police steamboat and steam-boiler inspection squad
                    to enforce the statute law on the subject, an “ordinance police squad” to
                    enforce ordinances of the corporation, and a “property office.”</p>
                <p>Members of the force are subject to rules; at the discretion of the board, on
                    written application, they are permitted to receive rewards or presents for
                    services rendered by them in the discharge of duties which are both “meritorious
                    and extraordinary,” but for such only.</p>
                <p>Admission to the force, examination, instruction, drill, and discipline are
                    provided for by special regulations. The right of every member of the police
                    force to entertain political or partisan opinions, and to express the same
                    freely when such expression shall not concern the immediate discharge of his
                    official duties, as well as the right of the elective franchise, is deemed
                    sacred and inviolable; but no member of the force is permitted to be a delegate
                    or representative to, or member of, or to take part in any political or partisan
                    convention, whose purpose is the nomination of a candidate or candidates to any
                    political office. Upon the days of election for public offices held under the
                    laws of the State, he must do all within his power to preserve the peace,
                    protect the integrity of the ballot box, enforce the rights of lawful voters,
                    and prevent illegal and fraudulent voting.</p>
                <p>The estimated salaries for the police of New York for 1884, comprising upwards of
                    2816 members of the force of all ranks, amounted to $3,328,333, besides the
                    salaries of the clerical force. The appropriations for the maintenance of the
                    city government (including the police) are made by the board of estimate and
                    apportionment, composed of the mayor, comptroller, president of the board of
                    aidermen, and president of the department of taxes and assessments. Some police
                    statistics are given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">New York</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi></p>
                <p>Looked at from a general point of view, the police in France may be regarded as
                    divided into two great branches—administrative police <hi rend="italic">(la
                    police administrative')</hi> and judicial police <hi rend="italic">(la
                    police</hi><hi rend="italic">judiciaire),</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the
                    former having for its object the maintenance of order, and the latter charged
                    with tracing out offenders, collecting the proofs, and delivering the presumed
                    offenders to the tribunals charged by law with their trial and punishment.</p>
                <p>Police duties are exercised under the minister of the interior, in the
                    departments and municipalities by the prefects and sub-prefects, appointed by
                    the president of the republic, and mayors, having as auxiliaries the
                    commissaries of police and other officers (appointed by the president, but under
                    the orders of the prefects). One of the chief prerogatives of the administrative
                    police is to make rules to ensure public order. Of these rules some embrace
                    general interests of the state, these being regulations of high or grand police;
                    others have no other object than the ruling of the particular district and its
                    inhabitants, and are simply termed police regulations. According as it deals
                    with the general interests of the state or only with those of a municipality,
                    the administrative police is said to be general or municipal; and each of these
                    branches admits of other divisions according to the subject. The <hi
                    rend="italic">police</hi><hi rend="italic">générale,</hi> besides more obvious
                    matters, includes all matters relating to public health, the regulation of
                    prostitution, the inspection of food, the carrying on of trades and
                    manufactures; and in relation to the welfare of the state it embraces public
                    meetings, banquets, societies and clubs, cafés and public places, and the
                    enforcement of laws relating to the publication and distribution of printed or
                    written matter, the sale of journals, the surveillance of strangers or
                    fugitives, the system of passports, the sale of gunpowder and firearms, designs
                    against the state, and a variety of such matters. In this way the police who
                    look after the safety of the state is closely allied with political matters <hi
                    rend="italic">(la police politique).</hi> Under a government really representing
                    the popular will the duties of the <hi rend="italic">police politique</hi> are
                    trifling, or at least innocuous, but under a despotic government they become of
                    the highest importance. It is matter of history which cannot be treated of here
                    that under Louis XIV. and in succeeding times the most unpopular and
                    unjustifiable use was made of police as a secret instrument for thepurposes of
                    despotic government. Napoleon availed himself largely of police instruments,
                    especially through his minister Fouché. On the restoration of constitutional
                    government under Louis Philippe police action was less dangerous, but the danger
                    revived under the second empire.</p>
                <p>The ministry of police created by the act of the Directory in 1796 was in 1818
                    suppressed as an independent office, and in 1852 it was united with the ministry
                    of the interior.</p>
                <p>The detection and punishment of crime is theoretically as well as practically
                    regarded by the French as essentially a matter of public concern, and to be
                    provided for by public officials appointed for that purpose, and on the other
                    hand in every French criminal proceeding, from the most trifling to the most
                    important, every person injured by the offence may make himself <hi
                    rend="italic">partie</hi><hi rend="italic">civile.</hi> It follows that in many
                    features the French police is organized in a different manner from the British,
                    and has some very different duties (Stephen). An observation has been already
                    cited, that neither in England nor iu America is there a system of espionage by
                    which private matters can be made the subject of police investigation or
                    interference. On the other hand the English system is open to the observation
                    that the police, in practice at least, are powerless to protect from annoyance
                    in many matters essential to perfect rule. Short of absolute indecency or
                    obscenity, printed matter of a scurrilous and offensive kind is openly sold in
                    the streets without police interference; and, owing apparently to the
                    much-abused maxim that an Englishman’s house is his castle, the quiet and
                    freedom from annoyance in the performance and fulfilling of the daily duties and
                    engagements of life are not secured. The annoyance to which Carlyle was subject
                    is only an illustration of the almost daily complaints that arise in the English
                    metropolis. Although the noise of a bell may be the subject of indictment or
                    injunction, the officers of police do not complain of or even remonstrate with
                    an inconsiderate or selfish neighbour in such a matter, or even in still greater
                    annoyances, such as those arising from animals kept in a state of confinement
                    (not affecting public health), because the source of annoyance is within private
                    territory, or because there is no summary modo of dealing with it. It is
                    unreasonable that complainants should be told, as they are every day, and
                    correctly, by magistrates, that the annoyances which render the enjoyment of
                    life impracticable <pb break="no"

                    not of summary police intervention. The fear of drawing down ridicule akin to
                    Verges’s direction to the watch, “If you hear a child cry in the night, you must
                    call to the nurse to bid her still it,” probably stands unduly in the way of
                    police interference with real nuisances.</p>
                <p>It is not, however, in the minute details of regulation and inspection of the
                    incidents of every-day life that the distinctions between the police systems of
                    the two countries chiefly consist. Such distinctions have of late years greatly
                    diminished; the intervention in all matters of health, for example, places the
                    English system more akin to the French, and on the other hand all travellers of
                    mature years can testify to the mitigation and even total cessation in France,
                    and on the Continent generally, of the minute investigation of a stranger who is
                    not a “suspect.” “To the word espionage a stigma is attached,” says Bentham.
                    “Let us substitute the word inspection, which is unconnected with the same
                    prejudices. If this inspection consists in the maintenance of an oppressive
                    system of police, which subjects innocent actions to punishment, which condemns
                    secretly and arbitrarily, it is natural that such a system and its agents should
                    become odious. But if the inspection consists in the maintenance of a system of
                    police for the preservation of the public tranquillity and the execution of good
                    laws, all its inspectors and all its guardians act a useful and salutary part;
                    it is only the vicious who will have reason to complain, and it will be
                    formidable to them alone.” It is with reference to criminal matters and <hi
                    rend="italic">the police</hi><hi rend="italic">judiciaire</hi> that important
                    distinctions exist between the French and English systems. In every <hi

                    having both administrative and judicial duties. The commissaries see that the
                    laws relating to good order and public safety are observed, and that the police
                    orders are executed, and take special action in serious matters. As officers of
                    the judicial police they are the auxiliaries of the procureur of the republic in
                    correctional and criminal police action, and in the ordinary police tribunal <hi

                    with three bureaus having for their special object the safety of the president

                    >(lapolice</hi><hi rend="italic">militaire),</hi> and various other matters;
                    secondly, the judicial police <hi rend="italic">(la police</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >judiciaire)</hi> already spoken of, with five bureaus, in constant
                    communication with the courts of judicature, and including the service of the
                    prisons of the Seine, matters relating to aliens, and the protection of
                    children; thirdly, the administrative police <hi rend="italic">(la police
                    administrative),</hi> with four bureaus, including everything relating to
                    supplies, navigation, public carriages, animals, firemen, public health, and the
                    enforcement of the law respecting the employment of young persons. Some minor
                    matters are under the supervision of the prefect of the Seine. Concurrently with
                    these divisions there is the municipal police, which comprises all the agents in
                    enforcing police regulations in the streets or public thoroughfares, acting
                    under the orders of a chief <hi rend="italic">(chef de la police</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">municipale)</hi> with a central bureau. The municipal police is
                    divided into two principal branches—the service in uniform of the <hi
                    rend="italic">gardiens de la paix,</hi> and the service out of uniform of <hi
                    rend="italic">inspecteurs</hi><hi rend="italic">de police,</hi> the latter a
                    comparatively small number.</p>
                <p>For purposes of municipal police, Paris is divided into twenty arrondissements
                    (corresponding in a great measure with the divisions of the metropolitan police
                    of England), which the uniform police patrol.</p>
                <p>The total police strength of the Paris arrondissements, according to the latest
                    return, showed 5932 <hi rend="italic">gardiens de la paix,</hi> each
                    arrondissement officered by an <hi rend="italic">officier de paix</hi> (an
                    office peculiar to Paris), with 3 or 4 brigadiers and from 24 to 27
                    sous-brigadiers under his command. There are two divisional inspectors.</p>
                <p>Besides these divisional <hi rend="italic">gardiens de la paix</hi> police, there
                    is a central administration consisting of 6 central brigades of 100 each, 4 of
                    the brigades carrying out the orders of the prefecture at theatres, assemblies,
                    races, and in the Bois de Boulogne, and elsewhere in the capital where their
                    presence is required, while the 5th brigade regulates traffic generally, and the
                    6th prevents obstructions in the markets.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">service</hi><hi rend="italic">de sûreté,</hi> or detective
                    department (out of uniform), with which is now amalgamated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >brigade</hi><hi rend="italic">des moeurs</hi> (which deals with public morals,
                    houses of ill fame, prostitutes, and so forth), comprises a commissary,
                    principal inspectors, brigadiers, and 211 inspectors. There are a number of
                    other branches of service including a fire brigade.</p>
                <p>The proportion of police to inhabitants as last estimated is 1 in 352.</p>
                <p>The pay of the <hi rend="italic">gardiens de la paix</hi> is from 1400 to 1700
                    francs; brigadiers, 2000 francs; sous-brigadiers, 1800 francs; <hi rend="italic"
                    >officiers</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">paix,</hi> 3000 to
                    6000 francs. The estimate of expenditure of the whole Paris police for 1884 was
                    23,952,631 francs,—of which the state contributed 7,693,825 francs.</p>
                <p>Whether the police of Paris are more effective than those of the English
                    metropolis is doubted. Persons who are best entitled to express an opinion,
                    having practical experience, think that, while a multitude of offices and
                    officers for a multitude of subjects and stages of investigation—a system, in
                    short, of bureaucracy—exists, which creates an impression, the actual detection
                    of grave offences is not commensurate with the display of attention.</p>
                <p>It is impossible in the narrow limits of this article to go through all the
                    police forces of Europe. It must suffice to allude to a few principal states,
                    noting the police forces of their capitals as illustrating the systems. Taking
                    the Berlin force as illustrative of the police system in the German empire,
                    police duties are as various as in France; the system includes a political
                    police controlling all matters relating to the press, societies, clubs, and
                    public and social amusements. Police duties are carried out under the direction
                    of the royal police presidency, the executive police force comprising a police
                    colonel, with, besides commissaries of criminal investigations, captains,
                    lieutenants, acting lieutenants, sergeant-majors, and a large body of constables
                    <hi rend="italic">(Schutzmänner).</hi> The total in 1883-84 amounted to 3441
                    executive officers, including criminal investigation officers, the political
                    police, and the department for the supervision of prostitution. Taking the
                    population of Berlin from the statistical bureau of 27th July 1884 at 1,242,820,
                    this gives 361 to each officer. The pay of the police is principally provided
                    from fiscal sources, and varies in an ascending scale from 1125 marks and
                    lodging allowance for the lowest class of constable.</p>
                <p>Taking Vienna in the same way as illustrative of the Austrian police, it is to be
                    observed that there are three branches,—(1) administration; (2) public safety
                    and judicial police; and (3) the Government police. At the head of the police
                    service in Vienna there is a president of police, and at the head of each of the
                    three branches there is an <hi rend="italic">Oberpolizeirath</hi> or chief
                    commissary. The head of the Government branch sometimes fills the office of
                    president. Each of the branches is subdivided into departments at the head of
                    which are <hi rend="italic">Polizeiräthe.</hi> Passing over the subdivisions of
                    the administrative branch, the public safety and judicial branch includes the
                    following departments :—the office for public safety, the central inquiry
                    office, and the record office or <hi rend="italic">Evidenzbureau.</hi> The
                    Government police branch comprises three departments :—the Government police
                    office, the press office, and the <hi rend="italic">Vereinsbureau</hi> or office
                    for the registration of societies.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Sicherheitswache</hi> or executive police of Vienna
                    consists of a central inspector and chief, district, divisional, and other
                    inspectors, with about 2500 constables, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sicherheitswachmänner.</hi> The detective department comprises a chief and
                    other inspectors, and 130 agents. In July 1884 the proportion of police
                    constables to the inhabitants was 1 to 436. In the latest return, the entire
                    police service comprises 2816 persons, at a cost of 2,355,710 florins,—of which
                    the state contributes 1,730,740 florins, and the communes the greater part of
                    the remainder. The pay of the constable ascends from 360 florins with allowances
                    of 90 florins.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that there is a general resemblance between the organization and
                    scope of the police forces of Germany and Austria and of France.</p>
                <p>In Belgian municipalities the burgomasters are the heads of the force, which is
                    under their control. The administrator of public safety is, however, specially
                    instructed by the minister of justice to see that the laws and regulations
                    affecting the police are properly carried out, and he can call on all public
                    functionaries to act in furtherance of that object. The administrator of public
                    safety is specially charged with the administration of the law in regard to
                    aliens, and this law is applied, as in the case of Victor Hugo, to <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n359/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0359-0344"/> persons stirring up sedition. The duty of the <hi
                    rend="italic">gendarmerie,</hi> who constitute the horse and foot police, is
                    generally to maintain internal order and peace. In Brussels as elsewhere the
                    burgomaster is the head, but for executive purposes there is a chief commissary
                    (subject, however, to the orders of the burgomaster), with assistant
                    commissaries and commissaries of divisions and other officers, and central and
                    other bureaus, with a body of agents (police constables) in each.</p>
                <p>There are two main classes of police functions recognized by law, the
                    administrative and the judicial police, the former engaged in the daily
                    maintenance of peace and order and so preventing offences, the latter in the
                    investigation of crime and tracing offenders; but the duties are necessarily
                    performed to a great extent by the same agents. The two other functions of the
                    judicial police are, however, limited to the same classes of officers, and they
                    perform the same duties as in Paris,—the law in practice there being expressly
                    adopted in Brussels.</p>
                <p>In Brussels the police force numbers, according to the latest report, 485 of all
                    ranks. For the population (162,489), this gives 1 to every 335 persons. Strictly
                    speaking there is no detective branch so called, but the special and judicial
                    officers are employed in detection as the necessity arises. The pay and
                    establishment charges are defrayed by local taxation. The annual pay of a
                    constable is 1500 francs.</p>
                <p>While this article is going through the press the idea is put forward, in
                    consequence of political disturbances, to place the police of the larger Belgian
                    towns under the control of Government instead of that of the respective
                    municipalities as at present, and establish a sort of prefecture of police in
                    Brussels. The attempt, if made, will probably meet with opposition from local
                    authorities.</p>
                <p>In Switzerland, which is sometimes classed with Belgium as among the least
                    policed states of Europe, the laws of the cantons vary. In some respects they
                    are stricter than in Belgium or even in France. Thus a <hi rend="italic">permis
                    de séjour</hi> is sometimes required where none is in practice necessary in
                    Paris or Brussels.</p>
                <p>In Italy there is in every province a prefect at the head of the police. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Italy.</hi></p>
                <p>The police in the Netherlands, as regards the sources from which its powers are
                    derived, is divided into the state police and the communal police, the former
                    forming part of the general executive government, and the latter, although
                    regulated by the executive, enforcing general and local police legislation.
                    Regulations for the state police are framed by the minister of justice. For the
                    purposes of the state police the country is divided into five districts, with a
                    director of police at the head of each district responsible for the control and
                    government of the state police within it, and to see that the laws and
                    ordinances for the safety and quietness of the state, the security of persons
                    and property, and the equality of all before the law are carried out. The duty
                    specially includes the supervision of strangers and their admission into and
                    departure from the country, and extends even to the enforcement of shooting and
                    fishing licences. In each district there is an officer of justice who directs
                    the prosecution of criminal offences.</p>
                <p>At the head of the communal police stand the burgomasters, and under them police
                    commissaries entrusted with the observance of police regulations, whose
                    appointment and removal rest with the crown, but they are paid by the commune.
                    The whole of the communal police are bound to assist the state police; and, on
                    the other hand, the latter assist the police, especially in the country
                    districts. The duties of the officer of justice may be carried out by the
                    commissary of police, who for the time being is an assistant officer of justice.
                    In large communes the police force is divided into several grades. Besides
                    commissaries, of whom one is chief, there are a chief inspector, classes of
                    inspectors, and brigadiers; but the arrangements differ in almost every
                    municipality.</p>
                <p>The total strength of the police is 6000; at The Hague there is supposed to be
                    one constable to 1000 inhabitants. Only in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague
                    are there special departments of detective police. Police salaries vary in
                    different communes. The highest are at The Hague, and range from 600 florins for
                    a third-class constable to 1800 florins for a chief inspector. The cost of the
                    state police and the expenses incurred in prosecutions for crime are defrayed by
                    the state. The expenses of the communal police are paid out of local rates on
                    houses and land.</p>
                <p>An official Russian document specially obtained for this article affords the
                    following scanty particulars regarding the police in European Russia.</p>
                <p>At the head of a police district there is a police master, who has subordinate
                    officers on his staff. A number of constables are appointed, depending on the
                    population. Large towns are subdivided into districts with inspectors and
                    assistants, smaller towns with an assistant inspector. In villages police duties
                    are executed by the inhabitants elected for that purpose, constituting
                    “hundreds” or “tenths” according to the number of inhabitants. There is a
                    control over the villages by the police of the district, and the governor
                    general has a controlling power over all, including the police master. Besides
                    the ordinary police there are police brigades in large towns with duties of a
                    special kind, as attending parades and fêtes. Each member of the brigade has
                    five hundred inhabitants to look after or control. In the capitals there is a
                    secret police having a staff in St Petersburg of a chief and his assistant, four
                    clerks, and twenty inspectors, and in Moscow of a chief, two clerks, and twelve
                    inspectore.</p>
                <p>The principal active duties of the Russian police comprise the enforcement of
                    police laws and the suppression of nuisances, disturbances, and crime. The
                    details of these duties are laid down in a special Act, which is subdivided into
                    different statutes, taken from the criminal code. The provincial towns are
                    governed by a special law, passed in 1876, as supplementary to the already
                    existing law. The towns provide the funds for the maintenance of the police.
                    Laws of 1853 regulated the lodgings and necessaries for the whole police staff
                    according to their rank; but a change has been introduced since 1873, and many
                    officers receive payment in the place of lodgings. Police pay varies from 200
                    roubles upwards.</p>
                <p>In closing this article, it is well to observe that the dis tinction between the
                    exercise of judicial power and police functions should be always borne in mind.
                    “The functions of justice and those of the police must be apt in many points to
                    run into one another, especially as the business would be very badly managed if
                    the same persons whose more particular duty it is to act as officers of the
                    police were not upon occasion to act in the capacity of officers of justice. The
                    idea, however, of the two functions may still be kept distinct” (Bentham). The
                    employment of police powers in the ante-judiciary part of criminal process,
                    which previously to the establishment of a police force in England was thought
                    to require an apology as founded on convenience and utility rather than on
                    principle, has become a necessity.</p>
                <p>The necessity for a police force as part of any system of orderly government is
                    exemplified by its recent introduction into Egypt. Amid differences of opinion
                    on every subject, and even on the administration of the force and its duties,
                    the abstract propriety of a police force is apparently beyond dispute.</p>
                <p>In every country the difficult question, apart from any as to the extent of
                    interference with the freedom of individual action, arises in actual police
                    administration— <hi rend="italic">Quis custodiet ipsos custodes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">?</hi></p>
                <p>By whatever name the head of a police force is known, whether as commissioner,
                    chief constable, superintendent, or otherwise, the efficient performance of his
                    duty involves inquiry, and judgment upon that inquiry. The character and
                    efficiency of his force must largely depend upon the insight as well as vigour
                    brought to bear upon the individual members of that force.</p>
                <p>In relation to the public generally a perfect police code must be full of
                    restraints, with coextensive powers of inquiry, even in matters that do not
                    involve punishment. The extent to which these restraints and powers are applied
                    greatly depends on time and place. Precautions which are necessary, Bentham
                    observes, at certain periods of danger and trouble, ought not to be continued in
                    a period of quietness, and care should be taken not to shock the national
                    spirit. One nation would not endure what is borne by another. (J. <hi
