                    mortgage in that the pledge is in the possession of the pledgee; it also differs
                    from mortgage in being confined to personal property. A mortgage of personal
                    property in most cases takes the name and form of a bill of sale (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bill,</hi> the giving of bills of sale being now regulated by
                    the Bills of Sale Acts, 1878 and 1882). The chief difference between Roman and
                    English law is that certain things, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> wearing
                    apparel, furniture, and instruments of tillage, could not be pledged in Roman
                    law, while there is no such restriction in English law. In the case of a pledge,
                    a special property passes to the pledgee, sufficient to enable him to maintain
                    an action against a wrongdoer, but the general property, that is the property
                    subject to the pledge, remains in the pledgor. As the pledge is for the benefit
                    of both parties, the pledgee is bound to exercise only ordinary care over the
                    pledge. The pledgee has the right of selling the pledge if the pledgor make
                    default in payment at the stipulated time. No right is acquired by the wrongful
                    sale of a pledge except in the case of property passing by delivery, such as
                    money or negotiable securities. In the case of a wrongful sale by a pledgee, the
                    pledgor cannot recover the value of the pledge without a tender of the amount
                    due. For pledges by factors see <hi rend="smallcaps">Factor.</hi> A pledge by a
                    banker, merchant, broker, attorney, or other agent, in violation of good faith,
                    and contrary to the purpose for which the property pledged was intrusted to him,
                    or a pledge of property with which he was intrusted for safe custody, renders
                    the offender guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable with a maximum term of seven
                    years’ penal servitude, 24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 96, §§ 75, 76. Pledges with
                    pawnbrokers are regulated by the Pawnbrokers’ Act, 1872, 35 &amp; 36 Vict. c. 93
                    (which applies to Great Britain). By the provisions of the Act (which does not
                    affect loans above &lt;£10), a pledge is redeemable within one year and seven
                    days of grace added to the year. Pledges pawned for 10s. or under not redeemed
                    in time become the property of the pawnbroker, pledges above 10s. are redeemable
                    until sale. The sale must be by public auction. The pawnbroker is entitled to
                    charge as interest one halfpenny per month on every two shillings lent where the
                    loan is under 40s., on every two shillings and sixpence where the loan is above
                    40s. Special contracts may be made where the loan is above 40s. Unlawful pawning
                    of goods not the property of the pawner, and taking in pawn any article from a
                    person apparently under the age of sixteen or intoxicated, or any linen or
                    apparel or unfinished goods or materials intrusted to wash, make up, &amp;c.,
                    are <hi rend="italic">(inter alia)</hi> made offences punishable by summary
                    conviction. An annual licence, costing <hi rend="italic">£7,</hi> 10s., must be
                    taken out for every pawnbroker’s shop.</p>
                <p>The law of Scotland as to pledge generally agrees with that of England, as does
                    also that of the United States. The main difference is that in Scotland and
                    Louisiana a pledge cannot be sold unless with judicial authority. In some of the
                    States the common law as it existed apart from the Factors’ Acts is still
                    followed; in others the factor has more or less restricted power to give a title
                    by pledge. In some States pawnbroking is regulated by the local authorities, and
                    not, as in most, by the general law of the State.</p>
