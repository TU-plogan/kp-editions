                    commission under which a privateer sails in time of war. The acceptance of a
                    commission from a belligerent power by a neutral, though not piracy by the law
                    of nations, has frequently been made so by treaty.<note anchored="true"

                    British subject is forbidden by the Foreign Enlistment Act, 1870. A vessel with
                    a commission from each of two powers at war with one another is a pirate by the
                    law of nations. Privateers stand in a position between that of a public ship of
                    war and a merchant vessel. They are not entitled to the full rights which the
                    comity of nations extends to public ships of war; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    by the municipal regulations of most nations they may not carry the flag of a
                    public ship of war. A</p>
                <p>capture made by a privateer may either become the property of the captor or,
                    following the general rule of international law, the property of the state (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Prize).</hi> In Great Britain, in order to encourage
                    privateering, the prize taken by a privateer was formerly divided between the
                    owners and the captors, and the rights of the crown were specially excluded in
                    numerous Prize Acts. But now, by the Naval Prize Act, 1864, a prize made by a
                    privateer belongs to the crown in its office of admiralty. By the United States
                    Prize Act of 1864, the whole proceeds of a prize made by a privateer go, unless
                    it is otherwise provided in her commission, to the captors. The sum awarded is
                    divided, in the absence of agreement, equally between the owners and the ship’s
                    company.</p>
                <p>Privateering is now a matter of much less importance than it formerly was, owing
                    to the terms of Art 1 of the Declaration of Paris, April 16, 1856, “Privateering
                    is and remains abolished.” The Declaration binds only the powers who are
                    signatories or who afterwards assented, and those only when engaged in war with
                    one another. The United States, Mexico, Uruguay, and Spain have not acceded to
                    it, and thus it would not hold in case of a war between the United States and
                    any other power, whether the latter were bound by the Declaration or not. By the
                    constitution of the United States, Congress has power to grant letters of marque
                    and reprisal. Congress, by an Act of March 3, 1863, authorized the issue of
                    letters of marque by the president, but they were never in fact issued either by
                    the United States or Confederate Government.</p>
                <p>In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Prussia, in spite of the Declaration of
                    Paris, took a course very little removed from privateering in the creation of a
                    volunteer fleet.</p>
