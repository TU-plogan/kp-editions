                    by side versions of the same text in several different languages; and the most
                    important polyglotte are editions of the Bible, or its parts, in which the
                    Hebrew and Greek originals are exhibited along with the great historical
                    versions, which are of value for the history of the text and its interpretation.
                    The first enterprise of this kind is the famous <hi rend="italic">Hexapla</hi>
                    of Origen: but here only Hebrew and</p>
                <p>Greek were employed (though the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion
                    were shown as well as the Septuagint), so that the work was rather diglott than
                    polyglott in the usual sense. After the invention of printing and the revival of
                    philological studies, polyglotte became a favourite means of advancing the
                    knowledge of Eastern languages (for which no good helps were available) as well
                    as the study of Scripture. The series began with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Complutensian</hi> (Alcala, 1514-17), already spoken of in the article on its
                    promoter Cardinal <hi rend="smallcaps">Jimenes</hi> or Ximenes; next came the
                    <hi rend="italic">Antwerp</hi><hi rend="italic">Polyglott</hi> (1569-72, in 8
                    vols, folio) of which the principal editor was Arias Montanus aided by Guido
                    Fabricius Boderianus, Raphelengius, Masius, Lucas of Bruges, and others. This
                    work was under the patronage of Philip II. of Spain; it added a new language to
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">Complutensian</hi> by including the Syriac New
                    Testament; and, while the earlier polyglott had only the Targum of Onkelos on
                    the Pentateuch, the Antwerp Bible had also the Targum on the Prophets, and on
                    Esther, Job, Psalms, and the Salomonie writings. Next came Le Jay’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Paris</hi><hi rend="italic">Polyglott</hi> (1645), which embraces
                    the first prints of the Syriac Old Testament (edited by Gabriel Sionita, a
                    Maronite, but the book of Ruth by Abraham Ecchelensis, also a Maronite) and of
                    the Samaritan Pentateuch and version (by <hi rend="smallcaps">Morinus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.').</hi> It has also an Arabic version, or rather a series of
                    various Arabic versions. Le Jay’s work is a splendid piece of typography, but
                    its success was marred by the appearance of the cheaper and more comprehensive
                    <hi rend="italic">London</hi><hi rend="italic">Polyglott.</hi> Le Jay was
                    ruined, and a great part of the impression went to the trunkmakers. The last
                    great polyglott is Walton’s (London, 1657), which is much less beautiful than Le
                    Jay’s, but more complete in various ways, including among other things the
                    Syriac of Esther and several apocryphal books for which it is wanting in the
                    Paris Bible, Persian versions of the Pentateuch and Gospels, the Psalms and New
                    Testament in Ethiopie. Walton was aided by able scholars, and used much new
                    manuscript material. His prolegomena, too, and collections of various readings
                    mark an important advance in Biblical criticism. It was in connexion with this
                    polyglott that E. Castle produced his famous <hi rend="italic">Heptaglott
                    Lexicon</hi> (London, 2 vols, folio, 1669), an astounding monument of industry
                    and erudition even when allowance is made for the fact that for the Arabic he
                    had the great MS. lexicon compiled and left to the university of Cambridge by
                    the almost forgotten W. Bedwell. The later polyglotts are of little scientific
                    importance, the best recent texts having been confined to a single language; but
                    every Biblical student still uses Walton and, if he can get it, Le Jay. Of the
                    numerous polyglotts on parts of the Bible it may suffice to mention the Genoa
                    psalter of 1516, edited by Giustiniani, bishop of Nebbio. It is in Hebrew,
                    Latin, Greek, Chaldee, and Arabic, and is interesting from the character of the
                    Chaldee text, from being the first specimen of Western printing in the Arabic
                    character, and from a curious note on Columbus and the discovery of America on
                    the margin of Psalm xix.</p>
