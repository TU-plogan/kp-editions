                    (1796-1859), historian, was born in Salem, Massachusetts, on 4th May 1796, his
                    ancestors, of the old Puritan stock, having migrated from Lancashire about 1640
                    and established themselves in Middlesex county, Massachusetts. He received his
                    earlier education in his native city until the removal of his family in 1808 to
                    Boston, where he was placed under the tuition of Dr Gardiner, a pupil of Dr
                    Parr. His schooldays appear to have been in the main typical rather than
                    prophetic, though in his passion for mimic warfare and for the narration of
                    original stories some indication of the historical bias may perhaps be
                    discerned. A healthy aversion to persistent work, which even in later years
                    broke at times through his rigorous system of self-discipline, did not hinder
                    him from making a good if somewhat desultory use of his permission to read at
                    the Boston athenaeum,—an exceptional advantage at a time when the best books
                    were by no means readily accessible in any part of the United States. He entered
                    Harvard College in the autumn of 1811, therefore, with a fairly thorough mental
                    equipment, but almost at the outset his career was interrupted by an accident
                    which affected the whole subsequent course of his life. A hard piece of bread,
                    flung at random in the Commons Hall, struck his left eye with such force that he
                    fell to the ground; and, though the first shock speedily passed, the sight was
                    irremediably destroyed. He resumed his college work, however, with success in
                    classics and literature, though he abandoned the study of mathematics as one in
                    which he could not attain even an average proficiency. After graduating
                    honourably in 1814 he entered his father’s office as a student of law; but in
                    January 1815 the uninjured eye showed dangerous symptoms of inflammation, which
                    for some time refused to yield to remedies. When at last in the autumn he was in
                    condition to travel, it was determined that he should pass the winter at St
                    Michael’s and in the spring obtain medical advice in Europe. His visit to the
                    Azores, which was constantly broken by confinement to a darkened room, is
                    chiefly noteworthy from the fact that he there began the mental discipline which
                    enabled him to compose and retain in memory long passages for subsequent
                    dictation; and, apart from the gain in culture, his journey to England, France,
                    and Italy (April 1816 to July 1817) λvas scarcely more satisfactory. The verdict
                    of the physicians consulted by him was that the injured eye was hopelessly
                    paralysed, and that the preservation of the sight of the other depended upon the
                    maintenance of his general health. His further pursuit of the legal profession
                    seemed out of the question, and on his return to Boston he remained quietly at
                    home listening to a great deal of reading, but with no fixed object in view. On
                    4th May 1820 he was married to Miss Susan Amory. Prior to his marriage he had
                    made a few experiments in composition which had obtained no further publicity
                    than that of his own circle of friends, but he now finally decided to devote his
                    life to literature. It must be admitted that he had not hitherto displayed any
                    remarkable aptitude; but having once determined his future occupation he set
                    himself strenuously to the task of self-preparation. With almost amusing
                    thoroughness he commenced the study of Murray’s <hi rend="italic">Grammar,</hi>
                    the prefatory matter of Johnson’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi> and Blair’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric,</hi> reading at the same time for general purposes
                    of style a series of the standard English writers from the period of Elizabeth
                    onwards. A review of Byron’s <hi rend="italic">Letters on Pope</hi> in 1821
                    constituted his first contribution to the <hi rend="italic">North American
                    Review,</hi> to which he continued for many years to send the results of his
                    slighter researches. He next turned to French literature, the irksomeness with
                    which he regarded his studies in this subject being mitigated by incursions into
                    the early English drama and ballad literature. Of the direction and quality of
                    his thought at this time he has left indications in his papers on <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay-Writing</hi> (1822) and on <hi rend="italic">French and
                    English Tragedy</hi> (1823). In pursuance of his method of successive studies he
                    began in 1823 the study of Italian literature, passing over German as demanding
                    more labour than he could afford; and so strongly did he feel the fascination of
                    the language that for some time he thought of selecting it as his chief sphere
                    of work. In the following year, however, he made his first acquaintance with the
                    literature of Spain under the influence of his friend and biographer, Ticknor,
                    "who was then lecturing upon it; and, while its attractiveness proved greater
                    than he had at the outset anticipated, the comparative novelty of the subject as
                    a field for research served as an additional stimulus.</p>
                <p>In the meantime his aims had been gradually concentrating. History had always
                    been a favourite study with him, and Mably’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">Γ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire</hi> appears to have had considerable influence in
                    determining him to the choice of some special period for historic research. The
                    selection, however, was not finally made without prolonged hesitation. The
                    project of a history of Italian literature held a prominent place in his thought
                    and found some tentative expression in his article on <hi rend="italic">Italian
                    Narrative Poetry</hi> (1824) and in the reply to Da Ponte’s criticism (1825);
                    but he had also in contemplation a history of the revolution which converted
                    republican Rome into a monarchy, a series of biographical and critical sketches
                    of eminent men, and a Spanish history from the invasion of the Arabs to the
                    consolidation of the monarchy under Charles V. It was not till the 19th of
                    January 1826 that he recorded in the private memoranda begun by him in 1820 his
                    decision “to embrace the gift of the Spanish subject.” The choice was certainly
                    a bold one. On the one hand, he had no great liking for, if he had not, as he
                    alleged, an absolute detestation of the investigation of latent and barren
                    antiquities, while, on the other, he had not the visual power which others
                    besides Milton have deemed indispensable to an historian. The first he might and
                    did overcome, but the second seemed likely to prove a permanent
                    disqualification. He could only use the eye which remained to him for brief and
                    intermittent periods, and as travelling affected his sight prejudicially he
                    could not anticipate any personal research amongst unpublished records and
                    historic scenes. He was happy, however, in the possession both of ample means
                    and admirable friends to supply so far as might be the necessary materials, and
                    of a wide leisure in which to give them literary shape and polish; and he
                    sketched with no undue restriction or hesitancy the plan of the <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella—</hi> his first
                    great work. Mr English, one of his secretaries, has furnished a picture of him
                    at this period seated in a study lined on two sides with books and darkened by
                    green screens and curtains of blue muslin, which required readjustment with
                    almost every cloud that passed across the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n726/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0726-0703"/> sky. His writing apparatus—a noctograph—lay
                    before him, and he kept his ivory style in his hand to jot down notes as the
                    reading progressed. In accordance with his general method these notes were in
                    turn read over to him until he had completely mastered them, when they were
                    worked up in his memory to their final shape. So proficient did he become that
                    he was able to retain the equivalent of sixty pages of printed matter in his
                    memory, turning and returning them as he walked or drove. The rate of progress
                    in preparation was therefore necessarily slow, apart from any liability to
                    interruption by other undertakings and failures in bodily health. He still
                    continued his yearly experimental contributions to the <hi rend="italic">North
                    American Review,</hi> elaborating them with a view as much to ultimate
                    historical proficiency as to immediate literary effect, the essays on <hi
                    rend="italic">Scottish Song</hi> (1826), <hi rend="italic">Novel-Writing</hi>
                    (1827), <hi rend="italic">Molière</hi> (1828), and Irving’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Granada</hi> (1829) belonging to this preparatory period. The death of his
                    eldest daughter in 1828 also led him aside to the study— afterwards renewed in
                    the interval between the <hi rend="italic">Ferdinand and Isabella</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Conquest of Mexico—</hi> of Christian evidences, with the
                    result that he convinced himself of the fundamental truth of Christianity,
                    though he did not accept all the tenets of orthodoxy. On the 6th of October 1829
                    he began the actual work of composition, which was continued without more
                    serious interruptions than those occasioned by the essays on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asylums for the Blind</hi> (1830), <hi rend="italic">Poetry and Romance of the
                    Italians</hi> (1831), and <hi rend="italic">English Literature of the 19th
                    Century</hi> (1832), until 25th June 1836, when the concluding note was written.
                    Another year, during which his essay on <hi rend="italic">Cervantes</hi>
                    appeared, was spent in the final revision of the <hi rend="italic">History</hi>
                    for the press, in which the author was ably assisted by two friends, of whom
                    Gardiner, the son of his old schoolmaster, criticized the style and Folsom
                    verified the facts. Its success upon its publication in Boston was immediate,
                    the five years’ contract being discharged in a few months. Arrangements were
                    speedily made for its publication in England, and there its success was not less
                    marked. From the position of an obscure reviewer Prescott suddenly found himself
                    elevated to the first rank of contemporary historians. Daniel Webster spoke of
                    him as a comet which had suddenly blazed out upon the world in full splendour,
                    and American, British, and Continental reviewers were equally laudatory. Its
                    reception determined the nature of all his subsequent work. Hitherto he had
                    still inclined towards the history of literature rather than to that of polity
                    and action, on the ground that the former was more consonant with his previous
                    studies and a more suitable sphere for the display of his special powers. A
                    close examination of his work in the department of literary criticism does not,
                    however, bear out this estimate of his own genius, and the popular voice in
                    approving his narrative faculty gave him the required impetus in the right
                    direction. After coquetting for a short time with the project of a life of
                    Molière he decided to follow in the track of his first work with a <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Conquest of Mexico.</hi> Washington Irving, who had
                    already made preparations to occupy the same field, generously withdrew in his
                    favour; and in May 1838 Prescott began his first reading in the subject. The
                    work was completed in August 1843, the five years’ labour having been broken by
                    the composition of reviews of Lockhart’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Scott</hi>
                    (1838), Kenyon’s <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1839), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chateaubriand</hi> (1839), Bancroft’s <hi rend="italic">United States</hi>
                    (1841), Mariotti’s <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> (1842), and Madame Calderon’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Life in Mexico</hi> (1843), and by the preparation of an
                    abridgment of his <hi rend="italic">F</hi><hi rend="italic">erdinand and
                    Isabella</hi> in anticipation of its threatened abridgment by another hand. On
                    6th December 1843 the <hi rend="italic">Conquest of Mexico</hi> was published
                    with a success proportionate to the wide reputation won by his previous work,
                    the contracted number being sold off in four months and London and Paris
                    editions meeting with a similar reception. The careful methods of work which he
                    had adopted from the outset had borne admirable fruit. While the consultation of
                    authorities had been no less thorough, his style had become more free and less
                    self-conscious; and the epic qualities of the theme were such as to call forth
                    in the highest degree his powers of picturesque narration. It was only a step
                    from the conquest of Mexico to that of Peru, and scarcely three months elapsed
                    before he began to break ground on the latter subject, though the actual
                    composition was not commenced until the autumn of 1844. While the work was in
                    progress and before the close of the year his father died,—a heavy blow to him,
                    inasmuch as the elder and younger members of the family had continued to share
                    the same home upon almost patriarchal terms, and the breach was therefore in a
                    chain of constant association extending over a period of forty-eight years. In
                    February 1845 he received the announcement of his election as corresponding
                    member of the French Institute in place of the Spanish historian Navarrete, and
                    also of the Royal Society of Berlin. The winter found him arranging for the
                    publication in England of the selection from his articles and reviews which
                    appeared in 1845 under the title of <hi rend="italic">Critical and Historical
                    Essays,</hi> and which was issued almost contemporaneously at New York under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Biographical and Critical Miscellanies.</hi> After
                    some minor interruptions—his removal from the old mansion-house in Bedford
                    Street to the house in Beacon Street, visits to friends, and a renewed failure
                    of sight— the <hi rend="italic">Conquest of Peru</hi> was completed in November
                    1846 and published in March following. His misgivings as to its reception were
                    at once set at rest, and it was speedily issued in translations into French,
                    Spanish, German, and Dutch, in addition to the English editions of New York,
                    London, and Paris. He was now over fifty and his sight showed serious symptoms
                    of enfeeblement. Although during the composition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ferdinand and Isabella</hi> it had been of very intermittent service to him, it
                    had by his careful regimen so far improved that he could read with a certain
                    amount of regularity during the writing of the <hi rend="italic">Conquest of
                    Mexico,</hi> and also, though in a less degree, during the years devoted to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Conquest of Peru.</hi> Now, however, the use of his remaining
                    eye had been reduced to an hour a day, divided into portions at wide intervals,
                    and he was driven to the conclusion that whatever plans he made for future work
                    must be formed on the same calculations as those of a blind man. He had been for
                    many years collecting materials for a history of Philip II., but he hesitated
                    for some time to attempt a work of such magnitude, occupying himself in the
                    meantime with the slighter labours of a memoir of Mr John Pickering for the
                    Massachusetts Historical Society and the revision of Ticknor’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Spanish Literature.</hi> Butin March 1848 he set himself with
                    characteristic courage to the accomplishment of the larger project, though with
                    the intention of writing memoirs rather than a history, as admitting a more
                    rambling style and less elaborate research. He had been fortunate in obtaining
                    the aid of Don Pascual de Gayangos, then professor of Arabic literature at
                    Madrid, by whose offices he was enabled to obtain material not only from the
                    public archives of Spain but from the muniment rooms of the great Spanish
                    families. With an exceptional range of information thus afforded him, he wrote
                    the opening of his history at Nahant, his summer residence, in July 1849; but,
                    finding himself still unsettled in his work, he decided in the spring of the
                    following year to carry out a long projected visit to England. His reception
                    there was of the most cordial and gratifying kind, and he returned reinvigorated
                    to his work. The idea of writing memoirs <pb break="no"

                    form, and in November 1855 the first two volumes of his uncompleted <hi

                    eclipsing that of any of his earlier books. This was his last great undertaking;
                    but as Robertson’s <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> I <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi>., in the light of new sources of information, was inadequate to take its
                    place as a link in the series, he republished it in an improved and extended
                    form in December 1856. A slight attack of apoplexy on the 4th of February 1858
                    foretold the end, though he persevered with the preparation of the third volume
                    of <hi rend="italic">Philip II.</hi> for the press, and with the emendation and

                <p>In personal character Prescott possessed many admirable and amiable qualities,
                    his courageous bearing and persistent labour being by no means without their
                    heroic element, though the greater portion of his life was passed with his
                    friends and his books. A certain habit of striving to be habitual is curiously
                    prominent from his boyhood till his death, the desire for an objective stimulus
                    finding expression in numberless formal resolutions and in frequent wagers with
                    his secretaries or friends. Necessarily a valetudinarian, the smallest details
                    of life had to be considered by him, even to the adjustment of the weight of his
                    dress to the state of the weather and the thermometer. Yet the formalism,
                    whether voluntary or enforced, was never obtrusive, and the final impression
                    made upon his contemporaries was that of a frank, spontaneous, and thoroughly
                    manly life. As an historian he stands in the direct line of literary descent
                    from Robertson, whose influence is clearly discernible both in his method and
                    style. But, while Robertson was in some measure the initiator of a movement,
                    Prescott came to his task when the range of information was incomparably wider
                    and when progress in sociologie theory had thrown innumerable convergent lights
                    upon the progress of events. He worked, therefore, upon more assured ground; his
                    sifting of authorities was more thorough and his method less restricted both in
                    the selection of details and in their graphic presentation. At the same time he
                    cannot be classed as in the highest sense a philosophic historian. His power
                    lies chiefly in the clear grasp of fact, in selection and synthesis, in the
                    vivid narration of incident. For extended analysis he had small liking and
                    faculty; his critical insight is limited in range, and he confines himself
                    almost wholly to the concrete elements of history. When he does venture upon
                    more abstract criticism his standards are often commonplace and superficial, and
                    the world-scheme to which he relates events is less profound than the thought of
                    his time altogether warranted. If these things, however, indicate failure from
                    the point of view of ideal history, they at least make for popularity. Few
                    historians have had in a higher degree that artistic feeling in the broad
                    arrangement of materials which ensures interest. The course of his narrative is
                    unperplexed by doubtful or insoluble problems; no pretence at profundity or
                    subtlety saps the vitality of his characters or interrupts the flow of incident
                    with dissertation and digression. The painting is filled in with primary colours
                    and with a free hand; and any sense of •crudity which may be awakened by close
                    inspection is compensated by the vigour and massive effectiveness of the whole.
                    Though he did not bring to his work the highest scientific grasp, he brought to
                    it scientific conscientiousness and thoroughness within his limitations, while
                    his dominant pictorial faculty gave to his treatment a super-scientific
                    brilliancy. The romance of history has seldom had an abler exponent, and the
                    large number of editions and translations Of his works attests their
                    undiminished fascination at certain stages of popular culture. (R. Μ. W. )</p>
