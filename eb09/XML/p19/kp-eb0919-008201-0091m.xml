                    for the mother’s name was Romana, and the father continued living during many
                    years of Piero’s career. The painter is also named Piero Borghese, from his
                    birthplace, Borgo San Sepolcro, in Umbria. The true family name was, as above
                    stated, Franceschi, and the family still exists under the name of
                    Martini-Franceschi.</p>
                <p>Piero first received a scientific education, and became an adept in mathematics
                    and geometry. This early bent of mind and course of study influenced to a large
                    extent his development as a painter. He had more science than either Paolo
                    Uccello or Mantegna, both of them his contemporaries, the former older and the
                    latter younger. Skilful in linear perspective, he fixed rectangular planes in
                    perfect order and measured them, and thus got his figures in true proportional
                    height. He preceded and excelled Domenico Ghirlandajo in projecting shadows, and
                    rendered with considerable truth atmosphere, the harmony of colours, and the
                    relief of objects. He was naturally therefore excellent in architectural
                    painting, and, in point of technique, he advanced the practice of oil-colouring
                    in Italy.</p>
                <p>The earliest trace that we find of Piero as a painter is in 1439, when he was an
                    apprentice of Domenico Veneziano, and assisted him in painting the chapel of S.
                    Egidio, in S. Maria Novella of Florence. Towards. 1450 he is said to have been
                    with the same artist in Loreto; nothing of his, however, can now be identified
                    in that locality. In 1451 he was by himself, painting in Rimini, where a fresco
                    still remains. Prior to this he had executed some extensive frescos in the
                    Vatican; but these were destroyed when Raphael undertook on the same walls the
                    Liberation of St Peter and other paintings. His most extensive extant series of
                    frescos is in the choir of S. Francesco in Arezzo,—the History of the Cross,
                    beginning with legendary subjects of the death and burial of Adam, and going on
                    to the entry of Heraclius into Jerusalem after the overthrow of Chosroes. This
                    series is, in relation to its period, remarkable for effect, movement, and
                    mastery of the nude. The subject of the Vision of Constantine is particularly
                    vigorous in chiaroscuro; and a preparatory design of the same composition was so
                    highly effective that it used to be ascribed to Giorgione, and might even
                    (according to one authority) have passed for the handiwork of Correggio or of
                    Rembrandt. A noted fresco in Borgo San Sepolcro, the Resurrection, may be later
                    than this series; it is preserved in the Palazzo de’ Conservatori. An important
                    painting of the Flagellation of Christ, in the cathedral of Urbino, is later
                    still, probably towards 1470. Piero appears to have been much in his native town
                    of Borgo San Sepolcro from about 1445, and more especially after 1454, when he
                    finished the series in Arezzo. He grew rich there, and there he died, and in
                    October 1492 was buried.</p>
                <p>Two statements made by Vasari regarding “Piero della Francesca” <hi rend="italic"
                    >are</hi> open to much controversy. He says that Piero became blind at the age
                    of sixty, which cannot be true, as he continued painting some years later; but
                    scepticism need perhaps hardly go to the extent of inferring that he was never
                    blind at all. Vasari also says that Fra Luca Pacioli, a disciple of Piero in
                    scientific matters, defrauded his memory by appropriating his researches without
                    acknowledgment. This is hard upon the friar, who constantly shows a great
                    reverence for his master in the sciences. One of Pacioli’s books was published
                    in 1509, and speaks of Piero as still living. Hence it has been propounded that
                    Piero lived to the patriarchal age of ninety-four or upwards; but, as it is now
                    stated that he was buried in 1492, we must infer that there is some mistake in
                    relation to Pacioli’s remark—perhaps the date of writing was several years
                    earlier than that of publication. Piero was known to have left a manuscript of
                    his own on perspective; this remained undiscovered till a recent date, when it
                    was found by E. Harzen in the Ambrosian Library of Milan, ascribed to some
                    supposititious “Pietro, Pittore di Bruges.” The treatise shows a knowledge of
                    perspective as dependent on the point of distance.</p>
                <p>In the London National Gallery are four paintings attributed to Piero de’
                    Franceschi. One of them, a profile of Isotta da Rimini, may safely be rejected.
                    The Baptism of Christ, which used to be the altarpiece of the Priory of the
                    Baptist in Borgo San Sapolcro, is an important example; and still more so the
                    Nativity, with the Virgin kneeling, and five angels singing to musical
                    instruments. This is a very interesting and characteristic specimen, and has
                    indeed been praised somewhat beyond its deservings on aesthetic grounds.</p>
                <p>Piero’s earlier style was energetic but unrefined, and to the last he lacked
                    selectness of form and feature. The types of his visages are peculiar, and the
                    costumes (as especially in the Arezzo series) <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n92/mode/1up"

                    models swathed in real drapery. Luca Signorelli was his pupil, and probably to
                    some extent Perugino; and his own influence, furthered by that of Signorelli,
                    was potent over all Italy. Belonging as he does to the Umbrian school, he united
                    with that style something of the Sienese and more of the Florentine mode.</p>
