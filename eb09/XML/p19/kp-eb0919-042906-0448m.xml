                    by the animals on the surface of their bodies, and build up, in consequence of
                    the formation of dense colonies by budding, complex aggregates known as “sea
                    mats” and “sea mosses.” Thompson expressly stated the opinion that the
                    organization of the animals detected by him led to the conclusion that “they
                    must be considered as a new type of the Mollusca Acephala.”</p>
                <p>Subsequently (1844) Henri Milne-Edwards (3) pointed out the relationship of
                    Thompson’s Polyzoa to the Brachiopoda, and, adopting the latter’s view as to
                    their Molluscan affinities, proposed to unite these two classes with the
                    Tunicata in a group to be called “Molluscoidea.” Recent researches have entirely
                    separated the Tunicata from this association, and have demonstrated that they
                    belong to the great phylum of Vertebrata. On the other hand the association of
                    the Polyzoa with the Brachiopoda appears at present to be confirmed, though the
                    relationship of these two classes to the Mollusca has been shown to rest on
                    mistaken identification of parts; see, however, Harmer (18).</p>
                <p>The Polyzoa appear to be related to the Sipunculoid Gephyraean worms (Gephyraea
                    inermia) more nearly than to any other class of the animal kingdom. The study
                    and interpretation of the facts of their ontogeny (growth from the egg) presents
                    such extreme difficulty that in the present state of our knowledge it is
                    necessary to regard them <pb break="no"

                <p>We shall most readily arrive at a conception ot the essential structure of a
                    Polyzoon, and of the variations to which that essential structure is subject
                    within the class, by first examining one member of the group in detail and
                    subsequently reviewing the characters presented by the divergent sub-classes,
                    orders, &amp;c., above indicated.</p>
                <p>The most convenient form for our purpose is <hi rend="italic">Paludicella
                    Ehrenbergii</hi> (fig. 2, A), belonging to the typical section of the class (the
                    Eupolyzoa) and to the order Gymnolaema. The organism occurs as minute trec-like
                    growths (figs. 2, A and 1, E) attached to stones in freshwater streams and
                    canals. The branches of the little tree are rarely more than an inch in length,
                    and are regularly swollen and jointed at intervals. Each of the very numerous
                    joints is about one-fifth of an inch long, and is in reality a tubular horny box
                    attached above and below to the preceding and succeeding joints, and having on
                    one side of it a spout-like aperture from which a crown of tentacles can be
                    protruded. Each joint is thus inhabited by a distinct animal which is more or
                    less completely shut off from the one in front of it and the one behind it,
                    although it originated from the hinder and has given rise to the fore-lying
                    individual by a process of budding, and retains a continuity of substance with
                    both. A single cell or joint with its contained animal is represented in fig. 2,
                    A.</p>
                <p>Paludicella produces an arboriform colony, the main trunk or stolon being
                    adherent to some stone or piece of wood. The substance of the wall of the cells
                    is formed by a chemical body allied to chitin. Other Polyzoa may form mat-like
                    expansions—the cells being placed in one plane, side by side (fig. 1, C, D, F,
                    G), as well as in linear series; others again form solid masses, whilst many
                    agree with Paludicella in the simple linear arrangement of their units. Phoronis
                    and Loxosoma, on the other hand, do not form colonies at all—the former because
                    it does not bud, the latter because the buds become detached from their parent
                    as soon as formed, as do the buds of the Hydrozoon Hydra.</p>
                <p>On the whole Paludicella presents us with a very simple form of Polyzoon-colony
                    (technically termed a “zoarium”), in which the aggregate of budded persons, each
                    of which is called a “polypide,” does not exhibit any marked individuation, but
                    is irregular and tree-like. But, just as in the Hydrozoa we find the
                    Siphonophora presenting us with a very definite shape and individuality of the
                    aggregate or colonv. so in the Polvzoa we find instances of high indι- <pb

                <p>viduation of the zoarium of a similar kind. The most remarkable example is
                    afforded by the locomotive zoarium or colony of Cristatella (fig. 3); and
                    another very striking instance is that of the stalked zoaria of Kinetoskias
                    (fig. 14) and Adeona.</p>
                <p>The horny consistence of the cells which are produced by Paludicella is very
                    usual in other Polyzoa; but we find frequently that the substance which forms
                    the cells is gelatinous and soft instead of being horny, or again may be
                    strongly calcareous. The term <hi rend="italic">coenoeciunι</hi> is applied to
                    the mass of cells belonging to a colony or zoarium when considered apart from
                    the living polyp ides which form it. Often such coenoecia are found retaining
                    form and structure when the soft living polypides have decomposed and
                    disappeared. A single cell of the coenoecium, corresponding to a single
                    polypide, is called by the special students of the Polyzoa a <hi rend="italic"
                    >zooecium.</hi></p>
                <p>If we examine a single cell or zooecium of Paludicella more carefully whilst its
                    polypide is alive, we discover that the horny cell is nothing more than the
                    cuticle of the polypide itself, to which it is absolutely adherent. At the
                    so-called “mouth” or spout of the cell the cuticle suddenly changes its
                    character and becomes a very delicate and soft pellicle instead of being
                    thickandhorny. There is no real discontinuity of the cuticle at this region, but
                    merely a change in its qualities. This gives to that portion of the body of the
                    polypide which lies beyond the spout a mobility and capacity for folding and
                    pleating which is entirely denied to that part where the cuticle is more dense
                    (fig. 2, A). Accordingly we find that the anterior portion of the body of the
                    polypide can be pulled into the hinder part as the finger of a glove may be
                    tucked into the hand. It is, in fact, an “introvert” (for the use of this term
                    see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 652). This arrangement is
                    universal in the Ectoproctous Eupolyzoa, but does not obtain either in the
                    Entoprocta, the Pterobranchia, or the Vermiformia. In Phoronis, Rhabdopleura,
                    and Cephalodiscus the anterior part of the body can <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                    be tucked or telescoped into the hinder part as it can in typical Eupolyzoa. On
                    the other hand it is very important to note that the Sipunculoid Gephyraeans are
                    all pre-eminently characterized by possessing identically this arrangement. The
                    introversion is effected in Paludicella (as in other Eupolyzoa) by a series of
                    long detached retractor muscles of considerable power (fig. 2, A, <hi
                    rend="italic">mr, r', m)</hi>; the same is true of Sipunculus.</p>
                <p>The view has been advanced by Allman (4) that the retractile part of the polypide
                    is to be considered as a distinct individual budded from the basal portion,
                    which is regarded as an equivalent individual. It does not appear to the present
                    writer that such a theoretical conception tends to facilitate the understanding
                    of the structure and relations of these animals.</p>
                <p>An “ectocyst" and “endocyst” have also been distinguished in former treatises,
                    and these terms form part of a special “polyzoarial” nomenclature, but do not
                    appear to be any longer needful. Equally undesirable is the misapplied term
                    “endosarc” lately introduced by Jolliet (5) to denote a certain portion of the
                    Polyzoon structure which will not be referred to here by that name.</p>
                <p>The retractile or introversible portion of the body of the polypide of
                    Paludicella is terminated by a crown of sixteen stiff non-contractile tentacles
                    (fig. 2, A, <hi rend="italic">br)</hi> which form a circle around a central
                    aperture—the animal’s mouth. These tentacles are hollow and beset with vibratile
                    cilia. The beating of the cilia causes a powerful current in the water by which
                    food is brought to the animal’s mouth. Each tentacle is also muscular, and can
                    be bent and straightened at will. The tentacles not only serve to bring food
                    into the mouth, but they are efficient as gillfilaments, being possibly
                    homologous with (as well as functionally similar to) the gill-filaments of
                    Lamellibranch Molluscs. They also serve as delicate tactile organs, and are the
                    only sense organs possessed by the Eupolyzoa.</p>
                <p>In Paludicella the platform around the mouth from which the tentacles arise, or
                    <hi rend="italic">lophophore,</hi> as it is termed, is circular. This is the
                    case in all members of the large group of Gymnolaema and in the Entoprocta. But
                    in the Phylactolaema the lophophore is drawn out on each side, right and left,
                    so as to present a horse-shoe shape (fig. 2, B), and in some forms, notably
                    Lophopus and Alcyonella, the two arms or diverging rami of the horseshoe are
                    very strongly developed.</p>
                <p>In the Pterobranchia the tentacles are confined in one genus (Rhabdopleura) to
                    the two arm-like outgrowths of the lophophore, and are not simply hollow but
                    contain a well-developed cartilaginoid skeleton (fig. 7). In the allied genus
                    Cephalodiscus there are not merely a single pair of such arm-like processes,
                    each bearing two rows of tentacles, but the lophophore is developed into twelve
                    arm-like processes (fig. 9), which form a dense tuft of filaments around the
                    anterior extremity of the animal.</p>
                <p>In the Vermiformia (Phoronis) we again meet with a very perfect horse-shoe-shaped
                    lophophore (fig. 4). The tentacles upon the crescentic or otherwise lobed
                    circumoral region of the Sipunculoids are the representatives of the tentacles
                    of the Polyzoa; whilst the tentaculiferous “arms” of the Brachiopoda appear to
                    be the equivalents of the Polyzoon’s lophophore much drawn out and in most cases
                    spirally rolled.</p>
                <p>Just below the circular crown of tentacles in Paludicella we find an aperture
                    which the study of internal anatomy proves to be the anus. In all Polyzoa the
                    anus has this position near the mouth; and in this respect we again note an
                    agreement with Sipunculus and the other so-called Gephyraea inermia. In one
                    division of the Polyzoa alone is there any noteworthy variation in the position
                    of the anus, namely, in the Entoprocta (sub-class of the section Eupolyzoa). In
                    these forms the anus, instead of lying just below the lophophore or platform
                    from which the tentacles spring, is included like the mouth within its area
                    (fig. 15, C).</p>
                <p>Passing now to the deeper structure of Paludicella, we find that it is a
                    Coelomate animal; that is to say, there <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n451/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0451-0432"/> exists between the body-wall and the wall of the
                    alimentary tract a distinct space termed “perigastric space,” body-cavity,” or
                    “coelom.” This is true of all Polyzoa, though it has been erroneously stated by
                    G. O. Sars that Rhabdopleura does not possess such a coelom. In Eupolyzoa
                    (excepting the Entoprocta) the coelom is very capacious; it is occupied by a
                    coagulable haemolymph in which float cellular corpuscles, and also the
                    generative products, detached, as is usual in Coelomata, from definite “gonads”
                    developed on its lining membrane (fig. 2, A, o, <hi rend="italic">t).</hi> This
                    lining membrane or “coelomic epithelium” is ciliated in the Phylactohema, but
                    its characters appear not to have been definitely determined in other Eupolyzoa.
                    The coelomic space and the tissues bounding it are continuous throughout the
                    colony or zoarium of a Polyzoon—either directly without any constriction marking
                    off one polypide from another, or through perforate septum-like structures as in
                    Paludicella (see right-hand upper process of fig. 2, A), which form incomplete
                    barriers between juxtaposed zooecia, and are termed “rosette-plates” or
                    “communication-plates.” The coelomic cavity is continued in Paludicella and
                    probably in all Polyzoa into the tentacles, so that these organs expose the
                    haemolymph fluid to a respiratory action, and hence may be called branchial.</p>
                <p>The body-wall of Paludicella consists, alike in the anterior introversible region
                    and in the posterior region, of an outer cuticle which has already been spoken
                    of as thickened around the base of the polypide so as to become there the hard
                    tube-like zooecium. Beneath this is the delicate layer of living epidermic cells
                    which are the mother-cells or matrix of that cuticle. Beneath this again are a
                    few scattered annuli of muscular fibre-cells arranged ring - wise around the
                    cylindrical body; more deeply placed than these are five large bundles of
                    longitudinally placed muscular fibre-cells which are attached at three different
                    levels to the soft introversible portion of the body, and by their retraction
                    pull it in three folds or telescopic joints into the capacious hinder part of
                    the body. In some Polyzoa the muscular fibre-cells present transverse
                    striations. These folds are shown in fig. 2, A; but when the longitudinal
                    muscles are completely contracted the tentacular crown would be pulled down far
                    out of sight into the midst of the body by the great longitudinal muscle <hi
                    rend="italic">mr.</hi> Deeper than the longitudinal muscles, and clothing them
                    and everything else which projects into the coelom, is the coelomic epithelium,
                    not easily observed, and sufficiently known only in the Phylactohema. Part of it
                    gives rise to the generative products (fig. 2 A, o, <hi rend="italic">t).</hi>
                    Other Eupolyzoa have a similar but not identical arrangement of the longitudinal
                    muscles—acting essentially as retractors of the “introvert” or soft anterior
                    region of the body—and a similar structure of the body-wall which is in
                    essential features identical with that of the Sipunculoid worms, the Chaetopod
                    worms, and other typical Coelomate animals.</p>
                <p>The alimentary canal of Paludicella forms a closely compressed U-shaped loop
                    depending from the closely approximated mouth and anus into the capacious
                    coelom. It is clothed on its coelomic surface (in Phylactolaema at any rate)
                    with coelomic epithelium, and beneath this are extremely delicate muscular
                    layers. Within it is lined, except in the immediate region of the mouth (which
                    is lined by the in-pushed outer cell-layer), by the enteric celllayer— the
                    digestive cells derived from the archenteron of the embryo. We can distinguish
                    in Paludicella a contractile pharyngo-oesophagus (fig. 2, A, oe), a digestive
                    stomach <hi rend="italic">V</hi> (the lining cells of which have a yellow
                    colour), and an intestine which forms that arm of the loop connected with the
                    anus. This simple form of alimentary canal is uniformly present in Polyzoa. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Boτverbankia</hi> and its allies a muscular gizzard with horny
                    teeth is interposed between oesophagus and digestive stomach.</p>
                <p>The alimentary canal of Paludicella does not hang quite freely in the coelomic
                    cavity, but, as is usually the case in other classes where the coelom is large,
                    <hi rend="italic">mesenteries</hi> are present in the form of fibrous (muscular
                    Î) bands clothed with coelomic epithelium and suspending the gut to the
                    body-wall. In Paludicella there are two of these mesenteries, an anterior (√)
                    and a posterior <hi rend="italic">(x).</hi> The presence of two mesenteric bands
                    is exceptional. Usually in the Eupolyzoa we find one such mesentery only,
                    corresponding to the hinder of the two in Paludicella. The special name <hi
                    rend="italic">funiculus</hi> (Huxley) is applied to this mesenteric band, and it
                    is noteworthy that the cells of the coelomic epithelium, either upon its surface
                    or at its point of insertion into the body-wall, are modified as reproductive
                    elements, forming either the testis or ovary; in the Phylactolaema they form
                    here also special asexual reproductive bodies, the statoblasts. The nervous
                    tissue and organs of Paludicella have not been specially investigated, but in
                    many Eùpolyzoa an oval mass of nerve-ganglion cells is found lying between the
                    mouth and anus, and there is no doubt that it is present in this case. In
                    Plumatella nerve-fibres have been traced from this ganglion to the tentacles and
                    other parts around the mouth (fig. 11, <hi rend="italic">w, x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic                     subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">y).</hi> A
                    “colonial nervous system” was described some years ago by Fr. Müller in
                    Serialaria; but modern histologists do not admit that the tissue so named by
                    Müller is nerve-tissue. The ganglion above mentioned is the only nervous tissue
                    at present known in Polyzoa (but see fig. 17, <hi rend="italic">x).</hi></p>
                <p>No heart or blood-vessels of any kind exist in Paludicella nor in any of the
                    Eupolyzoa or Pterobranchia. On the other hand the isolated vermiform genus
                    Phoronis presents a closed contractile system of longitudinal vessels (dorsal
                    and ventral) which contain nucleated corpuscles coloured red by haemoglobin
                    (figs. 4, 5).</p>
                <p>No excretory organs (nephridia) or genital ducts have been observed in
                    Paludicella, nor have such organs been detected in the majority of the Polyzoa
                    which have been studied. In the Entoprocta, however, a pair of minute ciliated
                    canals are found in the nearly obliterated bodycavity opening to the exterior
                    near the tentacular crown in both Pedicellina and Loxosoma, which represent the
                    cephalic nephridia of worms. A definite pair of nephridia occur in Phoronis. A
                    similar significance is perhaps to be attributed to the “intertentacular organ”
                    of Farre—a ciliated passage opening between two tentacles of the lophophore in
                    Membranipora, Alcyonidium, and other forms—through which Hincks has observed the
                    spermatozoa to escape in large numbers. This organ occurs equally in female
                    specimens of Membranipora, and is not therefore simply a spermatic duct.</p>

                <p>Paludicella, as we have seen, develops both ova and spermatozoa in one and the
                    same polypide. The details of impregnation and development have not been
                    followed in this instance, but in some of the marine Eupolyzoa (Gymnolaema)
                    remarkable bud-like structures termed <hi rend="italic">o&lt;xcia</hi> are
                    developed for the special reception of the ova, and in these organs
                    fertilization takes place. In the Entoprocta there is a peculiar brood-pouch.
                    The spermatozoa of one polypide probably in all cases fertilize the ova of
                    another, but we have not yet in many cases a knowledge of how the spermatozoa
                    get to the eggs, or how the eggs escape from the body-cavity of the parent. In
                    the hippocrepian freshwater Polyzoa (Phylactolaema) the ova appear to be
                    fertilized and undergo the early stages of development within the body-cavity of
                    the parent or in a hernia-like protrusion of it. Probably in such cases the
                    embryos escape by the death of the parent and rupture of the parental tissues,
                    as do also the peculiar asexual internal buds or statoblasts of these forms.</p>
                <p>The embryo Polyzoon or “larva” swims freely in its early condition by means of
                    cilia, and is in this condition a single polypide or “person.” The forms assumed
                    by these ciliated larvae in different Polyzoa are very various and exceedingly
                    difficult of interpretation. We shall have more to say with regard to them below
                    (see figs. 19, 20, 21). The ciliated larva then fixes itself and commences to
                    produce polypides by a process of budding, the buds remaining not merely in
                    contact but in organic continuity, and increasing continually in number so as to
                    form a large colony or zoarium. In Paludicella we have seen that this colony has
                    a simple tree-like form. The new buds form as wart-like growths, usually one,
                    sometimes two in number, at the free end of a cell or zooecium near the
                    spout-like process from which the tentacular crown is everted. In Paludicella
                    all the polypides of a colony are alike; there is no differentiation of form or
                    distribution of function amongst the members of the colony. In many Eupolyzoa
                    this simplicity is by no means maintained, but a great variety of form and
                    function is assumed by various members of the aggregate. The only approach to a
                    differentiation of the polypides in Paludicella is in the arrest of growth of
                    some of the buds of a colony in autumn, which, instead of advancing to maturity,
                    become conical and invested with a dark-coloured cuticle. They are termed <hi
                    rend="italic">hybernacula.</hi> Should the rest of the polypides die down in
                    winter, these arrested buds survive and go on to complete development on the
                    return of spring.</p>
                <p>In Paludicella we have thus seen a fairly simple and central example of Polyzoon
                    structure and life-history. The variations upon this theme presented in
                    different groups of Polyzoa have been to some small extent noted in the
                    preceding account, but we shall now be able to indicate them more precisely by
                    considering the various groups of Polyzoa in succession. The limit assigned to
                    this article necessitates very large omissions. The reader who wishes to have

                    differs from all other Polyzoa first in its greater size (species 2 inches long
                    are known) and elaboration of organization, and correlatively with that in the
                    fact that it does not produce buds. Further, it does not produce a closely
                    adherent cuticular zooecium as do Paludicella and the Eupolyzoa generally, but a
                    leathery tube in which the animal freely moves, resembling that of some
                    Chaetopods (Sabella). Like some Sabellae, Phoronis forms closely packed
                    aggregates of individuals not brought together by any process of budding, but
                    each separately developed from an egg. Phoronis has an elongate, wormlike,
                    unsegmented body, with a conical posterior termination (like Sipunculus), and
                    anteriorly provided with a horse - shoe - shaped crown of tentacles surrounding
                    the mouth (figs. 4, 5). There is an intertentacular “web” between the bases of
                    the tentacles as in the Phylactolaema. Caldwell (6) has recently shown that the
                    tentacles are supported by a mesoblastic skeleton, as is also the case in
                    Rhabdopleura, but apparently not the case in any other Polyzoa. Close to the
                    mouth, as in all Polyzoa, is placed the anus, outside the horse-shoe-shaped
                    lophophore or tentacular platform (fig.</p>
                <p>11, <hi rend="italic">i).</hi> The tentacular crown is not intro versible; in
                    this point Phoronis differs from Paludicella and the Ectoproctous Eupolyzoa, and
                    agrees with the Entoprocta and the Pterobranchia. Overhanging the mouth is a
                    small praeoral lobe or “epistome” (figs. 4, 5, c). This organ is aborted in
                    Paludicella, and indeed in all the Gymnolaema, but is present in the other
                    Polyzoa, and is especially large and well developed in Rhabdopleura and
                    Cephalodiscus. It has been compared to the Molluscan foot, but undoubtedly in
                    Phoronis it is the persistent representative of the prae-oral <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n453/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0453-0434"/> lobe of the larva (fig. 6), and therefore cannot
                    be compared to the Molluscan foot. If we are right in associating Phoronis with
                    the Polyzoa, this fact is sufficient to show that the epistome of the
                    Phylactolaema (fig. 11, <hi rend="italic">e)</hi> and the buccal shield of
                    Rhabdopleura (fig. 7, &lt;Z) and of Cephalodiscus (fig. 9, ό) are also cephalic
                    in nature, and cannot rightly be identified with the post-oral and ventral
                    muscular lobe known as the foot in Mollusca. A circum-oral nerve ring occurs at
                    the base of the tentacles and sends off a cord which runs along the left side of
                    the body. The alimentary canal presents the same general form and regions as in
                    Paludicella. It hangs in the body-cavity, to the walls of which it is suspended
                    by definite mesenteries.Phoronis presents a closed contractile vascular system
                    containing red-coloured blood-corpuscles (figs. 4, 5, <hi rend="italic">f, g,
                    h).</hi> A pair of ciliated canals acting as genital pores is found near the
                    anus; these have been shown by Caldwell to be typical nephridia.The development
                    of Phoronis is remarkable. The egg gives rise (after the usual phases of
                    cleavage and gastrulation) to the larval form knoλvn as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actinotrocha</hi> (fig. 6). This larva possesses a hood-like region overhanging
                    the mouth and a number of ciliated post-oral processes or tentacles. The anus is
                    placed at the extremity of the elongate body opposite to that bearing the mouth
                    and prae-oral hood. The prae-oral hood becomes the epistome, and the tentacles,
                    by further development (new tentacles replacing the larval ones), become the
                    horse-shoe-shaped group of tentacles of the adult. A very curious process of
                    growth changes the long axis of the body and results in the anus assuming its
                    permanent position near the mouth. An invagination appears on the ventral face
                    of the larva between the anus and mouth, and attains considerable size. At a
                    definite moment in the course of growth this invagination is suddenly everted,
                    carrying with it in its cavity the intestine in the form of a loop. Thus a new
                    long axis is suddenly established at right angles to the original oro-anal axis,
                    and continues to develop as the main portion of the body. The short area
                    extending from the prae-oral hood to the anus is thus the true <hi rend="italic"
                    >dorsal</hi> surface of Phoronis, whilst the elongated body is an outgrowth of
                    the ventral surface perpendicular to the primary oro-anal axis, as conversely in
                    many Mollusca we find a short <hi rend="italic">ventral</hi> area (the foot)
                    between mouth and anus, and an outgrowth of the dorsal surface (the visceral
                    hump) perpendicular to the primary oro-anal axis, forming the chief body of the
                    animal. In these relations Phoronis (and with it the other Polyzoa) agrees with
                    Sipunculus. On the other hand Echiurus, the Chaetopods, Nemertine worms, and
                    some other groups which start from a simple larval form not unlike that of
                    Phoronis, present a continual elongation of the original oro-anal axis, and no
                    transference of the long axis by the perpendicular or angular growth of either
                    the ventral or the dorsal surface of the larva.</p>
                <p>Phoronis was discovered originally in the Firth of Forth by Dr Strethill Wright.
                    It occurs in the Mediterranean and in Australian seas (Port Jackson).</p>
                <p>THE PTEROBRANCHIA.</p>
                <p>This section of the Polyzoa also comprises forms which differ very widely from
                    Paludicella. Inasmuch as their development from the egg is at present quite
                    unknown, it may possibly prove that they have other affinities. Only two genera
                    are known, Rhabdopleura (Allman) and Cephalodiscus (MTntosh), the former dredged
                    by Dr Norman in deep water off the Shetlands (and subsequently in Norway), the
                    latter taken by the “Challenger” expedition in 250 fathoms off the coast of
                    Patagonia.</p>
                <p>The Pterobranchia have the mouth and anus closely approximated, and immediately
                    below the mouth are given off a series of ciliated tentacles, but these do not
                    form a complete circle as in Paludicella, nor is the lophophore (the platform of
                    their origin) horse-shoe-shaped as in Phoronis. The lophophore is drawn out into
                    a right and a left arm in Rhabdopleura (fig. 7), upon each of which are two rows
                    of ciliated tentacles; no tentacles are developed centrally in the region
                    between the two arms, so that the mouth is not completely surrounded by these
                    processes. The horseshoe-shaped lophophore of Phoronis could be modified so as
                    to represent the tentaculiferous arms of Rhabdopleura by suppressing both rows
                    of tentacles at the curve of the horse-shoe, and leaving only those which occur
                    on the arms or rami of the horse shoe (see fig. 4). The lophophore of
                    Cephalodiscus presents us with twelve processes, each carrying two rows of
                    ciliated tentacles; in fact we have six pairs of tantaculiferous arms instead of
                    a single pair, and each of these arms is precisely similar to one of the arms of
                    Rhabdopleura (fig. 9), excepting that it terminates in a knob instead of
                    tapering. There is no arrangement for introverting the anterior portion of the
                    body into the hinder portion in the Pterobranchia.</p>
                <p>The little epistome or prae-oral lobe of Phoronis is represented in the
                    Pterobranchia by a large muscular shield or disk-like structure (fig. 7, <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> and fig. 9, δ) which overhangs the mouth and has an
                    actively secreting glandular <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n454/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0454-0435"/> surface by which the tube or case (tubarium) in
                    which the polypide is enclosed is secreted.Both Rhabdopleura and Cephalodiscus
                    produce colonies by budding; but the colonies of the former are large, definite,
                    and arborescent, whilst those of Cephalodiscus are remarkable for the fact that
                    the buds do not remain long in organic continuity with their parent, but become
                    detached and nevertheless continue to be enclosed by the same common envelope or
                    secretion. The bud-formation of Rhabdopleura recalls that of Paludicella in the
                    fact that it leads to the formation of continuous arboriform communities. That
                    of Cephalodiscus resembles the budding of Loxosoma, since no two fully-formed
                    individuals remain in organic continuity. Both Rhabdopleura and Cephalodiscus
                    (like Phoronis) produce cases or investments in which they dwell. These are free
                    secretions of the organism, and are not, like the coenoecia of Eupolyzoa,
                    cuticular structures adherent to and part of the polypide’s integument. The
                    dwelling of Rhabdopleura is a branched system of annulated tubes of a delicate
                    membranous consistency, each tube corresponding to a single polypide, the rings
                    of which it is built being successively produced at the termination of the tube
                    by the secreting activity of the prae-oral disk (fig. 7, E). The polypides
                    freely ascend and descend in these tubes owing to the contractility of their
                    stalks. On the other hand the dwelling of Cephalodiscus is a gelatinous,
                    irregularly branched, and fimbriated mass (fig. 8), excavated by numerous
                    cavities which communicate with the exterior. In these cavities are found the
                    numerous <hi rend="italic">detached</hi> small colonies of Cephalodiscus (fig.
                    9), or we should rather say the isolated budding polypides. The remaining
                    important feature in the organization of the Pterobranchia, namely, the parts
                    connected with the formation of buds, are best understood by first examining
                    Cephalodiscus. The body of Cephalodiscus is seen (fig. 9) to be an oval sac; in
                    this is suspended the U-shaped alimentary canal, and from the walls of its
                    cavity (coelom) the ova and the spermatozoa are developed. Projecting from the
                    ventral face of this oval sac is a muscular cylindrical stalk, into which the
                    viscera do not pass, though the coelom is continued into it (fig. 9, c). This
                    stalk is merely the outdrawn termination of the body. It is about as long as the
                    whole of the rest of the animal, and it is from its extremity that the buds are
                    produced (fig.</p>
                <p>9, a). Before the buds have attained half the size of their parent they become
                    detached, but continue to occupy some portion of the common gelatinous
                    dwelling.</p>
                <p>Turning to Rhabdopleura, we find that each polypide has a body of similar shape
                    and character to that described for Cephalodiscus, and a similar ventrally
                    developed <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> stalk ' ’ (fig. 7, A, c). But, inasmuch
                    as the buds developed<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0455-0436"/> on the stalk of a Rhabdopleura polypide do not
                    detach themselves, we find that we can trace the stalk of each polypide of a
                    colony into connexion with the stalk of the polypide from which it was
                    originally budded, which may now be considered as a “branch” bearing manystalked
                    polypides upon its greatly extended length, and such a “branch-stalk” may be
                    further traced to its junction with the “stem-stalk” of the whole colony. The
                    stem-stalk was at one time the simple terminal stalk of a single polypide, but
                    by lateral budding it gave rise to other polypides, and so became a gemmiferous
                    “branch”; and further, when some of these in their turn budded and became
                    branches, it became the main “stem” of a copious colony.</p>
                <p>A serious error has been made in comparing the contractile stalk of the
                    Pterobranchiate polypide to the “funiculus <hi rend="italic">” or</hi> cord-like
                    mesentery of Eupolyzoa. With this it has morphologically nothing in common,
                    since it is not an internal organ, but simply the elongated termination or stalk
                    of the body, comparable to the stalk of Pedicellina (fig. 15) and Loxosomι (fig.
                    16), or to the hydrocaulus of such a Hydrozoon colony as Cordylophora. The stalk
                    where it bears only very young buds, or none at all,⅛s is always its condition
                    in Cephalodiscus and in many polypides of a Rhabdopleura colony, may be called a
                    “gymnocaulus”; when once its buds have developed into full grown polypides, and
                    it has elongated proportionally with their growth, it becomes a “pectocaulus”;
                    that is to say, it is to that part of it which bears such polypides that this
                    term may be conveniently applied. The pectocaulus of Rhabdopleura, both in the
                    form of branch and stem, undergoes remarkable change of appearance as compared
                    with the gymnocaulus. It loses its contractility, shrinks, and develops on its
                    surface a hard, dark, horny cuticle (whence its name), comparable precisely in
                    its nature to the hardened cuticle which forms the zooecia of Eupolyzoa. It now
                    has the appearance of a black cord or rod-like body lying within and adherent to
                    the inner face of the much wider tubular stem, and branches formed by the
                    gradual building up and arborescent extension of the annotated tubarium secreted
                    by the individual polypides. It has been regarded both by Allman and by Sars as
                    a special structure, and called by the former “the chitinous rod” or
                    “blastophore,” by the latter “the axial cord.”</p>
                <p>In reality it is the black-coloured pectocaulus of Rhabdopleura which corresponds
                    to the coenoecium of an ordinary Polyzoon; whilst the term “coenoecium” is
                    totally inapplicable morphologically to the annulated branched tube in which the
                    Rhabdopleura colony lives, this having absolutely no parallel in the
                    Eupolyzoa.</p>
                <p>A sac-like testis has been discovered in Rhabdopleura opening by the side of the
                    anus (Lankester, 7); but the ova have not yet been seen, nor is anything known
                    of its development. Similarly the eggs of Cephalodiscus are observed within the
                    body of the parent in the “Challenger” specimens, but nothing further is known
                    of its life-history.</p>
                <p>A body-cavity is present (Lankester), though its existence has been denied by
                    Sars and by M*Intosh. Nephridia and nerve ganglia are not described.
                    Cephalodiscus has two remarkable eye spots dorsal to the cephalic disk (fig. 10,
                    y).</p>
                <p>THE EUPOLYZOA.</p>
                <p>Whilst it is necessary to include in the group Polyzoa the forms we have already
                    noticed as Vermiformia and Pterobranchia, there can be no doubt that those
                    organisms to which we assign the name Eupolyzoa are primarily those upon which
                    naturalists have framed their conception of the group, and that they constitute
                    a very consistent assemblage, held together by well-defined characters, and yet
                    presenting an immense number of varied forms showing a wide range of
                    modifications.</p>
                <p>All the Eupolyzoa have closely approximated mouth and anus, and, like
                    Paludicella, a complete range of hollow ciliate tentacles, describing either a
                    circle or a horse shoe, surrounding the mouth. The anus as well as the mouth is
                    included in this area in a few exceptional forms (the Entoprocta); it lies near
                    but outside the lophophore (as the area is termed) in the vast majority (the
                    Ectoprocta). Except in the Entoprocta, where the movement is limited, the whole
                    anterior portion of the body bearing the lophophore can be invaginated into the
                    hinder part (as described above for the typical Eupolyzoon Paludicella). This
                    character distinguishes the Eupolyzoa from both Vermiformia and Pterobranchia.
                    The polypides of all the Eupolyzoa are minute, but all produce buds which remain
                    in organic continuity with their parent (except in Loxosoma) and build up very
                    considerable and sometimes massive colonies.</p>
                <p>In all Eupolyzoa the cuticle of the hinder part of each polypide is thick and
                    dense, thus forming a hard-walled sac, the zooecium. This is peculiar to and
                    universal in the Eupolyzoa (except Loxosoma), and is not to be confounded with
                    the non-adherent tubes of Phoronis and Rhabdopleura or the jelly-house of
                    Cephalodiscus. The connected zooecia of a colony of Eupolyzoa constitute a
                    coenoecium. A simple nerve ganglion between mouth and anus, a large body-cavity
                    (except in Entoprocta), simple gonads without accessory glands or ducts, usually
                    testis and ovary in the same polypide, absence of a blood-vascular system, of
                    any but the most rudimentary nephridia, and of eyes, otocysts, or other special
                    sense-organs, are features characterizing all adult Eupolyzoa.</p>
                <p>The section Eupolyzoa, with its vast number of species and genera, requires a
                    somewhat elaborate classification. The forms in which the anus is enclosed
                    within the tentacular circle are very few, and are peculiar in other respects.
                    We follow Nitsche (8) in separating them as the sub-class Entoprocta from the

                    ellipse and locomotive (fig. 3). In addition to the multiplication of polypides
                    in a colony by budding, and to the annual production of new individuals from
                    fertilized eggs which initiate new colonies, a reproduction by internal buds
                    called “statoblasts,” comparable to the gemmae of Spongilla, has been observed
                    in all the genera (fig. 3, δ). The statoblasts are developed from the funiculus
                    (mesentery), and are enclosed in ornate lenticular capsules of chitinous
                    substance, characteristic in form in each species.</p>
                <p>The fertilized egg of the Phylactolaema does not give rise to a zonociliate
                    larva, but to a uniformly ciliate cystlike diblastula, which develops directly
                    and produces polypides by budding. The Phylactolaema are all inhabitants of
                    fresh water (lacustrine).</p>
                <p>The Phylactolaema include the genera Lophopus, Cristatella, Alcyonella,
                    Plumatelia, and Fredericella, which have been beautifully figured and described
                    in Allman’s classical <hi rend="italic">Freshwater Polyzoa,</hi> Bay Society,
                    1856. The colonies of Lophopus are small, consisting of half a dozen polypides
                    embedded in a massive glass-like coenoecium. Cristatella (fig. 3) is remarkable
                    amongst all Polyzoa for its locomotive zoarium. Alcyonella forms massive
                    coenoecia of many hundred polypides, as large as a man’s fist. Plumatella and
                    Fredericella are delicate arborescent forms commonly encrusting stones and the
                    leaves of water-plants. All the genera known are British.</p>
                <p>The Phylactolaema furnish a remarkable instance of a well-marked zoological group
                    being confined to fresh water. Their reproduction by statoblasts (not known in
                    the marine Polyzoa) appears to be related to the special conditions of
                    lacustrine life, since it is also observed under· the same exceptional
                    conditions in the single freshwater genus of another great group of animals,
                    viz., Spongilla. Also related to their non-marine conditions of life is the
                    development of the fertilized egg, which, as in so many similar-cases, does not
                    produce the remarkable banded forms of locomotive larvae which are
                    characteristic of their marine congeners.</p>
                <p>Order 2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gymnolaema,</hi> Allman.</p>
                <p>Ectoproctous Eupolyzoa in which the polypide is devoid of any trace of the
                    prae-oral lobe or epistome, whilst the lophophore is perfectly circular. The
                    polypides of a colony are frequently highly differentiated as avicularia,
                    vibracu laria, ocecia (egg-receptacles), and even as root and stem segments. The
                    neighbouring polypides of a colony communicate (?) with one another by
                    “rosette-plates” or “communication-plates ”—perforated areas in the walls of
                    contiguous zocecia. The greatest variety in the character of the cuticle forming
                    the zooecia (gelatinous, horny, calcareous) and in the grouping of the
                    polypides, as well as in the shape of their zocecia, is observed in different
                    sub-orders and families. In addition to the ordinary sexual reproduction, there
                    are various modifications of the process of budding, the full exposition of
                    which would necessitate more space than is here allotted, and is not yet indeed
                    within the possibilities of present knowledge. The fertilized egg of the
                    Gymnolaema gives rise to remarkable ciliate larvae of various forms (figs. 19,
                    20, 21), from which the first polypide of a colony is developed by an
                    extraordinary and unexplained series of changes. The Gymnolaema are, with the
                    single exception of the genus Paludicella, inhabitants of the sea.</p>
                <p>The Gymnolaema are divided, according to the system of Busk, into three
                    sub-orders characterized by the shape of their zooecia, and the nature of the
                    mouth-like margin which it presents when the exsertile portion of the polypide
                    is withdrawn within it. The Cyclostoma have long tubular zocecia, often of large
                    size and often calcified, placed side by side in cylindrical bundles, or in
                    other definite grouping; the mouth of the zooecium is circular and devoid of
                    processes. There is little or no differentiation of the polypides constituting a
                    colony. Most of this group are fossil, and the living genera belong mostly to
                    southern seas. The genera Crisia (fig. 13, A), Diastopora, Tubulipora, and
                    Hornera are typical. The Ctenostoma have usually a soft zooecium; its orifice is
                    closed by the folds of the retracted polypide or by a circlet of bristles which
                    surround it. <hi rend="italic">Alcyonidium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gelatinosum</hi> is the commonest representative of this group on the British
                    coasts. Bowerbankia (fig. 1, A) and Paludicella (fig. 1, E) also belong here.
                    The Chilostoma form the largest and most varied suborder of Gymnolaema. The
                    zooecia are horny or calcified; their orifices can be closed by a projecting lip
                    in the form of an operculum. The operculum is a separable plate developed on the
                    cuticle of the retractile part of the polypide, and has muscles attached to it
                    (fig. 13, B, C, D). The surface of the zooecia is frequently sculptured, and its
                    orifice provided with processes and spines (fig. 1, C, F). Very usually some of
                    the polypides of a colony are modified asavicularia, vibracula ria, radical
                    fibres, and ocecia. The avicularium is a polypide reduced to a simple muscular
                    apparatus working upon the modified operculum and zooecium so as to cause these
                    hard parts to act as a snapping apparatus comparable to a bird’s head (fig. 12,
                    o). They are frequently found regularly distributed among the normal cells of a
                    colony, and probably have a cleansing function similar to that attributed to the
                    Pedicellariae of the Echinoderms. “Vibracularia” are even more simplified
                    polypides, being little more than motile filaments, probably tactile in
                    function. The opercula of zocecia, ocecia, and avicularia have recently been
                    used by Busk in characterizing genera and species, in a systematic way.
                    Stem-building and root-forming polypides are frequently found, being closed
                    polypides which subserve anchoring or supporting functions for the benefit of
                    the whole colony. The stem of Kinetoskias (fig. 14) is produced <pb break="no"

                    the inversion of the broad truncated extremity of the cup-shaped body.
                    Tentacular crown not further introversible, the individual tentacles (as in the
                    Pterobranchia and unlike the Ectoprocta) capable of being flexed and partially
                    rolled up so as to overhang the mouth (see fig. 15, B and C). Bodycavity
                    (ccelom) almost completely obliterated. The anti-tentacular region of the
                    polypide’s body is drawn out to form a stalk similar to the gymnocaulus of the
                    Pterobranchia. The extremity of this stalk is provided with a cement gland in
                    the young condition which persists in the adult of some species <hi

                    small nephridia are present.</p>
                <p>The Entoprocta consist of the marine genera Pedicellina (fig. 15), Loxosoma (fig.
                    16), and probably the insufficiently known freshwater American genus Urnatelia
                    of Leidy. To these must be added Busk’s new genus Ascopodaria, as yet
                    undescribed, based on a specimen dredged by the “Challenger,” showing a number
                    of Pedicellina-like polypides, carried as an umbel on a common stalk of very
                    peculiar structure. Pedicellina is found attached to algae, shells, zoophytes,
                    &lt;fcc., and to the integument of some Gephyraean worms <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Sipunculus punctatus)</hi> and Annelids (Aphrodite); Loxosoma occurs on
                    various worms, &amp;c. Whilst the buds of Pedicellina remain connected so as to
                    constitute a colony, those produced by Loxosoma are continually detached, so
                    that the polypide is solitary. Further, the cup-like body of Pedicellina is
                    deciduous, and frequently falls from the stalk and is replaced by new growth.
                    There is less distinction between body and stalk in Loxosoma, and the former
                    does not become detached. Apparently a very important feature in the structure
                    of the Entoprocta is the absence of a body-cavity. This is, however, more,
                    apparent than real. The Entoprocta are true Coelomata, but the ccelom is
                    partially obliterated by the growth of mesoblastic tissue. The nephridia
                    presumably lie in a space which, small as it is, represents the coelom. See
                    Harmer (18) for details.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Genealogical Relationships of the Groups of Polyzoa.</hi></p>
                <p>It is necessary that we should try to form some opinion as to which of the
                    various groups of Polyzoa are most like the ancestral form from which they have
                    all sprung, and what are the probable lines of descent within the group. Any
                    attempt of the kind is speculative, but it is absolutely needful since zoology
                    has become a science—that is to say, an investigation of causes and not merely a
                    record of unexplained observations—to enter upon such questions. Colonial
                    organisms have necessarily descended from solitary ancestors, and it is probable
                    that the ancestral form of Polyzoa was not only solitary, as are Phoronis and
                    Loxosoma at the present day, but of relatively large size and more elaborately
                    organized than the majority of living Polyzoa. Whilst the polypides have
                    dwindled in size and lost some of their internal organs, the mcdern Polyzoa have
                    developed <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with this degeneration an elaborate
                    system of bud-production and colony-formation. The new individuality (the
                    tertiary aggregate) attains a high degree of development (Cristatella,
                    Kinetoskias) in proportion as the constituent units merged in this new
                    individuality have suffered a degeneration. The prae-oral lobe (epistome, buccal
                    disk) present in all Polyzoa except the most minute and most elaborately
                    colonial forms— namely, the Gymnolaema—is to be regarded as an ancestral
                    structure which has been lost by the Gymnolaema. The horse-shoe-shaped
                    lophophore, such as we see it in Phoronis and in Lophopus, is probably the
                    ancestral form, and has given rise to the two other extreme forms of
                    lophophore,— namely, the “pterobranchiate,” associated -with a great development
                    of the epistome, and the “circular,” associated with a complete suppression of
                    the epistome. The ento-proctous lophophore is a special modification of the
                    horseshoe-shaped, as shown in the diagram fig. 15, C. The formation of zooecia,
                    and so of an elaborate colonial skeleton, was not a primary feature of the
                    Polyzoa. Even after budding and colony-formation had been established zooecia
                    were not at once produced, but possibly dwellings of another kind
                    (Pterobranchia). We are thus led to look upon the Gymnolaema as the extreme
                    modification of the Polyzoon type. Starting with an organism similar to
                    Phoronis, we may suppose the following branchings in the pedigree to have
                    occurred.</p>

                <p>From all that has preceded it appears that the really distinctive characters
                    common to all the Polyzoa may be summed up as follows :—</p>
                <p>Coelomata with closely approximated mouth and anus, the bulk of the body forming
                    a more or less elongate growth at right angles to the original (ancestral)
                    oro-anal axis, and starting from the original ventral <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> oral) surface. A variously modified group of ciliated tentacles is
                    disposed around the mouth, being essentially the development by digitiform
                    upgrowth of a post-oral ciliated band.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n459/mode/1up"

                <p>As negative characters it is important to note the absence of all trace of
                    metameric segmentation, of setae, and of paired lateral (parapodia of
                    Appendiculata) or median ventral (podium of Mollusca) outgrowths of the
                    body-wall.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Larval Forms of Polyzoa.</hi></p>
                <p>In the consideration of the probable pedigree and affinities of the Polyzoa, we
                    are not at present able to make use of the facts of development from the egg, on
                    account of the extreme difficulty which the study of the young stages of these
                    organisms presents. In the case of Phoronis we have the only readily
                    intelligible history. The larva, to start with, is of that form known as an
                    archi-troch (see Lankester, “Notes on Embryology and Classification,” <hi
                    rend="italic">Quart. Journ. Mier. Sci.,</hi> 1876), having a prae-oral ciliated
                    area (velum or cephalotroch) continuous with a post-oral ciliated band (the
                    branchiotroch), which latter becomes developed into the tentacular crown of the
                    adult.</p>
                <p>The actinotrocha (Phoronis) larva is readily comparable with the trochosphere
                    larvae of Echinoderms, Chaetopods, Gephyraeans, and Molluscs. Its special
                    character consists in the strong development of the post-oral ciliated band,
                    whereas the prae-oral ciliated band is in most other classes (the. Sipunculoids
                    excepted) the predominant one. The Phoronis larva exhibits first of all an
                    oro-anal long axis, and this is suddenly abandoned for a new long axis by the
                    growth of the ventral surface of the larva at right angles to the primary axis
                    (hence the term Podaxonia).</p>
                <p>In the other Polyzoa we do not at present know of any larva which retains even in
                    its earliest phases the original oro-anal long axis. They all appear to start at
                    once with the peculiar and secondary long axis of the adult Phoronis, so that
                    Balfour has diagrammatically represented the Polyzoon larva by the sketch given
                    in fig. 19. This diagram applies, however, more especially to the Entoprocta,
                    since the anus is represented as included in the area of the post-oral ciliated
                    ring. The development of Pedicellina has been very carefully followed by
                    Hatschek, and may be said to be the only instance among the Eupolyzoa in which
                    the growth of the different organs and the consequent relation of the form of
                    the larva to the form of the adult is understood (see figs. 17 and 18).</p>
                <p>In the other Polyzoa, in spite of the painstaking and minute studies of Barrois
                    (14), the fact is that we do not know what face of the larva corresponds to the
                    tentacular area, what to the stalk or anti-tentacular extremity, what to the
                    anterior and what to the posterior surface. The conversion of the larva into the
                    first polypide has not been observed in the case of these free-swimming forms,
                    and it is even probable that no such conversion ever takes place, but that the
                    first polypide forms as a bud upon the bodywall of the larva.</p>
                <p>Two of the most remarkable forms of free-swimming larvae of Gymnolaema are
                    represented in figs. 20 and 21. In both, in addition to the chief post-oral
                    ciliated band, a smaller ciliated ring is observed, which is identified by
                    Balfour with that which is found at the anti-tentacular extremity (base of the
                    stalk) in the Pedicellina larva.</p>
                <p>It does not seem justifiable, in the face of the existing uncertainties as to
                    identification of parts, and in view of the high probability that the Gymnolaema
                    are extremely modified and degenerate forms (a consideration which applies in
                    some respects even more strongly to the Entoprocta), to assume that the larval
                    form schematized in fig. 19 represents an ancestral condition of the Polyzoa.
                    Professor Balfour (15) was, however, led to entertain such a view; and, assuming
                    that the chief ciliated band (drawn as a broad black line) corresponds to the
                    single prae-oral ciliated band of the trochosphere larva of Eehiurus,
                    Polygordius, Chaetopods, and Mollusca, he pointed out that in both cases the
                    ciliated girdle divides the larva into a hemisphere in which mouth and anus lie
                    and a hemisphere which is the complement of this; in most classes the first
                    hemisphere elongates and forms the bulk of the body, whilst the second
                    hemisphere forms the prostomium or prae-oral lobe. But, according to Balfour’s
                    theory, in Polyzoa it is the second hemisphere which enlarges and becomes the
                    stalk-like body of the adult, whilst the first hemisphere remains small and
                    insignificant. Thus the Polyzoa would fix themselves in later growth by what
                    corresponds to the head or prostomium of other animals, as do the Barnacles and
                    the Ascidians. Ingenious as this speculation is, we must remember that it takes
                    no account of the facts known as to Phoronis, nor of the Pterobranchia, and that
                    it is confessedly based upon the assumption that the larvae of extremely
                    degenerate and peculiar members of the group are not adaptive and modified, but
                    retain primary and archaic characters. Further, it is to be distinctly borne in
                    mind that the interpretation of parts upon which this speculation rests is,
                    except in the case of Pedicellina, altogether hypothetical.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Relations of the Polyzoa to the Brachiopoda.</hi></p>
                <p>The Polyzoa were first associated with the Brachiopoda by H. Milne-Edwards. The
                    investigation of the development of Terebratulina by Morse (16) led to a further
                    perception of the points of agreement in structure between these two groups.
                    Lastly, Caldwell (6) has shown that the mesenteries of Phoronis have precisely
                    similar relations to the lophophore, the nephridia, and the termination of the
                    intestine as have the gastro-parietal and ilio-ρarietal bands or mesenteries of
                    the Terebratulidae. The young Terebratulina (fig. 22) may be readily compared
                    with Loxosoma (fig. 16),—the peduncle with its cement glands in the former being
                    identical with the stalk and basal gland of the latter. The form of the
                    alimentary canal <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n460/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0460-0441"/> and the disposition of the tentacular arms (fig.
                    23) is the same in Brachiopoda and Polyzoa. The nephridia (oviducts) of
                    Terebratula have a position and relations similar to those of the nephridia
                    (genital ducts) of Phoronis. The chief difference between Polyzoa and
                    Brachiopoda consists in the special development of the margin of the cupped end
                    of the body, into which the lophophore is sunk, as in Pedicellina (see fig. 15,
                    B, c). This up-standing margin is enormously increased in the Brachiopoda, so as
                    to form a voluminous hood or collar, which surrounds the large tentacular arms,
                    and forms a protective chamber for them. It is notched right and left so as to
                    be divided into two lobes, and on its surface is developed a horny or a
                    calcareous shell in two corresponding moieties. Until recently it was held (see
                    Lankester, 17) that both Brachiopoda and Polyzoa were modifications of the
                    Molluscan type, and the Brachiopods’ collar was identified with the palliai fold
                    of Mollusca. The resemblance of the two structures must now be considered as
                    purely homoplastic, and not as having any real morphological (homogenetic)
                    significance.</p>
                <p>The larvae of the Brachiopoda (figs. 24, 25) are as exceptional and difficult of
                    interpretation as those of Polyzoa, but no attempt has been yet made to show
                    that the one can be reduced to a common form with the other. The three segments
                    presented by some Brachiopod larvae (fig. 25) have been compared to the segments
                    of Chaetopod worms by some writers; and these, together with the presence of
                    setae, have been regarded as indicative of affinity between the Brachiopoda and
                    Chaetopoda (Morse). But it is sufficient, in order to dispose of this
                    suggestion, to point out that the segments of the Chaetopoda follow one another
                    along the primary oro-anal axis, whilst those of Brachiopoda are developed along
                    an axis at right angles to this (Caldwell).</p>
                <p>The Brachiopoda must be classified together with the Polyzoa and Sipunculoidea in
                    a phylum (Podaxonia) characterized by the development of this secondary
                    axis.</p>
