                    commonly called the abbé Prévost, one of the most important French novelists of
                    the 18th century, was born at Hesdin in Artois on 1st April 1697. His father was
                    of good family, and held legal employments of some importance. Prévost was
                    educated by the Jesuits, first at Hesdin and then at Paris. At the age of
                    sixteen he left the Collège d’Harcourt and enlisted. This was, however, at the
                    close of the War of the Spanish Succession, and he soon returned to the Jesuits,
                    and was almost persuaded to enter the order. According to some accounts he
                    actually did so, but a truant disposition once more came on him and he again
                    joined the army, apparently obtaining some commission. It is, however, not easy
                    to make his statement that he passed five or six years thus tally with the
                    positive assertion that in 1719 he once more sought the cloister, this time
                    joining the famous learned community of the Benedictines of St Maur. He took the
                    vows finally in 1720, and it would appear that for some seven years he devoted
                    himself without repining to study at various houses of the order, preaching,
                    teaching, and writing some part of the <hi rend="italic">Gallia Christiana.</hi>
                    In 1727, however, or thereabouts (for the details of Prévost’s life, though
                    unusually interesting, are most vaguely and insufficiently recorded) he once
                    more broke bounds and fled to Holland. It is said that the immediate occasion
                    was nothing more than a wish which he had formed to be transferred to Cluny, and
                    which made him commit some technical misdemeanour. However this may be, he was
                    for six years an exile in Holland and England, and one story even asserts that
                    he contracted a regular or rather irregular marriage during this period. He
                    certainly published the first of his remarkable novels, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">un Homme</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Qualité,</hi> in 1728, and continued them for some years.
                    Besides this he produced much miscellaneous work— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cléve-</hi><hi rend="italic">land,</hi> another novel <hi rend="italic">;
                    Manon</hi><hi rend="italic">Lescaut,</hi> his masterpiece (which is a kind of
                    appendix to his first book); and a periodical publication, partly in the style
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> and partly in that of a literary review,
                    called <hi rend="italic">Le Pour et le Contre.</hi> All these were begun and
                    most of them were finished before 1735, when he was back in France and produced
                    his last novel of importance, the <hi rend="italic">Doyen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de Killérine,</hi> in which, as in <hi rend="italic">Cléveland,</hi> he made
                    much use of his English sojourn. He returned to France openly and with the royal
                    permission, being allowed to wear the dress of the secular priesthood. Among his
                    patrons the cardinal de Bissy and the prince de Conti are named; the latter made
                    him his chaplain. He lived for nearly thirty years longer, composing, though not
                    for bread, an extraordinary number of books, some of them original, some
                    compilations. Amongst them were an <hi rend="italic">Histoire Générale</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Voyages,</hi> historical compilations on William the Conqueror
                    and Margaret of Anjou, letters, moral essays, semi-scientific works,
                    translations (including <hi rend="italic">Pamela</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clarissa),</hi> and some original pieces. Of all these the novel called <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire d'une Grecque Moderne</hi> (1741) has alone attracted
                    some attention in modern times. Prévost was a facile writer and a fair critic,
                    but except for his first three novels, and especially for <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manon Lescaut,</hi> he would hardly be remembered save as a man of a curiously
                    eventful and very imperfectly recorded life. His death itself has a kind of
                    legendary character, and some of the circumstances are, it may be hoped,
                    fictitious. He lived in a small cottage (for, despite his immense literary work
                    on subjects which for the most part occupy only writers for money, he seems to
                    have written <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n743/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0743-0720"/> purely for love) at Chantilly, and it was his
                    custom to walk much in the woods there. What is agreed is that he was struck
                    with apoplexy during one of these walks, on 23d November 1763, and was found
                    senseless. The legend adds the hideous particular that he was not dead, and that
                    a clumsy village surgeon, heedlessly beginning what he supposed to be a <hi
                    rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, at once recalled his patient to life
                    and killed him. Even without this detail there is sufficient romantic interest
                    (without other stories, some of them demonstrably fictitious, such as that he
                    was accidentally the cause of his father’s death) about this life of a man who
                    is at the same time uniformly represented as an indefatigable student and one of
                    a quiet and easygoing temperament.</p>
                <p>Prevost’s three chief romances, the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cleveland,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Doyen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Killérine,</hi> are not unremarkable, because they hold a kind
                    of middle place between the incident-romance of Le Sage and Defoe and the
                    sentiment - romance of Marivaux and Richardson; but they all have the defect of
                    intolerable length and of an indefinite fluency. <hi rend="italic">Manon</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lescaut,</hi> his one masterpiece, and one of the greatest novels
                    of the century, is in both these respects so different that it might seem
                    impossible that the same man should have written it. It is very short, it is
                    entirely free from improbable incident, it is penetrated by the truest and the
                    most cunningly managed feeling, and almost every one of its characters is a
                    triumph of that analytic portraiture which is the secret of the modern novel.
                    The chevalier des Grieux, the hero, is probably the most perfect example of the
                    carrying out of the sentiment “All for love and the world well lost” that exists
                    in fiction (it is curious that Prévost translated Dryden’s play of the name), at
                    least where the circumstances are those of ordinary and probable life. Tiberge,
                    his friend, is hardly inferior in the difficult part of mentor and reasonable
                    man. Lescaut, the heroine’s brother, has vigorous touches as a bully and
                    Bohemian; but the triumph of the book is Manon herself. Animated by a real
                    affection for her lover, and false to him only because her incurable love of
                    splendour, comfort, and luxury prevents her from welcoming privation with him or
                    for him, though in effect she prefers him to all others, perfectly natural and
                    even amiable in her degradation, and yet showing the moral of that degradation
                    more .vividly than a hundred characters drawn with a less complacent pencil
                    could have done, Manon is one of the most remarkable heroines in all fiction.
                    She had no literary ancestress; she seems to have sprung entirely from the
                    imagination, or perhaps the sympathetic observation, of the wandering scholar
                    who drew her. Only the <hi rend="italic">Princesse de Clèves</hi> can challenge
                    comparison with her before or near to her own date, and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manon</hi><hi rend="italic">Lescaut</hi> the plot is much more complete and
                    interesting, the sentiments less artificial, and the whole story nearer to
                    actual life than in Madame de la Fayette’s masterpiece. It is not easy to name a
                    novel on the same scale which is more directly and naturally affecting at a
                    first reading, and which on subsequent study approves itself more thoroughly as
                    a work of art, than <hi rend="italic">Manon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lescaut.</hi></p>
                <p>There is no complete edition of Prévost’s works. Oeuvres Choisies were published
                    in 1783, and again in 1806. Of Manon Lescaut the editions are very numerous.</p>
