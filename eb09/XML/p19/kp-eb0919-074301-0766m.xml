                    royal household, and both were rewarded with posts in Government offices of
                    trade; and there was besides not a little in common between them as poets. There
                    are not two careers in literature that offer more numerous or more curious
                    points of parallelism. The vintner’s nephew in the reign of Charles II. (born,
                    July 21, 1644, either, it would appear, at Wimborne in Dorsetshire, or in or
                    near London) attracted the notice of a noble patron while still at school at
                    Westminster, under the famous Dr Busby. The earl of Dorset was with a party at
                    the tavern, and the schoolboy was called in to decide some debate that had
                    arisen about a passage in Horace. According to the story, Prior acquitted
                    himself so well that the earl, the Maecenas of his generation, at once undertook
                    to send him to Cambridge, and he was entered at St John’s in 1682. As it
                    happened a fellow schoolboy at Westminster was Charles Montague, who afterwards
                    became earl of Halifax. The two continued comrades at Cambridge, and together
                    wrote in 1687 the <hi rend="italic">City Mouse and Country Mouse,</hi> in
                    ridicule of Dryden’s <hi rend="italic">Hind and Panther.</hi> It was an age when
                    satirists were in request, and sure of patronage and promotion. The joint
                    production made the fortune of both authors. Montague, who was an earl’s
                    grandson, was promoted at once, and Prior had to languish only three years as a
                    fellow of his college when he was gazetted secretary to the embassy at The
                    Hague. After four years of this employment he was recalled to England, and
                    appointed one of the gentlemen of the king’s bedchamber. Apparently also he
                    acted as one of the king’s secretaries, and in 1697 he was secretary to the
                    plenipotentiaries who concluded the peace of Ryswick. Prior’s talent for affairs
                    was doubted by Pope, who had no special means of judging, but it is not likely
                    that King William would have employed in this important business a man who had
                    not given proof of diplomatic skill and grasp of details. The poet’s knowledge
                    of French is specially mentioned among his qualifications, and this was
                    recognized by his being sent in the same year to Paris in attendance on the
                    English ambassador. At this period Prior could say with good reason that “he had
                    business enough upon his hands and was only a poet by accident.” To poetry,
                    however, which had laid the foundation of his fortunes, he still occasionally
                    trusted as a means of maintaining his position, and composed odes on various
                    public events that required celebration. His wit made him a favourite as a
                    member of the English legation at Paris, although he used it sometimes in a
                    patriotic manner at the expense of the French. Aften-his return from France, and
                    a brief tenure of other offices, Prior succeeded Locke as a commissioner of
                    trade. In 1701 he sat in parliament for East Grinstead. About the same time for
                    some undiscovered reason he changed his side in politics, and allied himself
                    with Harley and St John. Perhaps in consequence of this for nine years there is
                    no mention of his name in connexion with any public transaction. But when the
                    Tories came into power in 1710 Prior’s diplomatic abilities were again called
                    into action, and till the death of Anne he held a prominent place in all
                    negotiations with the French court, sometimes as secret agent, sometimes in an
                    equivocal position as ambassador’s companion, sometimes as fully accredited but
                    very unpunctually paid ambassador. From this greatness the poet had a sudden
                    fall when the queen died and the</p>
                <p>Whigs regained power. He was considered of sufficient consequence not to be
                    allowed to escape into obscurity. He was spécially examined by a committee of
                    the privy council, and kept in close custody for three years. During this
                    imprisonment, maintaining his cheerful philosophy, he wrote his longest humorous
                    poem, <hi rend="italic">Alma, or The Progress of the Mind.</hi> This, along with
                    his most ambitious work <hi rend="italic">Solomon,</hi> and a collection of <hi
                    rend="italic">Poems on several Occasions,</hi> was published by subscription in
                    1718. The poet did not long survive his enforced retirement from public life,
                    although he bore his ups and downs with rare equanimity. He died at Wimpole,
                    Cambridgeshire, a seat of the earl of Oxford, September 18,1721, and was buried
                    in Westminster Abbey, where his monument may be seen in Poets’ Corner. Prior had
                    very much the same easy pleasureloving disposition as Chaucer, combined with a
                    similar capacity for solid work. Johnson lays stress with justice on the variety
                    and the uniform excellence of Prior’s poetry. This distinction may fairly be
                    claimed for a poet who has received the enthusiastic praise, in different views
                    of his work, of two men so different as John Wesley and Mr Swinburne. Prior
                    tried many kinds of grave and gay, and in the face of such testimony it would
                    seem as if we ought to reconsider Johnson’s verdict that he never rises high
                    above mediocrity in any kind. Johnson might have been more lenient to Prior’s
                    love-verses if he had not made so much use in them of classical fictions. This
                    was the one thing that the great critic would on no account tolerate; frigid
                    allusions to Venus, Cupid, Diana, Ganymede, and such like “easy fictions and
                    vulgar topics,” put him out of temper at once, and excluded the unlucky
                    composition from all chance of fair consideration at his hands. The truth was
                    that what Johnson desiderated in love-verses was honest fervent passion. He had
                    no taste for such elegant trifling as the poems in playful praise of Cloe. Even
                    the pretty compliments in the love-letter to the lady of quality aged five would
                    not have moved him to any ecstasy of admiration. “Whatever Prior obtains above
                    mediocrity,” he says, “seems the effort of struggle and of toil. He has many
                    vigorous but few happy lines; he has everything by purchase, and nothing by gift
                    His expression has every mark of laborious study; the line seldom seems to have
                    been formed at once; the words did not come till they were called, and were then
                    put by constraint into their places, where they do their duty, but do it
                    sullenly.” This criticism is too unqualified. It applies very happily to many of
                    Prior’s verses, but not to Prior at his best; and, even when he is at his worst,
                    it strikes us that the failure is rather owing to his not having laboured long
                    enough to conceal the labour. If Prior has nothing by gift, it is equally
                    true—and Johnson admits this also— that he has nothing by theft. He is eminently
                    original, and this will probably help to keep his reputation alive with students
                    of poetry for a very long time. There is a fresh intellectual force and a
                    pregnancy of thought in his writing that has made Prior exceedingly serviceable
                    reading for subsequent poets, and there are some of his short poems in which
                    every stanza has been the cause of happy thought and perfect expression in his
                    successors. “Prior is a lady’s book,” Johnson once said to Boswell. He might
                    have said with more propriety that Prior is a poet’s book —a very good book, not
                    exactly to steal from, but to get stimulus from. (w. Μ.)</p>
