                    type="authorial"><p>The design of the present article is simply to give the main
                    outlines of the history of the Papacy as an institution; the details connected
                    with the personal history of each pontiff will be found under the respective
                    names of the different popes. The dates immediately after the name of each pope
                    denote the period of his pontificate.</p></note> Both the ecclesiastical and the
                    temporal authority formerly exercised and still claimed by the popes of Rome
                    profess to be of divine appointment, appealing in the first place to the
                    language of the New Testament, and in the next to the tradition of the church,
                    handed down, as it is asserted, in unbroken continuity from apostolic times to
                    the present age. According to the theory thus put forth, Peter the apostle was
                    indicated by Christ Himself as superior to the rest of the twelve in faith and
                    spiritual discernment, and as the one of the number whom it was His design to
                    invest with special pre-eminence. In like manner, the church itself which Peter
                    was afterwards to found and to preside over was predestined to a like
                    superiority among other churches, while his personal superiority was to be
                    vested in perpetuity in his successors. In conformity with this divine design
                    Peter, accompanied by Paul, went to Rome after Christ’s death, and founded there
                    a church over which he presided as its bishop for twenty-five years,—from the
                    first year of the reign of Claudius, 41 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> to 67
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> —eventually suffering martyrdom in the same year
                    and on the same day as St Paul, in the persecution under Nero. And, if we accept
                    the records preserved in the Roman Church, we shall believe that St Peter’s
                    successors, so long as Christianity was the object of state persecution,
                    continued heroically to encounter the same glorious fate, the distinction of
                    martyrdom being assigned in the Roman calendar to all but two of the bishops of
                    Rome from Linus to Eusebius (see list at conclusion of article).</p>
                <p>In dealing with a subject in which the evidence is frequently ambiguous and
                    conflicting, and sometimes of more than doubtful genuineness, and with a period
                    of much obscurity, no amount of research will often serve to point to more than
                    a conjectural conclusion. But, inasmuch as it is on the basis of the assumptions
                    involved in the above theory that the claims of the Church of Rome mainly rest,
                    it will be desirable to state, as concisely as possible, the main facts and
                    arguments on which those who deny these assumptions ground their contrary
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>The question whether or no St Peter was designed for pre-eminence among the
                    apostles resolves itself, it is evident, into one of New Testament criticism;
                    but from the time of Origen, who visited Rome early in the 3d century, when the
                    theory first began to be put forward, there has always been a certain section in
                    the church who have distinctly repudiated the affirmative assumption. “For if,”
                    says Origen, “you hold that the whole church was built by God on· Peter alone,
                    what will you say concerning John, the son of thunder, and each of the other
                    apostles?” (Migne, <hi rend="italic">Patrologia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Graeca,</hi> xiii. 397). Next, as regards the evidence for St Peter’s presence
                    in Rome and lengthened labours there, as the head of a Christian congregation,
                    it is maintained by the great majority of Protestant scholars that there is no
                    proof that he was ever in Rome at all; that the “Babylon” referred to in his
                    first epistle (ch. v. 13) is really the distant city of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n507/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0507-0488"/> East; and that, even if his presence in Rome be
                    admitted, his arrival there must have been long subsequent to that of his
                    brother apostle, and his labours altogether subordinate in
                    importance,—conclusions supported by the complete silence observed in the Acts
                    of the Apostles respecting both him and his work in the capital of the empire.
                    On the other hand, it is urged that, as no known tradition assigns the martyrdom
                    of Peter to any other place than Rome, every allusion to that event is
                    implicitly an argument for his visit to the capital; and, generally speaking, it
                    may be said that the most recent and authoritative research seems to point to
                    the conclusion that he both visited Rome and taught there, but that his labours
                    were carried on in a spirit of rivalry, not to say antagonism, to those of Paul,
                    being bestowed exclusively on a Judaizing church, while those of his
                    fellow-apostle were devoted to the Gentile community. Of the important feature
                    which harmonizes perfectly with these conclusions—namely, that the Church of
                    Rome, attaching itself directly to the church at Jerusalem, became the
                    depositary of a Jewish-Christian rather than of a Pauline tradition—there can be
                    no doubt whatever.</p>
                <p>The existence of a considerable poor Jewish element in Rome as early as the
                    latter half of the 1st century is attested by numerous facts and allusions in
                    the classical writers. The Jews were everywhere actively engaged in commercial
                    pursuits, and formed an influential section in all great centres. Josephus tells
                    us that, when on one occasion the Jews of Palestine presented a petition to the
                    emperor Augustus, it was supported by no less than eight thousand of their
                    countrymen resident in the capital. The chief quarters of this Jewish colony
                    were in the Trastevere, about the base of the Janiculum; and its members were
                    distinguished by the fidelity with which they cherished their national customs
                    and beliefs. Both Rome and the Jewish community in its midst must accordingly
                    have appeared a field of primary importance in the work of evangelization; and
                    it is evident that the questions raised by the claims of Christianity would
                    there be discussed with the greatest ardour, and the most strenuous endeavours
                    be made to bring them to an ultimate issue. That such was really the case is
                    sufficiently proved by a well-known passage in Suetonius, who relates that about
                    the middle of the 1st century there were constant riots among the Jewish
                    population, their ringleader being one “Chrestus,” and that Claudius in
                    consequence expelled them from the city. There is no reason for supposing that
                    this section of the community would be estranged to any great degree, by the
                    pursuits and associations of their daily life, from those by whom they were
                    surrounded. The influences that then pervaded alike the Roman literature,
                    culture, and civilization were mainly Greek, and the Jewish element was no less
                    affected by these influences than the Latin. Greek, again, was the ordinary
                    medium of commercial intercourse throughout the Roman world, and the Jew was
                    largely engaged in commerce. Greek therefore had, except in the Syrian
                    provinces, become the language of his daily life, as it had long been that of
                    his sacred books read aloud in the synagogues, and of the annals of his race as
                    recorded by the national writers.</p>
                <p>The importance of the passage above referred to in Suetonius, of which the very
                    inaccuracy which it embodies is in itself highly significant, has perhaps hardly
                    been sufficiently recognized, for it not only records an important fact but it
                    sheds light on subsequent history. It enables us to understand that, when the
                    Jewish population was permitted to return to Rome, its members, whether
                    adherents of the national faith or converts to the new, would, in common with
                    the whole Christian community, feel the necessity of extreme caution lest their
                    religious observances or their religious differences should again attract the
                    notice of the Rofhan magistrate and expose them to fresh persecution. Of this
                    character would appear to be the sentiments indicated in the epistle of Clemens
                    Romanus (supposed by some to have been the same with the Clemens whose name is
                    inserted as that of the third bishop of Rome) when he refers to the sudden and
                    repeated “calamities and adversities which are befalling us”—a passage generally
                    interpreted as having reference to the persecution under Nero and the impending
                    persecution under Domitian (Lightfoot, <hi rend="italic">Append.,</hi> p. 267).
                    In such considerations as these we may fairly consider that we have a reasonable
                    explanation of the fact that during the first two centuries of its existence we
                    hear so little of the Christian church in Rome.</p>
                <p>With such considerations before us, it is scarcely necessary to point out that
                    Greek was also the language of the early Christian church in Rome. In whatever
                    proportions, therefore, that church was composed of Christianized Jews or of
                    Christianized pagans, its records would naturally be, as we find them to have
                    been, in the Greek language. Hegesippus, “the father of church history,” makes a
                    statement which is generally understood to imply that, being in Rome in the time
                    of Anicetus (bishop 155<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>For this date see article “Pope” in Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Diet, of
                    Christian Antiquities,</hi> p. 1657.</p></note>- 168 A.D.), he made a list of
                    the bishops of the see. This list is not extant; but in Irenaeus, who wrote his
                    <hi rend="italic">Adversus</hi><hi rend="italic">Heereses</hi> a few years
                    later, we have another Greek list of twelve bishops, which shows the succession
                    accepted at Rome in the time of Eleutherius, the contemporary of Irenaeus, and
                    at the head of which stand the names of both Peter and Paul. To these lists are
                    to be added two other Greek lists, the one in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicon</hi> of Eusebius, the other in the <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical
                    History</hi> of the same writer. Of these, the former extends from Peter to
                    Gaius (the last bishop before the Diocletian persecution), and gives the periods
                    of office. It is derived from the Armenian translation, but is not contained in
                    the version by Jerome. The first Latin list, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catalogus</hi><hi rend="italic">Liberianus,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    supposed by Mommsen to have been derived from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicon,</hi> of Hippolytus, bishop of Portus, and to have been in turn the
                    original from which the <hi rend="italic">Catalogus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Felicianus</hi> (the oldest existing version of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Pontificalis,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> see <hi
                    rend="italic">infra}</hi> was taken,—is so called because it was compiled in the
                    episcopate of Liberius, who succeeded 352 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> We have
                    also two other Latin lists of some authority, in Augustine <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Epist.</hi> 53; Migne, <hi rend="italic">Patrol.,</hi> xxxiii. 195) andin
                    Optatus <hi rend="italic">(De Schism. Don.,</hi> ii. 3).</p>
                <p>It is undeniable that in all the foregoing lists there are considerable
                    discrepancies. The Liberian catalogue gives us a certain “Cletus,” as the
                    immediate predecessor of Anacletus; scholars like Mommsen and Lipsius are
                    divided in opinion as to whether Anicetus was the predecessor or the successor
                    of Pius; while, as regards the duration of each episcopate, there are equally
                    important discrepancies. But difficulties like these cannot justly prejudice our
                    acceptance of the general tradition with which they are associated; they are
                    rather to be looked upon as supplying valuable incidental evidence with respect
                    to the status of the Roman episcopate; and, while the lists themselves prove, on
                    the one hand, that before the termination of the 3d century the office was held
                    to be of such importance that its succession was a matter of interest to
                    ecclesiastics living in distant sees, the <hi rend="italic">variations</hi> that
                    the lists present indicate not less clearly that the Roman bishopric at this
                    period could not have held that position in relation to the church—the parallel
                    to that of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n508/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0508-0489"/> imperial office in the empire—claimed for it by
                    writers like Bellarmine.</p>
                <p>The comparative history of institutions would, in itself, incline us to look for
                    a less precise and exalted conception of the office, as discharged by these
                    early bishops, than when, after a lapse of centuries and a succession of varied
                    experiences, its duties and responsibilities had become defined and developed;
                    but it is also a fact of considerable significance that thöse who were elected
                    to the office from the time of Clement were for the most part men whose very
                    names would probably not have survived but for their appearance in these lists,
                    and that, even when, in one or two instances, their individual careers emerge
                    from the general obscurity, they themselves appear as speaking and acting in a
                    manner which seems hardly compatible with those exalted prerogatives which, as
                    some maintain, were inherent in the office from its first commencement. In: the
                    recently recovered portion of the epistle of Clemens Romanus, above cited, it
                    is, for example, highly significant to find that the letter purports to emanate,
                    not from the “bishop of Rome,” but from “the church at Rome,” and to find again
                    that, even so late as the 2d century, this letter is in like manner referred to
                    as emanating from the community, and not from the individual. This feature,
                    indeed, is not a little suggestive with respect to the development of the Roman
                    supremacy. While the letter is wanting in anything that implies any special
                    pre-eminence on the part of the Roman bishop, it is at the same time
                    characterized by a certain admonitory tone, such as could hardly have been
                    assumed if the community by whom it was sent had not been held to possess a
                    recognized superiority over the community to whom it is written, but this
                    superiority is not greater than would naturally belong (notwithstanding their
                    common founder) to the church in imperial Rome as contrasted with the church at
                    subject Corinth,—to the church of the august capital from whence emanated the
                    laws which governed the empire and the church of the fallen city which, two
                    centuries and a half before, the Roman arms had well nigh effaced from
                    existence.</p>
                <p>If again we accept as genuine the evidence afforded in * those seven letters of
                    Ignatius which most critics are disposed to accept as genuine, the relations of
                    the Roman Church to the other churches of the empire appear to be of the same
                    character. Ignatius, when on his way to Rome (probably early in the 2d century)
                    to suffer martyrdom, addressed a letter to the Christian community in that city.
                    In this letter there is again an equally direct reference to a certain primacy
                    of the church in Rome, which is addressed as “she who hath the presidency in the
                    place of the region of the Romans.” But this expression is immediately followed
                    by a definition of this primacy which is altogether incompatible with the theory
                    that it is derived from the episcopal succession in the church; it is spoken of
                    as founded upon sentiments of Christian fellowship, with the additional
                    considerations attaching to the dignity and superior advantages belonging to the
                    church of the capital.</p>
                <p>The conclusion to which the foregoing evidence points is again strongly confirmed
                    by the general fact that, as each new pretension on the part of the Roman see
                    was put forward, it was called in question and repudiated by some one or other
                    section of the Christian community. An obscure and doubtful passage in Irenaeus
                    <hi rend="italic">{Adv.</hi><hi rend="italic">Haeres.,</hi> bk. iii. c. 3)
                    testifies, at most, to nothing more than a fuller recognition of the primacy of
                    the Roman Church, while in the same writer, who, it will be remembered, was
                    bishop of the church at Lyons, we have a notable instance of a distinct
                    repudiation of the claims of the Roman bishop to dictate to the bishops of other
                    dioceses. This was ,on the occasion of a sentence of excommunication which <hi

                    episcopal brethren in Palestine, Pontus, Gaul, and Corinth; but Irenaeus,
                    notwithstanding, remonstrates boldly with him on the rigour of his proceeding,
                    and on the impolicy of thus cutting himself off from an important section of the
                    church on a mere matter of ceremonial observance. We find again Tertullian, who
                    during his residence in Rome had acquired a certain practical knowledge of the
                    administrative characteristics of its church, implicitly intimating his

                    St Peter.</p>
                <p>The evidence with which we are presented for the rest of the 3d century is of a
                    similar character. <hi rend="smallcaps">Callistus</hi> (218-223), the successor
                    to Zephyrinus, was originally a Christian slave in Rome during the bishopric of
                    Victor, who (if we accept the narrative of Hippolytus) had been sent on account
                    of his turbulence and dishonest practices to the mines in Sardinia. Victor, who
                    was acquainted with the circumstances of his career, deemed him,
                    notwithstanding, so little deserving of commiseration that, when, through the
                    influence of Marcia, the mistress of the emperor Commodus, he had succeeded in
                    bringing about the liberation of a certain number of Callistus’s Christian
                    fellow-sufferers in Sardinia, he did not include in the list the name of
                    Callistus himself. The latter, however, managed to regain his freedom, and
                    ultimately himself became bishop of Rome. During his brief episcopate his
                    administration, as well as that of his predecessor Zephyrinus, was unsparingly
                    criticized by Hippolytus, the well-known bishop of Portus. Against Callistus
                    Hippolytus alleges the greatest laxity in the admission of candidates to
                    ecclesiastical orders, and also undue connivance at marriages dishonourable to
                    those professing the Christian faith; while Zephyrinus is depicted as a man of
                    but little intelligence and of ignoble aims. It is evident that when a suffragan
                    bishop could venture thus to criticize his metropolitan the authority wielded by
                    the latter, even in his own diocese, was very far from meeting with
                    unquestioning obedience.</p>
                <p>The foregoing evidence, together with many other similar facts which cannot here
                    be enumerated, points clearly to two important conclusions: first, that in the
                    course of the 2d and 3d centuries the Church of Rome began to put forth
                    unprecedented claims to a certain superiority among other churches; and,
                    secondly, that these claims not unfrequently encountered considerable opposition
                    as novel and unjustifiable.</p>
                <p>The circumstances which contributed to bring about their ultimate establishment
                    were various. The Roman Church itself had, from the first, been associated with
                    that severer type of Christian belief which had its chief seat at Jerusalem;
                    and, after the Holy City and its temple were <pb break="no"

                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> much of the reverence which had belonged to
                    Jerusalem was transferred to Rome. In relation to the episcopal office itself,
                    again, it is to be noted that the general conception of its functions underwent,
                    at this period, considerable change. On this point a passage in Jerome <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ad Tit.,</hi> i. 7) is of special significance. He here expressly
                    attributes the institution of the episcopal order to the necessity which had
                    arisen of repressing the numerous schisms in the church; and he goes on to
                    observe that bishops would consequently do well to bear in mind that their
                    office, with its involved authority over presbyters, was to be regarded rather
                    as the result of custom and tradition than of divine appointment. As regards any
                    special supremacy attaching to the Roman episcopate, the evidence afforded by
                    another passage in Jerome is not less notable. In one of his most important
                    letters <hi rend="italic">(Ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Rusticum</hi>; Migne, <hi
                    rend="italic">Patrol.,</hi> xxii. 932) he fully recognizes the expediency and
                    value of a central supreme authority, vested in a single individual. In support
                    of his position he adduces examples from the animal kingdom, from the imperial
                    power, from the judicial power, from the military power, and then goes on to
                    say, “so again each church has its one bishop, its one arch-presbyter, its one
                    archdeacon, every ecclesiastical grade relying on its leader,” but to the
                    clenching example, derivable from the supreme pontiff himself, no reference is
                    made. It seems, accordingly, an inevitable inference that by one of the greatest
                    of the Latin fathers, writing at the close of the 4th century, the Roman theory
                    of the popedom was unrecognized. But the circumstance which perhaps most
                    conduced to the acceptance of the papal pretensions was the creation of a new
                    office in the ecclesiastical organization, that of the metropolitan. So long as
                    Christianity was the religion only of an obscure sect, or of a persecuted
                    minority in the Roman state, lying also under the suspicion of political
                    disaffection, it probably sought to avoid attracting further attention to itself
                    by any elaborate attempt at organization. At the same time the political
                    organization of the empire, from its Jong established and universally recognized
                    territorial divisions, its system of intercommunication, and its arrangement of
                    the executive power, must have obviously seemed to furnish the most practicable
                    outlines for the administration of a great and growing ecclesiastical community.
                    The chief cities or <hi rend="italic">metropoleis</hi> of the several Roman
                    provinces were accordingly from the first selected as the seats of the principal
                    Christian churches—Antioch, Corinth, Ephesus, and Thessalonica respectively
                    representing the chief ecclesiastical centres of Syria, Achaia, Asia, and
                    Macedonia. And when, again, under Constantine and his successors, the
                    distribution of civil authority was further modified by the creation of four
                    patriarchates, subdivided into twelve “dioceses” or major provinces, these
                    changes were soon followed by corresponding modifications on the part of the
                    church organization. In this manner we are able to understand how it is that we
                    find the bishop of Rome successively assuming, as in the pontificates of
                    Fabianus and Cornelius, the more extended authority of a metropolitan,<note

                    of Nicaea (325) the authority of a metropolitan is distinctly recognized, and in

                    precision.</p></note> and, as in the days of Julius I, and Siricius, the
                    authority of a patriarch.</p>
                <p>But no external event exercised a more potent influence on the early history of
                    the Roman Church than the removal of the seat of imperial power to
                    Constantinople (330). For more than a century from that event it was not a
                    little doubtful whether the patriarch of “Nova . Roma” might not succeed in
                    asserting an authority to which even the Western pontiff might be compelled to
                    defer. It became accordingly an object of primary importance with the latter to
                    dissociate as far as possible in the mind of Christendom the notion of an
                    ecclesiastical supremacy derived, like that at Constantinople, mainly from the
                    political importance of the capital from the conception of that supremacy which
                    he himself claimed as the representative of the inalienable authority and
                    privileges conferred on St Peter and his successors. For such a policy an
                    additional motive was created by the predilection shown by Constantine for his
                    new capital, and the conviction which he is said to have entertained that the
                    days of ancient Rome were numbered.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    upon as accretions of a later period. It is supposed, however, that Constantine
                    built the original Vatican basilica, the church of St Agnes, and the
                    Lateran.</p></note> From henceforth it was the key-note to the utterances of the
                    Roman primate that his supremacy, as a tradition from apostolic times, could
                    never depart from him and his successors, and that, as representing the
                    authority of the two chief apostles, it had claims upon the obedience and
                    reverence of the whole Christian church such as no other <hi rend="italic"
                    >apostolica</hi><hi rend="italic">sedes</hi> could produce. To the ultimate
                    assertion of these pretensions the long and fierce struggle carried on between
                    the followers of Arius and the supporters of orthodoxy materially contributed.
                    The appeal to the arbitration of Rome, preferred both by Athanasius and by the
                    Arian party, placed <hi rend="smallcaps">Julius</hi> I. (337-352) in the proud
                    position of the recognized protector of the orthodox faith. In the year 339
                    Athanasius himself visited the Western capital and resided there for three
                    years. His presence and exhortation confirmed the Roman pontiff still further in
                    his policy; and from this time we perceive the see of Rome assuming, more
                    distinctly than before, the right to define doctrine and the function of
                    maintaining the true standard of faith amid the numerous heresies that were then
                    troubling the whole church. While Constantinople was conspicuous by its
                    attachment to Arianism, Rome appeared as the champion of the orthodox belief. In
                    another direction the Western see would appear to have been also advancing
                    important and exclusive claims. If we accept as genuine the letter of Julius to
                    the Eusebians, written after the acquittal of Athanasius, the pontiff already
                    maintained that, in all proceedings whereby the conduct or orthodoxy of any of
                    the higher ecclesiastical authorities was called in question, the canonical
                    method of procedure required that the Roman see should be consulted before any
                    initiative was taken. In other words, the council which had been convened at
                    Tyre to try Athanasius had usurped the functions which belonged to the pontiff
                    of Rome alone.</p>
                <p>During the bishopric of <hi rend="smallcaps">Liberius</hi> (352-366) we meet with
                    the first instance of a schism in the Roman Church, and, in the person of Felix,
                    with the first representative of that maintenance of a rival claim to the see
                    which in later history assumed such importance in connexion with the antipopes.
                    The contested succession of <hi rend="smallcaps">Damasus</hi> (366-684),
                    although attended by scenes of brutal violence and outrage, affords further
                    illustration of the main question then at issue. Damasus, who had been the
                    personal friend of Liberius, represented the cause of orthodoxy, and his triumph
                    over his rival, Ursinus, was hailed with exultation by the chief contemporary
                    teachers of the church. During his tenure of the see Arianism in the West almost
                    ceased to exist.</p>
                <p>At the council of Nicaea (325), one of the canons enacted (the sixth) had already
                    assigned to the three sees, or patriarchates, of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch,
                    their honorary rank in the order of their enumeration. In the <pb break="no"

                    convened; it was an assembly in which the Western Church took no share, and its
                    notable third canon was accordingly enacted without opposition. By this it was
                    declared that the bishop of Constantinople, or Nova Roma, was entitled, although
                    the representative of a non-apostolic see, to the next place after Rome, and
                    consequently to precedence of the older and apostolic sees of Alexandria and
                    Antioch. This distinguished position was assigned to him as the supreme
                    ecclesiastical authority in the new centre of political power, and a theory of
                    the basis of ecclesiastical dignity was thus put forward by the church which was
                    in direct conflict with that maintained by Rome.</p>
                <p>The pontificate of <hi rend="smallcaps">Siricius</hi> (384-398) is chiefly
                    remarkable as that with which commences the series known as the Decretals—a
                    collection of pastoral letters and of replies to questions submitted for their
                    consideration sent by the popes to the churches of the West. These subsequently
                    formed the basis of a vast and elaborate series of forgeries known as the
                    decretals of the pseudo-Isidorus, of which we shall have occasion again to
                    speak; but the genuineness of the letter of Siricius to Himerius, bishop of
                    Tarragona, does not appear to have ever been called in question, and it takes
                    its stand therefore as the earliest existing decretal. In the influence which
                    they exercised upon Western Christianity neither Siricius nor his successor <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Anastasius</hi> I. (398-401) could compare with their
                    illustrious contemporary, Ambrose, bishop of Milan, whom the emperor Theodosius
                    pronounced to be the only true bishop whom he had known. But Ambrose, although
                    acting in perfect independence of the Roman see, always professed to take it as
                    his model in matters of discipline, and by the respect which his example
                    inspired in others for the episcopal office in general he indirectly augmented
                    the conception of the papal prerogatives.</p>
                <p>With the division of the empire in the year 395 the question of the Roman
                    precedence of Constantinople was left for a time in abeyance; but in the West
                    the authority of the bishop of Rome became more and more firmly established. In
                    the following century the general conditions under which he was called upon to
                    act became so materially modified as to constitute a new period in the history
                    of our subject.</p>
                <p>The characters of the men who filled the papal chair during this century, most of
                    them of exemplary life, some of commanding genius, would alone suffice to
                    constitute it a memorable era. “Upon the mind of Innocent I.,” says Milman,
                    “seems first distinctly to have dawned the vast conception of Rome’s universal
                    ecclesiastical supremacy.” <hi rend="smallcaps">Innocent</hi> I. (402-417) seems
                    indeed to have been the first of the popes who ventured to repudiate those
                    political conceptions which threatened to circumscribe the extending influence
                    of his office. Writing in the year 415 to Alexander, bishop of Antioch, he
                    implies that the church in that city, as an “apostolica sedes,” is entitled to
                    rank second only to Rome; “but not,” he adds, “so much on account of the
                    grandeur of the city itself as because it is shown to be the first apostolic
                    see” (Mansi, <hi rend="italic">Concilia,</hi> vol. iii. p. 1055). In the same
                    letter he distinctly repudiates the notion that the church is bound by political
                    divisions; the emperor may create two capitals <hi rend="italic"
                    >{metropolis'),</hi> but it by no means follows that a second metropolitan is to
                    be appointed by the church. In the year 412 he gave practical proof of his
                    determination to assert his own theory of his prerogatives, by appointing the
                    archbishop of Thessalonica his vicar over the extensive province of Illyricum,
                    of which but a small portion lay in the Western empire; and, when the bishops of
                    the province showed themselves less amenable than he had anticipated to his
                    directions in matters of discipline, he insisted with unprecedented explicitness
                    on the jurisdiction of his see as “head of all the churches.” Innocent was
                    succeeded by <hi rend="smallcaps">Zosimus</hi> (417-418) and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi> (418-422). The former, whose pontificate lasted
                    only twenty-one months, exhibits a noteworthy exception to the traditions of his
                    see, in the disposition he at one time showed to temporize with Pelagianism, and
                    even to set aside in its favour the decrees of his predecessor. The pontificate
                    of Boniface is notable as having been preceded by a contested election which
                    afforded the emperor Honorius an opportunity for the exercise of his
                    intervention, thereby establishing a precedent for imperial interference on like
                    occasions. At the instance of Boniface himself, Honorius enacted an ordinance
                    designed to avert the scandals incident to such contests. By the new provisions,
                    all canvassing for the vacant chair was strictly prohibited; in the event of a
                    disputed election both candidates were to be deemed ineligible; finally, it was
                    essential to any election that the candidate should have been chosen by the
                    unsolicited suffrages of the qualified clergy, and that their choice should have
                    been ratified by the approval of the entire church community. The successor of
                    Boniface was <hi rend="smallcaps">C&lt;elestinus</hi> L (422-432). The evidence
                    afforded by the events of his pontificate is somewhat conflicting in character.
                    On the one hand, we find the churches of Africa putting forward their latest
                    recorded protest against the Roman pretensions, adducing the sixth canon of the
                    council of Nicaea in support of their protest; on the other hand, the success
                    with which Coelestinus intervened in Illyricum, and again in connexion with the
                    sees of Narbonne and Vienne, proves that the papal jurisdiction was being
                    accepted with increasing deference in other parts of the empire. The effect with
                    which his solicited decision was given in the controversy raised by Nestorius,
                    the patriarch of Constantinople, and the synod held under his auspices in Rome
                    (430) for the further consideration of the same question, likewise added to the
                    reputation of his office.</p>
                <p>Barbaric invasion, although resulting in the overthrow of many of the
                    institutions of civilization, and in widespread suffering and social
                    deterioration, served but to enhance the influence and importance of the Roman
                    see. The apparent fulfilment of prophecy, pagan as well as Christian, when the
                    city was taken and sacked by Alaric (410), seemed to complete the effacement of
                    the temporal power in Rome. Neither the Western emperors nor the Gothic
                    conquerors held their court in the ancient capital, where the pope was now at
                    once the most important and conspicuous authority. In the African provinces, the
                    demoralization occasioned by the fierce controversies and dissensions concerning
                    Pelagianism and Donatism compelled the Catholic communities to exchange their
                    former attitude of haughty independence for one of suppliant appeal, and to
                    solicit the intervention and counsel which they had before rejected. Such was
                    the aspect of affairs in the West when <hi rend="smallcaps">Leo the Great</hi>
                    (440-461)— by some regarded as the true founder of the mediaeval
                    popedom—succeeded to the primacy. A citizen of Rome by birth, he exemplified in
                    his own character many of the antique Roman virtues—a tenacious adherence to
                    tradition in matters of religious belief, an indomitable resolution in the
                    assertion of the prerogatives of his office, and the austere practice of the
                    recognized duties of social life. This rigid maintenance of orthodoxy had been
                    instilled into him (or at least confirmed) by the exhortations of Augustine,
                    with whom he had become personally acquainted when on a mission to the African
                    province; and before his election to the papal office the celebrated Cassian had
                    conceived so high an opinion of his virtues and abilities as to dedicate to him
                    his treatise on the Incarnation. Regarded, indeed, simply as the able antagonist
                    of the Manichaean<pb break="no"

                    of the Collect, Leo would fill no unimportant place in the annals of Latin
                    Christendom; but his influence on church history in other respects is of a far
                    deeper and more potent kind. In none was it followed by more important results
                    than by the success with which he established the theory that all bishops who,
                    in questions of importance, demurred to the decision of their metropolitan
                    should be entitled to appeal to Rome. He obtained the recognition of this
                    principle not only in Illyricum, as his predecessor Innocent had done, but also
                    in Gaul; and the circumstances under which he did so in the latter province
                    constitute the whole proceedings a memorable episode in church history.
                    Celidonius, bishop of Besançon, had been removed from his bishopric by his
                    metropolitan, the eminent Hilary of Arles, and determined to proceed to Rome to
                    appeal against his sentence in person. He was followed thither by Hilary, who
                    courageously protested against any exercise of the pontifical authority which
                    should trench upon his own as metropolitan, and for which, in the present
                    instance, it seems to be generally admitted that the canons of the church down
                    to the time of Dionysius Exiguus (fl. 525) afforded no sanction.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>That is, unless we admit the
                    genuineness of the canons of the council of Sardica (343), which probably few
                    who have studied the evidence will be prepared to do.</p></note> Leo, however,
                    not only annulled the sentence of deprivation, but condemned Hilary’s entire
                    conduct. The latter could only remonstrate in terms of energetic but ineffectual
                    protest, and then took his departure from the city to die soon after at Arles.
                    His name, along with that of Irenaeus, stands at the head of that long
                    succession of able churchmen who, sometimes in conjunction with the temporal
                    power and sometimes independently of it, have gained for the Gallican Church a
                    character for systematic opposition to the encroachments of the Roman see which
                    (if we except the Church of Utrecht) is unique among the communities of Western
                    Catholicism. In a circular letter to the churches of Gaul, Leo subsequently
                    passed a formal and deliberate censure upon Hilary’s conduct; and this measure
                    was followed up by an imperial edict, in which, again, we have a remarkable
                    illustration of that compact between the state and the church which assumed such
                    importance at a later period. In this decree of Valentinian III. (445) the
                    primacy of Rome is placed upon a triple basis—the merits of St Peter, the
                    majesty of the city of Rome, and the authority of a council <hi rend="italic"
                    >(sacrae</hi><hi rend="italic">synodi auctoritas).</hi> To which of the councils
                    reference is intended is by no means clear; but all bishops are required by this
                    imperial edict to present themselves when summoned at the tribunal of the Roman
                    pontiff <hi rend="italic">(Novellae,</hi> ed. Haneζ pp. 172-5). As, prior to
                    this time, the emperors themselves had always claimed, though they had not
                    invariably exercised, the right of representing a supreme court of appeal, this
                    transfer of such a prerogative to Rome may fairly be regarded as marking the
                    commencement of a new era in the conception of the papal office.</p>
                <p>The chief obstacle to the recognition of the supremacy: of the Roman pontiff was
                    now to be found in the revival of Arianism, which, professed alike by the Goth
                    and the Vandal, represented the dominant faith in the chief cities of northern
                    Italy, as well as in Africa, Spain, and southern Gaul. But the rivalry thus
                    generated only increased the disposition of the Catholic party to exalt the
                    prerogatives of their head, and the attitude of Rome towards other churches
                    continued to be more and more one of unquestionable superiority. In the year 483
                    Pope <hi rend="smallcaps">Felix</hi> II. (or III.) ventured upon an
                    unprecedented measure in citing Acacius, the patriarch of Constantinople, to
                    Rome, to answer certain allegations preferred against him by John, patriarch of
                    Alexandria, whom he designates as “frater et coepiscopus noster” (Thiel, <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistolae,</hi> p. 239). On Acacius refusing to recognize the
                    legality of the letter of citation, he was excommunicated by Felix. The
                    successor of Felix, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gelasius</hi> I. (492-496), refused to
                    notify, as was customary, his election to the patriarch of Constantinople, and
                    by his refusal implicitly put forward a fresh assumption, viz., that communion
                    with Rome implied subjection to Rome. Throughout the pontificate of Gelasius the
                    primacy of the Roman see was the burden of his numerous letters to other
                    churches, and he appears also to have been the first of the pontiffs to
                    enunciate the view that the authority which he represented was not controllable
                    by the canons of synods, whether past or present. In Italy these assumptions
                    were unhesitatingly accepted. The Palmary Synod, as it was termed, convened in
                    Rome during the pontificate of <hi rend="smallcaps">Symmachus</hi> (498-514)
                    formally disavowed its own right to sit in judgment on his administrative acts.
                    Ennodius, bishop of Pavia <hi rend="italic">(circ.</hi> 510), declared that the
                    Roman pontiff was to be judged by God alone, and was not amenable to any earthly
                    potentate or tribunal. It is thus evident that the doctrine of papal
                    infallibility, though not yet formulated, was already virtually recognized.</p>
                <p>During the Gothic rule in Italy (493-553), its representatives manifested the
                    utmost tolerance in relation to religious questions, and showed little
                    disposition to impose any restraints on the policy of the popes, although each
                    monarch, by virtue of his title of “king of the Romans,” claimed the right to
                    veto any election to the papal chair. In the year 483, when Odoacer sent his
                    first lieutenant, Basilius, from Ravenna to Rome, the latter was invested with
                    the titles “eminentissimus” and “sublimis.” The pope accordingly appeared as
                    politically the subject of his Arian overlord. The advantage thus gained by the
                    temporal power appears to have been the result of its intervention, which <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Simplicius</hi> (468-483) had himself solicited, in the
                    elections to the papal office, and one of the principal acts of the Palmary
                    Synod (above referred to) was to repudiate the chief measures of Basilius, which
                    had been especially directed against the abuses that prevailed on such
                    occasions, and more particularly against bribery by alienation of the church
                    lands. The assertion of this authority on the part of the civil power was
                    declared by the synod to be irregular and uncanonical, and was accordingly set
                    aside as not binding on the church. The fierce contests and shameless bribery
                    which now accompanied almost every election were felt, however, to be so grave a
                    scandal that the synod itself deemed it expedient to adopt the ordinance issued
                    by Basilius, and to issue it as one of its own enactments. In order more
                    effectually to guard against such abuses, <hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi>
                    II., in the year 530, obtained from a synod specially convened for the purpose
                    the power of appointing his own successor, and nominated one Vigilius—the same
                    who ten years later actually succeeded to the office. But a second synod, having
                    decided that such a concession was contrary to the traditions of episcopal
                    succession, annulled the grant, and Boniface himself committed the former decree
                    to the flames. At his death, however, the recurrence of the old abuses in a yet
                    more flagrant form induced the senate to obtain from the court of Ravenna a
                    measure of reform of a more comprehensive character, and designed to check, not
                    only the simoniacal practices within the church itself, but also the extortion
                    of the court officials.</p>
                <p>In the year 526 Dionysius Exiguus, a monk in Rome, undertook thè labour of
                    preparing a new collection of the canons of the councils, and, finding his
                    production favourably received, proceeded also to compile a like collection of
                    the papal letters or decretals, from the earliest extant <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n512/mode/1up"

                <p>down to those of Anastasius II. in his own day. The letters of the popes were
                    thus placed on a level with the rescripts of the emperors, and in conjunction
                    with the canons formed the basis of the canon law, which afterwards assumed such
                    importance in connexion with the history of the church. The negative value of
                    the collection formed by Dionysius may be said, however, almost to equal that of
                    its actual contents; for, from the simple fact that it does not contain those
                    yet earlier decretals subsequently put forth by the pseudo-Isidorus, it affords
                    the most convincing disproof of their genuineness.</p>
                <p>The substitution of the rule of the Greek emperors for that of the Gothic
                    monarchs was inimical in almost every respect to the independence and reputation
                    of the popedom. For a short interval before Justinian landed in Italy, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Agapetus</hi> (535-536), appearing as the emissary of Theodotus
                    to the Eastern court, assumed a bearing which inspired the emperor himself with
                    respect, and his influence was sufficiently potent to procure the deposition of
                    one patriarch of the Eastern capital and to decide the election of another. But,
                    after Belisarius entered Rome and the city had been reduced to subjection, the
                    pontiff was seen to be the mere vassal of the emperor, and not only of the
                    emperor but of the courtezan on the imperial throne. The deposition of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Silverius</hi> (536-540), and his mysterious fate at
                    Pandataria, together with the elevation of <hi rend="smallcaps">Vigilius</hi>
                    (540-555), the nominee of the abandoned Theodora and her pliant slave, completed
                    the degradation of the Roman see. Each successive pope was now little more than
                    a puppet which moved at the pleasure of the Eastern court; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">apocrisiarius</hi> or deputy whom he maintained at that court was
                    generally (as in the case of Pelagius I., Gregory I., Sabinian, Boniface III.,
                    Martin) his own successor—an honour purchased, it can hardly be doubted, by
                    systematic compliance with the imperial wishes. In the career and fate of
                    Vigilius the papal office was dishonoured as it had never been before, at once
                    by the signal unworthiness of its bearer and by the indignities heaped upon him
                    by the savage malice of his foes. So sinister, indeed, had become the relations
                    between the Roman bishop and the Eastern court that <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pelagius</hi> I. (555-560) is said to have besought Narses to send him to
                    prison rather than to Constantinople.</p>
                <p>In the year 568 the Lombards invaded Italy. Like the Goths they become converts
                    to Arianism; but they were also far less civilized, and looked with little
                    respect on Roman institutions and Roman habits of thought, while their
                    arrogance, faithlessness, and cruelty gained for them the special detestation of
                    the Roman see. Their conquests did not extend over all Italy. Ravenna and the
                    Pentapolis, Venice, Rome and its duchy (as the surrounding district was then
                    termed), Naples, Calabria, and Sicily remained subject to the empire. In the
                    peninsula the pope was, after the exarch of Ravenna, the most powerful
                    potentate, and the presence of a common foe caused the relations between himself
                    and the empire to assume a more amicable character. The emperor, indeed,
                    continued to control the elections and to enforce the payment of tribute for the
                    territory protected by the imperial arms; but, on the other hand, the pontiff
                    exercised a definite authority within the Roman duchy and claimed to have a
                    voice in the appointment of the civil officers who administered the local
                    government. From the time of Constantine the Great the church had possessed the
                    right of acquiring landed property by bequests from individuals, and the Roman
                    see had thus become greatly enriched. Some of its possessions lay far beyond the
                    confines of Italy. It was one of the last acts of Celestine I. to address to the
                    emperor Theodosius II. an appeal for the imperial protection of certain estates
                    in Asia, which a lady named Proba had bequeathed to the Roman see for the
                    maintenance of “the clergy, the poor, and certain monasteries” (Constant, ed.
                    Schoenemann, p. 879). “Ever since the restriction of the Western empire,” says
                    Mr Bryce, “had emancipated the ecclesiastical potentate from secular control,
                    the first and most abiding object of his schemes and prayers had been the
                    acquisition of territorial wealth in the neighbourhood of his capital. He had
                    indeed a sort of justification, for Rome, a city with neither trade nor
                    industry, was crowded with poor, for whom it devolved on the bishop to provide.”
                    The motives for acquiring such wealth did not, accordingly, cease to actuate the
                    pontiff, even when the paralysing influences of the imperial despotism were
                    again very sensibly felt; but the territory thus gained, known as the
                    “patrimonium Petri,” must not be supposed to have involved that claim to
                    temporal sovereignty put forth at a later period. Originally bestowed mainly for
                    the relief of the sick and destitute, the patrimonial revenues came, in course
                    of time, to be applied to the maintenance of the pope himself and the clergy of
                    his diocese, and to the erection and repair of churches. They were strictly
                    inalienable; and the pontiff himself was regarded simply as the steward, for the
                    time being, of the estate.</p>
                <p>Under <hi rend="smallcaps">Gregory</hi> I. (590-604), commonly known as “the
                    Great,” this territorial wealth became largely augmented; and, although, amid
                    the universal demoralization and widespread misery of his age, he professed to
                    discern the unmistakable signs of the approaching end of the world, the
                    efficient administration of the estates of the church was an object of his
                    unceasing solicitude. Of noble descent, great wealth, and considerable learning,
                    he possessed also a capacity for administration not inferior to that of his
                    predecessor Leo, and his best energies were devoted to the interests of his
                    diocese and the alleviation of the want and misery of which it was the constant
                    scene. His <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> which constitute a remarkable picture
                    both of the man and his age, and attest the minute and unwearied care which he
                    bestowed on everything relating to the affairs of his see, appear to have been
                    taken as the model for the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Diurnus,</hi> or journal of the Roman curia, which was commenced in the
                    following century. In other respects his genius for administration, his good
                    sense and tact, are equally conspicuous. Through his influence with
                    Theude-linda, the wife of Agilulf, the Lombard monarch, he not only succeeded in
                    averting another siege of Rome, but he also managed to bring about the
                    establishment of amicable relations between the Lombards and the Roman
                    population. With the Byzantine court he did his best to maintain a friendly
                    intercourse, although in his zeal on behalf of monasticism he withdrew his <hi
                    rend="italic">apocrisiarius</hi> from Constantinople, when the emperor Maurice
                    forbade his soldiers to assume the monastic life. It is perhaps the greatest
                    blot on Gregory’s memory that, when the emperor and his family were cruelly
                    murdered by Phocas, who seized upon the imperial dignity, Gregory was not above
                    congratulating the usurper on the circumstances of his accession, an act of
                    adulation but insufficiently extenuated by his panegyrists, as taking its rise
                    in feelings of genuine, though mistaken, religious enthusiasm. His efforts on
                    behalf of primary education, which have caused him to take rank in the Roman
                    calendar as the patron saint of school festivals, are deserving of high praise;
                    but, on the other hand, his illiberal condemnation of the pagan literature (in
                    striking contrast to the Benedictine traditions of a later time) diminishes not
                    a little our impression of his real greatness. He stands, however, among the
                    foremost of the popes, and the impress of his character and teaching must be
                    held to have permanently modified the views and policy of the Roman curia.</p>

                <p>The personal qualities and virtues of Gregory are thrown into stronger relief by
                    the comparative insignificance of his successors in the 7th century, whose
                    tenure of office was, for the most part, singularly brief and inglorious. His
                    immediate successor was <hi rend="smallcaps">Sabinianus</hi> (604- 606), who
                    after a few months’ tenure of office, and an interval of a whole year which
                    remains entirely unaccounted for, was succeeded by Boniface III. (607). Boniface
                    was the last <hi rend="italic">apocrisiarius</hi> who had represented Gregory at
                    the imperial court, and he appears to have been successful in completely winning
                    the favour of Phocas, who at his suggestion passed a decree declaring “the
                    Apostolic Church of Rome” to be “the head of all the churches.” He did this,
                    says Paulus Diaconus, “because the church of Constantinople had styled itself
                    the first of all the churches.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the claim of the Byzantine Church to be regarded as of universal authority—a
                    claim which it now became the policy of the Church of Rome to assert on her own
                    behalf on every possible occasion. The new and intimate relations which Gregory
                    and his emissaries had created between the church and the great Teutonic races
                    especially favoured these assumptions. Frankland and England alike were brought
                    within the range of influences of incalculable after importance, the development
                    of which in the 7th and 8th centuries may fairly be looked upon as constituting
                    a distinct era in the history of the popedom. In Rome itself, on the other hand,
                    the interest of the drama becomes perceptibly lessened. In the long and rapid
                    succession of the pontiffs, most of them pliant Greeks or Syrians, the nominees
                    of the exarch of Ravenna, and intent on winning the favour of both the emperor
                    and his representative, scarcely one appears as actuated by more than the
                    traditional views of his office and its functions. One of them, who ventured to
                    thwart the imperial purpose, paid dearly for his conscientiousness. The
                    Byzantine capital, at this period, was distracted by the interminable
                    controversies carried on between the Monothelites and their opponents. The
                    emperor, the half-insane Constans, arrogated to himself the function of
                    mediating between the contending parties, and sought to wring from <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Martin</hi> I. (649-653) an authoritative assent to a
                    compromise of doctrine which, to that pontiff, appeared to involve the sacrifice
                    of orthodoxy. The latter convened a council at the Lateran and formally
                    condemned the proposed solution. He was soon after induced to repair to
                    Constantinople, and, having there been arraigned on a false charge of fomenting
                    political intrigue, was deprived of his see and, although in advanced years and
                    feeble health, banished to a gloomy prison on the Euxine, where he soon after
                    died.</p>
                <p>But, while thus menaced and dishonoured in Italy, the papal power was making
                    important advances in the west. In England the resistance offered by the
                    representatives of the British Church was soon overcome, and from the time of
                    the council of Whitby (664) the teachings and traditions of Gregory, as enforced
                    by Augustine, Theodorus, Wilfrid, and others, found ready acceptance. The
                    humanizing influences which these representatives of the Roman culture diffused
                    around them exercised a potent spell over the minds and wills of the English
                    population. Monasteries were founded; cathedrals rose, each with its school of
                    instruction for the young, and its charity for the needy; and a spirit of filial
                    though far from slavish devotion to Rome was everywhere created.</p>
                <p>In Frankland, however, the Merovingian kings and the populations of Neustria and
                    Austrasia exhibited a different spirit, and the civil power showed no
                    disposition to welcome foreign interference even in connexion with
                    ecclesiastical institutions. It is observed by Guizot that from the death of
                    Gregory the Great to the time of Gregory II. (604-715) not a single document
                    exists which can be cited as proof of intercommunication between the rulers of
                    Frankland and the papacy. The series of events which led to such different
                    relations, enabling the Roman pontiff eventually to shake off both his fear of
                    the Lombard and his long dependence on the Byzantine emperor, forms one of the
                    most interesting passages in European history.</p>
                <p>In the year 715 the long succession of pliant Greeks and Syrians in the papal
                    chair was broken by the election of a man of Roman birth and endowed with much
                    of the strength of purpose that belonged to the ancient Roman. In <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gregory</hi> II. (715-731) men recognized no unworthy successor
                    of his great namesake, and by Gibbon he is regarded as the true “founder of the
                    papal monarchy.” In no respect were his care and religious sentiments more
                    conspicuously manifested than in connexion with the evangelization of distant
                    lands, and it was under his auspices that the celebrated Winfrid or Boniface
                    first commenced his famous missionary work in Frankland. His rapid success in
                    the work of converting the still heathen populations is a familiar story. From
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Gregory</hi> III. (731-741) Boniface received the
                    appointment of papal legate; he took the oath of perpetual fidelity to the
                    supreme pontiff, and wherever he went he preached the duty of a like submission.
                    He enforced the theory of the Catholic unity and of the obligation of the whole
                    body of the clergy to render implicit obedience to the representative of that
                    unity,—the successor of St Peter, the spiritual superior of all earthly
                    tribunals.</p>
                <p>While bonds of union were thus being created in the West, theological differences
                    were exercising a very different though not less important influence in the
                    East. It was in the year 731 that Gregory III., the last of the pontiffs who
                    received the confirmation of his privileges from Constantinople, issued a
                    sentence of excommunication against the Iconoclasts. It was the papal rejoinder
                    to the decree of Leo the Isaurian, passed in the preceding year, commanding that
                    all images in the churches of the empire should be forthwith removed. Although
                    he was a Syrian by birth, orthodoxy was dearer to Gregory than political
                    allegiance, and the sequel justified his policy. The emperor, indeed, retaliated
                    by what could not but be deemed a disastrous blow. All the dioceses within the
                    empire where the Roman pontiff had hitherto claimed obedience—Calabria, Sicily,
                    and Illyricum—were forthwith absolved from their ecclesiastical allegiance, and
                    the revenues from their rich “patrimonies,” which had before flowed into the
                    papal treasury, were confiscated. But the tie which had hitherto bound the
                    popedom to the empire was thus effectually broken.</p>
                <p>Under these circumstances a compact with the Lombards, who had by this time
                    become converts from Arianism to the Catholic faith, would have seemed the
                    obvious policy on the part of Rome, had not the political aims of the former
                    stood in the way. The Lombard coveted the possession of the capital, and this
                    design, the cherished design of centuries, marked him out as perforce the foe of
                    the popedom. In his extremity, therefore, the Roman pontiff turned to the Frank,
                    untainted by the heresy of Arianism, and already, as the result of the teaching
                    of Boniface, disposed to assent to any claims of the papacy which, did not
                    involve the diminution of his own prerogatives or the restoration of alienated
                    revenues. In the year 752 Pepin le Bref assumed the dignity and title of “king
                    of the Franks.” He did so, the annalists are unanimous in assuring us, with the
                    consent and sanction <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n514/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0514-0495"/> of Pope Zacharias, and he was anointed and
                    crowned by Boniface—a momentous precedent in relation to European history. In
                    the following year, during the pontificate of <hi rend="smallcaps">Stephen</hi>
                    III. (753-757) Aistulf, the king of the Lombards, invaded the duchy of Rome with
                    the avowed purpose of adding the capital itself to his dominions. He seized
                    Ravenna and the exarchate; and Stephen, finding remonstrance and entreaty alike
                    unavailing, fled for protection to the Frankish territory and was received by
                    King Pepin with every mark of sympathy and profound respect. Within a short time
                    after, Pepin invaded the Lombard domain and wrested from its monarch an
                    extensive territory embracing Ravenna and the Pentapolis; and at a council held
                    at Quiercy, in the same year (754), he handed over this territory to Stephen,
                    “to be held and enjoyed by the pontiffs of the apostolic see for ever.” Such
                    appears to be the real origin of that “donatio,” or gift of territory (referred
                    back, by the invention of after times, to the age of Constantine the Great),
                    which constituted the pope a temporal ruler over what were subsequently known as
                    the “States of the Church.” The munificence of Pepin was rivalled by that of his
                    son. In the year 774, on the occasion of the visit of Charles (known as the
                    Great) to Rome, the donation of his father was made the ground for soliciting
                    and obtaining a yet larger grant, comprising much of the territory already
                    bestowed, but extending to at least double the area stipulated for in the
                    earlier donation.</p>
                <p>It will thus be seen that, towards the close of the 8th century, the germs of the
                    chief papal claims were already in existence, and only needed for their full
                    development those favouring conditions which, with the lapse of time, were
                    certain to occur, and for which, from its peculiar character as an institution,
                    the popedom itself was so well able to watch and wait. Already the pontiff
                    claimed the dispensing power, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the right to dispense
                    with the observance of the existing canonical law under conditions determinable
                    at his pleasure. Already he claimed the right to confer privileges—a power
                    subsequently wielded with enormous effect in enabling monastic and episcopal
                    foundations to urge their encroachments on the rights and jurisdiction of the
                    secular power. He assumed again, in Western Christendom at least, the rights of
                    an universal metropolitan—demanding that in all elections to bishoprics his
                    sanction should be deemed essential; and the arrival of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pallium</hi> from Rome was already awaited with anxiety by all newly-elected
                    metropolitans. By the encouragement which was Systematically given to appeal to
                    Rome, what had before been the exception became the practice, and that
                    “extraordinary” authority, as it was termed, which had been introduced, in the
                    first instance, only under the pretext of providing a fixed court of appeal in
                    cases of dispute which threatened otherwise to prove incapable of adjustment,
                    developed into an immediate and ordinary jurisdiction—into an authority, that is
                    to say, which in all questions of graver import set aside that of the bishop,
                    and even that of the metropolitan, and made reference to Rome the rule rather
                    than the exception. In theory, although the claim was admitted neither by the
                    rulers of Frankland nor by those of England, the Roman pontiff already claimed
                    also to present to all benefices. Although he had not, as yet, assumed the
                    distinctive insignia of his office—the triple crown and the upright pastoral
                    staff surmounted by the cross—he more and more discouraged the application of
                    the name of “papa” (pope) to any but himself. The title of “universal bishop,”
                    which both Pelagius II. and Gregory the Great had disclaimed, seemed his by
                    right after the decree of Phocas, and with the lapse of two centuries from that
                    time was assumed by no other rival. The titles of “apostolicus,” “claviger” (the
                    bearer of the keys), and “servus servorum Dei” were claimed in like manner as
                    exclusively his. One temporal potentate had already received his crown as a
                    grant from the pontifical chair; the occupant of that chair was already himself
                    a temporal sovereign.</p>
                <p>That the mediaeval conception of the papal office was one of gradual and slow
                    development appears accordingly to be beyond all reasonable doubt, and this
                    feature belongs in common to the whole hierarchical system. We find, for
                    example, that the conception of the episcopal order and its functions grew with
                    the increasing power and wealth of the church. In like manner if we compare the
                    theory of the equality of bishops one with another, enunciated by Cyprian, with
                    the prerogatives of a metropolitan, as laid down at the council of Antioch
                    (341), and subsequently further magnified, we are conscious of the introduction
                    of what is tantamount to a new theory. And, finally, we become aware of yet
                    another hierarchical order, as we see rising up the patriarchates of Rome,
                    Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Constantinople, each invested by the church
                    with an assigned order of precedence. Something, however, was yet wanting which
                    should crown the gradations thus successively created, and complete the analogy
                    to the Roman political organizations —the institution of the monarchical
                    dignity. It was for this supreme honour that Rome and Constantinople contended,
                    at a time when, from various causes and circumstances, the other patriarchates
                    had sunk into an inferiority too marked to admit of rivalry. In this contest the
                    patriarch of Constantinople rested his claim on what may be termed the
                    traditional political foundation—the honour due to the patriarch of the chief
                    seat of empire; this plea, although already sanctioned by the church, was met on
                    the part of Rome by a counter appeal to the supreme reverence due to what was
                    not merely an “apostolica sedes,” but a see founded by two apostles, of whom one
                    was the chief of the apostolic order. In this remarkable abandonment of the
                    ancient plea for pre-eminence and the limitation of the argument to that
                    derivable from the claim to be an apostolic see, much of the difficulty and
                    obscurity that belong to the earlier history of the papacy had probably its
                    origin. And it seems but too probable that the endeavour to disguise this
                    change, and to represent the claims advanced by Innocent I., by Leo L, by
                    Gregory the Great, and by Hadrian II., <hi rend="italic">as already virtually
                    asserted and admitted in the 4th century and in yet earlier times,</hi> has
                    given rise to endless wrestings of isolated passages in writers of good
                    authority, to deliberate falsification of genuine documents, and to what are
                    allowed on all hands to be direct and palpable forgeries. Another feature, which
                    has been made subservient to no small amount of misrepresentation, must not be
                    overlooked. From their earliest appearance, the distinctive claims advanced by
                    the Roman see can only be regarded as a series of encroachments on that original
                    conception of the episcopal office maintained by Cyprian. And so long as the
                    other patriarchates—Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem—maintained their ground,
                    these encroachments wore a comparatively inoffensive guise, being little more
                    than the assertion of the rights of a patriarch or supreme metropolitan within
                    the Roman diocese. But, in addition to and distinct from the patriarchal
                    supremacy, there was the theory of the primacy of the bishop of Rome over all
                    the bishops, patriarchs, and metropolitans—at first little more than an honorary
                    distinction and carrying with it no definite authority or jurisdiction. When the
                    patriarchates of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem could no longer appear as
                    rivals and Rome was confronted by Constantinople alone, this theory was brought
                    much more prominently forward; while at the same time, in order <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n515/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0515-0496"/> the better to enforce the papal claims, a
                    confusion was designedly and skilfully introduced of the honorary primacy
                    derived from St Peter with the actual rights of the head of the Roman diocese.
                    The precedents afforded by the former were adduced in support of the universal
                    jurisdiction claimed by the latter, and in an ignorant and uncritical age were
                    with little difficulty represented as affording sufficient warrant for a large
                    proportion of the claims asserted in the 9th century. It is by the light which
                    we derive from these considerations that we are enabled to discern what appears
                    to be the only theory which offers a solution of the tradition respecting St
                    Peter and his successors that is in harmony with the historical evidence. When
                    we consider that in the course of the 5th century papal Rome, partly from the
                    ambition of her pontiffs, partly from the concurring influence of external
                    circumstances, had acquired a position of authority in relation to Christendom
                    at large which afforded the prospect of yet more complete and general
                    pre-eminence, and that towards the assertion of such pre-eminence her claim to
                    rank as the greatest and most honoured of the “apostolicae sedes” seemed to
                    offer effective aid, the appearance of legends and spurious documents tending to
                    support such a claim can excite no surprise in the minds of those familiar with
                    the literature of the period. As in the 2d century the attempt to reconcile two
                    earlier and corrupt traditions respecting St Peter’s presence and work in Rome
                    gave rise to the tradition of his five-and-twenty years’ episcopate, so, we can
                    understand, it was probably sought to substitute for the simple tradition
                    preserved in “Hegesippus” and Irenaeus, with respect to St Peter’s successors,
                    official records (purporting to supply details such as no other church had
                    preserved, and such as it is in the highest degree improbable that the church at
                    Rome should have succeeded in preserving) of an early episcopal succession;
                    while the discrepancies of the different lists that profess to record this
                    succession admit, again, of an adequate if not a satisfactory explanation, if we
                    regard them as, for the most part, independent and purely conjectural efforts to
                    invest the earlier episcopal office with an historical importance to which in
                    the first two centuries it certainly had not attained.</p>
                <p>While the Western primate was thus growing in dignity, wealth, and influence,
                    those ecclesiastical potentates who had once claimed an equal or coordinate
                    rank, with the sole exception of the patriarch of Constantinople, altogether
                    ceased to exist. The Saracen conquests in Syria and Egypt had involved the loss
                    of Jerusalem to Christendom (637), and this had been speedily followed by the
                    extinction of the churches of Antioch and Jerusalem. The patriarch of
                    Constantinople represented, accordingly, the only spiritual power which could
                    compare with that of Rome; but, while <hi rend="italic">he</hi> continued to be
                    the submissive vassal of the Byzantine court, that court was compelled to see
                    the once no less submissive pontiff of Rome changed into a successful invader of
                    its Italian possessions and into a determined repudiator of its articles of
                    faith. In the year 800 Charles the Great received at the hands of Leo III., in
                    Rome, the imperial crown, and the titles of “emperor” and “Augustus.” The
                    authority by virtue of which Leo assumed the right to confer such dignities was
                    probably by no means quite clear even to those who were witnesses of the
                    imposing ceremony. It may perhaps be best described as derived partly from his
                    sacerdotal function, as displayed in the consecrating rites, and partly from the
                    fact that he also acted as the representative of the people in their capacity of
                    electors. To the Byzantine emperor, the whole ceremony and the titles conferred
                    seemed a direct menace to his own prerogative, and com ρl eted the estrangement
                    between the West and the East.</p>
                <p>From that time down to the 15th century Greek institutions and Greek culture were
                    the special objects of dislike and distrust to the papacy. The use of the Greek
                    language had already been discontinued in the records of the Roman Church; and
                    the study of its literature was now systematically discouraged. The assumption
                    by Charles of the imperial dignity and the consequent rise of the “Holy Roman
                    Empire” were events on the importance of which it is unnecessary here to dwell.
                    By the theory thus established, a temporal supremacy or “condominium” was
                    created corresponding to the spiritual supremacy of the popedom, and the Roman
                    emperor claimed from all other rulers in Christendom an allegiance corresponding
                    to that which the Roman pontiff claimed from all other ecclesiastical
                    potentates. The imperial authority and papal authority were thus complementary
                    the one to the other. The emperor claimed to confirm the papal elections; the
                    pope claimed to confer the imperial crown upon the emperor. But the precise
                    adjustment of these respective claims, and the further assumptions which they
                    suggested or favoured, according as the empire or the papacy proved for the time
                    the stronger, gave rise to a series of memorable struggles which sometimes
                    assume proportions that constitute them the pivot on which contemporary history
                    throughout Europe may be said to revolve. The compact originally made between
                    the empire and the popedom, however plausible in theory, was indeed attended
                    with no little danger to both. At one time it appeared probable that the state
                    would overwhelm the ecclesiastical organization and convert it into a machine
                    for political purposes; at another time it seemed no less likely that the latter
                    would subjugate the former and reduce all Western Christendom to a vast
                    spiritual tyranny. During the three centuries that followed upon the creation of
                    the Holy Roman Empire—from the year 800, that is to say, down to the Concordat
                    of Worms (1122)—it was chiefly the former contingency that seemed the more
                    probable. During the pontificate of <hi rend="smallcaps">Nicholas</hi> I.
                    (858-867), however, the papacy again made a perceptible advance. Nicholas
                    intervened with signal effect in the disputed succession to the Eastern
                    patriarchate, and asserted more distinctly than it had ever been asserted before
                    the theory of the Roman supremacy. He dared, also, to forbid the divorce of
                    Lothair (the powerful monarch of the vast territory which stretched from the
                    German Ocean to the Mediterranean) from his wife Theutberga, thereby
                    establishing an important precedent for papal interference in questions of
                    private morality. And, finally, in his arduous struggle with Hincmar,
                    metropolitan of Rheims, he gained an important victory over the powerful
                    prelates on the Rhine in the question of appeal. It must, however, be admitted
                    that this last advantage was 'gained only by the use of forged documents—the
                    ρseudo-Isidorian decretals, which seem to have first seen the light about the
                    year 850; it was pretended that they had been compiled by Isidore of Seville, an
                    eminent writer and ecclesiastic of the 7th century, and had been brought from
                    Spain to Mainz by Riculfus, the archbishop of that city. This collection
                    embodied a complete series of letters purporting to have been written by the
                    popes of Rome from the time of Clemens Romanus down to that with which the
                    collection by Dionysius Exiguus commences, thus filling up the entire blank, and
                    affording among other data ample precedent for appeals to Rome of the kind
                    against which Hincmar had protested. When some doubt was raised as to the
                    genuineness of the collection, Nicholas did not scruple to assure Hincmar that
                    the originals had been lying from time immemorial in the Roman archives. Among
                    many other fundamental positions laid down in these decretals was one to the
                    effect that no council of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n516/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0516-0497"/> church had canonical validity unless it had been
                    summoned with the sanction of the holy see. The assertion of this theory
                    rendered it necessary considerably to extend the practice of appointing papal
                    legates <hi rend="italic">(legati</hi><hi rend="italic">a latere∖</hi> who now
                    became the ordinary channels of communication between Rome and the Western
                    churches, and through whom all affairs of importance were transacted. The legate
                    convened the provincial councils and presided over them, taking precedence even
                    of the metropolitan. Such encroachments enable us at once to understand how it
                    was that Henry I. of England deemed it necessary to demand from Paschal II. a
                    promise that no legate should be sent into the kingdom until the royal assent
                    had been previously obtained. From the pontificate of Nicholas we date a notable
                    diminution in the power of the metropolitans.</p>
                <p>The false decretals have been described as the source to which we may trace that
                    great revolution in the relations of church and state which now gradually
                    supervened. The pontificate of <hi rend="smallcaps">Hadrian</hi> II. (867-872)
                    is especially notable for the application which he sought to make of some of the
                    principles which they laid down. When Lothair, king of Lotharingia, died without
                    heirs, Hadrian claimed the right to bestow the crown on the emperor Louis.
                    Christian Europe, however, was not as yet prepared to accept this bold extension
                    of the papal prerogatives. The kingdom was seized by Charles the Bald, and
                    Hadrian was reminded in a manifesto drawn up by the bishops of Germany that he
                    could not at once be “universal pope and universal king.” But the weakness of
                    Charles’s claim was undeniable, and we accordingly find him, five years later,
                    consenting to receive the imperial crown at the hands of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >John</hi> VIII. (872-882), not as his heritage but as a gift from the pope.
                    During the dark and stormy period that intervened between the death of Charles
                    the Bald and the coronation of Otto the Great at Rome (962), the Carlovingian
                    empire broke up, and the results that followed were disastrous both for the
                    popedom and the empire. The Saracens occupied southern Italy, and menaced on
                    more than one occasion the capital itself; the Normans poured in successive
                    waves over Frankland; the ravages of the Magyars were yet wider spread and not
                    less terrible. Alike in the civil and the ecclesiastical world the elements of
                    strife and insubordination were let loose; and, while the feudal lords defied
                    the authority of their king, and the power of the French monarch sank to the
                    lowest ebb, the bishops in like manner forsook their allegiance to the Roman
                    pontiff. The archbishops of Ravenna and Milan appeared indeed as his rivals, and
                    the political influence which they commanded more than equalled his: the 10th
                    century has been designated “the noon-day of episcopal independence.” The
                    history of the curia at this period is marked by the deepest moral degradation
                    and the most revolting scenes. The papal jurisdiction was limited almost
                    entirely to the capital itself, and even the succession of the pontiffs
                    themselves is with difficulty to be traced. The office, indeed, was sometimes
                    disposed of by the influence of immoral women. The pontificate of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Stephen</hi> VI. (or VII., 896-897) is remembered only for the
                    inhuman manner in which he treated the lifeless corpse of his predecessor
                    Formosus; that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Sergius</hi> III. (904-911) for the
                    virtual reign of Theodora and her daughter, the two most notorious courtezans of
                    the age; <hi rend="smallcaps">Stephen</hi> IX. (939-942) was disf gured for life
                    by the brutal treatment which he received at the hands of the Roman mob.</p>
                <p>In the dismembered empire, the kingdom of Germany first exhibited signs of
                    returning order and cohesion; and at the solicitation of Pope <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">John</hi> XII. (955-963) King Otto led an army into Italy,
                    rescued the land from its cruel oppressor, Berengar, the feudal lord of the
                    realm, and was anointed emperor at Rome. John, however, who was one of the worst
                    of the pontiff's, ill repaid the service rendered to the see; and, foreseeing
                    that the restoration of justice and law was likely to prove fatal to his own
                    misrule, he proceeded to plot the emperor’s overthrow. He was summoned to appear
                    before a council presided over by the latter, to meet the accusations brought
                    against him, and, having failed to appear, was formally deposed. On the same
                    occasion the imperial right to confirm the election to the papal office (which
                    had been for some time in abeyance) was formally restored. Of the pontiffs whose
                    names stand in the subsequent succession two were antipopes, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> V. (964) and <hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi>
                    VII. (984-985), set up by the party in rebellion against the imperial power.</p>
                <p>With the restoration of law and order the ancient regard for the popedom regained
                    its hold on the minds of men. Under the guidance of the celebrated Gerbert, the
                    youthful enthusiasm of Otto III. aimed at making Rome once more the centre of
                    political dominion and the seat of the imperial power. Hugh Capet, too,
                    professed himself the “defender of the church.” A strong sense began also to
                    find expression of the infamy attaching to the associations of the curia. At the
                    first of the two councils convened at Rheims in 991 it was formally demanded, by
                    what decree it was that “numberless priests of God, famed alike for learning and
                    virtue, were subjected to the rule of monsters of iniquity wanting in all
                    culture, whether sacred or profane.” The French monarchs were glad, however, to
                    purchase the support of the papacy to aid them in their struggle with the
                    rebellious chieftains by whom the very existence of their authority was menaced,
                    and, until the action of the papal legates again roused the spirit of national
                    resistance, the Capetian dynasty was loyal to the Roman see. That it was so was
                    in no small measure due to the virtues and abilities of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gregory</hi> V. (996-999), the kinsman of Otto III., a young man of
                    considerable attainments, austere morality, and great energy of purpose, who
                    succeeded to the papal chair at the age of twenty-four. He was succeeded by
                    Gerbert, Pope <hi rend="smallcaps">Silvester</hi> II. (999-1003), from whom Otto
                    III. derived, as already stated, his ideas of Italian and papal regeneration.
                    But in Germany neither the nobility nor the episcopal order could contemplate
                    with equanimity the projects of either pontiff or emperor, and Otto’s schemes
                    were met with a stubborn and paralysing resistance. Then the feudal princes of
                    the Roman states rose in insurrection; and the ardent young reformer was taken
                    off—it was believed, by poison—at the age of two and twenty, to be followed in
                    the next year by his faithful preceptor on the pontifical throne.</p>
                <p>With the disappearance of these two eminent men the popedom relapsed into its
                    former degradation. The feudal nobility—that very “refuse” which, to use the
                    expression of a contemporary writer, it had been Otto’s mission “to sweep from
                    the capital ”—regained their ascendency, and the popes became as completely the
                    instruments of their will as they had once been of that of the Eastern emperor.
                    A leading faction among this nobility was that of the counts of Tusculum, and
                    for nearly half a century the popedom was a mere apanage in their family. As if
                    to mark their contempt for the office, they carried the election of Theophylact,
                    the son of Count Alberic, a lad scarcely twelve years of age, to the office. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> IX. (1033- 1045), such was the title given him,
                    soon threw off even the external decencies of his office, and his pontificate
                    was disgraced by every conceivable excess. As he grew to manhood his rule, in
                    conjunction with that of his brother, who was appointed the patrician or prefect
                    of the city, resembled that of two captains of banditti. The scandal attaching
                    to his administration culminated when it was known that, in order to win the
                    hand of a lady for whom he had conceived a passion, he had sold the pontifical
                    office <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n517/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0517-0498"/> itself to another member of the Tusculan house,
                    John, the arch-presbyter, who took the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Gregory</hi>
                    VI. (1045- 46). His brief pontificate was chiefly occupied with endeavours to
                    protect the pilgrims to Rome on their way to the capital from the lawless
                    freebooters (who plundered them of their costly votive offerings as well as of
                    their personal property), and with attempts to recover by main force the
                    alienated possessions of the Roman Church. Prior, however, to his purchase of
                    the pontifical office, the citizens of Rome, weary of the tyranny and extortions
                    of Benedict, had assembled of their own accord and elected another pope, John,
                    bishop of Sabina, who took the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Silvester</hi> III.
                    (rival pope, 1044-46). In the meantime Benedict had been brought back to Rome by
                    his powerful kinsmen, and now reclaimed the sacred office. For a brief period,
                    therefore, there were to be seen three rival popes, each denouncing the others’
                    pretensions and combating them by armed force. But even in Rome the sense of
                    decency and shame had not become altogether extinguished; and at length a party
                    in the Roman Church deputed Peter, their archdeacon, to carry a petition to the
                    emperor, Henry HL, soliciting his intervention. The emperor, a man of deep
                    religious feeling and lofty character, responded to the appeal. He had long
                    noted, in common with other thoughtful observers, the widespread degeneracy
                    which, taking example by the curia, was spreading throughout the church at
                    large, and especially visible in concubinage and simony,—alike regarded as
                    mortal sins in the clergy. He forthwith crossed the Alps and assembled a council
                    at Sutri. The claims of the three rival popes were each in turn examined and
                    pronounced invalid, and a German, Suidger (or Suger), bishop of Bamberg, was
                    elected to the office as <hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> II. (1046-47).</p>
                <p>The degeneracy of the church at this period would seem to have been in some
                    degree compensated by the reform of the monasteries, and from the great abbey of
                    Cluny in Burgundy there now proceeded a line of German popes, who in a great
                    measure restored the dignity and reputation of their office. But, whether from
                    the climate, always ill-adapted to the German constitution, or from poison, as
                    the contemporary chronicles not unfrequently suggest, it is certain that their
                    tenure of office was singularly brief. Clement II. died before the close of the
                    year of his election. <hi rend="smallcaps">Damasus</hi> II., his successor, held
                    the office only twenty-three days. <hi rend="smallcaps">Leo</hi> IX., who
                    succeeded, held it for the exceptionally lengthened period of more than five
                    years (1049-54). This pontiff, although a kinsman and nominee of the emperor,
                    refused to ascend the throne until his election had been ratified by the voice
                    of the clergy and the people, and his administration of the office presented the
                    greatest possible contrast to that of a Benedict IX. or a Sergius III. In more
                    than one respect it constitutes a crisis in the history of the popedom. In
                    conjunction with his faithful friend and adviser, the great Hildebrand, he
                    projected schemes of fundamental church reform, in which the suppression of
                    simony and of married life (or concubinage, as it was styled by its denouncers)
                    on the part of the clergy formed the leading features. In the year 1049, at
                    three great synods successively convened at Rome, Rheims, and Mainz, new canons
                    condemnatory of the prevailing abuses were enacted, and the principles of
                    monasticism more distinctly asserted in contravention of those traditional among
                    the secular clergy. Leo’s pontificate closed, however, ingloriously. In an evil
                    hour he ventured to oppose the occupation by the Normans, whose encroachments on
                    Italy were just commencing. His ill-disciplined forces were no match for the
                    Norman bands, composed of the best warriors of the age. He was himself made
                    prisoner, detained for nearly a twelvemonth in captivity, and eventually
                    released only to die, a few days after, of grief and humiliation. But, although
                    his own career terminated thus ignominiously, the services rendered by Leo to
                    the cause of Roman Catholicism were great and permanent; and of his different
                    measures none contributed more effectually to the stability of his see than the
                    formation of the College of Cardinals. The title of “cardinal” was not
                    originally restricted to dignitaries connected with the Church of Rome, but it
                    had hitherto been a canonical requirement that all who attained to this dignity
                    should have passed through the successive lower ecclesiastical grades in
                    connexion with one and the same foundation; the cardinals attached to the Roman
                    Church had consequently been all Italians, educated for the most part in the
                    capital, having but little experience of the world beyond its walls, and
                    incapable of estimating church questions in the light of the necessities and
                    feelings of Christendom at large. By the change which he introduced Leo summoned
                    the leaders of the party of reform within the newly-constituted college of
                    cardinals, and thus attached to his office a body of able advisers with wider
                    views and less narrow sympathies. By their aid the administration of the
                    pontifical duties was rendered at once more easy and more effective. The pontiff
                    himself was liberated from his bondage to the capital, and, even when driven
                    from Rome, could still watch over the interests of both his see and the entire
                    church in all their extended relations; and the popedom must now be looked upon
                    as entering upon another stage in its history—that of almost uninterrupted
                    progress to the pinnacle of power. According to Anselm of Lucca, it was during
                    the pontificate of Leo, at the synod of Rheims above referred to, that the title
                    of “apostolic bishop <hi rend="italic">” (Apostolicus)</hi> was first declared
                    to belong to the pope of Rome exclusively. The short pontificate of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nicholas</hi> II. (1059-61) is memorable chiefly for the
                    fundamental change then introduced in the method of electing to the papal
                    office. By a decree of the second Lateran council (1059), the nomination to the
                    office was vested solely in the cardinal bishops—the lower clergy, the citizens,
                    and the emperor retaining simply the right of intimating or withholding their
                    assent. It was likewise enacted that the nominee should always be one of the
                    Roman clergy, unless indeed no eligible person could be found among their
                    number. At the same time the direst anathemas were decreed against all who
                    should venture to infringe this enactment either in the letter or the spirit.
                    The preponderance thus secured to the ultramontane party and to Italian
                    interests must be regarded as materially affecting the whole subsequent history
                    of the popedom. The manner in which it struck at the imperial influence was soon
                    made apparent in the choice of Nicholas’s successor, the line of German popes
                    being broken through by the election of Anselm, bishop of Lucca (the uncle of
                    the historian), who ascended the pontifical throne as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Alexander</hi> II. (1061- 73) without having received the sanction of the
                    emperor. His election was forthwith challenged by the latter, and for the space
                    of two years the Roman state was distracted by a civil war, Honorius II. being
                    supported as a rival candidate by the imperial arms, while Alexander maintained
                    his position only with the support of the Norman levies. The respective merits
                    of their claims were considered at a council convened at Mantua, and the
                    decision was given in favour of Alexander. Cadalous, such was the name of his
                    rival, did not acknowledge the justice of the sentence, but he retired into
                    obscurity; and the remainder of Alexander’s pontificate, though troubled by the
                    disputes -respecting a married clergy, was free from actual warfare. In these
                    much vexed questions of church discipline Alexander, who had been mainly
                    indebted for his election to Hildebrand, the archdeacon of the Roman Church, was
                    guided entirely by that able churchman’s <pb break="no"

                    struggle between this pontiff and the emperor, Henry IV., we date the
                    commencement of that long series of contests between the papal and the imperial
                    power which distracted alike the holy see and the empire. In the two main
                    objects to which his policy was directed—the enforcement of a celibate life
                    among the clergy and the prohibition of investiture (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Investiture)</hi> by the laity—Gregory had on his side the sympathy of the best
                    and most discerning minds of his age. Lay investiture was little more than a
                    cloak for the inveterate and growing abuse of simony, for which the distribution
                    of church patronage by secular potentates afforded special facilities, and the
                    burden of which was now increased by those other forms of tribute, the “regale,”
                    “jus spolii,” and “servitium,” which the growth of the feudal system had
                    developed. But in the hands of Gregory this scheme of ostensible reforms
                    expanded first of all into independence of the temporal power, and finally into
                    a claim to dominate over it. Other schemes (not destined to be realized) engaged
                    his lofty ambition— the conquest of Constantinople, the union of the Eastern and
                    Western Churches, and the expulsion of the Saracens from Christendom. He died in
                    exile; but the theory of his office and its prerogatives which he asserted was
                    brought by his successors to a marvellous realization.</p>
                <p>The first crusade, which may be looked upon as generated by Gregory’s example and
                    a reflex of the policy which led him to sanction the expedition of William of
                    Normandy against England, materially favoured papal pretensions. It was
                    proclaimed as a religious war, and it was as a mode of penance that the Norman
                    and Latin warriors were enjoined to gratify their ruling passions of plunder and
                    adventure. More especially it brought to the front of the drama of European
                    action the Latin as opposed to the Teutonic elements,—the part taken by Germany
                    in these gigantic expeditions in no way corresponding to her position among
                    European powers. It was impossible that the excommunicated emperor Henry IV.
                    should place himself at the head of such an enterprise, and it was accordingly
                    by <hi rend="smallcaps">Urban</hi> II. (1088-99) that the direction was assumed,
                    and it was under his auspices that the first crusade was proclaimed at Clermont.
                    As the movement gathered force, the prestige of the popedom was still further
                    enhanced by the fact that the warriors who had before appeared in the field
                    under the banners of the empire now did so as loyal sons of the church. The new
                    orders of chivalry,·—the Knights of St John, the Templars, the Teutonic
                    Order,—each bound by religious vows, received their commissions from the
                    pontiff, were invested by him with the sword and the cross, and acknowledged no
                    allegiance to the emperor.</p>
                <p>But of all the schemes which Gregory’s genius conceived and promoted none was
                    more important in its after-effects than the expansion given to the
                    pseudo-Isidorian decretals —in the first instance by Anselm of Lucca, again by
                    Cardinal Deusdedit, and finally by the celebrated Gratian, a monk of Bologna,
                    who lived about the middle of the 11th century. By Gratian these accumulated
                    forgeries were reduced to order and codified; and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decretum,</hi> as <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> it was termed, stands to the
                    canon law <hi rend="smallcaps">(Canon Law)</hi> in much the same relation that
                    the Pandects of Justinian stand to the civil law. Further additions were
                    subsequently made by Gregory IX., Boniface VIII., and other pontiffs, and in
                    this manner a vast code was gradually elaborated which, serving as the framework
                    of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction in every land, was associated with separate
                    courts and professed by a distinct body of jurists. The canonists were naturally
                    ardent defenders of the system from whence they derived their professional
                    existence, and everywhere represented the faithful adherents of Rome.</p>
                <p>Another movement at this period, which gave effective aid in the diffusion of the
                    papal influence and authority, was the rise of the new religious orders,—the
                    Camaldules (c. 1012), the Cluniacs (c. 1048), the Carthusians (c. 1084), and the
                    Cistercians (1098). Although each of these orders professed a distinct rule, and
                    a sanctity and austerity of life which put to shame the degenerate Benedictines,
                    their presence was far from proving an unmixed benefit to the districts where
                    they settled. They rejected the episcopal jurisdiction, and purchased their
                    local independence by complete and immediate subjection to the pope. Wherever,
                    accordingly, their houses rose there was gathered a band of devoted adherents to
                    Rome, ever ready to assert her jurisdiction in opposition to the ecclesiastical
                    jurisdiction claimed by the secular clergy or the civil jurisdiction claimed by
                    the temporal power.</p>
                <p>On the death of Urban, Cardinal Rainerius, a native of Tuscany, and a man of
                    considerable learning and capacity, succeeded as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Paschal</hi> II. (1099-1118), During the earlier years of his pontificate he is
                    unfavourably distinguished by the manner in which he sanctioned, if he did not
                    instigate, the cruel and unnatural revolt of the young prince Henry (afterwards
                    the emperor Henry V.) against his father. The later years of Paschal’s rule seem
                    mainly a record of the nemesis which overtook a policy dictated by the most
                    heartless and selfish ambition. “Paschal,” says Milman, “is almost the only
                    later pope who was reduced to the degrading necessity of being disclaimed by the
                    clergy, of being forced to retract his own impeccable decrees, of being taunted
                    in his own day with heresy, and abandoned as a feeble traitor to the rights of
                    the church by the dexterous and unscrupulous apologists of almost every act of
                    the papal see.” One of the most memorable phases of this long process of
                    humiliation is marked by the treaty of Sutri (Feb. 1111), when the young emperor
                    compelled Paschal to surrender all the territorial possessions and royalties
                    which the church had received either from the emperor or from the kings of Italy
                    since the days of Charlemagne, together with numerous other political and fiscal
                    privileges, while he himself renounced the right of investiture. The indignation
                    of the ecclesiastical world compelled Paschal to retire from this treaty, and
                    ultimately, after long evasions, to become party to a second, whereby the former
                    conditions were completely reversed. The emperor resumed the right of
                    investiture, and that burning question again lit up the flames of war. Paschal
                    being too far pledged by his own solemn oath, a metropolitan council assembled
                    at Vienne assumed to itself the authority of excommunicating the emperor,
                    declaring that the assertion of the rights of lay investiture in itself
                    constituted a heresy. The great prelates of Germany rose in insurrection against
                    the emperor. He retaliated by seizing on the vast possessions (comprising nearly
                    a quarter of Italy) which Matilda,’ countess of Tuscany, at her death in 1115,
                    had bequeathed to the Roman see. The pope and the cardinals responded by
                    reenacting the sentence of excommunication. Henry occupied Rome; and Pope
                    Paschal died in the Castle of St Angelo, exhorting the cardinals with his latest
                    breath to greater firmness than he himself had shown in maintaining the rights
                    of the church. Paschal was the first of the pontiffs to discontinue the use of
                    the imperial years in dating his acts and encyclicals, substituting instead the
                    year of his own pontificate. The short rule of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Calixtus</hi> II. (1119-24), disgraced although it was by the savage revenge
                    which he perpetrated on his rival the antipope <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0519-0500"/> Gregory VIII., was characterized by wise and
                    resolute administration. A Frenchman by birth, he was the first to establish
                    those intimate relations with France which rendered that state the traditional
                    ally of the Roman see, and culminated in the secession to Avignon. Germany, on
                    the other hand, appears from this time as generally heading the anti-papal
                    party, espousing the cause of the antipope, and siding with Ghibelline faction.
                    But the chief event in the pontificate of Calixtus, and one which may be looked
                    upon as inaugurating a new era in the history of our subject, was the Concordat
                    of Worms of the year 1122.</p>
                <p>By this memorable treaty, which, accepted as the law of Christendom, seemed to
                    promise an ultimate conclusion of the long struggle, an understanding was at
                    last arrived at. The emperor ceded the right of investiture by the ring and the
                    pastoral staff,—thereby renouncing that at which the church most demurred, the
                    appearance of assuming to be in any way the transmitter of the spiritual
                    succession, but retaining the right of granting church benefices or other
                    property by the symbol of temporal power, the sceptre. The pope, on the other
                    hand, consented that the election of bishops and abbots should take place,
                    according to canonical procedure in the presence of the emperor, but that
                    neither bribery nor compulsion should be resorted to, and that, in the case of
                    disputed elections, there should be a right of appeal to the metropolitan and
                    provincial bishops. In Germany the investiture with the regalia by the sceptre
                    was to precede the consecration, the dependence of the higher clergy being thus
                    secured to the emperor; but in other countries the lay investiture was to take
                    place within six months after consecration. In an appended clause a reservation
                    was made which afterwards became a fruitful germ of controversy: the elected
                    dignitary bound himself to discharge his feudal obligations to the emperor
                    arising out of his investiture with the temporalities, “except in all things
                    which are acknowledged to belong to the Roman Church.”</p>
                <p>During the pontificate of <hi rend="smallcaps">Innocent</hi> II. (1130-43) the
                    importance of the new relations established with France are to be seen in the
                    all-commanding influence of <hi rend="smallcaps">Bernard of</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Clairvaux</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> the unswerving
                    supporter of the papal claims, round whose career indeed the life of the Western
                    Church for half a century may be said mainly to revolve. In the struggle,
                    arising out of his disputed election, with the antipope, Anacletus II., Innocent
                    succeeded in gaining the support of Bernard, and through Bernard that of the
                    emperor Lothair; and the narrative of his restoration to his see by the imperial
                    forces, after an exile of four years, is one of the most dramatic episodes in
                    papal history. Technically, at least, Anacletus had the better claim to the
                    papacy, having been elected by a majority of the cardinals; but Innocent secured
                    the support of Lothair by making over to him the territory bequeathed by the
                    countess Matilda. In return for this concession, Lothair accepted the imperial
                    crown from Innocent in the church of the Lateran, and acknowledged himself the
                    pope’s vassal, —in the language of the inscription recording the event, “Post
                    homo fit Papae, sumit quo dante coronam.”</p>
                <p>The change in the imperial dynasty, involving as it did the setting aside of
                    Lothair’s son-in-law as emperor, revived the rivalry between the empire and the
                    papacy; and the Ghibellines, or adherents of the Hohenstaufen (or Swabian) line,
                    now represented a more distinctly defined party in opposition to the Guelfs, who
                    sustained the traditional policy of the Saxon imperial line, and sided with the
                    popes. Frederick Barbarossa, although he consented to receive the imperial crown
                    at the hands of <hi rend="smallcaps">Hadrian</hi> IV. (1154-59), required that
                    pontiff altogether to disavow the notion of having conferred it as a <hi
                    rend="italic">beneficium</hi> upon a vassal, maintaining that, through the
                    election of the princes, he held his crowns (both kingly and imperial) of God
                    alone.</p>
                <p>During the pontificate of <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi> III. (1159-81)
                    Frederick supported the cause of the antipopes. A disputed election, in which
                    the merits of the candidates are even yet more difficult to determine than in
                    the election of Innocent II., gave rise to a series of counter claims, and
                    Alexander, during his long pontificate, had to contend with four successive
                    antipopes each backed by the imperial arms. Only the election of the first,
                    Victor V. (antipope, 1159-64), however, had real canonical validity, the claims
                    of the others having always been regarded by all orthodox Catholics as
                    presumptuous. It was during the latter part of Alexander’s government that Rome
                    achieved a great moral triumph in England in the reaction which followed upon
                    the murder of Thomas Becket and the abrogation of the Constitutions of
                    Clarendon. Eight years later the attention of all Christian Europe was riveted
                    by the memorable occurrence which marked the consummation of the truce of Venice
                    (1178), when Frederick Barbarossa prostrated himself before the aged pontiff and
                    held his stirrup as he mounted his palfrey.</p>
                <p>Passing by the comparatively unimportant careers of the five popes whose names
                    stand between those of Alexander and <hi rend="smallcaps">Innocent</hi> III.
                    (1198-1216), we find ourselves at the stage which marks the culmination of the
                    papal power. The august descent of this pontiff; his learning as a canonist and
                    his commanding genius; the interdicts which he could venture to impose on great
                    realms, whether ruled by the astute sagacity of a Philip Augustus or by the
                    reckless folly of a John; his sentences of excommunication, hurled with deadly
                    effect at emperor and at kings; the vigour with which he wrested whole provinces
                    from the imperial domination—the march of Ancona and the duchy of Spoleto—to
                    weld together into one compact whole the Patrimonium and the Romagna; the energy
                    with which he repressed the heresies which threatened the unity of the church;
                    the boldness with which he defined the doctrine of transubstantiation; his
                    patience in working and waiting for opportunities, and the promptitude with
                    which he seized the occasion when it arrived,—such are the features which
                    combine to render the eighteen years’ pontificate of Innocent III. a period of
                    unrivalled lustre and importance in the history of the popedom. It was now that
                    the papal power may be said to have effectually impressed its theory of
                    sacerdotal government upon Europe; that the canon law, wherein that theory was
                    elaborated, began to be taught in the universities which rose throughout Europe
                    —Bologna, Padua, Paris, Orleans, Oxford, and Cambridge; that ecclesiastical
                    discipline everywhere modelled itself on the practice of Rome; that the
                    mendicant orders, especially those of St Dominic and St Francis of Assisi, with
                    their irregular enthusiasm, skilfully converted by Innocent into a
                    widely-diffused, untiring, and devoted propaganda, roused a new spirit alike in
                    the universities and among the illiterate laity, and became a powerful
                    instrument wherewith to coerce to obedience the episcopal order and the whole
                    body of the secular clergy.</p>
                <p>The chief interest attaching to the pontificates of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Honorius</hi> III. (1216-27), <hi rend="smallcaps">Gregory</hi> IX. (1227-41),
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Innocent</hi> IV. (1243-54) arises from their connexion
                    with the policy and career of Frederick II. (emperor 1210-50). To the whole
                    traditions of the popedom Frederick was especially obnoxious, menacing on the
                    one hand its standard of doctrine by his reputed scepticism, and its newly
                    acquired possessions on the other by his schemes for the revival of imperial
                    supremacy in Italy. In the sequel his designs were baffled by the ability and
                    resolution of Gregory and Innocent; and at the general council of Lyons (1245)
                    Frederick was deposed both from his imperial and his kingly dignities, and his
                    subjects declared to be absolved from their fidelity. In this manner the power
                    claimed by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n520/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0520-0501"/> the Roman pontiff of deposing even kings received
                    the implicit sanction of a general council. The empire, worsted in Italy, broke
                    down in Germany. In 1268 Conradin, the grandson of Frederick and the last
                    representative of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, was cruelly put to death by Charles
                    of Anjou, and the long contest of the empire with the popedom came to an
                    end.</p>
                <p>The policy of <hi rend="smallcaps">Gregory</hi> X. (1271-76), a man of ability
                    and moderation, deserves the praise of having apparently aimed at the general
                    good of Christendom, so far, at least, as not incompatible with the overweening
                    pretensions which he continued to uphold. Gregory endeavoured to compose the
                    bitter jealousies and long-continued strife of the Italian states by the
                    establishment of a general protectorate under Charles of Anjou, king of Naples,
                    and to reconcile Guelf and Ghibelline by concessions to the leaders of the
                    latter party. He effected a temporary agreement with the Eastern Church; and he
                    sought to put an end to the abuses and rivalries which now almost invariably
                    accompanied each election to the pontificate by introducing a new method of
                    proceeding on such occasions. In the meantime, the growing spirit of nationality
                    had already received a striking exemplification in France by the enactment of
                    the Pragmatic Sanction (1268). Of this measure, which has been described as the
                    foundation of the Gallican liberties, it will here suffice to say that it
                    consists of a series of enactments expressly directed against all those
                    encroachments of the popedom with respect to collations to benefices, elections
                    to bishoprics, simoniacal practices, ecclesiastical promotions, imposts, and
                    other forms of exaction, such as we have already noted in their gradual growth.
                    Shielded from criticism by the fact that it was sanctioned by the pious Louis
                    IX., the loyal son of the church, the Pragmatic Sanction passed at the time
                    unchallenged even by the papacy itself. Of the extent to which the latter was
                    becoming more and more a political institution we have striking evidence in the
                    brief pontificate of <hi rend="smallcaps">Celestine</hi> V. (1294). A hermit of
                    the Abruzzi, of austere and holy life, he had been elected pope in the hope that
                    his reputation for virtue might in some measure restore the character of his
                    office. Something more, however, than mere sanctity and blamelessness were now
                    necessary for the discharge of the duties of a position which by its
                    associations demanded the exercise of statecraft, political intrigue, and a wide
                    knowledge of affairs. In less than six months Celestine resigned an office for
                    which by lack of experience and ability he was altogether unfitted, but leaving
                    behind him a tradition of self-devoted and holy life which found expression in
                    the institution of a new religious order, that of the Celestinians, afterwards
                    blended with the Fraticelli, or Spiritual Franciscans. Upon <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Boniface</hi> VIII. (1294-1303) the signs of the times and the development of a
                    spirit and of institutions incompatible with the pretensions of his predecessors
                    were altogether lost. A man of considerable abilities, indomitable will, and
                    imperious nature, he enunciated in yet more uncompromising terms the theory of
                    the papal supremacy. In the memorable bull <hi rend="italic">Unam sanctam.
                    Ecclesiam</hi> (18th Nov. 1302), he declared that the church could have but one
                    head—a two-headed church would be a monstrosity; and he explained away the
                    traditional interpretation of the symbolic meaning of the two swords, by
                    affirming that the temporal sword wielded by the monarch was borne only at the
                    will and by the permission of the pontiff <hi rend="italic">(ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nutum et patientiam sacerdotis).</hi> Dazzled by the apparent
                    success which attended his first measures, he was only confirmed in his policy
                    by the resistance he encountered in France and England. In Philip the Fair,
                    however, he was matched with an antagonist as resolute and unscrupulous as
                    himself and one who better understood the tendencies of the age. In the struggle
                    that ensued Philip had the whole French nation, including the episcopal order,
                    on his side; the pontiff was worsted, and his humiliation and sense of defeat
                    hastened his end.</p>
                <p>With the death of Boniface fell also the papacy of the Middle Ages, both in
                    theory and in fact:—in theory, through the ascendency of counter views such as
                    those put forth in the <hi rend="italic">I)e</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Monarchia</hi> of Dante, and in the writings of Aegidius Colonna and John of
                    Paris, which enforced the reasonableness and necessity of the supremacy of the
                    political power; in fact, from the manner in which the French monarch succeeded
                    not only in repelling the papal pretensions but in eventually reducing the Roman
                    see itself to be a mere instrument of his will and a submissive agent in the
                    furtherance of his policy.</p>
                <p>The origin, the growth, the characteristics, the assumptions, and the downfall of
                    the mediaeval papacy having now been traced out, it remains to note, as
                    concisely as practicable, the chief features in the later history of the
                    institution. In the year 1305 <hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> V. (1305-14), an
                    Aquitanian by birth, was elected after long contention to the pontificate. He
                    was invested with the tiara at Lyons, and subsequently (1309) transferred his
                    court from Rome to Avignon. The pressure put upon him by King Philip is
                    generally assigned as the cause of this step, but it is not improbable that he
                    was only too glad to escape from the strife then waging between the two great
                    factions, the Orsinis and the Colonnas, at Rome. At Avignon, for a period of
                    nearly seventy years, derisively styled the “Babylonian captivity,” pope after
                    pope held his court. Degraded to a state of splendid vassalage to France, their
                    luxury, pride, rapacity, and avarice became a bye-word in Europe, while their
                    complete subservience to the political aims of the French crown effectually
                    alienated from them the good will and sympathy of England and Germany. When <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">John</hi> XXII. (1316-34) sought to interfere in a double
                    election to the empire, the diet at Frankfort denounced his whole policy in
                    terms that startled Europe by their boldness; and the electoral union at Rense
                    in 1338 passed a resolution declaring that “whoever was chosen by the electors
                    became at once both king and emperor, and did not require that his election
                    should be approved and sanctioned by the apostolic see.” Other causes
                    contributed effectually to lower the papacy in the estimation of Europe. Clement
                    V. concurred in the infamous devices by which Philip procured the suppression of
                    the Order of the Templars, and the barbarous cruelties inflicted on the noble
                    victims produced in the popular mind a feeling of deepest aversion for the
                    authors of those proceedings. The traffic in benefices was now again developing
                    into a gigantic scandal and abuse. Annates and Peter’s pence were exacted with
                    an insatiable rapacity. Italy itself, indeed, torn between contending parties
                    and impoverished by the interruptions to commerce, offered but a barren field
                    for plunder, but in the countries north the Alps the pope’s emissaries were
                    everywhere to be seen, ever intent on their errand of exaction. The wealth thus
                    acquired was partly devoted towards extending the territorial possessions of the
                    see; and Avignon and the county of Venaissin, purchased in 1348 from the crown
                    of Provence, remained papal until the French Revolution. It is not a little
                    significant that this increase in wealth and territory should have been
                    concomitant with the sinking of the moral influence of the papacy to its lowest
                    ebb. In England the civil power endeavoured to check this system of extortion by
                    re-enacting the Statutes of Praemunire and Provisors. In Germany the deep
                    discontent to which it gave rise formed an important contributing element in the
                    causes which brought about the Reformation. In France the luxury and gross
                    immorality of the <pb break="no"

                    scathing language by Petrarch, are assigned by other contemporary writers as
                    conducing largely to the corruption of morals throughout the realm. Even among
                    the religious orders themselves there began to be signs of insubordination, and
                    the Fraticelli, or Spiritual Franciscans, who now took their rise, openly avowed
                    that the principles which they professed were designed as a protest against the
                    appalling degeneracy of the curia; while great scholars in the universities,
                    like William of Occam and Marsilio of Padua, brought the dialectics and new
                    philosophical tenets of the schools in the universities to bear with no little
                    effect on the whole system of the popedom.</p>
                <p>The outbreak of the great schism struck no less deeply at those sentiments of
                    veneration and deference which had been wont to gather round the pontiff’s
                    chair. The majority in the college of cardinals were Frenchmen, and, on the
                    death of Gregory XI. in 1378, it seemed only too probable that another Frenchman
                    would be elected his successor. The discontent of the citizens of Rome at the
                    withdrawal of the curia from the capital had now, however, reached a culminating
                    point. This feeling, it is to be noted, was by_ no means one of mere sentiment
                    and attachment to tradition, for the diversion of appeals, pilgrimages,
                    deputations, and embassies, with their attendant influx of travellers, and of
                    large streams of wealth and business from Rome to Avignon, had materially
                    affected the prosperity of the former city. On the occasion of the new election
                    the prevailing dissatisfaction found vent in menacing demonstrations on the part
                    of the population, and even in scenes of actual violence. In order to appease
                    the city the terrified cardinals determined on the unanimous election of an
                    Italian, Prignani, archbishop of Bari, who assumed the title of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Urban</hi> VI. The election was singularly unfortunate. The new
                    pontiff, intoxicated by his sudden and unexpected fortune, assumed such
                    arrogance of demeanour and showed himself so altogether wanting in moderation
                    and self-control that the cardinals put forth the plea that they had discharged
                    their function as electors under intimidation, and declared the election
                    invalid. In proceeding to elect another pontiff, their choice fell upon one of
                    their own number, Robert of Geneva, known as <hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi>
                    VII. (1378-94). For a period of thirty-eight years, Christian Europe was
                    scandalized by the contentions of two rival popes, the one holding his court at
                    Rome, the other at Geneva, each hurling anathemas, excommunication, and the
                    foulest accusations at the other, and compared by Wyclif to “two dogs snarling
                    over a bone ”—a simile which in itself affords significant proof of the manner
                    in which the popedom had fallen in the estimation of Christendom. The potentates
                    of Europe, in declaring themselves “in the obedience,” as it was termed, of one
                    or the other pontiff, were swayed almost entirely by political considerations,
                    in which jealousy of France was the predominant sentiment. Italy, Germany,
                    Bohemia, England, Flanders, Hungary, and Poland, all declared themselves in the
                    obedience of the pope at Rome; Scotland, Savoy, Lorraine, declared themselves,
                    'along with France, in that of the pope at Avignon. The Spanish kingdoms, which
                    at first stood aloof, ultimately also decided, though from somewhat different
                    motives, in favour of the latter pontiff. At last, at the commencement of the
                    15th century, an endeavour was made to prevail on both the reigning
                    popes—Gregory XII. at Rome, Benedict XIII. at Avignon—to renounce their claims,
                    with a view to the restoration of church union. The proposal was met by both
                    popes with persistent and unscrupulous evasion. France, indignant at the
                    subterfuges of Benedict, withdrew her support, and he accordingly retired to
                    Perpignan. The cardinals attached to either court met together at Leghorn, and
                    agreed to summon a general council, to meet at Pisa on the 25th March 1409. In
                    the meantime isolated scholars and divines throughout Europe, among the regular
                    and the secular clergy alike, were pondering deeply the lesson taught by the
                    papal history of the last six centuries, and in the place of the traditional
                    theories of appeals to popes, to councils, or to emperors there was growing up
                    another conception, that of the essential falsity of the axioms on which the
                    theory of the papal supremacy had been built up, and of Scriptural authority as
                    the only sure and final source of guidance in deciding upon questions of
                    doctrine and morality.</p>
                <p>But as yet, before ideas such as these had been sufficiently developed and events
                    had prepared the popular mind for their reception, the remedy that most
                    commended itself to the leading minds of Christendom was that of a true general
                    council. Such was the idea which influential churchmen of the age—men like Peter
                    D’Ailly, cardinal of Cambrai, and John Gerson, chancellor of the university of
                    Paris, who, while they deplored the discipline, still assented to the doctrines
                    of the church—believed to be the best solution of the difficulties in which that
                    church had become involved. The opinions of the doctors of the canon law and of
                    theology at the universities had been taken, and at Oxford as in Paris it had
                    been decided that a general council might be summoned even against the will of
                    the pope, and that, when thus convened, its authority was superior to his. Such
                    were the circumstances under which in 1409 the council of Pisa was summoned. The
                    council enunciated the dogma of its own supremacy; it deposed the rival popes;
                    it constituted the two separate bodies of cardinals a single conclave, and by
                    this conclave a new pope, <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi> V. (1409-10) was
                    elected. Schemes of general ecclesiastical reform were discussed; and then after
                    a four months’ session the assembly adjourned, to resume, at an interval of
                    three years, its yet more memorable deliberations at Constance. In the
                    intervening time, Alexander V. died, not without strong suspicion of his having
                    been removed by poison through the machinations of his successor, the notorious
                    Balthasar Cossa, who assumed the title of <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi> XXIII.
                    (1410-15), and took up his residence in Rome. It is with this pontiff that the
                    gross abuse of indulgences is said to have first arisen. In the year 1416 the
                    council of Constance met, amid the most sanguine expectations on the part of
                    religious Europe, but it achieved practically nothing in the direction of church
                    reform. It deposed John XXIII., but <hi rend="smallcaps">Martin</hi> V.
                    (1417-31), by whom he was succeeded, although in some respects an estimable
                    pontiff, skilfully availed himself of the disturbances in Bohemia and the
                    hostile inroads of the Turks to postpone all questions of reform to a future
                    occasion. On the other hand, the actual results of its deliberations were
                    reactionary in their tendency. The council burned John Huss, one of the first to
                    assert the rights of the individual conscience in opposition to the prevailing
                    hierarchical system; it crushed the party of reform in the university of Paris,
                    and banished their great leader. The council of Basel (1431-49), although it
                    re-enunciated the principle of the superiority of a general council over the
                    pope, found, when it sought to proceed to the more practical reforms involved in
                    placing restrictions on the abuses practised under the papal sanction, that it
                    had assumed a task beyond its powers. Under the pretext of bringing about a
                    reconciliation with the Eastern Church, and inviting its delegates to the
                    deliberations of the council, <hi rend="smallcaps">Eugenius</hi> IV. (1431-47)
                    proposed to transfer the place of meeting from Basel to some Italian city. The
                    council, well knowing that such a measure would be fatal to its independence,
                    refused its assent; Eugenius retaliated by dissolving the council; the council,
                    by <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n522/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0522-0503"/> suspending the pope. Thereupon Eugenius summoned
                    another council at Ferrara, which was afterwards removed to Florence. The
                    council of Basel, as a last resource, arrogated to itself the papal functions,
                    and then proceeded to elect Amadeus, duke of Savoy, pope, with the title of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Felix</hi> V. In this extreme measure it failed, however, to
                    carry with it the more influential European powers. Germany, after an
                    ineffectual endeavour to mediate between the rival popes, assumed, in the first
                    instance, an attitude of strict neutrality, but was ultimately won over by the
                    crafty Aeneas Sylvius (afterwards Pius II.) to conclude the notable Concordat of
                    Vienna (1448). By this mercenary arrangement the newly-elected emperor,
                    Frederick III., altogether renounced whatever advantages had, down to that time,
                    been gained by the labours of the council of Basel, receiving in return from
                    Nicholas V. certain concessions with respect to all episcopal elections in his
                    own hereditary dominions, together with a hundred of the most valuable
                    benefices, the visitatorial rights in relation to the monasteries, and a tenth
                    of the monastic revenues. The policy adopted by France was of an altogether
                    different character. She preferred to adjust her ecclesiastical liberties on the
                    basis defined and sanctioned by the royal authority at the congress of Bourges.
                    The Pragmatic Sanction there enacted was registered by the parliament of Paris,
                    13th July 1439,—thus becoming part of the statute law of France. In this
                    celebrated manifesto the spirit of Gerson and the university of Paris spoke
                    again; but, while its twenty-three provisions rendered it peculiarly obnoxious
                    to the Roman see, the manner in which it set aside all royal nominations made it
                    no less distasteful to the monarchy. Louis XI., feigning to yield to the
                    pressure put upon him from Rome, abolished it, but it was re-enacted’ by Louis
                    XII. Eventually, in the year 1516, amid the full flow of the advantages which he
                    had gained by the victory of Marignano, Francis I. permitted the Pragmatic
                    Sanction to be superseded by the Concordat of Bologna,—a disastrous compromise
                    of principles, wherein, while some important concessions were made to Leo X.,
                    the crown interference with the administration of the church was more
                    effectually established than ever, and the independence of the Gallican clergy
                    reduced to a shadow. The concordat made no mention of the councils of Constance,
                    Basel, and Bourges, or of their fundamental conception of th <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> e superiority of a general council over the pope; and
                    it left the opportunity open for the réintroduction of annates. On the other
                    hand, the monarchical authority achieved a signal triumph; and, although the
                    parliament of Paris loudly protested, and even ventured to set aside some of the
                    royal nominations subsequently made, its voice was silenced by a peremptory
                    decree issued in the year 1527.</p>
                <p>To return to the council of Basel. Although supported at first by the electors of
                    Germany, it was, in the sequel, completely circumvented by the machinations of
                    the able but unscrupulous Aeneas Sylvius; and Pope Eugenius, at his death,
                    seemed almost to have regained the allegiance of Christendom. Under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nicholas</hi> V. (1447-55), the work of reunion was brought to
                    a completion. The council of Basel dissolved itself; and Felix V., laying aside
                    his empty title and dignity, retired into Savoy, and was shortly after promoted
                    to the rank of cardinal by Nicholas himself. The popedom was not destined ever
                    again to witness the phenomenon of a rival pontiff; and no council since the
                    council of Basel has ever ventured to assert its authority as superior to that
                    of the Roman chair. At the council of Florence that theory had been definitely
                    contravened (1439) by the enunciation of the following canon, in which the
                    counter theory first received a complete and distinct exposition:—“We define the
                    holy apostolic see and the Roman pontiff to have primacy over the whole earth,
                    and the Roman pontiff to be himself the successor of the blessed Peter, chief of
                    the apostles, and the true vicar of Christ, and to exist as head of the whole
                    church and father and teacher of all Christians; and that to him, in the blessed
                    Peter, our Lord Jesus Christ has committed full power of feeding, governing, and
                    directing the universal church, even as is [also] <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    contained both in the acts of the oecumenical councils and in the sacred
                    canons.”</p>
                <p>Thus re-established and confirmed in his own theory of his office and its
                    functions, the Roman pontiff regained somewhat of his former hold on the
                    estimation of Europe. There was also at the same time discernible a marked
                    improvement, so far as regarded external decorum, in the associations of the
                    curia; and, until the ascendency of the Borgias, the names of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nicholas</hi> V. (1447-55), Pius II. (1458-64), and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sixtus</hi> IV. (1471-84) redeemed the reputation of the Roman
                    see, if not for sanctity, at least for learning. The last-named pontiff,
                    however, lies under the imputation of having been the first to institute trials
                    for witchcraft, an example which spread, in later times, far wider than the
                    boundaries of Roman Catholicism itself. In the latter half of the 15th century
                    the popedom retires altogether into the background of European history. The
                    pretensions of the pontiff were not, indeed, in any way retracted or modified,
                    but his actual policy was no longer commensurate with these, and the former
                    weapons of the interdict and the anathema had fallen into disuse. The popes
                    became little more than territorial princes, their political and ecclesiastical
                    influence being exerted mainly with reference to the material interests of the
                    States of the Church. It was one of the most baneful results of these changed
                    external relations that each more ambitious pontiff —the Farnesi, the Borgias,
                    the Della Roveres, and the Medici—aspired to found an hereditary sovereignty or
                    principality in connexion with his own family, and the most valuable possessions
                    of the church were successively alienated. By the next pontiff the holders of
                    such property would be not unjustly regarded as usurpers, and it would be the
                    first aim of himself and his party to eject them from the lands and revenues
                    thus acquired. In this manner deadly feuds were generated, which became
                    hereditary in the different families, and proved an unfailing source of
                    sanguinary feuds and bitter animosities.</p>
                <p>With the tacit surrender of the theory of the supremacy of general councils, the
                    Holy Roman Empire itself came also virtually to an end; and Germany, broken up
                    into a number of independent principalities, often involved in internecine
                    strife, presented a striking contrast to the advances which France and Spain
                    were making in the direction of consolidation and order. The papacy found a
                    direct apparent advantage in fomenting this disunion, and in no country were the
                    exactions of its emissaries more shameless or extortionate. Eventually, however,
                    both these phases of its policy proved eminently detrimental to the Roman
                    interests. For, while the unscrupulousness of its agents did much to foster a
                    strong aversion to the tenets which they inculcated, and thus paved the way for
                    the reception of Lutheran doctrines, the isolation to which <hi rend="italic

                    early 16th century theologians. In the Roman edition of Abraham Cretensis,
                    however, the obvious meaning of the Greek, viz., that the prerogatives of the
                    pope are to be determined and exercised according to the canons of the ancient
                    councils, is done away with by the change of <hi rend="italic">et</hi> to <hi

                    (which thus becomes merely a confirmatory reference) is, that the prerogatives
                    enumerated belonged to the pope, and were also recognized in the ancient
                    councils.</p>

                <p>each German state was reduced proved favourable to its freer action, and enabled
                    it, in no small measure, to pursue that independent policy which, in several
                    instances, materially aided the progress of the Reformation. The history of the
                    popedom from this point (c. 1517) to the commencement of the council of Trent
                    (1545) will be found in the article on the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Reformation.</hi></p>
                <p>The distinctive features of the doctrinal belief formulated by the council of
                    Trent were mainly the outcome of Jesuit influences (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Jesuits);</hi> and, enforced as these tenets were by the terrorism of the
                    Inquisition, the freedom of thought which during the revival of learning had
                    passed comparatively unchallenged within the pale of the church was now
                    effectually extinguished. But it must at the same time be admitted that,
                    concurrently with this tendency to greater rigidity of doctrine, Roman
                    Catholicism became characterized by far greater earnestness of religious
                    teaching, displayed a remarkable activity in the cultivation of theological
                    learning, and abolished, or sought to abolish, many glaring abuses. In this
                    amendment, however, Rome had at first but small share. The Reformation movement
                    within the church took its rise in Spain; and the purely political feeling which
                    now constituted so considerable an element in the papal policy led each pontiff
                    to regard with no little jealousy the overweening aggrandizement of the Spanish
                    monarchy. Political considerations, in fact, sometimes prevailed over
                    theological sympathies. <hi rend="smallcaps">Paul</hi> III. (1534-49), in
                    endeavouring to trim his sails between the contending influences of France and
                    Spain, more than once took side with the powers who were fighting the battle of
                    Protestantism.</p>
                <p>While thus involved in antagonism to the chief of the Catholic powers, the Roman
                    see found its difficulties not a little enhanced by the alienation of the
                    revenues formerly derived from those countries which now professed the
                    Protestant faith. Prior to the 16th century the States of the Church had enjoyed
                    an almost unrivalled prosperity. That prosperity was mainly owing to their
                    immunity from direct taxation. Nothing had contributed so much to the
                    unpopularity of Hadrian VI. as his endeavour to levy a small hearth-tax, in
                    order to replenish to some extent the coffers emptied by the prodigality of his
                    predecessor. The loss of the revenues alienated by successive pontiffs was now
                    aggravated by the failure of the supplies derived from the collection of Peter’s
                    pence and annates in Protestant countries. Even the sums levied in those
                    kingdoms which continued to profess Catholicism suffered considerable diminution
                    before they reached the Roman treasury, and the main source of revenue at this
                    period appears to have been that represented by the sale of offices. In the
                    serious financial embarrassment in which the curia now found itself involved,
                    every expedient was had recourse to in order to meet the inevitable expenditure;
                    and it is to the example of the papal treasury that Von Ranke attributes the
                    commencement of national debts. In default of the contributions no longer levied
                    in England, in the United Provinces, and in northern Germany, the pope found
                    himself under the necessity of taxing his own territory; and in this manner the
                    Romagna, once so prosperous, was crushed by a weight of taxation which
                    ultimately embraced every article of merchandise. The farmer and the peasant
                    left the land; and the papal provinces, formerly the most fertile and prosperous
                    in Italy, degenerated into a series of ill-cultivated, unwholesome, and
                    unproductive wastes.</p>
                <p>If left to rely solely on the loyalty of its adherents and the prevalent
                    impression of its abstract merits, the position of the popedom at this period,
                    viewed in connexion with its financial difficulties, might well have seemed
                    almost hopeless, had not its interests been so closely interwoven with those of
                    the secular power. The latter indeed was frequently induced to connive at the
                    papal exactions from the mere fact that it shared largely in the proceeds; and
                    in France the very advantages gained by the crown led it to regard with
                    complacency a system by which the royal influence and the royal revenues were
                    alike so largely augmented. The temporal ruler was thus sometimes found a firm
                    supporter of the popedom, even although involved in hostilities with the
                    reigning pope.</p>
                <p>During the pontificate of <hi rend="smallcaps">Julius</hi> III. (1550-55), who
                    dreamed away his closing years in the splendid palace and gardens which he had
                    himself designed near the Porta del Popolo, the curia played a merely passive
                    part in the great European drama; but with the accession of Cardinal Caraffa,
                    who assumed the title of <hi rend="smallcaps">Paul</hi> IV. (1555-59), it became
                    animated by another spirit. An energetic supporter of the doctrines already
                    promulgated by the council of Trent, devoted to the cause of the church, but
                    hating the Spaniard with the traditional hatred of a Neapolitan, his support was
                    given entirely to the French interests in European politics. He proclaimed
                    himself at once the liberator of Italy and the reformer of the church. In his
                    plans of reform, although he relied mainly on the Inquisition, he included alike
                    the monastic orders and the secular clergy. His successor, Pius IV. (1559-65),
                    although a man of different character, pursued a similar policy. The council of
                    Trent assembled again under his auspices, but its discussions now concerned only
                    points of Roman doctrine and discipline, and the rupture with the Protestant
                    communions was complete. With the accession of Pius V. (1566-72), who had filled
                    the office of chief inquisitor in Rome, the conditions of the papal policy had
                    become less embarrassing. Spain now stood at the head of the Catholic powers,
                    and England at the head of the Protestant. In France the issue of the deadly
                    struggle that was being waged between the Huguenots and the League, which seemed
                    likely to decide the religious destinies of Europe, was still doubtful. Philip
                    II. accordingly appeared as the natural ally of the popedom, and Pius, having
                    once accepted the position, remained true to this alliance throughout. The
                    lavish expenditure of <hi rend="smallcaps">Gregory</hi> XIII. (1572-85) brought
                    back the former condition of financial embarrassment. He not only made large
                    grants to aid the cause of Catholic education, and especially the newly-founded
                    colleges of the Jesuits, but he systematically subsidized the powers who fought
                    on the side of the church. Although the revenues of the papal states were again
                    on the increase, the rate of exchange during Pope Gregory’s pontificate was
                    never once in their favour. At last the pressure became insupportable. The
                    spirit of Guelf and Ghibelline revived. The Romagna rose in insurrection; and,
                    eventually, the aged pontiff died broken-hearted amid the disorganization and
                    lawlessness which surrounded him on every side. But already the tide of
                    Protestantism was beginning to ebb; and the famous bull <hi rend="italic">In
                    Coena Domini,</hi> which Gregory promulgated in 1584, enjoining the extirpation
                    of the different heresies in Germany, indicated the growing weakness of the
                    Lutheran communities.</p>
                <p>The five years embraced by the pontificate of <hi rend="smallcaps">Sixtus</hi> V.
                    (1585-90), the last of the really great pontiffs, mark another great crisis in
                    the history of the popedom. At his accession, the papal authority had dwindled
                    to its narrowest limits, being recognized scarcely anywhere save in Spain and
                    Italy, and in a few islands of the Mediterranean. To his tact, ability, and good
                    sense, conjoined with the widespread activity of the Jesuits, and aided by the
                    dissensions that prevailed among the Protestant sects, Catholicism was mainly
                    indebted for the remarkable reaction in its favour which set in with the <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0524-0505"/> closing years of the 16 th century—an episode of
                    which the 7 th book of Ranke’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Popes</hi>
                    supplies a comprehensive sketch. Sixtus conciliated the great landed proprietors
                    whom his predecessor had driven into insurrection by calling in question the
                    validity of their title-deeds and by attempts to re-appropriate their lands; he
                    repressed the prevailing brigandage with merciless severity; notwithstanding his
                    lowly extraction, he succeeded in winning the favour of the great houses—the
                    Colonnas and Orsinis; he developed the industries and manufactures of the
                    States; no pontiff ever effected so much for the improvement and adornment of
                    the capital; its population, which under Paul IV. had sunk to forty-five
                    thousand, rose to one hundred thousand; “for the third time,” says Ranke, “Rome
                    stood forth to view as the chief city of the world.” Another reform introduced
                    by Sixtus was that by which the college of cardinals, before a fluctuating body,
                    was definitely fixed at seventy. The inconsistencies of his foreign policy are
                    probably to be partly explained by the fact that, although the promotion of the
                    interests of the church was his most cherished object, he had conceived a
                    thorough distrust of Philip II. At the same time, while he believed that those
                    interests would be most effectually served by the establishment of peace and
                    order, he necessarily regarded with aversion the revolutionary doctrines of the
                    League, democratic in politics although ultramontane in doctrine. From Henry of
                    Navarre, indeed, he could not withhold his tribute of admiration; and on the
                    death of Henry III. he revoked the sentence of excommunication which he had
                    pronounced against the great Huguenot leader, and by his general policy
                    facilitated his return to the communion of the church. In like manner, although
                    he sanctioned the scheme of the Spanish Armada, and even promised a magnificent
                    subvention to the enterprise, as soon as he learned that, if successful, it
                    might result in the annexation of England to the crown of Spain, he withdrew his
                    support, and, when the failure of the expedition was known, could not conceal
                    his satisfaction.</p>
                <p>From the time of Sixtus V. the chief importance and interest of papal history are
                    to be found in its relations to France and Spain and to the Jesuit order (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Jesuits,</hi> vol. xiii. pp. 652-656) and, somewhat later,
                    to Jesuitism and Jansenism (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Jansenism,</hi> vol. xiii.
                    p. 566) combined. During the rest of the reign of Henry IV. France witnessed a
                    virtual triumph of Gallican principles; and, although he himself became a humble
                    suppliant for readmission within the communion of the Roman Church, it was only
                    to give more effectual expression to the principles of religious toleration. The
                    edict of Nantes (1598) was promulgated, in fact, in defiance of the strongly
                    expressed disapproval of <hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> VIII. (1592-1605).
                    The permission accorded to the Jesuits to return to France (1603) was a measure
                    resolved upon by Henry in opposition to the advice of both De Thou and Sully. He
                    appears to have been actuated simply by motives' of expediency, but his
                    expectations proved singularly fallacious. The Jesuits turned the opportunity
                    thus afforded them to signal account, and succeeded in establishing a powerful
                    ascendency in France throughout the 17 th and the first half of the 18th
                    century. The pontificate of Clement was distinguished by two other events, the
                    one memorable in politics, the other in literature. Of these, the former was the
                    reversion of the duchy of Ferrara, claimed from the house of Este by the
                    apostolic see as an escheated fief; the other was the publication of the greater
                    part of the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastici</hi>
                    of Baronius, a work of immense labour and research, which, although it could not
                    stand the test of later criticism, rendered material support to the pretensions
                    of the papacy. Baronius himself always maintained that the papacy was more
                    indebted to France than to any other European power; and on the death of Clement
                    his claim to the papal chair was strongly supported by the French party in the
                    conclave, his election being, however, lost through the opposition of the party
                    of Spain.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">Paul</hi> V. (1605-21), was carried, notwithstanding the
                    opposition of the same party. Paul’s election had really been in no small
                    measure owing to the fact that his previous career had not happened to involve
                    him in enmity with any of the cardinals. It is stated that Cardinal Bellarmine
                    would have been chosen in his place, but the conclave dreaded the consequences
                    of raising a Jesuit to the papal chair. Paul affected, however, himself to
                    regard his election as owing to the special intervention of Providence, and
                    assumed the air and demeanour which he held suitable to one divinely
                    commissioned to restore the pontifical office to its former dignity. No pontiff
                    ever insisted with more inflexible rigour on the attributes and exclusive powers
                    of his office. In the measures which he initiated for the purpose of extending
                    the influence and possessions of the church, Paul soon found himself involved in
                    a conflict with the powerful and flourishing republic of Venice. He accused the
                    Signory of opposing the institution of monastic and other religious foundations,
                    of conniving at the alienation of ecclesiastical property and at the suspension
                    of the authority of the ecclesiastical courts. Finding those whom he addressed
                    less amenable to his wishes than he anticipated, he proceeded to lay the whole
                    republic under an interdict. Such a sentence rendered it obligatδry on the
                    religious orders throughout the province to discontinue all the customary
                    religious services; the republic, however, enjoined them, under pain of
                    banishment, to continue those services as before. The Jesuits, along with two
                    other newly-founded orders, the Capuchins and the Theatines, alone ventured to
                    disobey, and were banished from the province. A fierce controversy ensued, in
                    which the conduct of the republic was vindicated by the able pen of Fra Paolo
                    Sarpi (better known as “Father Paul ”), while Baronius and Bellarmine defended
                    the cause of Rome. By Englishmen at that time resident in Italy, such as Sir
                    Henry Wotton and the eminent Bedell (afterwards bishop of Ardagh), and by the
                    English court, the contest was watched with lively interest as affording hopes
                    of an Italian Reformation. The quarrel was skilfully fomented by Spain, and
                    actual hostilities were averted only by the mediation of Henry IV. of France.
                    The later years of Paul’s pontificate present him in the more favourable light
                    of a reformer of many abuses which had crept into the law-courts of the States,
                    and the author of numerous improvements in the capital. He enlarged both the
                    Vatican and the Quirinal; and the Borghese family from his time ranked as one of
                    the wealthiest in the city.</p>
                <p>The protection extended to the Jesuits by Paul was continued by his successor,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Gregory</hi> XV. (1621-23), and was well repaid by their
                    devotion and energy as propagandists. Gradually, in kingdom after kingdom, in
                    principality after principality, the ground won by Protestantism, whether of the
                    Lutheran or the Reformed confession, was in a great measure recovered. In
                    Bohemia, in Silesia, and in Moravia the Protestant ministers, if not put to
                    death or imprisoned, were driven out, their churches closed, and their
                    congregations forbidden to assemble. Even in the United Provinces numerous
                    converts were made, and a footing regained for Catholic teaching which has never
                    since been lost, while in Asia and in America new territories were won which
                    might fairly seem to compensate the church for all that had been wrested from
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n525/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0525-0506"/> it in the Old World. The cordial co-operation of
                    the curia with the society of Jesus was suspended, however, during the
                    pontificate of <hi rend="smallcaps">Urban</hi> VIII. (1623-44). A man of
                    resolute and imperious nature, his conception of his own prerogatives is
                    indicated by his memorable retort, when, on one occasion, he was confronted with
                    a quotation from the pontifical constitutions, that the dictum of a living pope
                    was -worth more than those of a hundred dead ones. He claimed, indeed, the
                    promptest deference for his decisions; while the college of cardinals, which he
                    but rarely assembled in consistory, was treated by him with little respect. A
                    Florentine by birth, he had witnessed in his earlier years the bitter struggle
                    between the popedom and Spain; and it had become the cherished design of his
                    life to render the States powerful and independent, and himself, as pontiff, the
                    representative of a formidable political confederation. To this end he deemed it
                    essential to prevent the duchy of Mantua from falling into the hands of a ruler
                    who represented an influence antagonistic to, or independent of, Spain; and in
                    pursuit of this policy he sought the aid of Richelieu. It was the time when the
                    great cardinal was maturing his designs against the house of Hapsburg; and,
                    somewhat singularly, the popedom was thus brought into political alliance with
                    the statesman who was aiming at the overthrow of the very power to which Roman
                    Catholicism had been most indebted for its restoration. In the policy of
                    Richelieu and that of Urban there was indeed a similar inconsistency. The
                    former, while he persecuted the Huguenots at home, allied himself with
                    Protestant powers like England, the United Provinces, and the northern German
                    principalities; the latter, while he had recourse to the most rigorous measures
                    for the suppression of Protestantism in Germany, allied himself with the power
                    on which that Protestantism mainly relied for support. It is scarcely too much
                    to affirm to say that Protestantism, in the first half of the 17th century, owed
                    its very existence on the Continent to the political exigencies of the popedom.
                    During Urban’s pontificate, in the year 1634, the duchy of Urbino was
                    incorporated, like Ferrara, into the papal dominions, which now extended from
                    the Tiber to the Po, uninterrupted save by the little republic of San
                    Marino.</p>
                <p>The policy of <hi rend="smallcaps">Innocent</hi> X. (1644-55) was a complete
                    reversal of that of his predecessor, whose family he persecuted with implacable
                    animosity. So injurious indeed were the effects of the contentions produced by
                    these family feuds on the peace and prosperity of the city that <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi> VII. (1655-67) on his election took an oath
                    before the crucifix that he would never receive his kindred in Rome. Not less
                    serious were the dissensions produced by the strife of political parties. We
                    find an English visitor to Rome, during Innocent’s pontificate, deeming it
                    prudent to place himself under the protection of two cardinals—the one
                    representing the French, the other the Spanish faction. In Innocent’s eyes the
                    treaty of Westphalia assumed the aspect of a twofold disaster: in the
                    humiliation which it inflicted on the house of Hapsburg; and in the distinctness
                    with which it proclaimed the superiority of the state over the church, by the
                    declaration that all ordinances of the canon or civil law which might be found
                    to be at variance with the provisions of the treaty should be considered null
                    and void. Innocent even went so far as to denounce the treaty and to threaten
                    those who assented to its provisions with excommunication—a menace treated with
                    contemptuous indifference even by the Catholic powers. Throughout the reign of
                    Louis XIV., indeed, there existed a perfect understanding between that monarch
                    and the Jesuits; and with their support he could set the pope himself at
                    defiance with impunity. Louis asserted more unreservedly than any of his
                    predecessors the royal privileges known as the <hi rend="italic">droit de
                    regale.</hi> By this ancient right the crown claimed, whenever a bishopric was
                    vacant, both the revenues and the distribution of patronage attached to the see
                    as long as the vacancy continued. But in the southern provinces of Guienne,
                    Languedoc, Provence, and Dauphiné this right had hitherto never been enforced.
                    In an edict issued in 1673, however, Louis declared that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >droit de regale</hi> would in future be enforced throughout the whole extent of
                    the royal dominions. It was in vain that Innocent protested and threatened to
                    excommunicate those who espoused the royal claims. Louis, who was supported by
                    the great mass of the French clergy, remained firm; and nine years later a
                    further blow was aimed at papal predominance by the promulgation of the famous
                    <hi rend="italic">Declaratio Cleri Gallicani.</hi> In this notable manifesto,
                    which was drawn up at St Germains in 1682 and revised by Bossuet, a formal
                    denial was given to the theory that the pope had any power over the
                    temporalities of kings; the superiority of a general council over the pope was
                    once again affirmed; the administration of the affairs of the church by the
                    pontiff, it was declared, ought in all cases to be subject to the canon law, and
                    the papal authority to be exercised exclusively in connexion with questions of
                    dogma, but even in such matters the decisions of the pontiff were not infallible
                    and were subject to revision. <hi rend="smallcaps">Innocent</hi> XI. (1676—89),
                    who had in the meantime succeeded to the papal chair, declared these resolutions
                    to be null and void, and severely censured the French bishops who had assented
                    to them. His reputation for integrity and a genuine desire to reform the church
                    gave additional force to his protest. Among other measures for restoring order
                    in Rome he had deprived the French ambassador of the much-abused right of asylum
                    which, by long tradition, attached to the embassy and its extensive precincts,
                    and afforded shelter to many of the most desperate characters in the city. The
                    ambassador refused to yield up the privilege, and Innocent thereupon
                    excommunicated him. Louis now seized upon Avignon, took the papal nuncio
                    prisoner, and convened a general council. It was even believed that he had at
                    one time conceived the design of creating the archbishop of Paris, who seconded
                    and approved his policy, patriarch of France, and thus severing the last ties
                    that bound the Gallican Church to the popedom. The courage and resolution which
                    Innocent exhibited under these trying circumstances were by no means inspired
                    solely by the conviction of the justice of his cause. Perhaps at no period are
                    the interests and sympathies of religious parties to be found presenting a more
                    complicated study. All Europe at this time was watching with alarm the rapid
                    aggrandizement of the French monarchy; and Innocent, in his desire to see some
                    check placed on that aggrandizement, was even far from wishing that the
                    Huguenots should be expelled from France. With William of Orange he openly
                    avowed his sympathy, and it was from secret papers in the cabinet of his
                    minister of state that Louis, through the agency of a spy, first learned the
                    prince’s designs upon England. While the Jesuits, again, were co-operating with
                    Louis in his assertion of the Gallican liberties, the Protestant powers were
                    giving indirect support to the maintenance of the papal pretensions. From the
                    Jesuits Louis also received valuable aid in the question of the Spanish
                    succession; and it is to their machinations that contemporary writers ascribe
                    the fact that the Bourbon, Philip of Anjou, was named by Charles II. as the heir
                    to the Spanish monarchy.</p>
                <p>The virtue⅛and milder wisdom of <hi rend="smallcaps">Innocent</hi> XII. (1691-
                    1700) won from Louis what the unconciliatory attitude of his two predecessors,
                    Innocent XI. and <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi> VIIL (1689-91) had not been
                    able to obtain. In 1693 Louis himself notified to the pontiff that the
                    “Declaration” would <pb break="no"

                    Gallican clergy. Innocent responded by giving his assent to the above-mentioned
                    disposition of the Spanish crown by Charles II. Other circumstances concurred to
                    bridge over the breach which for half a century had separated the French
                    monarchy from the popedom. The revocation of the edict of Nantes (1685) had
                    conciliated both the curia and the Jesuits; and in 1699 the feeling of accord
                    between the French monarch and Innocent was confirmed by the condemnation of
                    Fénelon’s <hi rend="italic">Maximes</hi><hi rend="italic">des Saints.</hi> While
                    Protestantism was being crushed in France, Catholicism was obtaining in other
                    countries the immunities which it would not grant. In 1697 the elector Frederick
                    Augustus II. consented to declare himself a Catholic in order to gain the crown
                    of Poland, and by this means a certain toleration was secured for Roman doctrine
                    among a population bigotedly attached to Lutheranism. In 1713 the celebrated
                    constitution <hi rend="italic">Unigenitus</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Filius</hi> promulgated by <hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi> XI.
                    (1700-21) not only proved a death-blow to Jansenism, but involved in nearly the
                    same fate that party which had hitherto fought the battle of liberalism in the
                    Gallican Church. “All the extravagancies,” says a recent writer, “engendered by
                    Jansenism in its later and more questionable developments recoiled, however
                    unjustly, upon the system of ecclesiastical policy vindicated by Gerson, De
                    Marca, and Bossuet. Jansenism became manifestly dangerous to public order and
                    the security of the state; Gallicanism, in the view of a despotic Government,
                    seemed involved in the same odious category; and it was deemed necessary, in
                    consequence, to visit both with an impartial exhibition of the same persecuting
                    rigour” (Jervis, <hi rend="italic">Church of France,</hi> ii. 278). Many of the
                    Jansenists, driven from France, retired to Utrecht, a church which, without
                    professing Jansenist principles, long continued to uphold the standard of
                    doctrine fixed by Tridentine canons in opposition to the dangerous advance of
                    Jesuitism. The Jansenists were always distinguished by their resolute opposition
                    to the theory of papal infallibility, and with their fall a chief obstacle to
                    the promulgation of that dogma was removed.</p>
                <p>But, while, with respect to the acceptance of doctrine, the losses of the 16 th
                    century were thus materially retrieved, the popedom was sinking rapidly in
                    political importance. Its influence in the Italian peninsula dwindled to within
                    the limits of the States of the Church; and the dynastic succession in Naples
                    and Sicily, in Parma and Piacenza, underwent a total change without the curia or
                    the pontifical interests being in any way consulted. The results of the War of
                    the Spanish Succession disappointed in every way the hopes of Clement XI.; and
                    his chagrin, when he found himself compelled to recognize the pretensions of the
                    archduke Charles to the Spanish crown, was intense. The manner in which the
                    conclusion of the war demonstrated the growing power of England was again a
                    sinister omen for the permanence of the papal system.</p>
                <p>. The order to whose efforts, notwithstanding an exceptional experience in
                    France, the popedom had in other countries been largely indebted was also
                    destined to a signal reverse. The conviction had long been growing up in the
                    chief cities of the Continent that wherever the representatives of Jesuitism
                    obtained a footing the cause of public order and domestic peace was placed in
                    jeopardy. And, while, in distant lands, the vaunted successes of the Jesuit
                    missionaries too often represented the diffusion of a merely nominal
                    Christianity, their Activity as traders was a constant source of irritation to
                    the mercantile communities. We find, accordingly, the statesmen of Catholic
                    Europe exhibiting, in the middle of the 18th century, a remarkable unanimity in
                    their estimate of Jesuitism as a mischievous element in society, and also
                    showing an increasing determination to bring all ecclesiastical institutions
                    more and more under the control of the civil power. Carvalho, the Portuguese
                    minister, who had himself become involved in a deadly struggle with the order at
                    court, called upon <hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> XIV. (1740-58) to take
                    measures for enforcing fundamental reforms among the whole body. Benedict, who
                    recognized perhaps more fully than any other pontiff of the century the signs of
                    the times, and who introduced not a few salutary reforms in the general
                    relations of the curia, was far from disinclined for the task, but died before
                    his schemes could be put in operation. His successor, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Clement</hi> XIII. (1758-69), on the other hand, professed to discern in the
                    Jesuit body the surest stay of the church, and in 1765 gave his formal sanction
                    to the peculiar form of devotion which they had introduced, known as the worship
                    of the Sacred Heart. In 1768 he condemned their expulsion from France as “a
                    grievous injury inflicted at once upon the church and the holy see.” The
                    dissensions fomented by their agency at the Bourbon courts continued, however,
                    to increase; and in 1769 the representatives of the chief Catholic powers at the
                    Roman court received instructions to present each a formal demand that the
                    Jesuit order should be secularized and abolished. Clement, who had vainly
                    appealed to the empress Maria Theresa for the exertion of her influence, died
                    suddenly of apoplexy on the day preceding that on which a consistory was to have
                    been held for the purpose of giving effect to the demands of the powers. It was
                    expressly with the view that he should carry out the task which his predecessor
                    had sought to evade that Cardinal Ganganelli, <hi rend="smallcaps">Clement</hi>
                    XIV. (1769-74), was raised to the pontifical chair, chiefly through the Bourbon
                    interest. Originally a Franciscan friar, and a man of retiring unworldly
                    disposition, the new pontiff was painfully embarrassed by the responsibilities
                    attaching to the policy which he was expected to carry out. At length, after
                    four years spent in balancing conflicting evidence and overcoming the scruples
                    of his own mind, he issued the brief <hi rend="italic">Dominus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et Redemptor Noster,</hi> for the suppression of the order, which
                    he declared to have merited its ruin by “its restlessness of spirit and audacity
                    of action.” The remorse which he was said to have subsequently exhibited,
                    combined with his sudden and mysterious end, were not without considerable
                    effect upon his successor, Pius VI. (1775— 99), who observed the utmost caution
                    in carrying out the decree of Clement, and devoted his main efforts during his
                    long pontificate to diverting the mind of Christendom from questions of doctrine
                    to others of a practical and more pleasing character. The austere simplicity
                    which had distinguished the Roman court in the time of Clement was exchanged for
                    more than regal pomp and magnificence, while the pontiff’s own subjects were
                    benefited by the draining of the Pontine marshes, a work of immense labour,
                    whereby a vast district extending along the sea-coast south of Rome was
                    converted from an unhealthy swamp into a plain that subserved in some measure
                    the purposes both of agriculture and commerce. That the suppression of the
                    Jesuit order had been attended with no little danger to the interests of the
                    Roman see was clearly shown by the progress which liberal opinions now began to
                    make in Germany. The valuable researches of Muratori, which appeared in the
                    earlier half of the 18th century had thrown a flood of light on all the
                    circumstances of the development of the mediaeval papacy, and his labours as an
                    editor had served, at the same time, to render the successive contemporary
                    writers accessible for the first time to the ordinary scholar. In the year 1763
                    the famous treatise of Nicholas von Hontheim, suffragan bishop of Treves,
                    published under the pseudonym of “Febronius,” produced a profound impression. It
                    was entitled <hi rend="italic">On the State of the Church and the Legitimate
                    Power of the Roman Bishop,</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n527/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0527-0508"/> and was mainly devoted to pointing out how
                    largely the false decretals, and the application of their doctrines, had been
                    made to subserve the later pretensions of Rome, and more especially her claims
                    to assert the supremacy of the pontiff over general councils. On the accession
                    of Joseph II., in 1780, to the throne of Austria, a new era commenced throughout
                    the empire. Half the monasteries and friaries were suppressed. The bulls <hi
                    rend="italic">Uni</hi><hi rend="italic">genitus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >In</hi><hi rend="italic">Coena Domini</hi> were declared null and void within
                    the limits of the empire. Toleration was extended to Protestant sects and to
                    members of the Greek Church; and the introduction of papal dispensations within
                    the Austrian dominions was declared unlawful, unless it could be shown that they
                    were obtained without payment. Pius VI. vainly endeavoured to divert the emperor
                    from his policy of reform by a personal visit to Vienna in 1782. He was received
                    with enthusiasm by the populace, but with coldness by the emperor, and by prince
                    Kaunitz, the emperor’s chief adviser, with absolute rudeness. A few years later
                    the outbreak of the French Revolution seemed to portend for the popedom a like
                    fate to that which had overtaken the Jesuit order. A movement which abolished
                    tithes, rejected Catholicism as the state religion, and confiscated the property
                    of the church and the monastic orders in France was not likely, when its
                    representatives appeared in Italy, to deal leniently with papal institutions.
                    The demeanour of the National Assembly towards Pius himself had not been
                    disrespectful; but the outrages on religious sentiment and decency itself
                    perpetrated by the Convention drove the alarmed pontiff into the arms of
                    Austria, with whom and the several reigning Italian princes he hastily concluded
                    an offensive league. In the Italian campaign he met accordingly with no mercy at
                    the hands of the Directory, and of Bonaparte acting as their representative. In
                    1797, first of all at Bologna and subsequently at Tolentino, the most rigorous
                    conditions were imposed. The pontiff was compelled to cede to France not only
                    Avignon and the Venaissin, but also the legations of Bologna, Ferrara, and the
                    Romagna—an extent of territory representing fully a third of the papal
                    dominions; while at the same time a heavy pecuniary contribution was levied.
                    Shortly after the peace of Tolentino (February 1797) Pius was seized with an
                    illness which seemed likely, at his advanced time Of life, to prove fatal; and
                    Napoleon, in anticipation of his death, gave instructions that no successor to
                    the office should be elected, and that the papal government should be abolished.
                    The sequel, however, having disappointed these expectations, the French
                    ambassador in Rome proceeded through his agents to foment an insurrection—a
                    design for which the demoralized condition of the capital afforded unusual
                    facilities. The outbreak that ensued was immediately made the pretext for
                    abolishing the existing rule, and in its place the Roman republic was proclaimed
                    (15th February 1798). Neither his estimable character nor his advanced years
                    served to shield the dethroned pontiff from wanton cruelty and indignities. He
                    was treated as virtually a prisoner, his private property confiscated, and at
                    last, after having been removed from one place of confinement to another, he
                    expired at Valence, in August 1799, at the age of eighty-two.</p>
                <p>It was under the protection of a schismatic power,— that of the emperor of
                    Russia,—that, after a lapse of eight . months, Pius VII. (1800-23) was elected
                    pope at Venice. To ordinary observers the condition of the papacy at this time
                    seemed almost hopeless; and the skill with which those who guided its policy
                    converted the very theories and events of the Revolution itself into a ladder
                    whereby to regain the ancient vantage-ground is in its way not less remarkable
                    than that contemporary career of military genius which was before long destined
                    to so sudden an eclipse. Latin Christendom, observes Bunsen, seems throughout
                    its history to have been ever vacillating between two extremes —that of the
                    grossest superstition and that of the profoundest scepticism, of bigotry and of
                    atheism. It can scarcely, indeed, be doubted that the tolerance and
                    indifference, the results of contempt with respect to all religious questions,
                    which followed upon the Revolution largely favoured the réintroduction of Roman
                    doctrine. By the curia itself the experiences of the past were interpreted in a
                    manner eminently favourable to its own pretensions; the altar, it was asserted,
                    was ever the surest support of the throne, and the spiritual authority claimed
                    by the supreme pontiff afforded the best security for the maintenance of really
                    free institutions. Pius VIL, who as Cardinal Chiaramonte had at one time
                    affected to approve of democratic principles, succeeded in gaining the good will
                    of Bonaparte, and his accession was shortly followed by the concordat of 1801.
                    The First Consul had already astonished the world by the startling change of
                    opinion to which he gave expression in the Declaration of Milan, to the effect
                    that “society without religion is like a ship without a compass”; and, having
                    now resolved on the restoration of a monarchical form of government, he effected
                    an apparent reconciliation with the Roman pontiff in order to strengthen his own
                    hands. Catholicism was re-established as the state religion of France; but the
                    confiscated property of the church was not restored, while the pretended
                    réintroduction of the papal authority was deprived of all real validity by
                    appending to the concordat certain “articles organiques” which effectually
                    debarred the pontiff from the exercise of any real jurisdiction within the
                    realm. In the concordat made with the Italian republic in 1803 the canon law was
                    revived as the code whereby all questions not provided for in new articles were
                    to be decided. Notwithstanding that he warmly resented the manner in which he
                    had been duped, Pius was ultimately prevailed upon by the consummate address of
                    Talleyrand to crown Napoleon as emperor in Paris. The immediate result of this
                    imprudent act, as regarded the popedom, was the assertion of imperial rights in
                    Rome itself on the part of the new emperor, and a demand that the pontiff should
                    henceforth make common cause with him against the enemies of France. On his
                    refusal Pius was made a prisoner, and the temporal sovereignty of the Roman see
                    declared to be at an end. At Fontainebleau, in 1813, a new concordat was wrung
                    from the infirm and aged pontiff (whose position and treatment strongly recalled
                    those of his predecessor), and he was compelled to surrender almost the last
                    remnants of his authority in France and to disown all claim to rank as a
                    temporal ruler. Pius VII. survived, however, not only to witness the overthrow
                    of his oppressor, but to regain with the Restoration both his spiritual and
                    temporal prerogatives; and it was a notable feature in the proceedings that his
                    resumption of the traditional pontifical rights in connexion with the legations
                    was effected, in opposition to the wishes of Austria, with the support of
                    England. He regained his chair, indeed, amid the best wishes of the Protestant
                    powers,—a sympathy which, had he chosen to throw his influence into the scale
                    that favoured advancement and reform, he might have retained unimpaired to the
                    close of his pontificate. His policy, however, was thenceforth altogether
                    reactionary. On the one hand he suppressed the circulation of the Scriptures in
                    the vernacular; on the other, by a bull of 7th August 1814, he recalled the
                    Jesuits, who since their dispersion in Latin Christendom had transferred the
                    scene of their labours to Prussia and Russia. In other respects Pius’s
                    administration of his office was exemplary, and the same may be said of that of
                    his successors, <hi rend="smallcaps">Leo</hi> XII. (1823-29), Pius <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n528/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0528-0509"/> VIII. (1829-30), and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gregory</hi> XVI (1831-46). The adversities arising out of the Revolution had
                    proved a salutary discipline. Nepotism ceased to disgrace the papal court.
                    Ecclesiasticism itself assumed another tone: its morality was pure; its zeal in
                    the performance of its duties conspicuous. In France there arose a new school,
                    known as the <hi rend="italic">Parti</hi><hi rend="italic">Prêtre,</hi> the
                    school of Chateaubriand, Lamennais, and Montalembert, which rejected the ancient
                    Gallican claims and principles, and everywhere inculcated loyalty and submission
                    to Rome as the first duty of the Catholic. In Germany neither the enlightened
                    and strenuous efforts of Wessenberg nor the statesmanlike policy of Metternich
                    could produce concerted action among the several states, which were accordingly
                    eventually reduced to the necessity of each making separate terms with the curia
                    on an independent basis. The result, in nearly all cases, was that, in
                    reconstructing its ecclesiastical organization, and endeavouring at the same
                    time to establish a certain <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vivendi</hi> in its diplomatic relations with</p>
                <p>Rome, each state was compelled to make concessions which largely favoured the
                    re-establishment of ultramontane institutions. The signal failure of Wessenberg,
                    in his administration of the see of Constance, to reintroduce the principles
                    advocated by “Febronius,” may be cited as one of the most notable instances of
                    the defeat of liberal principles. In the Netherlands and in Silesia similar
                    reactionary movements took place. In England, the Catholic Emancipation Act
                    (1829), although conceived in a spirit of conciliation, proved, in the
                    embittered relations then existing with Ireland, of little avail, and in reality
                    only imparted fresh strength to the machinations of the ultramontane party. The
                    main facts in the history of the popedom from this period will be found under
                    the head of Pius IX. (1846-77), pp. 156-8, <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi></p>

                    continued by Raynaldus, 42 vols. fol. (1738-56), represents a laborious but
                    uncritical collection of materials from the earliest times down to the
                    Reformation. The continuation by A. Theiner, embracing the period 1572-85, is of
                    higher value. In a critical investigation of the original sources, the great
                    work of F. Maassen, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Quellen und der Literatur

                    >Christianity</hi> continues to be the fullest and most impartial source of
                    information in English from the 1st to the 15 th century; this may be
                    supplemented by Gregorovius, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der</hi><hi

                    (1859-72), which throws considerable light on the political and social relations
                    of the city and the papal States; and also by Thomas Greenwood, <hi

                    rend="italic">Patriarchate,</hi> 6 vols. (1856-65). This latter work, although
                    published subsequently to the first edition of Milman, was written before it,
                    and, according to the author, without reference to its pages; it deserves the
                    praise of being, at least in the earlier volumes, a piece of learned and
                    laborious research on the part of a layman of considerable acquirements and
                    candid disposition. In a comparison of the views and treatment of the two
                    foregoing works, Win. von Giesebrecht’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der
                    deutschen Kaiserzeit,</hi> 5 vols, (5th ed. now publishing), will be found
                    useful. <hi rend="italic">A History of the Papacy during</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >the Period</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Reformation,</hi> by Canon Creighton
                    (only partly published), promises to furnish a valuable account of this period,
                    derived from the original sources. From the Reformation, Leopold von Ranke, <hi

                    1878), is the classic work. A translation of the first edition into English by
                    Sarah Austin appeared in 1840, and has been frequently reprinted. H. GefΓcken,
                    <hi rend="italic">Church and State,</hi> translated by E. F. Taylor, 2 vols.
                    (1877), supplies additional illustration, more especially of the relations in
                    Germany. Nippold, <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der</hi><hi rend="italic">neuesten
                    Kirchengeschichte,</hi> 2 vols. (1880-83), traces the subject from the
                    Reformation to the present time. The difficulties attaching to the first
                    commencement, the earlier chronology, and the episcopal succession are
                    elaborately treated by R. A. Lipsius, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi

                    >Antiquities of the Christian Church</hi> (1st ed,, 1708— 22) gives the

                    Bulls of Innocent IV. and Benedict XI. have recently been edited from the

                    christlichen</hi><hi rend="italic">Confessionen</hi> (14th ed., 1871), of which
                    the first edition appeared in 1822, illustrates the departure from the older
                    ecclesiastical code which took its rise in the anti-Febronian movement. The
                    abuses that arose out of the papal nepotism are depicted by Gregorio Leti (a
                    convert from Romanism in the 17 th century) in a well-known volume,— <hi

                    of the pontiffs and the associations they recall are admirably described by
                    Gregorovius in a little volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
