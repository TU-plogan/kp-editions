                    horseback,” is of Eastern origin, and seems to have been a favourite pastime in
                    Persia, Tartary, and the frontiers of India from prehistoric times. Every
                    district has a different name for the game, and the rules under which it is
                    played, although substantially identical, vary considerably on minor points.
                    Thus in Little Tibet, Ladakh, and the adjacent districts the ground used is in
                    the form of a parallelogram some hundred yards long with a goal at each end
                    about 50 feet wide. Amongst the Manipuris, a semi-independent tribe on the
                    north-east frontier of India, by whom the game is known as “kunjai,” the ground
                    is about 120 yards by 50 yards and the whole of each end forms a goal. In other
                    places the goals are about 400 yards apart, and the ground is 120 yards wide at
                    each end, increasing in width towards the centre.</p>
                <p>In some of the early matches in the United Kingdom the ground was about 400 yards
                    long and 200 yards wide, the width of the goal being from 30 to 35 yards. Under
                    the present rules of the Hurlingham Club, which is now <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n419/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0419-0404"/> the principal authority on the game, it is
                    provided that the goals shall be “not less than 250 yards apart and that each
                    goal shall be 8 yards wide.” The English name of the game is perhaps derived
                    from “pulu,” which is the Tibetan for a ball, and the pastime itself reached
                    India from Persia through Afghanistan. It speedily gained favour with the
                    officers of British cavalry regiments quartered in India, and was introduced
                    into the United Kingdom in 1871 by the 10th Hussars. As far as can be
                    ascertained the first match played on English soil took place at Aidershot in
                    the spring of that year. This, however, is not absolutely certain, as no records
                    seem to have been preserved of the early contests.</p>
                <p>Under the rules of the game as now played the opposing parties may consist of
                    from three to six players a side, the number in all matches for cups or prizes
                    being limited to four. Each of the players is mounted on a pony which must not
                    exceed fourteen hands and which must be free from any vice. As the description
                    of the game as “hockey on horseback” would imply, the object of the pastime is
                    to force a ball by means of a stick, with which each player is furnished,
                    through the goal of the opposing side. The size of the ball is 3 inches in
                    diameter, and the sticks are 4 feet long with a cross piece at one end for the
                    purpose of striking the ball. At the commencement of a game each side takes up
                    its position behind the goal posts. A player on each side is appointed as
                    goal-keeper. On a flag being dropped to notify the commencement of the game, the
                    other players gallop towards the centre of the ground at full speed, their
                    object being to reach the ball first and drive it in the direction of the
                    opposite goal. When a ball is hit out of bounds it is thrown into play again by
                    one of the umpires, of whom there is one appointed for each side before the
                    commencement of a match. When a ball is hit beyond the goal without passing
                    through it the side defending goal is entitled to a “hit off,” which must be
                    made from the goal line. It is allowable in the course of play to impede an
                    adversary and hinder his stroke by hooking his stick, but this must not be done
                    either under or over his pony. Whilst it is permissible for a player to
                    interpose his pony before his antagonist so as to prevent the latter reaching
                    the ball, it is expressly forbidden to cross another player in possession of the
                    ball except at such a distance as to avoid all possibility of collision. Should
                    a player break his stick or have it broken he must ride to the appointed place
                    where the sticks are kept and take one, and on no account is one to be brought
                    to him. If he drops his stick he must dismount and pick it up, and is not
                    allowed to hit the ball whilst dismounted. If a player is in front of a player
                    of his own side who hits the ball, and has not two—or in case of matches of four
                    a side, one—of the opposing side between him and the hostile goal, and has not
                    come through the “bully,” he is “off side.” He does not then come “on his side”
                    until the ball has been hit or hit at by the opposing side, or until the player
                    on his own side who made the hit passes him. As long as he is “off side” he may
                    not in any way impede a player of the opposite side. In all matches the duration
                    of play is 1 hour 10 minutes, with an interval of 5 minutes after each 20
                    minutes play.</p>
                <p>Owing to the expense of maintaining a specially trained stud of ponies and a
                    prepared ground for the pastime, the pursuit of the game of polo has always been
                    confined to the wealthier classes in England. Its chief supporters are the
                    younger members of the aristocracy and the officers of British cavalry
                    regiments.</p>
