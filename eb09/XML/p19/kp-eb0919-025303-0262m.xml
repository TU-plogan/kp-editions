                <p>and S., Bessarabia on the S.W., and Galicia (Austria) on the W., from which last
                    it is separated by the Zbrutch, or Rodvotcha, a tributary of the Dniester. It
                    has an area of 16,223 square miles, extending for 200 miles from northwest to
                    south-east on the left bank of the Dniester. In the same direction two ranges of
                    hills, nearly parallel, and separated by the Bug, traverse the government; they
                    are ramifications of the so-called “Avratynsk heights.” One of these ranges runs
                    parallel to the Dniester at a distance of some 40 miles, and reaches a maximum
                    elevation of 1185 feet in the northern districts, sending a lateral branch to
                    the Dniester at Kamenets. The other range, entering also from the north-west,
                    follows the boundaries of the government of Kieff on the left bank of the Bug;
                    its highest eminences do not exceed 1050 feet. The geological structure of
                    Podolia is in accordance with the above-mentioned orographical features; a strip
                    of land to the east of the Bug belongs to the Huronian granitic region of the
                    Dnieper, granites and aplites (granulites) appearing also in the bed of the Bug,
                    and being covered with Quaternary deposits only, while the remainder of the
                    province, towards the west, is covered with Tertiary (Miocene). In the deep
                    valleys of the rivers, older formations—the Cretaceous and Silurian, as also
                    sometimes the granites—appear from beneath the Tertiary. The whole is covered
                    with a boulder-clay, mostly containing débris of the local rocks, and with
                    loess, the origin of both still being a subject of controversy among Russian
                    geologists. Two large rivers, with numerous tributaries, water the
                    government,—the Dniester, which forms its boundary with Bessarabia and is
                    navigable throughout its length, and the Bug, which flows almost parallel to the
                    former in a higher, sometimes swampy valley, and is broken at several places by
                    strong rapids. The Dniester is an important channel for trade, no less than
                    30,000 tons of corn, spirits, and timber being exported every year from its
                    eighteen ports, the chief of which are Moghilefl, Kalus, Zhvanets, and Porog.
                    The rapid smaller tributaries of the Dniester supply numerous flour-mills with
                    motive power. The soil is almost throughout “black-earth,” and Podolia is one of
                    the most fertile provinces of Russia. Forests cover about 245,000 acres. Marshes
                    occur only on the Bug. The climate is moderate, the average temperature of the
                    year at Kamenets being 48 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 3 (24 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 5 in January, 69° in July).</p>
                <p>The population, which was 2,242,650 in 1881, and is now estimated at 2,335,000,
                    consists chiefly of Little Russians, Poles (about 12 per cent.), and Jews (about
                    13 per cent.), of whom some 9000 are agriculturists. There are besides about 300
                    Armenians, some 2500 Germans, and nearly 45,000 Moldavians. There are many
                    Nonconformists among the Russians, Tultchin being the seat of their bishops and
                    a centre of propaganda. The chief occupation is agriculture, 56 per cent, of the
                    surface being under crops, and the average harvests of recent years reaching
                    3,382,000 qrs. of corn and 453,000 qrs. of potatoes. The chief crops are wheat,
                    Indian corn, oats, rye, potatoes, and beetroot. No less than 2,500,000 qrs. of
                    corn are exported every year to Austria or to Odessa. Gardening is in a
                    flourishing condition, and fruit is largely exported to the interior; the vine
                    is cultivated, mostly for grapes, but partly also for wine; the culture of
                    tobacco is a considerable source of income. Cattle-breeding is less developed,
                    owing to a want of grazing grounds and meadows. Horned cattle—a mixture of the
                    Hungarian and Bessarabian breeds—are, however, exported to Moscow and to
                    Austria. Finer breeds of sheep are raised in the proportion of two-fifths of the
                    whole number. In 1881 Podolia bad 169,000 horses, 432,000 horned cattle, 513,000
                    sheep, and 307,000 swine. Bees are kept throughout the territory, and honey is
                    exported. Sericulture has developed considerably of late years, and will
                    probably take an important position, owing to the climate. Agriculture and
                    cattle-breeding are on the whole declining. Lately manufactures have grown
                    rapidly. In 1865 they already employed 14,450 hands, but produced only to the
                    value of 5,334,000 roubles. Fourteen years later they employed more than 20,000
                    hands, and their yearly production was valued at 29,411,Q00 roubles. The first
                    place is taken by beetroot sugar works (15,800 hands; £1,038,000), after which
                    come distilleries (£1,872,000), sugar refineries (£287,100), flour-mills
                    (£134,500), tobacco manufacture (£32,200), the woollen cloth industry, and
                    several smaller manufactures (spirits, leather, soap, candles, machinery, and
                    agricultural implements). An active trade is carried on with Austria, especially
                    through the Isakovets and Gusyatin custom-houses,—com, cattle, horses, skins,
                    wool, linseed, and hemp seed being exported, in exchange for wooden wares,
                    linen, woollen stuffs, cotton, glass, and agricultural implements. The trade
                    with the interior is also carried on very briskly, especially at the twenty-six.
                    fairs, the aggregate returns of which exceed 3,000,000 roubles; the chief are at
                    Balta and Yarmolintsy. Podolia is traversed by a railway which runs parallel to
                    the Dniester, from Lemberg to Odessa, and has two branch lines to Kieff (from
                    Zhmerinka) and to Poltava (from Balta). Primary schools are better than in many
                    central provinces of Russia, and Kamenets-Podolsk has of late years begun to
                    show some development of intellectual life. The publications of the provincial
                    assembly and the memoirs of the historical and statistical committee of the
                    government are especially worthy of notice. Podolia is divided into twelve
                    districts, the chief towns of which are— Kamenets-Podolsk, capital of the
                    government (22,650), Balta (22,450), Bratslaff (5550), Gaysin (9450), Letitcheff
                    (4800), Litin (7100), Moghilefl&gt;on-Dniester (18,150), Novaya Ushitsa (4500),
                    Olgopol (6950), Proskuroff (11,750), Vinnitsa (18,800), and Yampol (4300). The
                    following tθλvns have municipal institutions:—Bar (7800), Khmelnik (7800),
                    Nemiroff (5450, has a lyceum), Salnitsa (3300), Staraya Ushitsa (3700),
                    Verbovets (2150), and Tultchin (11,220), besides many <hi rend="italic"
                    >mycstetcKki,</hi> having Polish municipal institutions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The country has been inhabited since the
                    beginning of the Neolithic period. In the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> it was already known to geographers, and Herodotus mentions it as the
                    seat of the Alazones and Neuri, who were followed by the Dacians and Getae. The
                    Romans left traces of their rule in the Wall of Trajan, which stretches through
                    the modern districts of Kamenets, Ushitsa, and Proskuroff. Many nationalities
                    passed through this territory, or settled within it for some time, during the
                    great migrations, leaving traces in numerous archaeological remains. The annals
                    of Nestor mention that the Slavonians, Bujanes, and Dulebes occupied the Bug,
                    while the Tivertsi and Uglitches were settled ou the Dniester. They were
                    conquered by the Avars in the 7th century. Oleg extended his rule over this
                    territory—the <hi rend="italic">Ponizie,</hi> or lowland, which became later a
                    part of the principalities of Volhynia, Kieff, and Galicia. In the 13th century
                    the Ponizie was plundered by the Mongols; a hundred years afterwards Olgerd
                    freed it from this rule, annexing it to Lithuania under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Podolia,</hi> a word which has the same meaning as Ponizie. After
                    the death of Witowt Podolia was annexed to Poland, with the exception of its
                    eastern part—the province of Bratslaff—which remained under Lithuania until its
                    union with Poland. The Poles retained Podolia until the third division of Poland
                    in 1793, when it was taken by Russia, which instituted the present government of
                    Podolia in 1796.</p>
