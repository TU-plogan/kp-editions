                <p><label type="entry">PISTACHIO NUT</label>, see Nuτ, vol. xvii. p. 665. The
                    pistachio nut is the species named in Gen. xliii. 11 (Heb.</p>
                <p>Ar. <hi rend="italic">botm)</hi> as forming part of the present which Joseph’s
                    brethren took with them from Canaan, and in Egypt it is still often placed along
                    with sweetmeats and the like in presents of courtesy. The nut is used in various
                    ways; but the simplest plan is to boil it with salt. PISTOIA, or <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Pistoja,</hi> a well-walled ancient city, 21 miles
                    north-west of Florence, on a slight eminence near the Ombrone, one of the
                    tributaries of the Arno; it now contains about 12,500 inhabitants. The chief
                    manufacture of the place is iron-working, especially fire-arms.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The word “pistol” is
                            derived (apparently through <hi rend="italic">pistolese,</hi> a
                            dagger,—dagger and pistol being both small arms) from Pistoia, where
                            that weapon was largely manufactured in the Middle Ages.</p></note> It
                    is on the site of the Roman <hi rend="italic">Pistoria,</hi> of which little
                    trace remains. During the Middle Ages Pistoia was at times a dangerous enemy to
                    Florence, and the scene of constant conflicts between the Guelfs and the
                    Ghibellines: it was there that, in the year 1300, the great party struggle took
                    place which resulted in the creation of the Bianchi and Neri factions (see
                    Dante, <hi rend="italic">Infer.,</hi> xxiv., 1. 121 to end). In the early
                    development of architecture and sculpture Pistoia played a very important part;
                    these arts, as they existed in Tuscany before the time of Niccola Pisano, can
                    perhaps be better studied in Pistoia than anywhere else; nor is the city less
                    rich in the later works produced by the school of sculptors founded by Niccola.
                    In the 14th century Pistoia possessed a number of the most skilful artists in
                    silver work, a wonderful specimen of whose powers exists now in the cathedral,—
                    the great silver altar and frontal of St James, originally made for the high
                    altar, but now placed in a chapel on the south side (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Metal Work,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 65, fig. 4). The cathedral is partly of the
                    12th century, but rebuilt by one of the Pisani, and inside sadly modernized in
                    the worst <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n141/mode/1up"

                    many fine works of sculpture; the chief are the monument of Cino da Pistoia,
                    lawyer and poet, Dante’s contemporary (1337), and Verrocchio’s finest work in
                    marble, the monument to Cardinal Forteguerra (1474), with a large figure of
                    Christ, surrounded by angels, in high relief. Unhappily two of the principal
                    figures were destroyed not many years ago, and replaced by worthless modern
                        ones.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>One of the

                    early churches the principal is Sant’ Andrea, enriched with sculpture, and
                    probably designed, by Gruamons and his brother Adeodatus, in 1136; in the nave
                    is Giovanni Pisano’s magnificent pulpit, imitated from his father’s pulpit at
                    Pisa. Other churches of almost equal interest are S. Giovanni Evangelista, also
                    with sculpture by Gruamons, about 1160, and S. Bartolomeo in Pantano by the
                    architect Rudolfinus, 1167. S. Piero Maggiore and San Paolo are also churches
                    begun in the 12 th century. San Francesco al Prato is a fine church of the
                    school of Niccola Pisano, end of the 13th century. San Domenico, a noble church
                    built about 1380, contains the beautiful tomb of Filippo Lazari by Bernardo di
                    Matteo, 1464. In addition to its fine churches, of which the above is a very
                    incomplete list, Pistoia contains many noble palaces and public buildings. The
                    Palazzo del Commune and the Palazzo Pretorio, once the residence of the podestà,
                    are both fine specimens of 14th-century domestic architecture, in very good
                    preservation. The Ospedale del Ceppo, built originally in the 13th century, but
                    remodelled in the 15th, is very remarkable for the reliefs in enamelled and
                    coloured terra-cotta with which its exterior is richly decorated. Besides
                    various medallions, there is a frieze of figures in high relief extending along
                    the whole front, over its open arcade. The reliefs consist of a series of groups
                    representing the Seven Works of Mercy and other figures; these were executed by
                    the younger members of the Della Robbia family between 1525 and 1535, and,
                    though not equal to the best work of Luca and Andrea, are yet very fine in
                    conception and modelling, and extremely rich in their general decorative
                    effect.</p>
