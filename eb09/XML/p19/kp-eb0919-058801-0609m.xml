                    very widely diffused throughout nature; but only potassium is at all abundant,
                    and therefore we begin with it. The richest natural store is in the ocean,
                    which, according to Boguslawski’s calculation (in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Océanographie}</hi> of its total volume and the present writer’s analysis of
                    sea water, contains potassium equal to 1141 times 10 <hi rend="superscript">

                    the “salt-gardens” on the coast of F rance have lost their industrial importance
                    as potash-producers, if not otherwise, since the rich deposits at Stassfurt in
                    Germany have come to be so largely worked. These deposits, in addition to common
                    salt, include the following minerals:—sylvine, KC1; carnallite, KCl.MgCl <hi

                    of this article. The potassium minerals named are not confined to Stassfurt; far
                    larger quantities of sylvine and kainite are met with in the salt-mines of
                    Kalusz in the eastern Carpathian Mountains, but they have not yet come to be
                    worked so extensively. The Stassfurt potassiferous minerals owe their industrial
                    importance to their solubility in water and consequent ready amenability to
                    chemical operations. In point of absolute mass they are insignificant compared
                    with the abundance and variety of potassiferous silicates, which occur
                    everywhere in the earth’s crust; orthoclase (potash felspar) and potash mica may
                    be quoted as prominent examples. Such potassiferous silicates are found in
                    almost all rocks, if not as normal at least as subsidiary components; and their
                    disintegration furnishes, directly or indirectly, the soluble potassium salts
                    which are found in all fertile soils. These salts are sucked up by the roots of
                    plants, and by taking part in the process of nutrition are partly converted into
                    oxalate, tartrate, and other organic salts, which, when the plants are burned,
                    assume the form of carbonate, K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. It is a remarkable fact that, although in a given soil
                    the soda may predominate largely over the potash salts, the plants growing in
                    the soil take up the latter by preference: in the ashes of most land plants the
                    potash (calculated as K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O) forms upwards of 90 per
                    cent, of the total alkali (K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O or Na <hi

                    other countries, where wood is used as the general fuel. In some places—for
                    instance, in certain districts of Hungary— wood is burned expressly for the
                    purpose; as a rule, however, the ashes produced in households form the raw
                    material. The ashes are lixiviated with water, which dissolves all the carbonate
                    of potash along with more or less of chloride, sulphate, and a little silicate,

                    for the making of soft soap. For many other purposes it is too impure and must
                    be refined, which is done by treating the crude product with the minimum of cold
                    water required to dissolve the carbonate, removing the undissolved part (which
                    consists chiefly of sulphate), and evaporating the clear liquor to dryness in an
                    iron pan. The purified carbonate (which still contains most of the chloride of
                    the raw material and other impurities) is known as “pearl ashes.”</p>

                    indirectly from beetroot molasses. The liquors are evaporated to dryness and the
                    residue is ignited to obtain a very impure carbonate, which is purified by
                    methods founded on the different solubilities of the several components. Such
                    potashes, however, is exceptionally rich in soda: Grandeau found in crude ashes
                    from 16 to 21 per cent, of potash and from 23 to 50 of soda carbonate. This
                    industry would have expired by this time were it not that the beetroot spirit
                    residues are worked for trimethylamine (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Methyl,</hi>
                    vol. xvi. p. 196), and the carbonate thus obtained incidentally. Most of the
                    carbonate of potash which now occurs in commerce is made from Stassfurt chloride
                    by means of an adaptation of the “Leblanc process” for the conversion of common
                    salt into soda ash (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sodium).</hi></p>
                <p>Chemically pure carbonate of potash is best prepared by the ignition of pure
                    bicarbonate (see below) in iron or (better) in silver or platinum vessels, or
                    else by the calcination of pure bitartrate (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tartaric

                    with charcoal, from which the carbonate is extracted by lixiviation with water
                    and filtration. The filtrate is evaporated to dryness (in iron or platinum) and
                    the residue fully dehydrated by gentle ignition. The salt is thus obtained as a
                    white porous mass, fusible at a red heat (838° C., Carnelley) into a colourless
                    liquid, which freezes into a white opaque mass. The dry salt is very
                    hygroscopic; it deliquesces into an oily solution (“oleum tartari ”) in ordinary

                <p>parts. Carbonate of potash, being insoluble in strong alcohol (and many other
                    liquid organic compounds), is much used for the dehydration of the corresponding
                    aqueous preparations. From its very concentrated solution in hot water the salt
                    crystallizes on cooling with a certain proportion of water; but these crystals
                    are little known even to chemists. Pure carbonate of potash is being constantly
                    used in the laboratory, as a basic substance generally, for the disintegration
                    of silicates, and as a precipitant. The industrial preparation serves for the
                    making of flint-glass, of potash soap (soft soap), and of caustic potash. It is
                    also used in medicine, where its old name of “sal tartari” is not yet quite
                    obsolete.</p>

                    carbonic acid is passed through a cold solution of the ordinary carbonate as
                    long as it is absorbed. If silicate is present, it likewise is converted into
                    bicarbonate with elimination of silica, which must be filtered off. The filtrate
                    is evaporated at a temperature not exceeding 60° or at most 70° C.; after
                    sufficient concentration it deposits on cooling anhydrous crystals of the salt,
                    while the chloride of potassium, which may be present as -an impurity, remains
                    mostly in the mother-liquor; the rest is easily removed by repeated
                    recrystallization. If an absolutely pure preparation is wanted, it is best to
                    follow Wöhler and start with the “black flux” produced by the ignition of pure
                    bitartrate. The flux is moistened with water and exposed to a current of
                    carbonic acid, which, on account of the condensing action of the charcoal, is
                    absorbed with great avidity. The rest explains itself. Bicarbonate of potash

                <p><hi rend="italic">Caustic Potash (Hydrate of Potassium),</hi> KH0.-It has been
                    known for a long time that a solution of carbonate of potash becomes more
                    intensely alkaline, acts more strongly on the epidermis, and dissolves fats more
                    promptly after it has been treated with slaked lime. It used to be supposed that
                    the latent fire in the quick-lime went into the “mild” alkali and made it
                    “caustic,” until Black, about the middle of last century, showed that the
                    chemical difference between the two preparations is that the mild is a compound
                    of carbonic acid and the caustic one of water with the same base (potash),—the
                    causticizing action of the lime consisting in this, that it withdraws the
                    carbonic acid from the alkali and substitutes its own water. Add to this that
                    the exchange takes place only in the presence of a sufficient proportion of
                    water, and that it is undone if the mixture is allowed to get concentrated by
                    evaporation beyond a certain (uncertain) point, and you have a full theory of
                    the process. A good concentration is twelve parts of water for one of carbonate
                    of potash; the lime is best employed in the shape of a semi-fluid paste, made by
                    slaking quick-lime with three parts of water poured on at a time. The alkali
                    solution is heated to boiling in a cast-iron vessel (industrially by means of
                    steam-pipes) and the lime paste added in instalments until a sample of the
                    filtered mixture no longer effervesces on addition of an excess of acid. The
                    mixture is then allowed to settle in the iron vessel, access of air being
                    prevented as much as practicable, and the clear liquor is drawn off by means of
                    a syphon. The remaining mud of carbonate and hydrate of lime is washed, by
                    decantation, with small instalments of hot water to recover at least part of the
                    alkali diffused throughout it, but this process must not be continued too long
                    or else some of the lime passes into solution. The united liquors are boiled
                    down in an iron vessel until the desired degree of concentration is reached. In
                    obedience to an old tradition, the concentration is habitually continued until
                    the specific gravity of the cold ley is 1*333, which is a rather inconveniently
                    high degree of strength for most purposes, but in the case of the ordinary
                    commercial article offers this advantage, that any sulphate of potash which may
                    be present as an impurity crystallizes out completely on standing (Liebig). If
                    solid caustic potash is wanted, the ley (after removal of the deposit of
                    sulphate, &lt;fcc.) is transferred to a <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> dish, and
                    the evaporation continued until, instead of steam, the heavy vapour of KHO
                    itself is seen to go off. The residual oily liquid is then poured out into <pb

                    produce the customary form of “sticks,” and allowed to cool. The solidified
                    preparation must be at once bottled up, because it attracts the moisture and
                    carbonic acid of the air with great avidity and deliquesces. According to the
                    present writer’s experience <hi rend="italic">(Joum. Soc. Chenι. Ind.,</hi> May
                    1884), nickel basins are far better adapted than iron basins for the
                    concentration of potash ley. The latter begin to oxidize before the ley has come
                    up to the traditional strength, while nickel is not attacked so long as the
                    percentage of <hi rend="italic">real</hi> KHO is short of 60. For the fusion of
                    the dry hydrate nickel vessels cannot be used; in fact, even silver is
                    perceptibly attacked as soon as <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the excess of water
                    is aw^y; absolutely pure KHO can be produced only in <hi rend="italic">gold</hi>
                    vessels. Regarding the action of potash on platinum, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Platinum</hi><hi rend="italic">{supra,</hi> p. 191). Glass and (to a less
                    extent) porcelain are attacked by caustic potash ley, slowly in the cold, more
                    readily on boiling.</p>
                <p>Frozen caustic potash forms an opaque, white, stone-like mass of dense granular
                    fracture; specific gravity = 24. It fuses considerably below and is perceptibly
                    volatile at a red heat. It is extremely soluble in even cold water, and in any
                    proportion of water on boiling. The solution is intensely “alkaline” to
                    test-papers. It readily dissolves the epidermis of the skin and many other kinds
                    of animal tissue,—hence the well-known application of the “sticks” in surgery. A
                    dilute potash ley readily emulsionizes fats, and on boiling “saponifies” them
                    with formation of a soap and of glycerin. Caustic potash is the very type of an
                    energetic (mono-acid) basic hydrate (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry,</hi>
                    vol. V. pp. 486, 488).</p>
                <p>According to Tiinnermann’s and Schiffs determinations, as calculated by Gerlach,
                    the relation in pure potash ley between specific gravity at 15° C. and
                    percentage strength is as follows :—</p>

                <p>All commercial caustic potash is contaminated with excess of water (over and
                    above that in the KHO) and with carbonate and chloride of potassium; sulphate,
                    as a rule, is absent. Absolutely pure potash has perhaps never been seen; a
                    preparation sufficing for most purposes of the analyst is obtained by digesting
                    the commercial article in strong (85 per cent, by weight) <hi rend="italic"
                    >pure</hi> alcohol. The hydrate KHO dissolves in the alcohol of the solvent; the
                    chloride and the carbonate unite with the water and form a lower layer or magma,
                    from which the alcoholic solution of the KHO is decanted off, to be evaporated
                    to dryness and fused in silver vessels (“potasse à l’alcool”).</p>
                <p>The metal (potassium) has been known to exist since Lavoisier, but was first
                    obtained as a substance by Humphry Davy in 1807. He prepared it from the hydrate
                    by electrolysis. Gay-Lussac and Thénard subsequently found that this substance
                    can be reduced to the metallic state more easily by passing its vapour over
                    white hot metallic iron; but even their method as a mode of preparation was soon
                    superseded by Brunner’s, who, to the surprise of his contemporaries, produced
                    the metal by simply distilling its carbonate with charcoal—applying an
                    old-established principle of ordinary metallurgy. Brunner’s process is used to
                    the present day for the production of the metal.</p>
                <p>One of those cylindrical, neckless, wrought-iron bottles which serve for the
                    storing of quicksilver is made into a retort by taking out the screw-plug at the
                    centre of one of the round ends and substituting for it a short, ground-in, iron
                    outlet pipe. This retort is charged with a black flux made from a mixture of
                    pure and crude bitartrate so adjusted that the flux contains as nearly as
                    possible the proportion of free carbon demanded by the equation K <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 2C = 2K + 3CO. It is
                    then suspended horizontally within a powerful wind-furnace, constructed for coke
                    as fuel. At first a mixture of coke and charcoal is applied, to produce the
                    right temperature for chasing away the moisture and enabling one to, so to say,
                    varnish over the retort with borax and thus protect it against the subsequent
                    intense heat. After these preliminaries coke alone is used and the fire urged on
                    to, and maintained at, its maximum pitch, when potassium vapour soon begins to
                    make its appearance. The condensation of this vapour, however, demands special
                    methods, because even the cold metal would quickly oxidize in the air ami act
                    most violently on liquid water. Brunner used to condense the vapour by passing
                    it into a small copper vessel charged with rock-oil (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Paraffin,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 237), in which liquid the condensed metal sinks
                    to the bottom and thus escapes the air. Donné and Maresca dispense with rock-oil
                    altogether; they receive the vapour in a dry condenser made of two flat
                    rectangular trays of wrought iron which fit closely upon each other, enclosing a
                    space such as might be used as a mould for casting a thin cake of any ordinary
                    metal. This condenser has a short neck into which the outlet pipe of the retort
                    fits; and the pipe must be as short as possible, because it is essential (Donné
                    and Maresca) that the hot vapour pass abruptly from its original high to a low
                    temperature, to evade a certain range of medium temperatures at which the metal
                    combines with carbonic oxide into a black solid, which may obstruct the outlet
                    pipe. The formation of this bye-product cannot be altogether avoided; hence a
                    long borer is inserted into the condenser from the first to enable one to clear
                    the throat of the retort at a moment’s notice. The condenser is kept as far as
                    possible cold by the constant application to it of damp cloths. As soon as the
                    distillation is finished the (still hot) condenser is plunged into a bucketful
                    of rock-oil, to cool it down, the mould opened (under the oil), and the now
                    solid metal taken out. The crude metal is always contaminated with some of the
                    black solid and other mechanical impurities. To remove these the best method is
                    to redistil it from out of a small iron retort and condense the vapour in
                    rock-oil according to Brunner’s original plan. The purified metal is soft enough
                    to be moulded (under rock-oil) into globular pieces, which are preserved in
                    bottles filled to the top with the protecting liquid. But even this does not
                    prevent gradual oxidation; bright metallic potassium can be maintained in this
                    condition only by preserving it in a sealed-up glass tube within a vacuum or in
                    an atmosphere of hydrogen or some other inert gas. The black solid above
                    referred to is a most dangerous substance. When exposed to the air it turns red
                    and then explodes either spontaneously or on the slightest provocation by
                    friction or pressure. Even if kept under rock-oil it gradually becomes
                    explosive. The distillation of potassium, in fact, is a dangerous operation,
                    which had better be left in the hands of specialists.</p>
                <p>Pure potassium is a bluish-white metal; but on exposure to ordinary air it at
                    once draws a film of oxide, and on prolonged exposure deliquesces into a
                    solution of hydrate and carbonate. At temperatures below 0° C. it is pretty hard
                    and brittle; at the ordinary temperature it is so soft that it can be kneaded
                    between the fingers and cut with a blunt knife; specific gravity = 0'865. It
                    fuses at 62° '5 C. (Bunsen), and at 720° to 730° C. (Carnelley and Williams),
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> considerably below its boiling point, begins to
                    distil with formation of an intensely green vapour. When heated in air it fuses
                    and then takes fire and burns into a mixture of oxides. Most remarkable, and
                    characteristic for the group it represents, is its action on water. A pellet of
                    potassium when thrown on water at once bursts out into a violet flame and the
                    burning metal fizzes about on the surface, its extremely high temperature
                    precluding absolute contact with the liquid, except at the very end, when the
                    last remnant, through loss of temperature, is wetted by the water and bursts
                    with explosive violence. What really goes on chemically is that the metal
                    decomposes the water thus, K + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = KHO + H, and
                    that the hydrogen catches fire, the violet colour of the flame being due to the
                    potassium vapour diffused throughout it. Similar to that on water is its action
                    on alcohol: the alcohol is converted into ethylate, while hydrogen escapes, K +
                    C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. OH = C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. OK + H, this time
                    without inflammation. So strong is the basilous character of the element that,
                    in opposition to it, even ammonia behaves like an <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0612-0591"/> acid. When the oxide-free metal is heated gently
                    within the dry gas it is gradually transformed into a blue liquid, which on

                    these are assorted into a raw material containing approximately in 100
                    parts—55-65 of carnallite (representing 16 parts of chloride of potassium);
                    20-25 of common salt; 15-20 of kieserite, a peculiar, very slowly soluble

                    components. This mixture is now wrought mainly in two ways. (1) The salt is
                    dissolved in water with the help of steam, and the solution is cooled down to
                    from 60° to 70°, when a quantity of impure common salt crystallizes out, which
                    is removed. The decanted ley deposits on cooling and standing a 70 per cent
                    muriate of potash, which is purified, if desired, by washing it by displacement
                    with cold water. Common salt principally goes into solution, and the percentage
                    may thus be brought up to from 80 to 95. The mother-liquor from the 70 per cent,
                    muriate is evaporated down further, the common salt which separates out in the
                    heat removed as it appears, and the sufficiently concentrated liquor allowed to
                    crystallize, when almost pure carnallite separates out, which is easily
                    decomposed into its components (see <hi rend="italic">infra).</hi> (2) Ziervogel
                    and Tuchen’s method. The crude salt is ground up and then heated in concentrated
                    solution of chloride of magnesium with mechanical agitation. The carnallite
                    principally dissolves and crystallizes out relatively pure on cooling. The
                    mother-liquor is used for a subsequent extraction of fresh raw salt. The
                    carnallite produced is dissolved in hot water and the solution allowed to cool,
                    when it deposits a coarse granular muriate of potash containing up to 99 per
                    cent, of the pure substance. The undissolved residue produced in either process
                    consists chiefly of kieserite and common salt. It is worked up either for Epsom
                    salt and common salt, or for sulphate of soda and chloride of magnesium. The

                    (and oxygen). The salt accordingly, in opposition to any combustible matter with
                    which it may be mixed, behaves at the same time as a store of highly-condensed
                    loosely-combined oxygen and of potential heat. Hence its manifold applications
                    in artillery and pyrotechnics are easily understood. To give one example of the
                    readiness with which it acts as a burning agent: a mixture of it and sulphur
                    when struck with a hammer explodes loudly, the mechanical blow sufficing to
                    produce locally the temperature necessary for starting the reaction. When the
                    salt was still a novelty it was tried as a substitute for the nitre in
                    gunpowder. Such powder, however, proved too good to be safe. Wore recently a
                    mixture of 49 parts of the chlorate, 23 of sugar, and 28 of prussiate of potash
                    was recommended by Pohl as a preferable substitute for gunpowder, but this
                    powder has never come into actual use anywhere. We must not forget to point out
                    that mixtures of chlorate of potash and combustible substances must on no
                    account be made in a mortar; this would be sure to lead to dangerous explosions.
                    The several ingredients must be powdered separately and only then be mixed
                    together on a sheet of paper or on a table, all unnecessary pressure or friction
                    being carefully avoided.</p>
                <p>The decomposition of chlorate of potash by heat is greatly facilitated by

                    of binoxide of manganese, for instance, comes off below the fusing point of the
                    salt. Hence a salt contaminated with even a small proportion of heavy metallic
                    chlorate cannot (in general) be fused without decomposition. The writer observed
                    this anomaly with a commercial chlorate which happened to contain about one half
                    per cent, of chlorate of zinc. The aqueous solution of the salt is neutral and
                    bears prolonged boiling without decomposition. On acidification with dilute

                    black. In the chemical laboratory it is in constant requisition as a source of
                    oxygen and as an oxidizing agent. In the hands of Marignac it served for the

                    3</hi> in solution) enough iodine to produce a permanent yellow colour (the
                    iodine passes at once into 5KI + KIO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>; the hypo body
                    KIO has no existence practically) and to deoxidize the iodate, which is done
                    most conveniently by adding a sufficiency of powdered charcoal to the solution,
                    evaporating to dryness in an iron vessel, and heating the residue. The oxygen
                    goes off as CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> at a lower temperature than that
                    which would be needed for its expulsion as oxygen gas. The residue is dissolved,
                    and the solution filtered and evaporated to crystallization. The salt comes out
                    in colourless transparent cubes, very easily soluble in even cold water. The
                    commercial salt forms opaque milk-white crystals, which, as a matter of habit,
                    are preferred to the clear salt, although they are produced by causing the salt
                    to crystallize from a strongly alkaline solution and by drying the crystals
                    (finally) in a stream of hot air, and although through the former operation they
                    are at least liable to contain carbonate. Iodide of potassium acts far more
                    powerfully on the human system than bromide, and therefore is administered in
                    smaller doses. It is used against skin-diseases, and also for eliminating the
                    mercury which settles in the system after long-continued administration of
                    mercurial medicines. It is also used, far more largely than the bromide, in
                    photography. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Photography,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">—</hi> When Bunsen and Kirchhoff in 1860 applied their method of
                    spectrum analysis to the alkali salts which they had extracted analytically from
                    Dürkheim mineral water, they obtained a spectrum which, in addition to the lines
                    characteristic for sodium, potassium, and lithium, exhibited two blue lines
                    which were foreign to any other spectrum they had ever seen. They accordingly
                    concluded that these lines must be owing to the presence of a new alkali metal,
                    which they called “caesium.” Bunsen at once resumed the preparation of the mixed
                    alkaline salt with 44,000 litres of Dürkheim water, with the view of isolating
                    the caesium in the form of a pure salt; and he was more than successful—for the
                    new alkali salt, after elimination of all the ordinary alkali metals, proved to
                    be a mixture of the salts of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> new alkali metals, which
                    he succeeded in separating from each other. For one he retained the name already
                    chosen; the other he called “rubidium,” on account of the presence in his
                    spectrum of certain characteristic red lines. Since Bunsen’s time these two
                    metals have been discovered in a great many native potassiferous
                    materials—minerals, mineral waters, plant ashes, Ac.—but in all cases they form
                    only a small fraction of the alkali, the caesium in general amounting to only a
                    fraction of even the rubidium. One solitary exception to both rules is afforded
                    by a rare mineral called “pollux,” which is found only on the island of Elba.
                    Plattner analysed this mineral in 1846 and recognized it as a compound silicate
                    of alumina, oxide of iron, soda, potash, and water; but his quantitative
                    analysis came up to only 92 ’ 75 per cent., and he could not account for the 7
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 25 per cent, of loss. After Bunsen’s discovery
                    Pisani analysed the mineral again, and he found that it contained no potash at
                    all, but, instead of it, a large percentage (34Ί) of <hi rend="italic"
                    >caesia.</hi> Recalculating Plattner’s analysis on the assumption that the
                    presumed chloroplatinate of potassium was really chloroplatinate of caesium, he
                    found that the corrected numbers did add up to near 100 and agreed with his own.
                    Rubidium, singularly, is absent from this mineral.</p>
                <p>That both rubidium and caesium are contained in sea water might well be taken for
                    granted; but it is worth while to state that Schmidt of Dorpat actually proved
                    the presence of rubidium, and even determined it quantitatively.</p>
                <p>For the preparation of rubidium compounds one of the best materials is a mixture
                    of alkaline salts, which falls as a bye-product in the industrial preparation of
                    carbonate of lithia from lepidolite. A supply of this salt mixture which Bunsen
                    worked up contained 20 per cent, of chloride of rubidium, 33 of chloride of
                    potassium, and 36 of common salt, but very little caesium; his supply came from
                    the Saxon or Bohemian mineral. The lepidolite of Hebron, Maine, United States,
                    on the other hand, is rich in caesium. Another practically available source for
                    caesium is the motherliquor salt of Nauheim in Germany. It yielded to Böttcher 1
                    per cent, of its weight of the chloroplatinate PtCl <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi>
                    Cs <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Bunsen’s method for the extraction of the two rare potassium metals from a given
                    mixture of alkaline salts is founded upon the different solubility of the
                    several alkaline chloroplatinates. According to him 100 parts of water

                <p>parts of the several salts. The chloroplatinates of sodium and lithium are easily
                    soluble even in cold water, so that chloride of platinum does not precipitate
                    these two metals at all. Hence, supposing we boil a given mixture of
                    chloroplatinates of potassium and (say) rubidium with a quantity of water
                    insufficient to dissolve the whole, part of both salts will dissolve; but the
                    residual chloroplatinate will be richer in rubidium than the dissolved part. And
                    supposing, on the other hand, we add to a mixed solution of the two chlorides a
                    quantity of chloroplatinic-acid solution insufficient to bring down the whole of
                    both metals, the rubidium will accumulate in the precipitate and the potassium
                    in the solution. It is also easily understood that, if the amount of

                    chlorides in strong hydrochloric acid, and adding a solution of terchloride of
                    antimony in the same menstruum; the caesium (chiefly) comes down as SbCl <hi

                    The two rare alkali metals are so closely similar to potassium that it will
                    suffice to give a tabular statement of the principal points of difference. By
                    way of introduction, however, we may state that rubidium metal was prepared by
                    Bunsen from the black flux obtained by igniting the bitartrate, by Brunner’s
                    method for potassium. Metallic caesium, it seems, cannot be thus obtained; but
                    in 1883 Setterberg made it by the electrolysis of a fused mixture of the
                    cyanides of caesium and barium.</p>

                <p>These flame-reactions are very delicate but not conclusive, because in the case
                    of mixtures several colours may be radiated out at the same time, and one may
                    eclipse all the rest—this holds, for instance, for things containing sodium,
                    whose flame-colour is more intense than that of any other metal—or a mixed
                    colour may be produced which the eye is incompetent to analyse. The spectrum
                    apparatus here comes in usefully; and by means of it it is in general possible
                    to see the lines characteristic of the several metals in presence of, or at
                    least after, one another, because as a rule the several metals are present as
                    compounds of different volatility.</p>
                <p>For a thorough analysis it is necessary to begin by bringing the substance into
                    aqueous or acid solution, and next to eliminate all that is <hi rend="italic"
                    >not</hi> alkali metal by suitable methods. A certain set of heavy metals can be
                    precipitated as sulphides by means of sulphuretted hydrogen in the presence of
                    acid, all the rest of these by means of sulphide of ammonium from an alkaline
                    solution. From the filtrate, barium, strontium, and calcium are easily
                    precipitated by means of carbonate of ammonia on boiling, so that, if the
                    filtrate from these carbonates is evaporated to dryness and the residue kept at
                    a dull red heat long enough to drive away the ammonia salts, nothing can be left
                    but salts of alkali metals and magnesium. This residue is dissolved in a <hi
                    rend="italic">small</hi> quantity of water, and any <hi rend="superscript">
                    τ</hi> residual basic salt of magnesium filtered off. The filtrate is then ready
                    to be tested for alkali metals as follows: <hi rend="italic">if magnesia be
                    absent,</hi> potassium or rubidium (not caesium) can be detected by addition (to
                    a neutral or feebly acetic solution) of a saturated solution of bitartrate of
                    soda. Potassium and rubidium come down as crystalline bitartrates. The reaction
                    may take some time to become manifest, but can be accelerated by vigorous
                    stirring. In a separate quantity of the solution lithium may be searched for by
                    means of carbonate of soda or trisodic phosphate as explained under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lithium</hi> (vol. xiv. p. 697). For soda we have no
                    characteristic precipitant. In any case the spectrum apparatus should be used
                    for controlling and, if necessary, supplementing the wet-way tests. The case of
                    <hi rend="italic">magnesia being present</hi> need not be specially considered,
                    because the qualitative method will easily be deduced from what is said in the
                    following paragraph.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Quantitative Determinations.—</hi> An exhaustive treatment of
                    this subject would be out of place here. We confine ourselves to two cases. (1)
                    A mixture of alkaline chlorides only. In this case the potassium (including Rb
                    and Cs) is best separated out by adding a quantity of chloroplatinic-acid
                    solution sufficient to convert <hi rend="italic">all the metals</hi> into
                    chloroplatinates, to evaporate to dryness over a water-bath, and from the
                    residue to extract the lithium and sodium salts by lixiviation with alcohol of
                    70 per cent, (by weight). The residual chloroplatinate is collected on a filter,
                    dried at 110“ C., and, if Rb and Cs are absent, weighed as chloroplatinate of
                    potassium, PtCl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> K <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi>
                    (PtCl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> × O'3O71 =
                    2KC1). The chloride of sodium is determined by difference—if lithium be absent.
                    The case of its presence cannot be here considered. (2) A mixture of alkalis
                    combined with sulphuric acid, or such volatile acids as can be expelled by
                    sulphuric. In this case it is best to begin by converting the whole into neutral
                    sulphates, and then to apply the method of Finkener, which, amongst other
                    advantages, offers the one that it does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> demand the
                    absence of magnesia. The mixed sulphate is dissolved in water and the solution
                    mixed with a little more than the volume of chloroplatinic acid (“platinum
                    solution ”) demanded by the potassium (Rb and Cs). The mixture is placed in a
                    water bath and, if necessary, diluted with sufficient water to bring the whole
                    of the precipitated chloroplatinate into hot solution. The solution is then
                    evaporated very nearly to dryness (on the water bath, with continuous stirring
                    towards the end to avoid formation of crusts), allowed to cool, and the residue
                    mixed, first with twenty times its volume of absolute alcohol, then with ten
                    volumes of absolute ether. The mixture is allowed to stand in a well-covered
                    vessel for some hours, to enable the precipitate to settle completely. The
                    precipitate contains all the potassium as chloroplatinate, and most of the
                    sodium and magnesium, and also part of the lithium in the sulphate form. It is
                    washed with ether-alcohol (to complete filtrate A), and then lixiviated as
                    quickly as possible with cold concentrated solution of sal-ammoniac, which
                    dissolves away the sulphates (filtrate B). The residual chloroplatinate is dried
                    within the filter in a porcelain crucible, which is next heated so as to char
                    the paper at the lowest temperature. The residue is then ignited gently in
                    hydrogen, and from the resulting residue the chloride of potassium is extracted
                    by water, to be determined as chloroplatinate, as shown in (1), or otherwise.
                    From the undissolved residue the charcoal is burned away and the residual
                    platinum weighed to check the potassium determination. After removal of the
                    ether and alcohol from filtrate A by distillation, the two filtrates A and B are
                    mixed, evaporated to dryness, the ammonia salts chased away by heating, and the
                    residue is reduced (at about 300“ C. ) in hydrogen to bring the platinum into
                    the form of metal, from which the magnesia and alkali salts are easily dissolved
                    away by means of water or dilute acid. The whole of the salts are then made into
                    neutral sulphate, which is weighed and then dissolved in a known weight of
                    water. The lithium and the magnesium are determined in aliquot parts of the
                    solution and calculated as sulphates. The soda is found by difference. A case
                    intermediate between (1) and (2) often presents itself in practice. We refer to
                    the commercial muriate from Stassfurt. In such an impure muriate the potassium
                    can be determined promptly and accurately by adding to the very concentrated
                    solution of the substance a large excess of a very concentrated solution of
                    chloroplatinic acid,—“excess” meaning more platinum than necessary to make all
                    the metals into chloroplatinates. The precipitate is allowed to settle,
                    collected on a small filter, and washed, first with successive instalments of a
                    platinum solution (containing 5 per cent, of metal), then with ordinary alcohol;
                    it is next dried, and'weighed as above (Tatlock’s method slightly modified). In
                    exact analyses the small quantity of potassium which passes into the filtrate is
                    recovered—ultimately by Finkener’s method—and allowed for. (W. D. )</p>
