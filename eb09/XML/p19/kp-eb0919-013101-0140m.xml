                    of which little trace remains. During the Middle Ages Pistoia was at times a
                    dangerous enemy to Florence, and the scene of constant conflicts between the
                    Guelfs and the Ghibellines: it was there that, in the year 1300, the great party
                    struggle took place which resulted in the creation of the Bianchi and Neri
                    factions (see Dante, <hi rend="italic">Infer.,</hi> xxiv., 1. 121 to end). In
                    the early development of architecture and sculpture Pistoia played a very
                    important part; these arts, as they existed in Tuscany before the time of
                    Niccola Pisano, can perhaps be better studied in Pistoia than anywhere else; nor
                    is the city less rich in the later works produced by the school of sculptors
                    founded by Niccola. In the 14th century Pistoia possessed a number of the most
                    skilful artists in silver work, a wonderful specimen of whose powers exists now
                    in the cathedral,— the great silver altar and frontal of St James, originally
                    made for the high altar, but now placed in a chapel on the south side (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Metal Work,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 65, fig. 4). The cathedral is
                    partly of the 12th century, but rebuilt by one of the Pisani, and inside sadly
                    modernized in the worst <pb break="no"

                    fine works of sculpture; the chief are the monument of Cino da Pistoia, lawyer
                    and poet, Dante’s contemporary (1337), and Verrocchio’s finest work in marble,
                    the monument to Cardinal Forteguerra (1474), with a large figure of Christ,
                    surrounded by angels, in high relief. Unhappily two of the principal figures
                    were destroyed not many years ago, and replaced by worthless modern ones.<note

                    enriched with sculpture, and probably designed, by Gruamons and his brother
                    Adeodatus, in 1136; in the nave is Giovanni Pisano’s magnificent pulpit,
                    imitated from his father’s pulpit at Pisa. Other churches of almost equal
                    interest are S. Giovanni Evangelista, also with sculpture by Gruamons, about
                    1160, and S. Bartolomeo in Pantano by the architect Rudolfinus, 1167. S. Piero
                    Maggiore and San Paolo are also churches begun in the 12 th century. San
                    Francesco al Prato is a fine church of the school of Niccola Pisano, end of the
                    13th century. San Domenico, a noble church built about 1380, contains the
                    beautiful tomb of Filippo Lazari by Bernardo di Matteo, 1464. In addition to its
                    fine churches, of which the above is a very incomplete list, Pistoia contains
                    many noble palaces and public buildings. The Palazzo del Commune and the Palazzo
                    Pretorio, once the residence of the podestà, are both fine specimens of
                    14th-century domestic architecture, in very good preservation. The Ospedale del
                    Ceppo, built originally in the 13th century, but remodelled in the 15th, is very
                    remarkable for the reliefs in enamelled and coloured terra-cotta with which its
                    exterior is richly decorated. Besides various medallions, there is a frieze of
                    figures in high relief extending along the whole front, over its open arcade.
                    The reliefs consist of a series of groups representing the Seven Works of Mercy
                    and other figures; these were executed by the younger members of the Della
                    Robbia family between 1525 and 1535, and, though not equal to the best work of
                    Luca and Andrea, are yet very fine in conception and modelling, and extremely
                    rich in their general decorative effect.</p>
