                    fifth Roman procurator or “governor” <hi rend="italic">(eττlτpoπo&lt;s,
                    ηγeμ,ωv)</hi> of Judaea, Samaria, and Idumaea, succeeded Valerius Gratus in 26
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> By rank he was a Roman eques, possibly of Samnite
                    extraction; his official appointment he owed to the influence of Sejanus. His
                    ordinary residence as procurator was* at Caesarea, the capital, but from time to
                    time he visited Jerusalem, especially at the greater feasts, and on these
                    occasions he had his <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> in the magnificent palace of
                    Herod the Great, hence called the <hi rend="italic">praetorium.</hi> Apart from
                    the supreme (to him, likely enough, most trivial) incident in his life
                    (“suffered under Pontius Pilate ”) the few facts that are known of him indicate
                    a somewhat exceptional recklessness about awakening Jewish fanaticism, and
                    unscrupulousness as to the means used in quelling its manifestations. Not long
                    after his appointment he allowed his soldiers to carry their eagles and other
                    insignia to Jerusalem, and did not give way until an excited mob had stormed for
                    five whole days and nights around his palace at Caesarea. At a later date, in
                    order to provide for the completion of his aqueduct for bringing water to the
                    city from the “Pools of Solomon,” he appropriated funds from the Corban or
                    sacred treasury; but, profiting by his former experience, when this conduct was
                    resented by the populace he caused some of his. soldiers, disguised as Jewish
                    citizens but armed with staves and daggers, to mingle in the crowd, when many
                    casual spectators as well as rioters were trampled to death. For having hung up
                    in Herod’s palace certain gilt shields dedicated to Tiberius he was in vain
                    remonstrated with by the Jews, but Tiberius, on being appealed to, ordered their
                    transference to the temple of Augustus at Caesarea. Of the circumstançes under
                    which he “mingled the blood” of certain Galilaeans “with their sacrifices”
                    nothing is known; but his cruelty in causing a number of Samaritans to be
                    attacked and massacred when assembled on Mount Gerizim led to a complaint being
                    lodged with Vitellius the legate of Syria, and ultimately to his being deprived
                    of his office early in 36 A.D. According to Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(H.
                    E.,</hi> ii. 7) he was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where various misfortunes
                    caused him at last to commit suicide; the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> of
                    Malalas alleges, with less probability, that he was beheaded under Nero. Later
                    legend (see, for example, the apocryphal <hi rend="italic">Mors</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pilati</hi> mentioned below) has a good deal more to say: his
                    suicide was anticipatory of Caligula’s sentence; the body was thrown into the
                    Tiber and there caused disastrous tempests and floods; it afterwards produced
                    similar effects in the Rhine at Vienne, and finally had to be consigned to a
                    deep pool among the Alps. Local tradition points to a little tarn on Mount
                    Pilatus near Lucerne; if anything is thrown into it the water is forthwith
                    strangely agitated. The devil takes the body from the water on Good Fridays and
                    sets it on a throne where it goes through the gesture of washing its hands. The
                    fact that Pilate allowed Jesus to be crucified is by no means out of keeping
                    with what we know of his indifference to the claims alike of justice and of
                    mercy; that he obviously wished to spare him if this could be done without too
                    much inconvenience to himself has, however, gained him in some quarters very
                    generous recognition; thus Tertullian speaks of him as “jam pro sua conscientia
                    Christianum,” the Copts regard him as a martyr, and the Abyssinian Church has
                    given him a place in its calendar (June 25). This view is reflected in the
                    spurious <hi rend="italic">Paradosis</hi><hi rend="italic">Pilati.</hi> Pilate’s
                    wife, known to tradition as Procla or Claudia Procula, is represented as having
                    been a proselyte of the gate and a secret disciple of Jesus. She is commemorated
                    as a saint in the Greek Church (Oct. 27).</p>
                <p>There is a considerable body of apocryphal literature connected with the name of
                    Pilate. The <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Pilati,</hi> which
                    forms part of the <hi rend="italic">Evangelium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nicodemi,</hi> gives a copious account of the trial of Jesus, intermingled with
                    legendary details of uncertain and very unequal value. It exists in a variety of
                    texts, but in substance is supposed with most probability to date from about the
                    middle of the 2nd century, and to be the work of a Jewish Christian, written for
                    Jews. The <hi rend="italic">Epistola Pilati,</hi> of which there are two
                    differing forms, contains what purports to be Pilate’s account to Tiberius of
                    the resurrection of Jesus. The <hi rend="italic">Paradosis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pilati</hi> relates his trial, condemnation, and execution at the emperor’s
                    command; Pilate appeals in prayer to Jesus, and, along with Procla his wife, is
                    received as a true penitent into the number of the faithful.. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Mors</hi><hi rend="italic">Pilati</hi> relates the circumstances
                    of his suicide, the casting of his body into the Tiber, its removal to Vienne
                    (explained as “Via Gehennae”), and the final disposal of it at “Losania.” For
