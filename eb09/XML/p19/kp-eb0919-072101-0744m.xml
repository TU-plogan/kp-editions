                    account, on the principle of reaction, for the liberal opinions and the
                    benevolent disposition of the son. Young Price appears at an early age to have
                    studied the works of Clarke and Butler, and to have conceived a special
                    admiration for the theological and philosophical works of the latter writer. In
                    his eighteenth year he removed to a Dissenting academy in London, and, having
                    completed his education, became chaplain and companion to a Mr Streatfield at
                    Stoke-Newington. While still occupying this position he officiated in various
                    Dissenting congregations, such as those in the Old Jewry, Edmonton, and
                    Newington Green. By the death of Mr Streatfield and of an uncle in 1756 his
                    circumstances were considerably improved, and in the following year, the year in
                    which he first published his best-known work, a <hi rend="italic">Review of the
                    Principal Questions in Morals,</hi> he married a Miss Sarah Blundell, originally
                    of Belgrave in Leicestershire. Price now resided at Newington Green, where his
                    time appears to have been mainly occupied in the performance of his ministerial
                    duties, though he made occasional excursions into the regions of mathematics and
                    philosophy. In 1767 he published a volume of sermons, including one on the
                    future state, which attracted thp attention and gained him the acquaintance of
                    Lord Shelburne, an event which had much influence in raising his reputation and
                    determining the character of his subsequent pursuits. Soon after this date he
                    added to his duties at Newington Green those of morning preacher to a
                    congregation at Hackney, where his audience appear^ to have been more numerous
                    and appreciative than any which he had heretofore succeeded in keeping
                    together.</p>
                <p>But it was not so much in the capacity of a religious teacher as a writer on
                    financial and political questions that Price was destined to become known to his
                    countrymen at large. In 1769 he wrote some observations addressed in a letter to
                    Dr Franklin on the expectation of lives, the increase of mankind, and the
                    population of London, which were published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> of that year; and, again, in May 1770, he
                    communicated to the Royal Society some observations on the proper method of
                    calculating the values of contingent reversions. The publication of these papers
                    is said to have exercised a most beneficial influence in drawing attention to
                    the inadequate calculations on which many insurance and benefit societies had
                    recently been formed. In the year 1769 Price received the degree of D.D. from
                    the university of Glasgow. In 1771 he published his <hi rend="italic">Appeal to
                    the Public on the Subject of the National Debt,</hi> of which subsequent
                    editions appeared in 1772 and 1774. This pamphlet excited considerable
                    controversy at the time of its publication, and is supposed to have influenced
                    Pitt in re-establishing the sinking fund for the extinction of the national
                    debt, which had been created by Walpole in 1716 and abolished in 1733. That
                    Price’s main object, the extinction of the national debt, was a laudable and
                    desirable one would now probably be universally acknowledged. The particular
                    means, however, which he proposed for the purpose of effecting this object are
                    described by Lord Overstone<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Lord Overstone reprinted in 1857, for private circulation, Price’s and other
                    rare tracts on the national debt and the sinking fund.</p></note> as “a sort of
                    hocus-pocus machinery,” supposed to work “without loss to any one,” and
                    consequently purely delusive. As Lord Overstone says, all the sinking funds that
                    have been set on foot have been supported either by loans or by the produce of
                    taxes, and have never paid off a single shilling of debt by their own agency. In
                    1829 Pitt’s sinking fund was abolished by Act of parliament.</p>
                <p>A subject of a much more popular kind was next to employ Dr Price’s pen. Being an
                    ardent lover of civil and religious liberty, he had from the first been strongly
                    opposed to the war with the American colonies, and in 1776 he published a
                    pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Observations on Civil Liberty and the
                    Justice and Policy of the War with America.</hi> Several thousand copies of this
                    work were sold within a few days; a cheap edition was soon issued; the pamphlet
                    was extolled by one set of politicians and abused by another; amongst its
                    critics were Dr Markham, archbishop of York, John Wesley, and Edmund Burke; and
                    its author rapidly became one of the best-known men in England. In recognition
                    of his services in the cause of liberty by the publication of this pamphlet Dr
                    Price was presented with the freedom of the city of London, and it is said that
                    the encouragement derived from this book had no inconsiderable share in
                    determining the Americans to declare their independence. A second pamphlet on
                    the war with America, the debts of Great Britain, and kindred topics followed in
                    the spring of 1777, and whenever the Government thought proper to proclaim a
                    fast-day Dr Price took the opportunity of declaring his sentiments on the folly
                    and mischief of the war. His name thus became identified, for good repute and
                    for evil repute, with the cause of American independence. He was the intimate
                    friend of Franklin; he corresponded with Turgot; and in the winter of 1778 he
                    was actually invited by Congress to transfer himself to America and assist in
                    the financial administration of the insurgent States. This offer he refused from
                    unwillingness to quit his own country and his family connexions, concluding his
                    letter, however, with the prophetic words that he looked “to the United States
                    as now the hope, and likely soon to become the refuge, of mankind.”</p>
                <p>One of Price’s most intimate friends was the celebrated Dr Priestley, but this
                    circumstance did not prevent them from taking the most opposite views on the
                    great questions of morals and metaphysics. In 1778 appeared a published
                    correspondence between these two liberal theologians on the subjects of
                    materialism and necessity, wherein Price maintains, in opposition to Priestley,
                    the free agency of man and the unity and immateriality of the human soul. Both
                    Price and Priestley were in theological opinion what would now vaguely be called
                    “Unitarians,” though they occupied respectively the extreme right and the
                    extreme left position of that school. Indeed Price’s opinions would seem to have
                    been rather Arian than Socinian.</p>
                <p>After the publication of his pamphlet on the American war Dr Price became an
                    important personage. He now preached to crowded congregations, and, when Lord
                    Shelburne acceded to power, not only was he offered the post of private
                    secretary to the premier, but it is said that one of the paragraphs in the
                    king’s speech was suggested by him and even inserted in his very words.</p>
                <p>In 1786 Mrs Price died, and as there were no children by the marriage, and his
                    own health was failing, the remainder of Price’s life appears to have been
                    somewhat <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n745/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0745-0722"/> clouded by solitude and dejection. It was
                    illuminated, however, by one bright gleam, the eager satisfaction with which he
                    witnessed the passing events of the French Revolution. “I could almost say,
                    Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy
                    salvation. . . . After sharing in the benefits of one Revolution, I have been
                    spared to be a witness to two other revolutions, both glorious.”<note

                    happily did not live to see. On the 19th of April 1791 he died, worn out with
                    suffering and disease. His funeral was conducted at Bunhill Fields by Dr Kippis,
                    and his funeral sermon was preached on the following Sunday by Dr Priestley,

                    Nonconformist divines.</p>
                <p>On the 4th of November 1789 Price had preached at the meeting-house in the Old
                    Jewry, before the Society for commemorating the Revolution in Great Britain, his
                    celebrated sermon on the Love of our Country. This sermon, together with a
                    speech subsequently made by him at a public dinner at the London Tavern,
                    rendered him peculiarly obnoxious to Burke, and brought down upon him some of
                    the fiercest denunciations of that brilliant but impassioned writer in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Reflections on the Revolution in France.</hi></p>
                <p>Price’s reputation rests mainly upon the position which he occupies in the
                    history of moral philosophy. His ethical theories are contained in the treatise
                    already mentioned, a <hi rend="italic">Review of the Principal Questions in
                    Morals,</hi> the third edition of which, expressing “the author’s latest and
                    maturest thoughts,” was published in 1787. This work is professedly directed
                    against the doctrines of Hutcheson, but the treatment as a whole is constructive
                    rather than polemical. Price’s views approximate more closely to those of
                    Cudworth than to those of any other English moralist; but they are mainly
                    interesting in the history of morals on account of their resemblance to the
                    theories subsequently propounded by Kant. The main positions of Price’s treatise
                    are three, which may be stated as follows (1) actions are <hi rend="italic">in
                    themselves</hi> right or wrong; (2) right and wrong are simple ideas incapable
                    of analysis; (3) these ideas are perceived immediately by the intuitive power of
                    the reason or understanding, terms which he employs indifferently.</p>
                <p>To the first of these positions it is not, at first sight, easy to attach any
                    precise meaning, nor does even a careful perusal of the work altogether remove
                    the ambiguity. The most natural interpretation, perhaps, of the expression that
                    “an action is right in itself” is that it is right without any relation to the
                    nature of the agent, the end aimed at, or the circumstances under which it is
                    performed. But, apart from the fact that the objections to such a theory would
                    be too obvious to be overlooked, the following passage is sufficient to show
                    that Price cannot have entertained it: “All actions being necessarily right,
                    indifferent, or wrong; what determines which of these an action should be
                    accounted is the <hi rend="italic">truth of the case,</hi> or the relations and
                    circumstances of the agent and the objects. In certain relations there is a
                    certain conduct right. There are certain manners of behaviour which we
                    unavoidably approve, as soon as these relations are known. Change the relations,
                    and a different manner of behaviour becomes right. Nothing is clearer than that
                    what is due or undue, proper or improper to be done, must vary according to the
                    different natures and circumstances of beings. If a particular treatment of one
                    nature is right, it is impossible that the same treatment of a different nature,
                    or of all natures, should be right” (ch. vi.). What, then, does he mean by the
                    phrase that “an action is right or wrong <hi rend="italic">in itself"?</hi>
                    Excluding the meaning which we have set aside, he may wish to express either
                    that actions are right or wrong irrespectively of their consequences, or that
                    the same action would appear right or wrong not to man only but to all
                    intelligent beings, or, as seems to be the case, he may sometimes wish to
                    express one of these meanings and sometimes the other.</p>
                <p>The second and third positions, that right and wrong are simple ideas incapable
                    of analysis, and that they are perceived by an intuitive act of the reason, are
                    succinctly stated in the following passage: “’ Tis a very necessary previous
                    observation that our ideas of right and wrong are simple ideas, and must
                    therefore be ascribed to some power of immediate perception in the human mind.
                    He that doubts this, need only try to give definitions of them, which shall
                    amount to more than synonymous expressions” (ch. i. sect. 1). In this and
                    similar passages the question in dispute between the two rival schools of
                    moralists is brought to a definite issue. Does the term “right” admit of any
                    explanation, definition, or analysis, or is it simply inexplicable? The majority
                    of moralists have adopted the former alternative, and have endeavoured to
                    explain the idea of right in subordination to that of good. Any course of action
                    which has, on the whole, a tendency to promote the happiness or to alleviate the
                    misery of mankind they denominate as right; and any course of action which has a
                    contrary tendency they denominate as wrong. Price, on the other hand, maintains
                    that when we say an action is right we can give no further account of it, that
                    λve state an ultimate fact which neither requires nor can receive any further
                    explanation. The connexion of the third with the first and second positions is
                    obvious. Right and wrong, being simple ideas, and being, moreover, qualities of
                    actions, considered in themselves, are regarded by Price as being perceived
                    immediately by the reason just in the same way that colour is perceived by the
                    eye or sound by the ear. That they are perceived immediately follows from the
                    fact that they are simple ideas, incapable of analysis; that they are perceived
                    by the reason or understanding, and not by a sense, is maintained in an
                    elaborate course of argument against Hutcheson. When the reason or understanding
                    has once apprehended the idea of right, it ought to impose that idea as a law
                    upon the will; and thus it becomes, equally with the affections, a spring of
                    action.</p>
                <p>The place of the emotional part of our nature in this system is not very clear.
                    The predominant view, however, appears to be that, while it is the source of all
                    vicious action, it may, when enlightened by reason, aid in the determination of
                    virtuous conduct. The school of Hutcheson, on the other hand, maintains that the
                    emotions are, in the last analysis, the original source of all conduct, be it
                    virtuous or vicious.</p>
                <p>As already stated, the English moralist with whom Price has most affinity is Cud
                    worth. The main point of difference is that, while Cud worth regards the ideas
                    of right and wrong as νοήματα or modifications of the intellect itself, existing
                    first in germ and afterwards developed by circumstances, Price seems rather to
                    regard them as acquired from the contemplation of actions, though acquired
                    necessarily, immediately, and intuitively.</p>
                <p>Those who are familiar with the writings of Kant (which are posterior to those of
                    Price) will recognize many points of resemblance both in the fundamental ideas
                    and in the modes of expression. Amongst these points are the exaltation of
                    reason; the depreciation of the affections; the unwillingness of both authors to
                    regard the ‘ ‘ partial and accidental structure of humanity,” the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ‘ mere make and constitution of man,” as the basis of
                    morality,—in other words, to recognize ethical distinctions as relative to human
                    nature; the ultimate and irresolvable character of the idea of rectitude; the
                    notion that the reason imposes this idea as a law upon the will, becoming thus
                    our independent spring of action; the insistence upon the reality of liberty or
                    “the power of acting and determining”; the importance attached to reason as a
                    distinct source of ideas; and, it may be added, the discrimination (so
                    celebrated in the philosophy of Kant) of the moral (or practical) and the
                    speculative understanding (or reason).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Price does not, like Kant, distinguish between the words
                    “reason” and “understanding.”</p></note></p>
                <p>Price’s ethical theories are almost the antithesis of those of Paley, whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Moral and Political Philosophy</hi> appeared in 1785. Speaking of
                    this work in his third edition Price says, “Never have I met with a theory of
                    morals which has appeared to me more exceptionable.”</p>
                <p>Most of Price’s more important works have heen already mentioned. To these may be
                    added an Essay on the Population of England (2d ed., 1780); two Fast-day
                    Sermons, published respectively in 1779 and 1781; and Observations on the
                    importance of the American Revolution and the means of rendering it a benefit to
                    the World, 1784. A complete list of his works is given as an appendix to Dr
                    Priestley’s Funeral Sermon. Notices of Price’s ethical system occur in
