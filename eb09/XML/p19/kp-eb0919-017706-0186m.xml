                    that of Thebes by the river Asopus. The Thebans claimed to have founded Plataea,
                    but, however this may have been, Plataea was always at feud with its more
                    powerful neighbour. In 519 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Plataeans, being
                    hard pressed by Thebes, applied for help to the Spartan king Cleomenes, who
                    advised them to place themselves under the protection of Athens. They did so,
                    and Athens and Plataea were thenceforward fast friends. It was perhaps on this
                    occasion that the Plataeans were granted that restricted citizenship of Athens
                    which we know that they enjoyed at a later time. When Athens faced the Persians
                    alone at Marathon, the Plataeans to a man marched out to their help and shared
                    in the victory (490 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> From that day the names of
                    Athens and Plataea were always associated in solemn prayers at Athens. Though
                    dwellers in an inland town, and therefore ignorant of seamanship, the Plataeans
                    helped to man the Athenian ships at the sea fight with the Persians off
                    Artemisium (480). In revenge the Persians burned Plataea. The great battle of
                    Plataea, which finally secured the freedom of Greece against the Persians, was
                    fought ou the uneven and broken ground to the east and north of the town
                    (September 479). After the battle the Greeks declared the city and territory of
                    Plataea to be independent and inviolable. The Plataeans undertook to bring
                    annual offerings of food and raiment to the graves of those who had fallen in
                    the battle; and a festival of liberation (Eleutheria) was celebrated every fifth
                    year. These offerings continued to be brought, and the festival to be held, as
                    late as the 2d century of our era. With the spoils of the Persian wars the
                    Plataeans raised a temple of Athene the Warlike.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was built, according to Plutarch (zlrtsi.
                    20), after the battle of Plataea; according to Pausanias (ix. 4, 1), after the
                    battle of Marathon.</p></note> The Peloponnesian War began with an attempt of
                    the Thebans to seize Plataea (431 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.).</hi> The attempt
                    failed, but in 427, after a siege of about two years, the city was taken by the
                    Peloponnesians and the garrison put to the sword. The bulk of the population had
                    previously taken refuge in Athens. A year afterwards the Thebans razed the city
                    to the 'ground, aud built a large hospice close to the old temple of Hera, to
                    whom they erected a new temple 100 feet long. In 421 the surviving Plataeans
                    received from the Athenians the town of Scioue in Macedonia as a residence, but
                    they had uo doubt to quit it at the end of the war (404). When the peace of
                    Antalcidas was concluded between Greece and Persia (387) Plataea was restored,
                    but a few years afterwards it was surprised and destroyed, except the temples,
                    by the Thebans (about 373). The Plataeans were again received <pb break="no"

                    citizenship, except that they were not eligible for the priesthood and the
                    archonship. After the battle of Chaeronea (338) Philip of Macedon brought back
                    the Plataeans as a counterpoise to the power of Thebes, but the walls were not
                    fully restored till some years later. Alexander the Great, then monarch of Asia,
                    contributed to rebuild them, in recognition, he declared, of the services which
                    the Plataeans had rendered against the Persians of old. With the loss of Greek
                    freedom Plataea sank into insignificance. The inhabitants lived on the glories
                    of the past, and were regarded as braggarts by the rest of the Boeotians. In the
                    6th century the walls were once more restored by Justinian.</p>
                <p>The fullest description of ancient Plataea is that of Pausanias, who visited it
                    in the 2d century. The great temple of Hera, he tells us, contained a statue of
                    Rhea by Praxiteles; the temple of Athene the Warlike was adorned with an image
                    of the goddess by Phidias and paintings by Polygnotus. Close to the city gates
                    were the tombs of the Greeks who had fallen in the battle of Plataea, and an
                    altar and image of Zeus the Liberator in white marble. The ruins of the ancient
                    town lie about 500 yards east of the modern village of Kokhla. They occupy a
                    slightly elevated plateau forming a rude triangle about two and a half miles in
                    circumference, of which the apex to the south almost touches the great rocky
                    slope of Cithaeron, and the base to the north has a steep though short descent
                    to the plain. The outer walls follow the edge of the plateau, but an inner
                    cross-wall divides it into two unequal parts. The southern and higher part is
                    probably as old as the Persian wars; the masonry of the northern part is more
                    recent, and probably belongs to the age of Philip and Alexander. It is likely
                    that these two parts were never included at the same time within the city
                    λvalls, but that the southern was the ancient city, and that at one of the
                    restorations (perhaps that of 387 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) the northern
                    and more spacious part of the plateau was preferred as the site. Within this
                    northern half, and close to the northern wall, is a terrace on which may have
                    stood the temple of Hera. The north-western corner of the northern town is
                    portioned off by a wall, and is conjectured to have been the acropolis of the
                    newer city.</p>
