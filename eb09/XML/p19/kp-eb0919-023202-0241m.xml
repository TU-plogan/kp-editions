                    best years of his life. There is some probability that he outlived Trajan,<note

                    collected from Plutarch’s writings are well discussed by Long in Smith’s <hi

                    daughter, he tells us (§ 2) that they had brought up four sons besides, one of
                    whom was called by the name of Plutarch’s brother, Lamprias. We learn
                    incidentally from this treatise (§ 10) that the writer had been initiated in the
                    secret mysteries of Dionysus, which held that the soul was imperishable. He
                    seems to have been an independent thinker rather than an adherent to any
                    particular school of philosophy. His forte, so to say, was learning, and the
                    application of it to the casualties of human existence. His vast acquaintance
                    with the literature of his time is everywhere apparent; and with history
                    especially he was thoroughly conversant, and hardly less so with physics.</p>
                <p>The celebrity of Plutarch, or at least his popularity, is mainly founded on his
                    forty-six <hi rend="italic">Parallel Lives.</hi> He is thought to have written
                    this work in his later years after his return to his native town Chaeronea. His
                    knowledge of Latin and of Roman history he must have partly derived from some
                    years’ residence in Rome and other parts of Italy,<note anchored="true"

                    Plutarch’s orthography of Roman words and names is important as bearing on the
                    question of pronunciation. A curious example (De <hi rend="italic">Fortun.

                    (doubtless in Greek, on philosophy) to turn his attention much to Roman
                    literature during that period. Long observes that “we must expect to find him
                    imperfectly informed on Roman institutions, and we can detect in him some
                    errors. Yet, on the whole, his Roman lives do not often convey erroneous
                    notions; if the detail is incorrect, the general impression is true.”</p>
                <p>Plutarch’s design in writing the <hi rend="italic">Parallel Lives—</hi> for this
                    is the title which he gives them in dedicating <hi rend="italic">Theseus</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Romulus</hi> to Sosius Senecio—appears to have been the
                    publication, in successive books, of authentic biographies in pairs, a Greek and
                    a Roman (generally with some approximation to synchronism as well as some
                    well-marked resemblances in political career) being selected as the subject of
                    each. In the introduction to the <hi rend="italic">Theseus</hi> he speaks of
                    having already issued his <hi rend="italic">Lycurgus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Numa,</hi> viewing them, no doubt, as bearing a resemblance to each other in
                    their legislative character; and so Theseus and Romulus are compared as the
                    legendary founders of states.</p>
                <p>In the opening sentence of the life of Alexander he says that “<hi rend="italic"
                    >in this book</hi> he has written the lives of Alexander and Caesar” (Julius),
                    and in his <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes,</hi> where he again (§1) mentions his
                    friend Sosius, 2o'σσιoς, he calls the life of this orator and Cicero the fifth
                    book.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is quite
                    evident that the original order of the books has been altered in the series of
                    <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> as we now have them.</p></note> It may therefore
                    fairly be inferred that Plutarch’s original idea was simply to set <hi
                    rend="italic">(πapaβ0λλew,</hi><hi rend="italic">Nie.,</hi> § 1) a Greek
                    warrior, statesman, orator, or legislator side by side with some noted Roman
                    celebrated for the same qualities. In his age, when Rome held the supremacy, but
                    Greece was still looked up to as the centre and source of wisdom and art, such a
                    comparison of the greatest men of both nations had a special propriety and
                    significance, and was more than a mere literary exercise. It was a patriotic
                    theme, to show the superiority of this or that race; and Plutarch, in a sense,
                    belonged to both. Now Alexander and C. Caesar, Demosthenes and Cicero, Solon and
                    Valerius Publicola, have some fairly obvious resemblances, which are not so
                    conspicuous in some other pairs. But the sequel which follows most (not all) of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lives,</hi> entitled σύγκρισι?, viz., a comparison in
                    detail, is by modern critics rejected as spurious. It was manifestly added as an
                    appendix from a misapprehension of Plutarch’s real motive; the effort to bring
                    out exact points of resemblances which are either forced or fanciful far
                    exceeded the design contemplated by him. Moreover, the marked difference in
                    style between the <hi rend="italic">βcoL</hi> and the συγκpiσeις is quite
                    decisive of the question.</p>
                <p>Nearly all the lives are in pairs; but the series concludes with single
                    biographies of Artaxerxes, Aratus (of Sicyon), Galba, and Otho. In the life of
                    Aratus, not Sosius Senecio, but one Polycrates, is addressed.</p>
                <p>It is not to be supposed that Plutarch was content to write merely amusing or
                    popular biographies. On the contrary, the <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> are works
                    of great learning and research, and they must for this very reason, as well as
                    from their considerable length, have taken many years in their compilation. For

                    of Lycurgus he cites Aristotle, Eratosthenes, Apollodorus, Timaeus, Xenophon,
                    Simonides, Aristocrates the Spartan, Sphaerus, Critias, Theophrastus,
                    Dioscorides, Hippias the sophist, Philostephanus, Demetrius Phalereus,
                    Hermippus, Sosibius, Thucydides, Apollothemis, Aristoxenus, Aristocrates. In the
                    life of Alexander, which is a long and elaborate essay, mention is made of
                    Onesicritus, Aristobulus, Duris, Chares, Callisthenes, Eratosthenes, Clitarchus,
                    Polyclitus, Antigenes, Ister, Ptolemaeus, Anticlides, Philo of Thebes, Philippus

                <p>It is true that many of the lives, especially of Romans, do not show such an
                    extent of research or such a wealth of authorities. But Plutarch must have
                    possessed or had access to a great store of books, and his diligence as an
                    historian cannot be questioned, if his accuracy is in some points impeached.</p>
                <p>His sympathy with Doric characters and institutions is very evident; he delights
                    to record the exploits, the maxims, and the virtues of Spartan kings and
                    generals. This feeling is the key to his apparently unfair and virulent attack
                    on Herodotus, who, as an Ionian, seemed to him to have exaggerated the prowess
                    and the foresight of the Athenian leaders.</p>
                <p>The voluminous and varied writings of Plutarch exclusive of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lives</hi> are known under the common term <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Moralia.</hi> These consist of above sixty essays, some of them
                    long and many of them rather difficult, some too of very doubtful genuineness.
                    Their literary value is greatly enhanced by the large number of citations from
                    lost Greek poems, especially verses of the dramatists, among whom Euripides
                    holds by far the first place. They evince a mind of vast and varied resources,
                    historical as well as philosophical—the mind of an inquirer and a seeker after
                    knowledge, rather than that of an exponent or an opponent of any particular
                    philosophical system.</p>
                <p>But Plutarch’s Greek is not, like Lucian’s, fluent and easy, nor even clear. He
                    uses many words not in the ordinary Greek vocabulary, and he too often
                    constructs long sentences, the thread of which separately, as well as the
                    connexion, cannot be traced without close attention. Hence he is unattractive as
                    a writer, so far as style is concerned, and he is often diffuse and carries his
                    discussions to an unnecessary length.</p>
                <p>It is certain that to most persons in Britain, even to those who call themselves
                    scholars, the <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">Moralia</hi> of
                    Plutarch are practically almost unknown. No English translation of them, we
                    believe, has been printed since the bulky folio of Philemon Holland, published
                    at the end of the 17th century, with the exception of a single volume in Bohn’s
                    Classical Library, lately added to that series by Mr C. W. King, M.A. It is
                    therefore the more desirable to devote the remainder of this article to a brief
                    notice of the principal treatises.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Education of Children</hi> recommends (1) good birth,
                    and sobriety in the father; (2) good disposition and good training are alike
                    necessary for virtue; (3) a mother ought to nurse her own offspring, on the
                    analogy of all animals; (4) the <hi rend="italic">paedagogus</hi> must be honest
                    and trustworthy; (5) all the advantages of life and fortune must be held
                    secondary to education; (6) mere mob-oratory is no part of a good education; (7)
                    philosophy should form the principal study, but not to the exclusion of the
                    other sciences; (8) gymnastics are to be practised; (9) kindness and advice are
                    better than blows; (10) oyer-pressure in learning is to be avoided, and plenty
                    of relaxation is to be allowed; (11) self-control, and not least over the
                    tongue, is to be learned; (12) the grown-up youth should be under the eye and
                    advice of his father, aιjd all bad company avoided, flatterers included; (13)
                    fathers should not be too harsh and exacting, but remember that they were
                    themselves once young; (14) marriage is recommended, and without disparity of
                    rank; (15) above all, a father should be an example of virtue to a son.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">How a Young Man ought to Hear Poetry</hi> is largely made up of
                    quotations from Homer and the tragic poets. The points of the essay are the
                    moral effects of poetry as combining the true with the false, the praises of
                    virtue and heroism with a mythology depraved and unworthy of gods, <hi
                    rend="italic">eι θeoi τι δpωσι φaυλov, oυκ 0σlv θtoi</hi> (§ 21). “So long as
                    the young man,” says Plutarch, “admires what is rightly said and done in the
                    poets, but feels annoyed at the contrary, no harm is done; but if he learns to
                    admire everything which is presented to him under the name of a hero, he will
                    unconsciously become morally deteriorated” (§ 26).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Right Way of Hearing (τrtpl τoυ aκoυtιv)</hi> advocates
                    the listening in silence to what is being said, and not giving a precipitate
                    reply to statements which may yet receive some addition or modification from the
                    speaker (§ 4). The hearer is warned not to give too much weight to the style,
                    manner, or tone of the speaker (§ 7), not to be either too apathetic or too
                    prone to praise, not to be impatient if he finds his faults reproved by the
                    lecturer (§ 16). He concludes with the maxim, “to hear rightly is the beginning
                    of living rightly,” and perhaps he has in view throughout his own profession as
                    a lecturer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">How a Flatterer may be Distingτιished from a Friend</hi> is a
                    rather long and uninteresting treatise. The ancient writers are full of warnings
                    against flatterers, who do not seem to exercise much influence in modem society.
                    The really dangerous flatterer (§ 4) is not the parasite, but the pretender to a
                    disinterested friendship, —one who affects similar tastes, and so insinuates
                    himself into your confidence. Your accomplished flatterer does not always
                    praise, but flatters by act, as when he occupies a good seat at a public meeting
                    for the express purpose of resigning it to his patron (§15). A true friend, on
                    the contrary, speaks freely on proper occasions. A good part of the essay turns
                    on <hi rend="italic">παρρησία,</hi> the honest expression of opinion. The
                    citations, which are fairly numerous, are mostly from Homer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">How one may be Conscious of Progress in Goodness</hi> is
                    addressed to Sosius Senecio, who was consul in the last years of Nerva, and more
                    than once (99, 102, 107) under Trajan. If, says Plutarch, a man could become
                    suddenly wise instead of foolish, he could not be ignorant of the change; but it
                    is otherwise with moral or mental processes. Gradual advance in virtue is like
                    steady sailing over a wide sea, and can only be measured by the time taken and
                    the forces applied (§ 3). Zeno tested advance by dreams (§ 12); if no excess or
                    immorality presented itself to the imagination of the sleeper, his mind had been
                    purged by reason and philosophy. When we love the truly good, and adapt
                    ourselves to their looks and manners, and this even with the loss of worldly
                    prosperity, then we are really getting on in goodness ourselves (§ 15). Lastly,
                    the avoidance of little sins is an evidence of a scrupulous conscience (§
                    17).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">How to get Benefit oτιt of Enemies</hi> argues that, as
                    primitive man had savage animals to fight against, but learnt to make use of
                    their skins for clothing and their flesh for food, so we are bound to turn even
                    our enemies to some good purpose. One service they do to us is to make us live
                    warily against plots; another is, they induce us to live honestly, so as to vex
                    our rivals not by scolding them but by making them secretly jealous of us (§ 4).
                    Again, finding fault leads us to consider if we are ourselves faultless, and to
                    be found fault with by a foe is likely to be plain truth speaking, <hi
                    rend="italic">o,κoυστeov</hi> eo∙τi παρά <hi rend="italic">των ίχθρων</hi> τ⅛v
                    <hi rend="italic">aληθtιav</hi> (§ 6). Jealousies and strifes, so natural to
                    man, are diverted from our friends by being legitimately expended on our enemies
                    (§ 10).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On Having Many Friends, On Chance, On Virtue and Vice,</hi> are
                    three short essays, the first advocating the concentration of one’s affections
                    on a few who are worthy (τo5s α∣iovs <hi rend="italic">φιλ,tas δι&lt;iκeιv,</hi>
                    § 4), rather than diluting them, as it were, on the many; the second pleads that
                    intelligence, <hi rend="italic">φρovησιs,</hi> not mere luck, is the ruling
                    principle of all success; the third shows that virtue and vice are but other

                <p>A longer treatise, well and clearly written, and not less valuable for its many

                    on the early death of his “generally beloved and religious and dutiful son.”
                    Equality of mind both in prosperity and in adversity is recommended (§ 4), since
                    there are “ups and downs” <hi rend="italic">(Sψoς κal τaπeιv6της)</hi> in life,
                    as there are storms and calms on the sea, and good and bad seasons on the earth.

                <p>he illustrates by citing fifteen fine verses from Menander (§ 5). The uselessness
                    of indulging in grief is pointed out, death being a debt to all and not to be
                    regarded as an evil ( §§ 10-12). Plato’s doctrine is cited (§ 13) that the body
                    is a burden and an impediment to the soul. Death may be annihilation, and
                    therefore the dead are in the same category as the unborn (§ 15). The lamenting
                    a death because it is untimely or premature has something of selfishness in it
                    (§ 19), besides that it only means that one has arrived sooner than another at
                    the end of a common journey. If a death is more grievous because it is untimely,
                    a new born infant’s death would be the most grievous of all (§ 23). One who has
                    died early may have been spared many woes rather than have been deprived of many
                    blessings; and, after all, to die is but to pay a debt due to the gods when they
                    ask for it (§ 28). Examples are given of fortitude and resignation under such
                    affliction (§ 33). If, says the author in conclusion, there is a heaven for the
                    good hereafter, be sure that such a son will have a place in it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Precepts about Health</hi> commences as a dialogue, and extends
                    to some length as a lecture. It is technical and difficult throughout, and
                    contains but little that falls in with modern ideas. Milk, he says, should be
                    taken for food rather than for drink, and wine should not be indulged in after
                    hard work or mental effort, for it does but tend to increase the bodily
                    disturbance (§ 17). Better than purges or emetics is a temperate diet, which
                    induces the bodily functions to act of themselves (§ 20). Another wise saying is
                    that idleness does not conduce to health (ούδ’ <hi rend="italic">a,Kηθis

                    >ησυχίαν</hi> ⅛γovταs, § 21), and yet another that a man should learn by
                    experience his bodily capabilities without always consulting a physician (§
                    26).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Advice to the Married</hi> is addressed to his newly wedded
                    friends Pollianus and Eurydice. It is simply and plainly written, and consists
                    chiefly of short maxims and anecdotes, with but few citations from the
                    poets.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Banquet of the Seven Wise Men</hi> is a longer treatise,
                    one of the several “Symposia” or imaginary conversations that have come down to
                    us. It is supposed to be given by Periander in the public banqueting-room <hi
                    rend="italic">(fστιaτipιov)</hi> near the harbour of Corinth (Lechaeum) on the
                    occasion of a sacrifice to Aphrodite. The whole party consisted of “more than
                    twice seven,” the friends of the principal guests being also present. Like
                    Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Symposizιm</hi> this treatise takes the form of a
                    narrative of what was said and done, the narrator being one Diocles, a friend of
                    Periander⅛, who professes to give Nicarchus a correct account as having been
                    present. The dinner was simple, and in contrast with the usual splendour of
                    “tyrants” (§ 4). The conversation turns on various topics; Solon is credited
                    with the remarkable opinion that “a king or tyrant is most likely to become
                    celebrated if he makes a democracy out of a monarchy” (§ 7). There is much
                    playful banter throughout, but neither the wit nor the wisdom seems of a very
                    high standard. Solon delivers a speech on food being a necessity rather than a
                    pleasure of life (§ 16), and one Gorgus, a brother of the host, comes in to
                    relate how he has just shaken hands with Arion brought across the sea on the
                    back of a dolphin (§ 18), which brings on a discussion about the habits of that
                    creature. Among the speakers are Aesop, Anaeharsis, Thales, Chilo, Cleobulus,
                    and one Chersias, a poet.</p>
                <p>A short essay <hi rend="italic">On Superstition</hi> contains a good many
                    quotations from the poets. It opens with the wise remark that ignorance about
                    the gods, which makes the obstinate man an atheist, also begets credulity in
                    weak and pliant minds. The atheist fears nothing because he believes nothing;
                    the superstitious man believes there are gods, but that they are unfriendly to
                    him (§ 2). A man who fears the gods is never free from fear, whatever he may do
                    or whatever may befall him. He extends his fears beyond his death, and believes
                    in the “gates of hell,” and its fires, in the darkness, the ghosts, the infernal
                    judges, and what not (§ 4). The atheist does not believe in the gods; the
                    superstitious man wishes he did not, but fears to disbelieve (§ 11). On the
                    whole, this is a most interesting treatise. Mr King has given a translation of
                    it, and of the next five essays.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On Isis and Osiris</hi> is a rather long treatise on Egyptian
                    symbolism, interesting chiefly to students of Egyptology. It gives an exposition
                    of the strange myths and superstitions of this ancient solar cult, including a
                    full account of the great antagonist of Osiris, Typhon, or the Egyptian Satan.
                    Plutarch thus lays down the Zoroastrian theory of good and bad agencies (§ 45):
                    “if nothing can happen without cause, and good cannot furnish cause for evil, it
                    follows that the nature of evil, as of good, must have an origin and principle
                    of its own.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Cessation of Oracles</hi> is a dialogue, discussing the
                    reasons why divine inspiration seemed to be withdrawn from the old seats of
                    prophetic lore. The real reason of their decline in popularity is probably very
                    simple; when the Greek cities became Roman provinces the fashion of consulting
                    oracles fell off, as unsuited to the more practical influences of Roman thought
                    and Roman politics. The question is discussed whether there are such
                    intermediate beings as daemons, who according to Plato communicate the will of
                    the gods to men, and the prayers and vows of men to the gods.</p>
                <p>The possibility of a plurality of worlds is entertained, and of the planets being
                    more or less composed of the essence of the five elements, fire, ether, earth,
                    air, and water (§ 37). The whole treatise is metaphysical, but it concludes with
                    remarks on the exhalations at Delphi having different effects on different
                    people and at different times. The ancient notion doubtless was that the vapour
                    was the breath of some mysterious being sent up from the under-world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Pythian Responses, why no longer given in Verse,</hi> is
                    also a dialogue, the first part of which is occupied mainly with conversation
                    and anecdotes about the statues and other offerings at Delphi. It is rather an
                    amusing essay, and may be regarded as a kind of appendix to the last. The theory
                    propounded (§ 24) is that verse was the older vehicle of philosophy, history,
                    and religion, but that plain prose has become the later fashion, and therefore
                    that oracles are now generally delivered “in the same form as laws speak to
                    citizens, kings reply to their subjects, and scholars hear their teachers
                    speak.” Discredit too was brought on the verse-oracle by the facility with which
                    it was employed by impostors (§ 25). Moreover, verse is better suited to
                    ambiguity, and oracles now-a-days have less need to be ambiguous (§ 28).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the E at Delphi</hi> is an inquiry why that letter or symbol
                    was written on or in the Delphic temple. Some thought it represented the number
                    five, others that it introduced the inquiry of oracleseekers, <hi rend="italic"
                    >If</hi> so-and-so was to be done; while one of the speakers, Ammonius, decides
                    that it means EΓ, “thou art,” an address to Apollo containing the predication of
                    existence (§ 17).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Face on the Moon's Disk</hi> is a long and curious if
                    somewhat trifling speculation, yet not without interest from its calculations of
                    the sizes and the distance from earth of the sun and moon (§ 10), and from the
                    contrast between ancient lunar theories and modern mathematics. The cause of the
                    moon’s light, its peculiar colour, the possibility of its being inhabited, and
                    many kindred questions are discussed in this dialogue, the beginning and end of
                    which are alike abrupt. Some of the “guesses at troth” are very near the mark,
                    as when it is suggested (§§ 21-2) that the moon, like the earth, contains deep
                    recesses into which the sun’s light does not descend, and the appearance of the
                    “face” is nothing but the shadows of streams or of deep ravines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Late Vengeance of the Deity</hi> is a dialogue
                    consequent on a supposed lecture by Epicurus. An objection is raised to the
                    ordinary dealings of providence, that long delayed punishment encourages the
                    sinner and disappoints the injured, the reply to which is (§ 5) that the god
                    sets man an example to avoid hasty and precipitate resentment, and that he is
                    willing to give time for repentance (§ 6). Moreover, he may wish to await the
                    birth of good progeny from erring parents (§ 7). Another fine reflexion is that
                    sin has its own punishment in causing misery to the sinner, and thus the longer
                    the life the greater is the share of misery (§ 9). The essay concludes with a
                    long story about one Thespesius, and the treatment which he saw, during a
                    trance, of the souls in the other world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On Fate</hi> discusses the law of chance as against the
                    overruling of providence. This treatise ends abruptly; the point of the argument
                    is that both fate and providence have their due influence in mundane affairs (§
                    9), and that all things are constituted for the best. </p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Genius of Socrates</hi> is a long essay, and, like so
                    many of the rest, in the form of a dialogue. The experiences of one Timarchus,
                    and his supernatural visions in the cave of Trophonius, are related at length in
                    the Platonic style (§ 22), and the true nature of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >baiμoves</hi> is revealed to him. They are the souls of the just, who still
                    retain regard for human affairs and assist the good in their efforts after
                    virtue (§ 28). The dialogue ends with an interesting narrative of the
                    concealment of Pelopidas and some of the Theban conspirators against the
                    Spartans in the house of Charon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On Exile</hi> is a fine essay, rendered the more interesting
                    from its numerous quotations from the poets, including several from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phoenissae.</hi> Man is not a plant that grows only in one soil;
                    he belongs to heaven rather than to earth, and wherever he goes there are the
                    same sun, the same seasons, the same providence, the same laws of virtue and
                    justice (§ 5). There is no discredit in being driven from one’s country; Apollo
                    himself was banished from heaven and condemned to live for a time on earth (§
                    18).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Consolation to his Wife,</hi> on the early death of their
                    only daughter Timoxena (§ 7), is a feeling and sensible exhortation to moderate
                    her grief.</p>
                <p>Nine books of <hi rend="italic">Symposiaca</hi> extend to a great length,
                    discussing inquiries (τrρo0λ⅛ματα) on a vast number of subjects. The general
                    treatment of these, in which great literary knowledge is displayed, is not
                    unlike the style of Atnenaeus. It is, of course, impossible here to give any
                    summary of the questions propounded.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Amorous Man</hi> is a dialogue of some length, describing a
                    conversation on the nature of love held at Helicon, pending a quinquennial feast
                    of the Thespians, who specially worsbipped <pb break="no"

                    illustrated by poetical quotations. In § 24 mention is made of the emperor
                    Vespasian. It is followed by a short treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Love
                    Stories,</hi> giving a few narratives of sensational adventures of lovers.</p>

                    dedicated to Trajan, extend to a great length, and are divided into three parts
                    :—(1) of kings and commanders (including many Roman); (2) of Spartans; (3) oi
                    Spartan women (a short treatise on Spartan institutions being interposed between
                    the last two). The names of the authors are added, and to some of them a large
                    number of maxims are attributed. Many are terse, shrewd, wise, or pointed with
                    strong commonsense; but a good many seem to us now somewhat commonplace.</p>
                <p>A rather long treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Virtues of Women</hi> contains a
                    series of narratives of noble deeds done by the sex in times of danger and
                    trouble, especially from “tyrants.” Many of the stories arc interesting, and the
                    style is easy and good.</p>
                <p>Another long and learned work bears the rather obscure title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Κεφαλαίων καταγραφή.</hi> It is generally known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quaestiones Romanae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Graecae,</hi> in two parts. In
                    the former, which contains one hundred and thirteen headings, the inquiry (on

                <p><hi rend="italic">Parallels</hi> are a series of similar incidents which occurred
                    respectively to Greeks and Romans, the Greek standing first and the Roman
                    counterpart following. Many of the characters are mythological, though Plutarch
                    regards them as historical.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Fortτιne of the Romans</hi> discusses whether, on the

                    Ulysses, and a talking pig take part. Ulysses wishes that all the human beings
                    that have been changed by the sorceress into bestial forms should be restored;
                    but “piggy” is quite opposed to the return, arguing that in moral virtues, such
                    as true bravery, chastity, temperance, and general simplicity of life and
                    contentment, animals are very far superior to man.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Whether Land Animals or Water Animals are the Cleverer</hi> is
                    a rather long dialogue on the intelligence of ants, bees, elephants, spiders,
                    dogs, &amp;c., on the one hand, and the crocodile, the dolphin, the tunny, and
                    many kinds of fish, on the other. This is a good essay, much in the style of
                    Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">History of Animals.</hi><hi rend="italic">On
                    Flesh-Eating,</hi> in two orations, discusses the origin of the practice, viz.,
                    necessity, and makes a touching appeal to man not to destroy life for mere
                    gluttony (§ 4). This is a short but very sensible and interesting argument. <hi
                    rend="italic">Questions on Plato</hi> are ten in number, each heading subdivided
                    into several speculative replies. The subjects are for the most part
                    metaphysical; the essay is not long, but it concerns Platonists only. <hi
                    rend="italic">Whether Water or Fire is more Useful</hi> is also short; after
                    discussing the uses of both elements it decides in favour of the latter, since
                    nothing can exceed in importance the warmth of life and the light of the sun.
                    <hi rend="italic">On Primary Cold</hi> is a physical speculation on the true
                    nature and origin of the quality antithetical to heat. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physical Reasons</hi><hi rend="italic">(Quaestiones Naturales)</hi> are replies
                    to inquiries as to why certain facts or phenomena occur; <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> “Why is salt the only flavour not in fruits?” “Why do fishing-nets
                    rot in winter more than in summer ?” “Why does pouring oil on the sea produce a
                    calm ?” <hi rend="italic">On the Opinions accepted by the Philosophers,</hi> in
                    five books, is a valuable compendium of the views of the Ionic school and the
                    Stoics on the phenomena of the universe and of life. <hi rend="italic">On the
                    Ill-nature of Herodotus</hi> is a well-known critique of the historian for his
                    unfairness, not only to the Boeotians and Lacedaemonians, but to the Corinthians
                    and other Greek states. It is easy to say that this essay “neither requires nor
                    merits refutation”; but Plutarch knew history, and he writes like one who
                    thoroughly understands the charges which he brings against the historian. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Ten Orators,</hi> from Antipho to Dinarchus, are
                    biographies of various length, compiled, doubtless, from materials now lost.</p>
                <p>Γwo rather long essays, <hi rend="italic">Should a Man engage in Politics when he
                    is no longer Young,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Precepts for Governing</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(πολιτικά</hi><hi rend="italic">πapayyiλ-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ματά),</hi> are interspersed with valuable quotations. In favour of the former
                    view the administrations of Pericles, of Agesilaus, of Augustus, are cited (§
                    2), and the preference of older men for the pleasures of doing good over the
                    pleasures of the senses (§ 5). In the latter, the true use of eloquence is
                    discussed, and a contrast drawn between the brilliant and risky and the slow and
                    safe P°ucy (§ 10). The choice of friends, and the caution against enmities, the
                    dangers of love, of gain, and of ambition, with many topics of the like kind,
                    are sensibly advanced and illustrated by examples.</p>
                <p>Besides the numerous works that have come down to us, Plutarch speaks of a work
                    called Αϊτζα, the same title with the lost poem of Callimachus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Romulus,</hi> § 15).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> have often been translated; the most popular
                    version into English is that by John and William Langhorne; more recently many
                    of the Roman lives have been translated, with notes, by the late Mr George Long.
                    Λn excellent and convenient edition of the Greek text, in 5 vols. 12mo, has been
                    published in the Teubner series by Carl Sintenis. It seems strange that no modem
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">Moralia</hi>
                    exists, and that the student has to fall back on the old-fashioned volumes of
                    Wyttenbach (6 vols. 4to, Oxford, also printed in 8vo), Reiske (in 12 vols. 8vo),
                    and Hutten (14 vols. 8vo). Whether there is any hope of Rudolph Hercher’s single
                    volume (1872) in the Teubner series being followed by others, we have no
                    information. (F. A. P )</p>
