                    possess twenty plays of Plautus. A few of them are incomplete, and in some cases
                    they show traces of later interpolations, but they have reached us in the main
                    as they were written by him in the end of the 3d and the beginning of the 2d
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> At the date of his birth Roman literature
                    may be said to have been non-existent. When he died the Latin language had
                    developed its full capacities as an organ of social intercourse and familiar
                    speech, and the literature of the world had been enriched by a large number of
                    adaptations from the New Comedy of Athens, animated by the new life of ancient
                    Italy and vivified by the genius and robust human nature of their author; and
                    these have been the chief means of transmitting the traditions of the ancient
                    drama to modern times. The maturity which comedy attained in a single generation
                    affords a remarkable contrast to the slow processes by which the higher forms of
                    Roman poetical and prose literature were brought to perfection. It may be
                    explained partly by the existence, for some generations before the formal
                    beginning of literature at Rome, of the dramatic and musical medleys (“saturae
                    impletae modis”) which in their allusions to current events and their spirit of
                    banter must have had a considerable affinity with the dialogue of Plautus, and
                    partly to the diffusion of the Latin language, as the organ of practical
                    business among the urban communities of Italy. But much also was due to the
                    individual genius and the command over their native idiom possessed by the two
                    oldest of the genuine creators of Roman literature, Naevius and Plautus.</p>
                <p>A question might be raised as to whether Plautus or his younger contemporary
                    Ennius was the most characteristic representative of the national literature of
                    their time. Ennius certainly exercised a much more important influence on its
                    subsequent development. He arrested the tendency imparted to that development by
                    Naevius and Plautus. He made literature the organ of the serious spirit and
                    imperial ambition of the Roman aristocracy, while the genius of Plautus appealed
                    to the taste and temperament of the mass of the people, at a time when they were
                    animated by the spirit of enjoyment and comparatively indifferent to political
                    questions. The ascendency of the aristocracy in public affairs for two
                    generations after the end of the Second Punic War determined the ascendency of
                    Ennius in Roman literature; and it may be admitted that, if the genius of
                    Plautus and of Ennius could not work harmoniously together, it was best that
                    that of the younger poet, as representative of the truer genius of Rome, should
                    prevail. The popularity of Plautus was greatest in his own time and in the
                    generation succeeding him, but his plays still continued to be acted with
                    applause till the age of Cicero, and he was greatly admired both by Cicero and
                    by the man among his contemporaries who, both from his learning and taste,
                    retained most of the antique spirit, Varro. The literary taste of the Augustan
                    age and of the first century of the empire was adverse to him; but the archaic
                    revival in the latter part of the 2d century of our era brought him again into
                    favour, with the result of securing the preservation of his works through
                    mediaeval times and their revival with great acceptance at the Renaissance. That
                    his original popularity was due to genuine gifts of humour and genuine power in
                    representing human life is clear from their reception by a world so much altered
                    from that in which he himself had played his part. And if his influence was not
                    felt like that of Ennius in determining the form and spirit of the literature of
                    his country, it was not without effect on the two greatest dramatists of modern
                    times, Shakespeare and Molière.</p>
                <p>The few facts known of his life rest on the authority of Cicero, of Aulus
                    Gellius, and of Jerome in his continuation of the Eusebian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle.</hi> He was born in the earlier half of the 3d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and died at an advanced age in the year 184 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> He was a native of Sarsina in Umbria. His first
                    employment was in some way connected with the stage “in operis artificum
                    scenicorum.” He saved money in this employment, engaged in foreign trade, and
                    returning to Rome in absolute poverty was reduced to work as a hired servant in
                    a mill; and then for the first time he began to write comedies. The earliest
                    allusion to any contemporary event which we find in any of his plays is that in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Miles</hi><hi rend="italic">Gloriosus</hi> (1. 212-3) to
                    the imprisonment of Naevius, which happened about the year 207 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Cistellaria</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Stichus</hi> were apparently written immediately after the end of
                    the Second Punic War. The last ten years of his life were the most productive,
                    and the greater number of his extant comedies belong to that period. They do not
                    seem to have been published as literary works during his lifetime, but to have
                    been left in possession of the players, to whom the interpolations and some
                    other unimportant changes are to be ascribed. The prologues to the plays, with
                    three or four exceptions, belong to the generation after his death. In a later
                    age the plays of many contemporary playwrights were attributed to him.
                    Twenty-one were accepted by Varro as undoubtedly genuine, and of these we
                    possess twenty nearly complete, and fragments of another, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vidularia.</hi> Other nineteen Varro regarded as probably genuine, and the
                    titles of some of them, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Saturio, Addictus,
                    Com-morientes,</hi> are also known to us.</p>
                <p>We get the impression from his works and from ancient <pb break="no"

                    years, a rapid and productive writer, more concerned with the immediate success
                    of his works than with their literary perfection.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Securus cadat an recto stet fabula
                    talo.”—Hör. <hi rend="italic">Ep.</hi> ii. 1, 176.</p></note> Yet he shows that
                    he took pride and pleasure in his art <hi rend="italic">(Bacck.,</hi> 214), and
                    Cicero testifies especially tc the gratification which he derived from two works
                    of his old age, the <hi rend="italic">Pseudolus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Truculentus</hi><hi rend="italic">(De Senec.,</hi> 14). We get further the
                    impression of a man of strong animal spirits and of large intercourse with the
                    world, especially with the trading and middle classes. We find no indication of
                    familiarity with the manners, tastes, or ideas of the governing aristocracy. The
                    story told of his unsuccessful mercantile speculations might seem to derive
                    confirmation from the “flavour of the sea” and the spirit of adventure present
                    in many of his plays, from his frequent colloquial use of Greek phrases, and
                    from indications of familiarity with the sights, manners, and pleasures of the
                    Greek cities on the Mediterranean. He has many allusions to works of art, to the
                    stories of Greek mythology, and to the subjects of Greek tragedies; and he tried
                    to enrich the native vocabulary with a considerable number of Greek words which
                    did not maintain their place in the language. The knowledge of these subjects
                    which he betrays, and his copious use of Greek words and phrases, seem to be the
                    result rather of active and varied intercourse with contemporary Greeks than of
                    the study of books.</p>
                <p>Like all the old Roman dramatists, he borrows his plots, incidents, scenes,
                    characters, and probably the outlines of his dialogue from the authors of the
                    new comedy of Athens,—Diphilus, Philemon, Menander, and others. But he treated
                    his borrowed materials with much more freedom and originality than the only
                    other dramatist of whom we possess complete pieces—Terence. A note of this
                    difference appears in the fact that the titles of all the plays of Terence are
                    Greek, while those of Plautus are nearly all Latin. We find a much greater range
                    and variety in the scenes and incidents introduced by Plautus, and much greater
                    divergence from a conventional type in his characters. But it is especially on
                    his dialogue and his metrical soliloquies that his originality is stamped.
                    Though all the personages of his plays are supposed to be Greeks, living in
                    Greek towns, they constantly speak as if they were Romans living in the heart of
                    Rome. Frequent mention is made of towns in Italy, of streets, gates, and markets
                    in Rome itself, of Roman magistrates and of their duties, of the business of the
                    law-courts, the comitia, and the senate, &amp;c. We constantly meet with Roman
                    formulae, expressions of courtesy, proverbs, and the like. While avoiding all
                    direct reference to politics, he frequently alludes to recent events in Roman
                    history, and to laws of recent enactment. Although he maintains and seems to
                    inculcate an attitude of political indifference, he is not altogether
                    indifferent to social conditions, and in more than one of his plays comments on
                    the growing estrangement between the rich and poor, as an element of danger to
                    the state. Still he writes neither as a political nor as a social satirist, but
                    simply with the wish to represent the humours of human life and to amuse the
                    people in their holiday mood.</p>
                <p>His independence of his originals, in regard to expression, is further shown by
                    the puns and plays on words, the alliterations, assonances, &lt;fcc., which do
                    not admit of being reproduced in translation from one language to another; in
                    the metaphors taken from Roman military operations, business transactions, and
                    the trade of various artisans; and in his profuse use of terms of endearment and
                    vituperation, characteristic of the vivacity of the Italian temperament in
                    modern as in ancient times. But in nothing is his difference from Terence, and
                    nrftRnm-</p>
                <p>ably from the originals which they both followed, more decided than in his large
                    use of lyrical monologue, or “cantica,” alternating with the ordinary dialogue
                    in much the same way as the choral odes do in the old Greek comedy. These one
                    may conjecture to have been a partial survival of passages in the old dramatic
                    <hi rend="italic">saturae,</hi> which were repeated to a musical accompaniment.
                    In the naïveté of the reflexions which they contain, and the prolixity with
                    which the thought is worked out, we recognize the earliest effort of the Roman
                    mind applied to reflexion on life, and no reproduction of any phase of the Greek
                    mind to which the expression of such reflexion had been familiar for
                    generations.</p>
                <p>In the diction of Plautus accordingly we may consider that we have a thorough
                    reflexion of his own mind, and an important witness of Roman life and thought in
                    his time. The characters in his plays are the stock characters of the New Comedy
                    of Athens, the “fallax servus,” the “leno insidiosus,” the “meretrix blanda,”
                    the “parasitus edax,” the “amans ephebus,” the “pater attentus,” &amp;c. We may
                    miss the finer insight into human nature and the delicate touch in drawing
                    character which Terence presents to us in his copies from Menander, but there is
                    wonderful life and vigour, and considerable variety in the embodiment of these
                    different types by Plautus. The characters of Ballio and Pseudolus, of Euclio in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aulularia,</hi> of the two Menaechmi, and of many others
                    have a real individuality, which shows that in reproducing Greek originals
                    Plautus thoroughly realized them and animated them with the strong human nature
                    of which he himself possessed so large a share. For his plots and incidents he
                    has been much more indebted to his originals. There is a considerable sameness
                    in many of them. A large number turn upon what are called “frustrationes”
                    —tricks by which the slave who plays the principal part in the comedy succeeds
                    in extracting either from the father of his young master or from some other
                    victim a sum of money to aid his master in his love affairs. But Plautus, if not
                    more original, is more varied than Terence in his choice of plots. In some of
                    them the passion of love plays either no part or a subordinate one. He also
                    varies his scenes much more than Terence. Thus in some of his plays we find
                    ourselves at Epidamnus, at Ephesus, at Cyrene, and not always in Athens.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of the comedies according to their usual arrangement,
                    which is nearly, but not strictly alphabetical :— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphitruo,</hi><hi rend="italic">Asinaria, Aulularia, Captivi, Curculio,
                    Casina, Cistellaria, Epidicus, Bacchides, Mostellaria,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Menaechmi,</hi><hi rend="italic">Miles Gloriosus, Mercator, Pseudolus,
                    Poenulus, Persa, Rudens, Stichus, Trinummus, Truculentus.</hi> Of these the most
                    generally read, and on the whole the most interesting, are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aulularia, Captivi,</hi><hi rend="italic">Menaechmi,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Miles</hi><hi rend="italic">Gloriosus, Mostellaria, Pseudolus, Rudens,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Trinummus.</hi> Besides these the <hi rend="italic">Amphitruo,
                    Bacchides,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Stichus</hi> (although the last two are
                    incomplete) are of special interest. The <hi rend="italic">Amphitruo</hi> is
                    altogether exceptional, and gives, perhaps, as high an idea both of the comic
                    and of the imaginative power of the author as any of the others. The interest
                    attaching to it is enhanced by the fact that it has been imitated both by
                    Molière and Dryden, that attaching to the <hi rend="italic">Aulularia</hi> by
                    its having suggested the subject of <hi rend="italic">L'Avare</hi> of the French
                    dramatist, and to the <hi rend="italic">Menaechmi</hi> by the reappearance of
                    its principal motive in the <hi rend="italic">Comedy of Errors</hi> of
                    Shakespeare. The <hi rend="italic">Captivi</hi> was characterized by Lessing as
                    the best constructed drama in existence. It may be classed with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rudens</hi> as appealing to a higher and purer class of feelings,
                    and as coming nearer to the province of serious poetry, than any other extant
                    specimens of Latin comedy. The <hi rend="italic">Aulularia</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Trinummus</hi> may be mentioned along with these as bringing us
                    into contact with characters more estimable and attractive than those in the
                    great majority of the other pieces.</p>
                <p>While there are abundant good sense and good humour in the comedies of Plautus,
                    and occasional touches of pathos and elevated feeling in one or two of them,
                    there is no trace of any serious purpose behind his humorous scenes and
                    representations of character. He presents a remarkable exception to the didactic
                    and moralizing spirit which appears in most of the leading representatives of
                    Roman literature. He is to be judged on the claim <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n226/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0226-0217"/> which is put forward in the epitaph which in
                    ancient times was attributed to himself :—</p>
                <p>“Postquam est mortem aptus Plautus, comoedia luget, Scaena est deserta, dein
                    risus, ludu’ jocusque, Et numeri innumeri simul omnes conlacrumarunt.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“After Plautus died, comedy
                    mourns, the stage is deserted, then laughter, mirth, and jest, and his
                    numberless numbers all wept in concert.”</p></note></p>
                <p>He has not the more subtle and penetrating irony which we recognize in Terence,
                    in Horace, and in Petronius; still less can we attribute to him the “rigidi
                    censura cachinni” which accompanied and inspired the humorous fancies of
                    Lucilius and Juvenal. But among all the ancient humorists, with the exception of
                    Aristophanes, he must have had the power of immediately provoking the heartiest
                    and broadest mirth and laughter. He was too careless in the construction of his
                    plots to be a finished dramatic artist. He was apparently more popular among the
                    mass of his countrymen than any Roman author of any age; but to be thoroughly
                    popular he had to satisfy the tastes of an audience accustomed to the indigenous
                    farces of Italy. This is the defect, according to the judgment of educated
                    critics in the Augustan age, which Horace indicates in the line</p>
                <p>“Quantus sit Dossennus edacibus in parasitis.”</p>
                <p>But he had the most wonderful power of dramatic expression of feeling, fancy, and
                    character by means of action, rhythm, and language. In the line in which Horace
                    expresses the more favourable criticism of his time,—</p>
                <p>“Plautus ad exemplar Siculi properare Epicharmi,"— the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >properarc</hi> expresses the vivacity of gesture, dialogue, declamation, and
                    recitative in which the plays of Plautus never fail, and which must have made
                    them admirable vehicles for the art of the actor. The lyrical recitative
                    occupies a much larger place in his comedies than in those of Terence, and in
                    them he shows the true poetical gift of adapting and varying his metres in
                    accordance with the moods and fancies of his characters. But the gift for which
                    he is pre-eminent above almost every other Roman author is the vigour and
                    exuberant flow of his language. No other writer enables us to feel the life and
                    force of the Latin idiom, undisguised by the mannerisms of a literary style, in
                    the same degree. Among the masters of expression in which the prose and poetical
                    literature of Rome abounds, none was more prodigally gifted than Plautus, and
                    this gift of expression was the accompaniment of the exuberant creativeness of
                    his fancy and of the strong vitality and lively social nature which was the
                    endowment of the race to which he belonged.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the 15tlι century only the first eight plays (from <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphit rue</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Epidicus)</hi> were in
                    circulation. The other twelve were recovered in the course of that century, and
                    two new manuscripts, one of them containing the whole twenty, were discovered in
                    the following century. The Ambrosian palimpsest, discovered in 1815, has been
                    recognized ns the most trustworthy text for those plays which it preserves, and
                    it is on this that the critical labours of Ritschl have been based. His great
                    critical edition is being continued by his pupils G. Loewe, G. Götz, Fr.
                    Schoell. An edition of the plays with a commentary by Professor Usβing of
                    Copenhagen is now nearly complete. The most useful editions of separate plays
                    are those of Lorenz and Brix. (W. Y. S.)</p>
