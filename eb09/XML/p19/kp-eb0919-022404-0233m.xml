                    at Novum Comum (Como). In the first sentence of his preface he calls Catullus,
                    born at Verona, “conterraneum meum,” meaning, perhaps, a native of Gallia
                    Cisalpina, though it may be that Verona was the actual birthplace of both.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>But, as has been shrewdly
                    remarked by Mr Long, “this somewhat barbarous word is much better adapted to
                    intimate that Catullus was a fellow-countryman of Pliny than that he was a
                    fellow-townsman.”</p></note> At Comum, however, was the family estate which the
                    younger Pliny inherited from his uncle. Like his nephew, the elder Pliny had
                    seen military service, having joined the campaign in Germany under L. Pomponius
                    Secundus;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“De Vita
                    Pomponi Secundi duo (libri)” are enumerated among his uncle’s works by the
                    younger Pliny, <hi rend="italic">Ep.</hi> iii. 5, § 3, who adds, “a quo
                    singulariter amatus hoc memoriae amici quasi debitum munus exsolvit.”</p></note>
                    like him also, he had been a pleader in the law-courts, and a diligent student
                    of Greek and Roman literature. Much of his literary work was done, he tells us
                    himself, in the hours stolen from sleep. Of his many works the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naturalis Historia</hi> in thirty-seven books has alone been preserved, and in
                    a nearly complete state. This voluminous treatise professes to be an
                    encyclopaedia of Roman knowledge, mainly based on the researches and
                    speculations of the Greeks. What A. von Humboldt accomplished in our own times,
                    in his great work <hi rend="italic">Cosmos,</hi> Pliny had essayed to carry out
                    on similar principles,—but, of course, without the scientific knowledge, and
                    also without the comprehensive view of the universe which is the inheritance of
                    the present age. Pliny, we must admit, was an industrious compiler, but he was
                    not, like Aristotle, a man of original research.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He claims for himself “ingenium perquam
                    mediocre,” <hi rend="italic">Praef.</hi> § 12. His nephew (iii. 5, § 8) calls it
                    “acre ingenium,” which may mean active and energetic.</p></note></p>
                <p>In his first book, which contains a summary of the whole work, he names the
                    authors, both Greek and Latin, from which the matter of each book was
                    derived.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hence he
                    reckons the number of books at 36, the subject beginning with Book ii. The
                    matter of these, he says, comprising 20,000 points worthy of attention, he has
                    collected from the perusal of about 2000 books, and from 100 Roman authors of
                    special note (ex exquisitis auctoribus centum), <hi rend="italic">Praef.</hi> §
                    17. The first book the author regards as an appendix to the dedicatory letter or
                    preface, “Quia occupationibus tuis publico bono parcendum erat, quid singulis
                    contineretur libris huic epistulae subjunxi,” <hi rend="italic">Praef.</hi> §
                    33.</p></note> The list indeed is a surprising one, and of comparatively few
                    have we any remains. Among Roman authors he most frequently cites Cato the
                    censor, Μ. Varro, Celsus, Cornelius Nepos, Pomponius Mela, Columella; among the
                    Greeks, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Democritus, more than one Apollodorus,
                    Apollonius of Pergamum, and Hippocrates. The Latin writers he calls simply
                    “auctores;” the Greeks, of whom the list is considerably longer, are
                    “externi.”</p>
                <p>The preface, written in a rather inflated and by no means clear style, very
                    inferior to the Latini ty of the younger Pliny, is a dedication of the work in a
                    strain of extravagant adulation to Titus, who was then, as Caesar, joint emperor
                    with his father Vespasian. Pliny apologizes for dedicating to such a man a work
                    of such commonplace and hackneyed subject-matter, but he pleads the novelty of
                    the undertaking, and boasts of being the first who had attempted so
                    comprehensive a theme.</p>
                <p>The work itself commences with a pantheistic definition of the universe, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mundus,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> world and sky, and the
                    sun and stars in space. This, he says, is reasonably regarded as a
                    divinity—eternal, boundless, uncreated, and indestructible. Nature, he adds, and
                    Nature’s work are one, and to suppose there is more than one universe is to
                    believe there can be more than one Nature,—which he calls “furor.” His theology
                    is “agnostic,” or Epicurean; if there is any God, he says, it is vain to inquire
                    His form and shape; He is entirely a Being of feeling and sentiment and
                    intelligence, not of tangible existence. He believes in the “religion of
                    humanity,” according to a rather recent definition of the idea. God is what
                    Nature is; God cannot do what Nature cannot do; He cannot kill Himself, nor make
                    mortals immortal, nor raise the dead to life, nor cause one who has lived never
                    to have lived at all, or make twice ten anything else than twenty. The last
                    sentence of his work is remarkable, and is characteristic of a pagan piety which
                    takes Nature alone for its God :— “Salve, parens rerum omnium Natura, teque
                    nobis Quiritium solis celebratum esse numeris omnibus tuis fave” (xxxvii.
                    205).</p>
                <p>But, although he regarded nature as one whole, of the great doctrine of the unity
                    of nature and the tendency of all its operations to one definite end Pliny had
                    no correct idea. He had a great store of ill-digested knowledge, not only
                    imperfect in itself, but put together on no consistent plan. His style too is
                    forced and somewhat pedantic, so that to read through and understand even a
                    single book is by no means a light task.</p>
                <p>To give an outline sketch of the <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> it may
                    be said that book ii. treats of earth, stars, meteorics, and terrestrial
                    phenomena, such as earthquakes, elevation of islands, &amp;c. Books iii. to vi.
                    inclusive are devoted to a geographical account of the known <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n234/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0234-0225"/> world, in giving which the author makes no
                    mention of Strabo. Book vii. contains a physical treatise on man, his form, the
                    laws of his birth, age, mental qualities, &amp;c. Book viii. treats of the
                    larger beasts, as elephants, lions, tigers, camels, descending to i nakes,
                    crocodiles, and the smaller and domesticated animals. Book ix. includes marine
                    animals of all kinds, fishes, shells, crustaceans, sponges, &amp;c. Book x. is
                    on birds, xi. on insects,—the latter half being devoted to an anatomical
                    description of animals generally. Book xii. is on trees; xiii. on their
                    products, fruit, gums, perfumes, &amp;c.; xiv. on the grape and the making of
                    wine; xv. on the olive, fig, apple, and other luscious fruits; xvi. on forest
                    trees, canes, and reeds, kinds of timber, and different ages of trees. Book
                    xvii. treats chiefly of the culture of trees, their diseases, and the arts of
                    pruning, manuring, training, &amp;c. Book xviii. is on farming and cereal crops;
                    xix. on other kinds of produce, including horticulture; XX. on the medicinal
                    properties of plants; xxi. on flowers, bees, honey, and on botanical
                    distinctions as to leaves, thorns, and times of flowering. Book xxii. treats of
                    all kinds of herbs used in medicine and in cookery; xxiii. the medicinal
                    properties of cultivated trees; xxiv. the same of forest trees, and their useful
                    products generally. (These two books are chiefly derived from Greek authorities,
                    and include the names and properties of a vast number of species.) Books XXV. to
                    xxvii. inclusive treat of the properties of plants, and these books also are
                    chiefly from Greek sources,—Cornelius Celsus being the principal Roman
                    authority. Books xxviii. to xxx. discuss the medicinal properties residing in
                    animals; xxxi. and xxxii. those in fishes. These books are full of the most
                    extraordinary and nonsensical superstitions, including discussions on magic in
                    book XXX. Book xxxiii. is on the nature and use of the precious metals; xxxiv.
                    on the different kinds of bronze, on lead, iron, and the oxides generally. Book
                    xxxv. is on the origin and practice of painting; xxxvi. on the different kinds
                    of stone and marble, including lime, sand, and gypsum; xxxvii. on precious
                    stones.</p>
                <p>It will be observed that, though there is no scientific classification in this
                    long work, a kind of sequence, not altogether unphilosophical, is observed. The
                    amount of matter and the number of subjects treated of in each book are always
                    recorded at the end of the epitome (book i.), just before the list of authors,
                    in the formula, “Summa: reset historiae et observationes <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >mdcvi.”</hi> &amp;c.; but in the medical books, in place of <hi rend="italic"
                    >res,</hi> “subjects,” <hi rend="italic">medicinae,</hi> “prescriptions,” is
                    used. By <hi rend="italic">historiae</hi> he means “inquiries,” or “the results
                    of inquiries,” as distinguished from <hi rend="italic">observationes,</hi>
                    “remarks.”</p>
                <p>With all its faults, inevitable to the infant state of science, Pliny’s work is
                    an astounding monument of industry. It is believed to have been published about
                    two years before his death. He wrote, besides several other treatises,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Three books, in six volumes,
                    were entitled “Studiosus,” and eight books bore the title “Dubius Sermo.” To
                    this last he probably refers, <hi rend="italic">Praef.</hi> § 28,
                    “audio—Epicureos quoque parturire adversus libellos quos de grammatica
                    edidi.”</p></note> a history of the wars from the first in Germany,<note

                    the lance from horseback, “De jaculatione equestri,” is mentioned here as his
                    first work, written when he was in command of a squadron of cavalry (praefectus
                    alae).</p></note> in twenty books, and a continuation of the history of Aufidius
                    Bassus down to his own times, in thirty-one books —all now lost.</p>
                <p>He is said to have been a great student, an early riser, abstemious and temperate
                    in his meals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pliny, <hi

                    8-10.</p></note> In his later days he appears to have grown somewhat unwieldy
                    and asthmatic, for Pliny the younger, in describing his uncle’s death by
                    suffocation from the fumes in the eruption of Vesuvius, 79 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> says that his breathing “propter amplitudinem corporis gravior et
                    sonantior erat.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Eρist.</hi> vi. 16, § 13,</p></note> Pliny’s intimate friendship
                    with Vespasian may be inferred from his custom of attending the morning levée;
                    he seems to have first known him in the German wars in the time of Claudius.</p>
                <p>Besides his published works, the elder Pliny left, as his nephew tells us, one
                    hundred and sixty note-books of extracts (electorum commentarios clx.), written
                    in a very small hand on both sides of the page. So valuable were these volumes
                    considered that Pliny assured his nephew he could have sold them in Spain for
                    £3500, even before the full number had been made up. He acted as procu rator in
                    Spain in 71, and was recalled to Rome by the death of his brother-in-law Caius
                    Caecilius, who by will appointed him guardian of the younger Pliny. At the time
                    of his death, the elder Pliny had the command of the Roman fleet at Misenum. He
                    fell a victim to his imprudent curiosity in advancing within the range of the
                    thickly-falling ashes during the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>Pliny’s influence on the nomenclature and the popular ideas about common objects
                    long continued to be very extensive, and survived till the dawn of the age of
                    more exact science. The knowledge he gives us of the writings and opinions of so
                    large a number of lost authors opens a view of the whole cycle of the science of
                    the period.</p>
                <p>The best editions of the <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi> are those by
                    Julius Sillig (Leipsic, 1831-36, in 5 vols. 12mo), and by Louis Janus (Teubner,
                    Leipsic, 1854-59, in 6 vols.), which is virtually a revised reprint of it, the
                    whole of the last volume being occupied with copious and accurate indices of
                    authors and subjects. These may be called critical editions; two French editions
                    with scientific commentaries had preceded,—by Hardouin (1685 and 1723), and by
                    Panckoucke (1829-33), in twenty volumes with a French translation. (F. A.
