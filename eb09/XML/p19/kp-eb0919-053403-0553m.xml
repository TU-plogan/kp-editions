                    the north and west, Landport on the north, and Southsea on the east. Portsmouth
                    proper is the barrack and garrison town; at Portsea is situated the great naval
                    dockyard; Landport is occupied chiefly by the houses of artisans; and Southsea,
                    as possessing facilities for bathing, is resided in by the wealthier classes.
                    The old High Street of Portsmouth, which is now continuous with the Commercial
                    Road from the Landport side, forms a spacious and busy central thoroughfare 2
                    miles in length, with numerous fine buildings, including the new and old
                    post-office, the new offices of the Waterworks Company and Gas Company, the
                    Central or Town Railway station, the new Government House with its
                    pleasuregrounds, the quaint old building occupied by the new free library, and
                    the grammar-school, which was founded in 1732, though the new building was
                    opened in 1879. Since the demolition of the ancient ramparts and unwholesome
                    moats a few years ago there have sprung up a handsome people’s park and
                    recreation grounds for the naval and military forces, and improvements are still
                    being vigorously carried forward. Much of the Government work has been done by
                    convict labour, notably at the north-east of Landport, where 1300 convicts have
                    been engaged in the formation of a new island (Whale Island), on which gunnery
                    experiments are carried out in connexion with the training-ships of the gunnery
                    school. The towns constitute one of the strongest fortresses of the kingdom,
                    being protected by a chain of detached forts, the outer line of which on the
                    land side north of the harbour extends along the Portsdown Ridge, the inner line
                    protecting the approach by Stokes Bay and Gosport on the west side, while
                    eastwards are the Hilsea lines, within which are also the Royal Artillery and
                    cavalry barracks of Hilsea and the powder-magazine of Tipner. On the south side
                    the forts are built in the sea, each being provided with an Artesian well sunk
                    into the seabed, from which a plentiful supply of fresh water can at all times
                    be obtained. The coast to the eastward is lined by the forts of “Cumberland” and
                    “Southsea Castle,” which complete the circle. There are 8 barracks—5 in
                    Portsmouth, 1 in Southsea, and 2 in Portsea—and at Eastney are the extensive
                    buildings which constitute the headquarters of the Royal Marine Artillery; on
                    the Gosport side of the harbour are those of the Portsmouth division of the
                    Royal Marines. In the church of St Thomas a Becket (12th cent.) the chancel and
                    transepts form part of the original structure; the nave and tower were erected
                    in 1698. The garrison chapel near the grand parade, in the Early English style,
                    formed originally a portion of the hospital of St Nicholas (1212), and was
                    restored in 1866. Among more recent buildings may be mentioned the new jail and
                    county lunatic asylum, both situated on the outskirts. In the centre of the town
                    and adjoining the people’s park are the new cathedral and buildings of the Roman
                    Catholic schools, the new Presbyterian church, the seamen and marines orphan
                    schools, the offices of the board of guardians and the borough overseers. At
                    Portsea a new railway station has been <pb break="no"

                    Besides these, amongst other public buildings may be mentioned the town-hall,
                    the county court, and the theatre. At Portsea is Aria College, opened in 1874
                    for the training of Jewish ministers. In the same town is situated the convict
                    prison, which superseded the hulks in 1852. Landport has a freemasons’ hall
                    (1879-80), and a people’s park of eight acres opened in 1878. Southsea, which is
                    only of recent origin, possesses assembly-rooms and baths, a pier (1879), and a
                    fine esplanade 2 miles in length. Southsea Castle, built by Henry VIII., was
                    taken by the Parliamentary forces in 1642 and partly dismantled, but it has now
                    been refortified. The creek which formerly separated Portsmouth and Portsea was
                    filled up in 1876.</p>
                <p>The port of Portsmouth extends eastwards 9 miles to Emsworth, and westwards 5
                    miles to Hill Head at the entrance to Southampton Water. About 3 miles to the
                    south of the harbour is the well-known anchorage of Spithead, protected by the
                    Isle of Wight. The harbour, one of the best in the kingdom, stretches 4 miles
                    inwards to the north-west of the town, with an entrance 220 yards in breadth,
                    permitting access to vessels of the largest tonnage at low tide. There is an
                    anchorage within the basin at low tide of 380 acres, and a portion of the
                    harbour is permanently occupied by dismantled vessels and the reserved fleet of
                    the navy. There is a graving-dock built by the corporation, with 18 feet of
                    water on the blocks, and a patent slip. Extending along the eastern shore are
                    the ordnance gun wharf between Portsmouth and Portsea and to the north of it the
                    great naval Government dockyard, which has lately been much enlarged (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dockyard,</hi> vol. vii. 313). At <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gosport</hi> (7.v.)are the royal Clarence victualling yard and the Haslar
                    hospital. Portsmouth has a considerable trade in coal, timber, fruits, and
                    agricultural produce. In 1883 the total number of vessels that entered the port
                    from British and foreign possessions and coastwise was 2094 of 210,210 tons
                    burden, the number that cleared 2079 of 216,926 tons. The borough of Portsmouth
                    is governed by a mayor, fourteen aidermen, and forty-two councillors. The area
                    of the borough is 4320 acres, with a population in 1871 of 113,569, and in 1881
                    of 127,989. Of the latter number 120,022 were included in Portsea.</p>
                <p>To the north of Portsmouth harbour is Porchester Castle, a ruined Norman fortress
                    occupying the site of the <hi rend="italic">Portus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Magnus</hi> of the Romans. The <hi rend="italic">Saxon Chronicle</hi> mentions
                    the arrival of Port and his two sons on the coast in 501, but the derivation of
                    the name Portsmouth is too evident to require a mythical invention to explain
                    it. Portsmouth, though a small town soon after the Norman invasion, did not
                    possess a church till 1140. It received its first charter from Richard I. In the
                    beginning of the 13th century it had grown to be a naval station of some
                    importance, and for the accommodation of the king’s galleys the docks were
                    enclosed by a strong wall. A large portion of the town was burned by the French
                    in 1372. Great additions were made to the fortifications by Edward IV., and the
                    works were continued by later sovereigns, especially Elizabeth and James II. Its
                    importance as a naval dockyard commences about 1544. The English fleet assembled
                    at Portsmouth in 1545 before the naval engagement with the French off Spithead.
                    In 1628 Villiers, duke of Buckingham, when on the point of embarking at
                    Portsmouth with the army for the relief of Rochelle, was killed by Felton. The
                    town was taken by the Parliamentary forces in 1642. In 1662 the nuptials of
                    Charles II. with Catherine of Braganza were celebrated at Portsmouth in the
                    chapel of the garrison. In 1782 the “Royal George,” with Admiral Kem-penfeldt on
                    board, having been careened to stop a leak, went down in the harbour. About 1792
                    Portsea began to be built on the common to the north of the town. Among eminent
                    persons connected with the town mention may be made of Charles Dickens, Jonas
                    Hanway, Sir Isambard Brunel, Sir F. Malden.</p>
