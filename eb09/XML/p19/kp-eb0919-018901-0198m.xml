                    original investigations of Plateau refer chiefly to portions of one or other of
                    two branches of science—physiological optics and molecular forces. His doctoral
                    thesis (Liège, 1829) had for its subject “Impressions produced by Light on the
                    Organs of Vision”; and it was succeeded by numerous memoirs, some of much value,
                    on the persistence of visual impressions, subjective impressions of colour,
                    irradiation, &amp;c. Among other results of his studies was the invention of the
                    philosophical toy known as the “thaumatrope.” We owe to him also something much
                    more important, the process of studying the motion of a vibrating body by
                    looking at it through equidistant radial slits in a revolving disk. In 1829 he
                    imprudently gazed at the midday sun for 20 seconds, with the view of studying
                    the after effects. The result was blindness for some days, succeeded by a
                    temporary recovery; but for the next fourteen years his sight gradually
                    deteriorated, and in 1843 he became permanently blind. This calamity did not
                    interrupt his scientific activity. Aided by his wife and son, and afterwards by
                    his son-in-law Van der Mensbrugghe, he continued to the end of his life his
                    researches on vision,—directing the course of the experiments which they made
                    for him, and interpreting the bearing of the results. He also published a
                    valuable analytical catalogue of all the more important memoirs which had been
                    written, from the earliest times to the end of the 18th century, on his
                    favourite theme of subjective visual phenomena. But even more extraordinary were
                    this blind man’s investigations about molecular forces, embracing hundreds of
                    novel experiments whose results he saw only with others’ eyes. These form the
                    subject of his great work <hi rend="italic">Statique expérimentale et théorique
                    des Liquides soumis aux seules Forces moléculaires</hi> (2 vols., 1873), which
                    is a valuable contribution to our knowledge of the phenomena usually called
                    capillary. To avoid, as far as possible, complications due to gravity, Plateau
                    employed either films formed of a solution of soap with glycerin, or masses of
                    oil suspended in a mixture of alcohol and water of the same density as the oil.
