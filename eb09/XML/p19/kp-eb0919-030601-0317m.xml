                <p><label type="entry">POLAND, <hi rend="smallcaps">Russian</hi></label>. After the
                    three dismemberments of the old kingdom, the name of Poland was chiefly retained
                    by the part of the divided territory annexed to Russia. Since the insurrection
                    of 1863, however, the name “kingdom of Poland” has disappeared. Thenceforward
                    this portion of the Russian empire is referred to in official documents only as
                    the “territory of the Vistula,” and later on as the “Vistula governments.”
                    Nevertheless the geographical position of Russian Poland, its ethnographical
                    features, its religion, and its traditions differentiate it so widely from the
                    remainder of the Russian empire that the name of Poland still survives in
                    current use. The area of this territory is 49,157 square miles, and the
                    population exceeds 7,300,000. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Russia,</hi> and map
                    accompanying that article.</p>
                <p>Projecting to the west of Russia in a wide semicircle between Prussia and
                    Austria, it is bounded on the N. by the provinces of western and eastern
                    Prussia, on the W. by Posen and Prussian Silesia, on the S. by Galicia, and on
                    the E. by the Russian governments of Volhynia, Vilna, Grodno, and Kovno. It
                    consists for the most part of an undulating plain, 300 to 450 feet above the
                    sea, which joins the lowlands of Brandenburg in the west, and the great plain of
                    central Russia in the east. A low swelling separates it from the Baltic Sea;
                    while in the south it gradually rises to a range of plateaus which imperceptibly
                    blend with the spurs of the Carpathians. These plateaus, with an average height
                    of from 800 to 1000 feet, occupy all the southern part of Poland. They are
                    mostly covered with beautiful forests of oak, beech, and lime, and are deeply
                    cut by the valleys of rivers and numerous streams, some being narrow and craggy,
                    and others broad, with gentle slopes and marshy bottoms. Narrow ravines
                    intersect them in all directions, and their surface often takes, especially in
                    the east, the <hi rend="italic">puszcza</hi> character,—in other words, that of
                    wild, impassable, woody, and marshy tracts. In these tracts, which occupy the
                    south-eastern corner of Poland, and are called Podlasie, the neighbourhood of
                    the Polyesie of the Pripet is felt. The Vistula, which borders these plateaus on
                    the south-west, at a height of 700 to 750 feet, has to penetrate them before
                    finding its way to the great plain of Poland, and thence to the Baltic. Its
                    valley divides the hilly tracts of Poland into two parts,—the Lublin heights in
                    the east, and the Sçdomierz (Sandomir), or central, heights in the west. These
                    last are diversified by several ridges which run east-south-east, parallel to
                    the Beskides, the highest of them being those of the “Bald” or “Holy Cross
                    Mountains” (Eysogôrski, or Swiçtokrzyski), two summits of which respectively
                    reach 1813 and 1961 feet above the sea. Another short ridge, the Chçcinski
                    hills, follows the same direction along the Nida river, reaching 1135 feet at
                    Zamkowa Gôra. South of the Nida, the Olkusz Hills, already blended with spurs of
                    the Beskides, fill up the south-west corner of Poland, reaching 1473 feet at
                    Podzamcze, and containing the chief mineral wealth of the country; while a
                    fourth range, from 1000 to 1300 feet high, runs north-west past Czçstochowo,
                    separating the Oder from the Warta. In the north, the plain of Poland is
                    bordered by a flat and broad swelling, 600 to 700 feet above the sea, dotted
                    with lakes, and recalling the lake regions of north-western Russia. Its gentle
                    southern slopes occupy the northern parts of Poland, while the province of
                    Suwatki, projecting as a spur towards the north-east, extends over the flat
                    surface of this swelling. Wide tracts covered with sands, marshes, peat-bogs,
                    ponds, and small lakes, among which the streams lazily flow from one marsh to
                    another, the whole being covered with poor pine-forests and a scanty vegetation,
                    with occasional patches of fertile soil—such are the general characters of the
                    northern border-region of the great plains of central Poland.</p>
                <p>These plains extend in a broad belt, 150 miles wide, from the Oder to the upper
                    Niemen and the marshes of Pinsk, gently sloping towards the west, and slowly
                    rising towards “the woods” of Volhynia and Grodno. Few hills raise their flat
                    tops above the surface, the irregularities of which for the most part escape the
                    eye, and can be detected only by levellings. As far as the eye can see, it
                    perceives a plain; and each hill, though but a few hundred feet above its
                    surface, is called a “gôra” (mountain). The rivers flow in broad, level valleys,
                    only a few hundred or even only a few dozen feet lower than the watersheds; they
                    separate into, many branches, enclosing islands, forming creeks, and covering
                    wide tracts of land during inundations. Their basins, especially in the west,
                    are mixed up with one another in the most intricate way, the whole bearing
                    unmistakable traces of having been in recent geological and partly in historical
                    times the bottom of extern <pb break="no"

                    rich crops. The fertility of the soil and the facility of communication by land
                    and by water have made this plain the very cradle of the Polish nationality, and
                    every furlong of it to the Pole is rich in historical memories. The very name of
                    Poland is derived from it,—Wielkopolska and Wielkopolane being the Slavonian for
                    the great plain and its inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Russian Poland belongs mostly, though not entirely, to the basin of the
                    Vistula,—its western parts extending into the upper basin of the Warta, a
                    tributary of the Oder, and its north-east spur (Suwatki) penetrating into the
                    basin of the Niemen, of which it occupies the left bank. For many centuries,
                    however, the Poles have been driven back from the mouths of their rivers by the
                    German race, maintaining only the middle parts of their basins.</p>
                <p>The chief river of Poland, and the very cradle of the Polish nationality, is the
                    Vistula (Pol., <hi rend="italic">Wisla),</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Vandalus,
                    Visula,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Istula</hi> of antiquity. It has a length of
                    620 miles, and a drainage area of 72,000 square miles. It rises in Galicia, in
                    the Beskides, 3675 feet above the sea, where the Black and White Vistulas unite.
                    Flowing first north-east, in an elevated valley between the Beskides and the
                    Sandomir heights, it separates Russian Poland from Galicia, and already at
                    Cracow has a breadth of 90 yards. It enters Russian Poland at Zawichwost, 473
                    feet above the sea. After having received the San, it turns north, traversing
                    for some 35 miles a broad valley deeply cut through the plateaus of southern
                    Poland. This valley reaches at several places a width of 10 miles» between the
                    limestone crags which border it on both sides, the space between being occupied
                    by two alluvial terraces, where the river winds freely, divides into several
                    branches, and frequently changes its bed. Here it has a speed of 8 feet per
                    second, with a gradient of 1 ’ 3 to 1 ’ 5 feet per mile, and a depth ranging
                    from 4 to 20 feet. About Jusefow (51° N. lat. ) it enters the great central
                    plain, where it flows north and west-north-west between low banks, with a
                    breadth of 1000 yards. Its inundations, dangerous even at Cracow, become still
                    more so in the plain, where the accumulations of ice in its loiVer course
                    obstruct the outflow, or the heavy rains in the Carpathians raise its level.
                    Dams, 20 to 24 feet high, are maintained at great expense by the inhabitants for
                    60 miles, but they do not always prevent the river from inundating the plains of
                    Opolic and Kozienic, the waters sometimes spreading as far as 150 miles to the
                    east. Below Warsaw (267 feet) it frequently changes its bed, so that, for
                    example, Ptock (180 feet), which formerly was on its left bank, is now on the
                    right. About Thom it enters Prussia, and a few miles below this town it finds
                    its way through the Baltic ridge, flowing in a north-east direction and entering
                    the Baltic Sea in the Frische-Haff at Dantzic. On the whole, it is what the
                    physical geographer would call a “young” river, which is still excavating its
                    bed, and probably on this account few towns of importance are situated on the
                    Vistula in Russian Poland, thé principal being Sçdomierz, Warsaw, and Ptock, and
                    the fortresses of Ivangorod and Novogeorgievsk (Modlin), while very many small
                    towns have sprung up within short distances from its course. It is navigable
                    almost from Cracow for small boats and rafts, which descend it at high water.
                    Real navigation begins, however, only below its confluence with the Wieprz, the
                    middle and lower Vistula being the chief artery for the traffic of Poland.
                    Thousands of rafts and boats of all descriptions descend every year, with
                    cargoes of corn, wool, timber, and wooden wares, giving occupation to a large
                    number of men. Steamers ply as far as to S⅞domierz.</p>
                <p>The Vistula receives many tributaries, the most important being the San, the
                    Wieprz, and the Bug on the right, and the Nida and the Pilica on the left. The
                    San (220 miles) rises in Galicia, in the same part of the Carpathians as the
                    Dneister, and flows north-west, close to the southern frontier of Poland; it is
                    navigable downwards from Dynow, and is ascended by boats as far as Yarostaw in
                    Galicia. The Wieprz (180 miles) is the chief artery of the Lublin government; it
                    flows north-west past Lublin and Lubartow, joining the Vistula at Ivangorod. It
                    is navigable for small boats and rafts for 105 miles from Krasnostaw. The Bug,
                    which describes a wide curve concentric with those of the middle Vistula and
                    Narew, rises to the east of Lwow (Lemberg) and flows north and west, past
                    Hrubieszow, Chetm, and Brest-Litowski, separating the Polish provinces of Lublin
                    and Siedlce from Volhynia and Grodno. It joins the Vistula a few miles below its
                    confluence with the Narew, some 20 miles below Warsaw, after a course of more
                    than 675 miles. Only light boats <hi rend="italic">(galary)</hi> are floated
                    down this broad but shallow stream, whose flat and open valley is often
                    inundated. Its great tributary, the Narew (150 miles), brings the forest-lands
                    of Byelowezha into communication with Poland, timber being floated down from
                    Surazh and light boats from Tykocin. The mountain-stream Nida waters the hilly
                    tracts of Kielce, and, rapidly descending south-east, joins the Vistula close by
                    the Opatowiec custom-house. The Pilica rises in the southwestern corner of
                    Poland, and flows for 135 miles north and east in a broad, flat, sandy, or
                    marshy valley, of evil repute for its unhealthiness; it joins the Vistula at
                    Mniszew, 30 miles above Warsaw.</p>
                <p>The Warta (450 miles) rises in the Chçstochowo hills, 900 feet above the sea, and
                    flows north and west past Sieradz (448 feet) and Koto. Below Czestochowo it
                    waters a flat lowland, whose surface rises only from 2 to 5 feet above the level
                    of the river, and the inhabitants have a constant struggle to keep it to its
                    bed; the country is, however, so low that every spring an immense lake is formed
                    by the river at the mouth of the Ner; as regards its right hand tributaries, it
                    is almost impossible to define them from those of the Bzura, tributary of the
                    Vistula, amidst the marshy grounds where both take their origin. The Warta turns
                    west at Koto and leaves Poland at Pyzdry in the government of Kalisz; it serves
                    to convey timber to Prussia.</p>
                <p>The Niemen, which has a total length of 500 miles and a basin of 40,000 square
                    miles, flows along the north-east frontier of Poland, from Grodno to Yurburg,
                    separating it from Lithuania. Already 70 yards wide at Grodno, it advances
                    northwards in great windings, between limestone hills covered with sand, or
                    amidst forests, past numerous ruins of castles, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >koorgans,</hi> which witness the battles that have been fought for its
                    possession. The yellowish sandy plains on its left allow only the cultivation of
                    oats, buckwheat, and some rye. The river flows so slowly below Kovno as to seem
                    almost stationary; it often changes its bed, and, notwithstanding repeated
                    attempts to regulate it, offers great difficulties to navigation. Still, large
                    amounts of corn, wool, and timber are floated down, especially after its
                    junction with the Black Hancza, giving occupation to about 90,000 men. A little
                    above Kovno the Niemen turns west, and after having received the Wilja from the
                    right, it attains a width of nearly 500 yards. At Yurburg it enters eastern
                    Prussia, and reaches the Baltic Sea at the Kurische-Haff. Of its tributaries in
                    Poland, only the Hancza Czarna and the Szeszupa, which winds through the
                    province of Suwatki, are worthy of mention.</p>
                <p>Lakes are numerous in the province of Suwatki, amounting there to over five
                    hundred; but the largest of them, Wigry, traversed by the Hancza, covers only
                    11,000 acres. They are mostly concealed amid thick coniferous or birch forests,
                    and their waters stretch with undefined banks amidst marshes, sands, or layers
                    of boulders thickly covered with moss. Another group of some one hundred and
                    twenty small lakes is situated in the basin of the Warta (north part of Kalisz),
                    the largest being Gopto, 18 miles long and 100 feet deep, surrounded by many
                    smaller lakes, and receiving the Noted river. It was much larger even within
                    historical times, and was well known from being situated on the highλvay from
                    the Adriatic, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Koto on the Oder, to the basin of the
                    Vistula.</p>
                <p>Though navigable for a few months only, the rivers of Poland have always been of
                    considerable importance for the traffic of the country, and this importance is
                    further increased by several canals connecting them with Russian and German
                    rivers. The Niemen is connected with the Dnieper by the Oginski Canal, situated
                    in the Russian government of Minsk. The Dnieper-and-Bug (Horodecki, Brzeski,
                    also Krolewski) Canal in Grodno connects the Mukhavets, tributary of the Bug,
                    with the Pina of the basin of the Pripet, that is, the Dnieper with the Vistula.
                    The Vistula is connected also with the Oder by the Bydgoski or Bromberg Canal in
                    Prussia, which connects the Brda, of the basin of the Vistula, with the Noted,
                    or Netze, tributary of the Warta. All these canals are, however, beyond Russian
                    Poland. In Poland proper, the Àugustowski Canal connects the Vistula with the
                    Niemen, by means of the Hancza, Netta, Biebrz, and Narew. Another canal, to the
                    west of Lçezyca, connects the Bzura, a tributary of the Vistula, with the Ner
                    and Warta; and the bed of the former has recently been altered so as to obtain
                    regular irrigation of the rich meadows extending along its banks.</p>
                <p>With the exception of its southern parts, Poland is built up almost exclusively
                    of Secondary and Tertiary formations, covered with a thick sheet of Quaternary
                    deposits. The non-schistous rocks are represented only by a small patch of
                    porphyries near Chçcin, and another of basalts at the castle of T⅛czyfiski.
                    Small deposits of quartzites in the Dyminski Hills, characterized by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Orthis kielcensis,</hi> Röm., which formerly were considered as

                    the Devon .an Old Red Sandstone and limestones. The last two cover wide tracts
                    in the province of Kielce, and in the district of Bedzin, on the Silesian
                    frontier. The Devonian limestones of Kielce, which contain the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Carboniferous formation appears in the Olkusz and Bedzin districts.
                    It'consists of sandstones and clays, with layers of’ coal 30 feet thick. The

                    the red sandstones in the most northern parts of the Kielce mountains. The
                    “Muschelkalk” appears in the districts of Olkusz and Bçdzin, as also in the
                    Kielce mountains, and has great importance, containing as it does zinc, tin, and
                    iron ores. The “Keuper” in the governments of Kielce, Piotrkow, and Radom
                    consists of sandstones, dolomites, and limestones, and contains brown coal and
                    iron ores.</p>
                <p>The Jurassic formation is widely spread; in south-west Poland it occupies the
                    space from Olkusz to Wielun, and consists of brown and white “Jura.” the whitish
                    crags of which give pleasing landscapes at Ojcowo and on the Pilica. The Oolite
                    crags of Ojcowo contain numerous caverns, renowned for their bone deposits,
                    worked out for manure, and for their numerous and remarkable Quaternary fossils.
                    That of Jerzmanowice, close by Ojcowo, the largest of the series, has a length
                    of 750 feet. The Cretaceous formation, which covers very large tracts throughout
                    Poland, consists of lower series of sandstones, and of an upper series
                    containing chalk and limestone, and yielding very fertile marls. They are
                    covered with Tertiary limestones and gypsums, which, together with Cretaceous
                    deposits, cover nearly the whole of the central plain and the northern
                    provinces. The layers of sulphur at Kielce, 7 to 70 feet thick, belong to the
                    Tertiary.</p>
                <p>The whole is covered with Quaternary deposits, reaching at several places a very
                    great thickness. They are chiefly made up of boulder clay containing
                    Scandinavian erratics of all sizes up to 5 and 7 feet in diameter. The Baltic
                    ridge is quite covered with them, their southern limit extending to 51° N. lat.,
                    or perhaps even to 50°, as the longitudinal valleys of the Kielce hills also
                    contain layers of Scandinavian boulders. Diluvial and alluvial sands and clays
                    cover the glacial deposits; and everywhere in Poland one meets with remains of
                    extensive lakes that filled up all depressions of the country during the
                    post-Glacial period. Thick peat-bogs are being formed in the moister
                    depressions, and cover an aggregate surface of no less than 2,800,000 acres.</p>
                <p>In these lacustrine deposits numerous traces of prehistoric man have been found,
                    but the old lake beds still await a more thorough exploration. The bone-caves at
                    Ojcowo have yielded rich finds of extinct mammals, thirty-two species of which
                    are familiar to explorers of British caverns; the cave-bear alone has yielded
                    fully four thousand canine teeth, while the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the
                    cave hyaena, and especially the reindeer, are represented by numerous remains.
                    The bones of extinct mammals have been found in association with very numerous
                    relics of man, some of which are most probably Palaeolithic, while the great
                    number belong to the Neolithic period,—those cave-inhabitants being in some
                    instances dolichocephalic, like those of the shores of postGlacial lakes, and in
                    others mesocephalic.</p>
                <p>Southern Poland is rich in minerals, especially in the Kielce mountains and the
                    region adjacent to Pnιssian Silesia. The Devonian sandstones contain malachite
                    ores at Medziana Gora, near Kielce, and copper has been worked there since the
                    15th century. In the years 1816-1826 65,000 cwts. of copper ore were extracted,
                    but the mines are now neglected. The brown iron orcs, also Devonian, of Kielce,
                    and especially those of Daleszyc, contain no less than 40 per cent, of iron. The
                    Triassic zinc ores of the Olkusz district, more than 50 feet thick at Bolestaw,
                    contain 8 to 14 per cent., sometimes 25 per cent., of zinc; ami in 1879
                    2,866,000 cwts. of ore were extracted from nine pits, yielding about 100,000
                    cwts. of zinc. The tin ores of Olkusz, also Triassic, are still more important,
                    and were extensively wrought as early as the 16th century, notwithstanding the
                    difficulties arising from the presence of water; they are reported to have then
                    yielded more than 35,000 cwts. per annum. In 1878 the very fluctuating yield
                    reached only 8960 cwts. Brown iron ores appearing in the neighbourhood of Bçdzin
                    as lenses 55 feet thick, and containing 25 to 33 per cent, of iron, accompany
                    the Triassic zinc ores. Spherosiderites and brown iron ores are also widely
                    spread in the “Keuper.” Sulphur is wrought at Czarkowa, in the district of
                    Pificzow; the deposits, which contain 25 per cent, of sulphur, reach a thickness
                    of 7 to 70 feet, and the amount of sulphuris estimated at 1,300,000 cwts.</p>
                <p>Carboniferous coal is spread in south-west Poland over a surface of about 200
                    square miles in the districts of Bedzin and Olkusz, which are estimated to
                    contain 732,000,000 cubic yards of coal. The Triassic brown coal, which appears
                    in the Olkusz district in layers 3 to 7 feet thick, has lately been worked out,
                    the single pit of St John yielding in 1879 204,200 cwts. of coal. Of other
                    mineral produce, chalκ exported from Lublin, a few quarries of marble, and many
                    of building stones are worthy of notice. Mineral waters are used medicinally at
                    Ciechocin and Natçchow.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the Lysa Gora hilly tracts (Kielce and South Radom), which
                    lie within the isotherms of 41° and 42°, Poland is situated between the
                    isotherms of 42° and 46°. The isotheres and isocheims <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> lines of equal mean summer and winter temperature) crossing one
                    another at right angles, and the former running east-north-east, Poland is
                    included between the isotheres of 64® and 61° and the isocheims of 35° 7 and 39°
                    ’ 2. The prevailing winds are westerly, with north-north-east and south winds in
                    autumn and winter, and east winds in spring. The number of rainy and snowy days
                    varies from 152 to 158, increasing towards the Baltic, with an average of 217 to
                    23 ’ 6 inches of rainfall in central Poland, which figures slowly increase also
                    towards the south on account of the proximity of the Carpathians, where they
                    reach 30 ’ 3 inches. Of the above amounts, about 17 per cent, fell in spring, 29
                    per cent, in summer, 21 per cent, in autumn, and 33 per cent, in winter. Owing
                    to this distribution the snow-covering in Poland is not very thick, and the
                    spring sets in early. Still, frosts lowering the thermometer to - 4° and - 22°
                    Fahr, are not uncommon, and the rivers are covered with ice for two and a half
                    to three months,—the Warta being under ice for 70 to 80 days, the Vistula at
                    Warsaw for 80 days and (exceptionally) even for 116, and the Niemen for 100
                    (exceptionally for 140).</p>

                    Poland :—</p>

                    extends from the Carpathians tc 52° N. lat., and three degrees farther north in
                    small groups oι isolated specimens; the confluence of the Bug and Narew may
                    still be regarded as its eastern limit. The white beech (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Carpinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Betulus),</hi> the aspen <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Populus tremula),</hi> and two elms <hi rend="italic">(Ulmus

                    found nearly everywhere, mingled with other trees iι forests. The same is true
                    with regard to the lime-tree (<hi rend="italic">Tilia parvi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">folia),</hi> which appears in groves only in the east (Niemen,
                    Pripet <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> Lublin). It is the most popular tree with
                    the Poles, as the bιrcl with the Russians; judgment of old was pronounced under
                    its shade, and all the folk-lore songs repeat its name. The oak— <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> highly venerated tree in Poland, though not so much as in
                    Lithuania—grows in forests only on the most fertile patches oi land, but it is
                    of common occurrence in conjunction with th« beech, elm, &amp;c. The maples <hi

                    trees—apple, pear, plum, and cherry—are cultivated everywhere.</p>

                <p>The wheat frontier coincides very nearly with that of the leafbearing forests. It
                    yields good crops on the fertile tracts of Sandomeria and Lublin, and on the
                    plains of the Vistula and Wartha, but does not thrive very well beyond 52° N.

                    in the east; hops are very common, and tobacco-culture has been begun in the
                    south. Some attempts in sericulture have been made with success.</p>
                <p>The fauna of Poland belongs to the middle European zoological group; within the

                    later in the forests of Lithuania. The wild goat, bison, and elk have migrated
                    to the Lithuanian forests. The lynx and beaver have also disappeared. The brown
                    bear continues to haunt the forests of the south, but is becoming rarer in
                    Poland; the wolf, the wild boar, and the fox are most common throughout the
                    great plain, as also the hare and several species of <hi rend="italic"

                    avi-fauna, which does not differ from that of central Europe, is represented by
                    some one hundred and twenty species, among which the singing birds <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dentirostrae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Conirostrae)</hi> are the
                    most numerous. On the whole, Poland lies to the westward of the great line of
                    passage of the migratory birds, and is less frequented by them than the steppes
                    of south-west Russia. Still, numerous aquatic birds breed on the waters of the
                    Baltic lake-region.</p>

                <p>The bulk of the population are Poles. During prehistoric times the basin of the
                    Vistula seems to have been inhabited by a dolichocephalic race, different from
                    the brachycephalic Poles of the present day; but from the dawn of history the
                    Slavonians (Poles), mixed to some extent with Lithuanians, are found on the
                    plains of the Vistula and Warta. The purest Polish type is found in the basin of
                    the middle Vistula and in Posen; in the north-east there is a Lithuanian
                    admixture, and in the south-east a Little Russian. The geographical domain of
                    the Poles corresponds approximately with the limits of Russian Poland. Some
                    250,000 Lithuanians (277,000 or 284,000, according to other enumerations) occupy
                    the north part of Suwaiki, their southern limit being the Hancza river and the
                    towns Seino and Suwatki; while the Ruthenians (about 506,000 in 1873) appear in
                    compact masses in the east and southeast, occupying the whole space between the
                    Bug and the Wieprz as far as Siedlce, as also the region between the upper
                    Wieprz and the San. The White Russians numbered 27,000 in the north-east and
                    east, and the Great Russians 12,000. The Poles extend but little beyond the
                    limits of Russian Poland. In east Prussia they occupy the southern slope of the
                    Baltic ridge (the Mazurs); and on the left bank of the lower Vistula they spread
                    to its mouth (the Kaszubes). Westward they occupy a strip of land of an average
                    breadth of 50 miles in Brandenburg, Posen, and Silesia, stretching down the
                    Warta as far as to Birnbaum (100 miles east of Berlin); and in the south they
                    extend along the right bank of the Vistula in western Galicia to the San. In
                    Russia they constitute, with Jews, Lithuanians, Ruthenians, and White Russians,
                    the town population, as also the landed nobility and <hi rend="italic"

                <p>According to the localities which they inhabit, the Poles take different names.
                    They are called Wielkopolanie on the plains of middle Poland, while the name of
                    Matopolanie is reserved for those on the Warta. The name of Lçczycanie is given
                    to the inhabitants of the marshes of the Ner, that of Kurpie to those of the
                    Podlasie; Kujawiacy, Sz⅛cy in Silesia, and G6rale in the Carpathians.</p>
                <p>The Kaszubes, and especially the Mazurs, may be considered as separate stocks of
                    the Polish family. The Mazurs (whose northern limits may be thus
                    described—Przerosl in Suwatki, Goldap, Rastenburg, and Bischofsburg in Prussia,
                    and Mlawa in Ptock) are distinguished from the Poles by their lower stature,
                    broad shoulders, and massive structure, and still more by their national dress,
                    which has nothing of the smartness of that of the southern Poles, and by their
                    ancient customs; they have also a dialect of their own, containing many words
                    now obsolete in Poland, and several grammatical forms bearing witness to the
                    Lithuanian influence. They submit without difficulty to German influence, and
                    already are Lutherans in Prussia. The language of the Kaszubes can also be
                    considered as a separate dialect. The Poles proper are on the whole of medium
                    stature (5 feet 4 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 inches), finely built, dark
                    in the south and fair in the north, richly endowed by nature, inclined to deeds
                    of heroism, but perhaps deficient in that energy which characterizes the
                    northern races of Europe, and in that sense of unity which has been the strength
                    of their present rulers.</p>
                <p>The German element is annually increasing both in number and in influence,
                    especially during the last twenty years. The Lodz manufacturing district, the
                    Polish Birmingham, is becoming more German than Polish; and throughout the
                    provinces west of the Vistula German immigration is going on at a steadily
                    increasing rate, especially in the governments of Ptock, Kalisz, Piotrkôw, and
                    Warsaw. It is estimated that a strip of land 35 miles wide along the Prussian
                    frontier is already in the hands of Germans, whose advance is further favoured
                    by the rapid transference of landed property into German hands in Posen. In
                    Russian Poland associations of four to six men, supported by German banks,
                    purchase large numbers of properties belonging to members of the Polish nobility
                    who have been ruined since the last insurrection. No fewer than 30,736 German
                    landholders, owning 5433 estates, were enumerated last year in the provinces
                    west of the Vistula; while 13,714 foreign proprietors, farmers, and labourers
                    (11,497 Prussians and 1914 Austrians) were at the same time owners of 1,857,900
                    acres, valued at 135,000,000 roubles. According to other statistics, the
                    foreigners in Poland, mostly Germans, who remained foreign subjects, numbered
                    170,000 in 1881 (5 ’ 15 per cent, of the population). Of these, 91,440 (families
                    included) hold landed property to the amount of 2,605,500 acres, or 8'3 per
                    cent, of the area of the kingdom. The aggregate number of Germans in Russian
                    Poland, estimated at 370,000 in 1873, must now exceed 450,000, thus constituting
                    about one-fifteenth of the population.</p>
                <p>The Jews, who are found everywhere throughout Poland, are still more numerous,
                    and must now exceed a million. They are nowhere agricultural; in the larger
                    towns many of them are artisans, but in the villages they are almost exclusively
                    engaged as shopkeepers, second-hand traders, dealers on commission, innkeepers,
                    and usurers. In the country, both commerce and agriculture are in the hands of
                    their intimately connected trading associations. Their relations with Poles and
                    Ruthenians are anything but cordial, and “Jew-baiting” is of frequent
                    occurrence. They are increasing much more rapidly than the Slavs.</p>

                    out of the country, the whole situation remained unsettled until 1883, when the
                    pope recognized the new diocesan subdivisions introduced by the Russian
                    Government. Poland is now divided into four dioceses (Warsaw, Sedomierz, Lublin,
                    and Pi ’ ock).</p>
                <p>From remote antiquity Poland has been celebrated for the production and export of
                    grain. Both, however, greatly declined in the 18th century; and towards the
                    beginning of this century the peasants, ruined by their proprietor's, or
                    abandoned to the Jews, were in a more wretched state than even their Russian
                    neighbours. Serfdom was abolished in 1807; but the liberated peasants received
                    no allotments of land, and a subsequent law (1808) rendered even their
                    transference from one landlord to another almost impossible; the old patrimonial
                    jurisdictions were also retained. Compelled to accept the conditions imposed by
                    the landlords, they had to pay rack-rents and to give compulsory labour in
                    various forms for the use of land. Only a limited number were considered as
                    permanent farmers, while nearly one-half of the peasants became mere <hi
                    rend="italic">prolétaires·,</hi> in 1864 1,338,830 former peasants had ceased to
                    have land rights at all. Pursuing a policy intended to reconcile ihe peasantry
                    to Russian rule and to break the power of the Polish nobility, the Russian
                    Government promulgated, during the outbreak in 1864, a law by which those
                    peasants who were holders of land on estates belonging to private persons,
                    institutions (such as monasteries and the like), or the crown were recognized as
                    proprietors of the soil,—the state paying compensation to the landlords in
                    bonds, and the peasants having to pay a yearly annuity to the state until the
                    debt thus contracted had been cleared. The valuation of these allotments was
                    made at a rate much more advantageous than in Russia, and the average size of
                    holding .reached 15 acres per family. Of those who held no land a number
                    received it out of the confiscated estates of the nobility and monasteries. At
                    the same time the self-government of the peasant was organized on democratic
                    principles. The so-called “servitudes,” however, that is, the right to pasture
                    on and take wood from the landlord’s estates, were maintained for political
                    reasons, becoming a source of great inconvenience both to landlords and
                    peasants.</p>
                <p>Whatever be the opinion held as to the intention of these reforms, there can be
                    no doubt that they resulted in a temporary increase of prosperity, or at any
                    rate an alleviation of the previous misery of the. peasants. In 1864 there were
                    342,500 peasant families, holding an aggregate of 8,300,000 acres of land; but
                    only 22,000 peasants, that is, less than one-half per cent, of the agricultural
                    population, were proprietors, the remainder (218,500) being nobles, while
                    2,000,000 peasants were <hi rend="italic">czinszewiki,</hi> that is, tenants at
                    will, and 1,338,000 had no land at all. In 1872 there were already -572,100 free
                    peasant estates, occupying 13,000,000 acres. In ten years (1864-73) the area of
                    cultivated soil had increased by 1,350,000 acres, while during the fourteen
                    years 1845-59 its increase was only 540,000 acres. The crops, which stood in
                    1846-60 at an average of 9,360,000 quarters of corn and 6,500,000 quarters of
                    potatoes, reached respectively 15,120,000 and 14,400,000 quarters. The yearly
                    increase, which was only 2'2 per cent, for com and 1'3 per cent, for potatoes
                    during the years 1846-60, became respectively 4'7 and 8 ’ 3 per cent, during the
                    years 1864-75, and the average crop per head rose from 1 '93 quarters in 1850 to
                    2’52 in 1872. The annual increase of horses, which formerly was 1 per cent.,
                    reached 2 ’ 7 per cent, in 1864-70, while the yearly increase of cattle remained
                    almost stationary (1’2 per cent., against Γl per cent.). In fact, Poland had in
                    1870 only 37 head of cattle for each 100 persons, against 41 head in 1860.
                    Another consequence of these measures was a notable decrease of crime, and a
                    rapid increase of village primary schools, maintained by the peasants
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>It must be acknowledged, however, that the maintenance of the “servitudes” has
                    become a serious evil. Moreover, the want of pasture-land, the want of money for
                    improvements, quite insufficiently supplied by the joint-stock banks in the
                    villages, and the very rapid increase in the price of land, from 50 roubles per
                    morgen (1'3835 acre) to 120 and 250 roubles, have all helped to lessen the
                    benefits of the agrarian measures of 1864. The peasants are unable to purchase
                    land proportionately with the increase of population; ami, while a few of them
                    buy, many others are compelled to sell to the Jews (notwithstanding the law
                    which prohibits the purchase of land by Jews) or to German immigrants. The
                    estates of the nobility do not pass into the hands of the Polish peasants as
                    they are sold, and still less to Russians, but largely into those of German
                    immigrants.</p>
                <p>Agriculture in Poland is carried on with more perfect methods on the whole than
                    in Russia. The extensive cultivation of beetroot, of potatoes for distilleries,
                    and of grasses has led to the introduction of a rotation of several years
                    instead of the former “three-fields” system; and agricultural machinery is in
                    more general use, especially on the larger estates of the west. Winter wheat is
                    extensively cultivated, especially in the south, the Sandomir wheat having a
                    wide repute. In 1873 50 per cent. (15,728,000</p>
                <p>acres) of the surface of Poland was under crops, 9 per cent. (2,929,000 acres)
                    under meadows, and 26 per cent. (8,242,000 acres) under forests. The first of
                    these figures exceeds now 54 per cent. In 1881 the crops reached 19,050,000
                    quarters of corn, 21,151,000 quarters of potatoes, and 14,368,000 cwts. of
                    beetroot (14,365,950 cwts. in 1882). The corn crops were distributed as follows
                    :—wheat, 11 per cent.; rye, 38; oats, 29; barley, 12; buckwheat, 4; various, 6
                    per cent.,—3 per cent, being used for manufactures, 22 per cent, for seed, 60
                    per cent, for home consumption, and 15 per cent for export. The potatoes were
                    used almost entirely for distilleries. The culture of tobacco is successfully
                    carried on (about 3500 acres), especially in Warsaw, Plock, and Lublin.</p>
                <p>Cattle rearing is an important source of income. In 1881 there were approximately
                    3,300,000 cattle, 4,500,000 sheep (including 2,500,000 of the finer breeds), and
                    1,000,000 horses. Fine breeds of horses and cattle occur on the larger estates
                    of the nobility, and cattle are exported to Austria. Bee-keeping is widely
                    spread, especially in the south-east. Fishing is carried on remuneratively,
                    especially on the Vistula and its tributaries.</p>
                <p>Manufactures have shown a rapid increase during the last twenty years. While in
                    1864 the annual production was only 50,000,000 roubles, it now exceeds
                    150,000,000,—the manufactures of Poland yielding one-eighth of the total
                    production of the Russian empire.</p>
                <p>Mining has shown a still more rapid development within the same period. While in
                    1862 only 154,100 cwts. of pig-iron and 100,900 cwts. of iron and steel were
                    made, these figures respectively reached 947,800 and 1,742,500 cwts. in 1881;
                    and, whereas the highest figure in the annual returns of the coal-mining
                    industry from 1867 to 1873 was only 2,494,000 cwts., the average for 1876-80 was
                    17,157,000, and the amount reached 27,659,000 cwts. in 1881. The zinc mines
                    yielded in 1881 89,640 cwts., aud the extraction of tin reached 7580 cwts. in
                    1878. Sulphur was obtained to the amount of 6450 cwts. in 1879.</p>

                <p>Thus, while the number of hands occupied in these industries has increased by 40
                    per cent., the production has nearly trebled, showing a corresponding
                    improvement in the machinery employed. The chief manufacturing centres are the
                    Lodé region in the government of Piotrk6w (woollen stuffs, cottons, sugar,

                    machinery, sugar, wine-spirit, tobacco, and all kinds of grocery and mercery
                    wares). Mining is chiefly concentrated in the south-west. The annual production

                <p>These figures, however, have already increased considerably, especially with
                    regard to distilleries, which yielded, in 1882-83, 6,269,500 gallons of pure
                    alcohol; while the sugar-works, which occupied in 1882-83 9774 men, 2636 women,
                    and 2403 children, produced 315,460 cwts. of rough sugar and 425,800 cwts. of
                    refined sugar. In 1882 the production reached 66,291,700 roubles in Piotrkow,
                    3,948,200 in Siedlce, and 1,240,230 in Suwatki.</p>
                <p>The railways of Poland have an aggregate length of 888 miles. A line of great
                    importance, connecting Vienna with St Petersburg, crosses the country from
                    south-west to north-east, passing through the mining district and Warsaw, and
                    sending a short branch to <hi rend="italic">L6dz.</hi> Another important line,
                    connecting Dantzic with Odessa, crosses Poland from north-west to south-east. A
                    branch line, parallel to this last, connects Skiernewice with Thorn and
                    Bromberg; while a military railway connects the fortresses of Warsaw and
                    Ivangorod with Brest-Li towsky, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Siedlce and L·ukow,
                    and a side line will soon connect Siedlce with Matkin on the lower Bug. The
                    great line from Berlin to St Petersburg crosses North Suwatki for 54 miles,
                    between Eydtkunen and Kovno. The aggregate length of the macadamized roads,
                    increased by 2110 miles since 1864, is now about 6700 miles.</p>
                <p>The traffic on the Polish railways is very brisk. In 1880 the aggregate amount of
                    merchandise brought to and sent from Warsaw reached respectively 36,055,000 and
                    18,248,000 cwts.; and the whole amount of merchandise conveyed on Polish
                    railways within Poland (exclusive of the Eydtkunen and Kovno line) amounted to
                    81,469,000 cwts.</p>
                <p>The chief custom-houses of the Russian empire—Wierzbotowo, Sosnowice, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Granica, Warsaw—and many minor ones are situated on
                    the frontiers of Poland. Their aggregate imports and exports reached
                    respectively 127,414,054 and 146,320,921 roubles in 1882.</p>
                <p>The “primary cell” of the administrative organization of Poland is the <hi
                    rend="italic">gmina,—</hi> formerly a village commune for the common posses sion
                    and partly also for the common cultivation of land, which lost its characters
                    with the introduction of serfdom, but has been taken by the law of 1864 as the
                    basis of the organization of the peasantry in Poland. Each district is
                    subdivided into twelve to twenty <hi rend="italic">gminas,</hi> including
                    several villages and all farms on its territory, and having a population of from
                    2000 to 10,000 inhabitants. All landholders of the <hi rend="italic">gmina</hi>
                    who are in possession of at least 4 acres constitute the communal assembly of
                    the <hi rend="italic">gmina.</hi> Only the clergymen and the police officials
                    are excluded from it. Each member has but one vote, however extensive his
                    property. The <hi rend="italic">gmina</hi> differs thus from the Russian <hi
                    rend="italic">volost</hi> in its including, not only peasants, but also all
                    landed proprietors of the territory. The assembly elects the <hi rend="italic"
                    >wait,</hi> or elder (the executive of the <hi rend="italic">gmina),</hi> a
                    clerk, a <hi rend="italic">sottys</hi> in each village, and a tribunal
                    consisting of <hi rend="italic">lawniki,</hi> who judge all matters of minor
                    importance, according to local customs. It also allocates the taxation among the
                    members of the <hi rend="italic">gmina,</hi> administers the common property
                    (pasturage, grazing lands, forests), has charge of the poor, and generally deals
                    with all questions educational, hygienic, and economic which concern the <hi
                    rend="italic">gmina.</hi> The cost of administration of each <hi rend="italic"
                    >gmina</hi> varies from 1000 to 3000 roubles. In reality, the powers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">gmina</hi> are, however, very much limited in all but purely
                    economical questions by a numerous bureaucracy, and especially by the “chief of
                    the district” nominated by the crown; there is also a general tendency towards
                    transforming it into a mere auxiliary to the Russian administration, the clerk
                    or secretary becoming its chief organ.</p>
                <p>The provincial administration is regulated by the law of December 31, 1866. Each
                    government being subdivided into ten to twelve districts, the district
                    administration consists of an <hi rend="italic">ouyezdnyi πatchalnik,</hi> or
                    “chief of the district,” with a number of secretaries and “chancelleries”
                    (military, for recruiting; philanthropic; for mutual assurance against fire; for
                    finance; and for gendarmerie). The provincial administration, finder a military
                    governor, consists in each of the ten governments of the following institutions
                    :—(1) “chancellery” of the governor; (2) a provincial “college,” with
                    councillors corresponding to the following departments—administration, military
                    and police, finance, state domains, law, medicine, and insurance; (3) a
                    philanthropic committee; (4) a postal department; (5) a “college” for finance;
                    (6-10) departments of excise, customs, forests, control, and education. There is
                    also in each government a special institution for the affairs of peasants.</p>
                <p>The entire administration of Poland is under the governor-general, residing at
                    Warsaw, whose power is limited only.by “collegiate” institutions corresponding
                    to the different branches of administration. He is at the same time the
                    commander of the entire military force of the “Warsaw military district.”
                    Justice is represented by the <hi rend="italic">gmina</hi> tribunals; the
                    justices of the peace (nominated by government); the <hi rend="italic"
                    >syezd,</hi> or “court” of the justices of the peace; the district tribunals
                    (assizes) in each government; and the Warsaw courts of appeal and cassation. The
                    prisons of Poland, with exception of a reformatory for boys at Studzieniec, are
                    in a very bad state. With an aggregate capacity for only 4050 prisoners, they
                    had in 1883 7210 inmates. Poland constitutes also a separate educational
                    district, a district of roads and communications, an administration of justice
                    district, and two mining districts.</p>
                <p>PΛ⅛nd has had no separate budget since 1867; its income and expenditure are
                    included in those of the empire, and since 1881 they have ceased to appear under
                    separate heads. The peasants’ arrears, which reached 663,685 in 1878, have
                    notably increased since then, ranging from 200,000 to 600,000 roubles in each
                    government.</p>
                <p>Perhaps no other country in Europe had so many towns (453), for the most part
                    enjoying municipal rights according to the Magdeburg and Lithuanian law, as
                    Poland. A large number of them (228) remained, however, private property, or
                    property of the crown. In some of them the proprietors only levied rents on the
                    holders of land that had been built upon; while in others the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dominvum supremum</hi> was maintained, and the proprietor exacted, not only
                    rents, but also taxes from the inhabitants and visitors, claiming also the
                    monopoly of selling spirits, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>After the last insurrection, all towns with less than 2000 inhabitants were
                    deprived of their municipal rights, and were included, under the designation of
                    <hi rend="italic">posads,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">gminas.</hi> The
                    seignorial rights were abolished or redeemed, and those inhabitants who lived on
                    agriculture received allotments of land redeemed by the state. But the
                    spirit-selling monopoly was maintained, as also the “servitudes.” Viewed with
                    suspicion by the Russian Government, the Polish towns received no
                    self-government like the villages. Instead of the former elective municipal
                    councils (which enjoyed <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> very large rights,
                    including that of keeping their own police, while in reality they were under the
                    rule of the nobility), Russian officials were nominated and entrusted with all
                    the rights of the former municipal councils. These last were, however,
                    maintained to carry out the orders of the military chiefs. The new municipal law
                    of 1870, first introduced at Warsaw and then applied to other towns, reduced the
                    functions of the municipal council almost to nothing, depriving it even of the
                    right of discussing the general budget, which is established by a special
                    administrative committee aided by three to four citizens nominated by the
                    governor. The burgomaster, chosen by Government out of three candidates, and the
                    members of the municipality <hi rend="italic">(tawnikï)</hi> elected by one
                    section of the citizens, mostly from the poorest classes, have no authority. The
                    burgomaster, who often is a retired private soldier, very badly paid (£18 to £45
                    per year), is entirely dependent upon the police and the chief of the district,
                    and has to discharge all sorts of functions (bailiff, policeman, &amp;c.) which
                    have nothing to do with municipal affaire.</p>
                <p>Poland naturally contains the first line of the fortifications of the Russian
                    empire on its western frontier. These fortifications, however, are intended only
                    to protect the country to the east of the Vistula, the region to the west of it,
                    which contains the chief mining and manufacturing districts of Poland, remaining
                    quite open to invasion. The marshy lowlands, covered with forests on the western
                    bank of the Vistula, are a natural defence against an army advancing from the
                    west, and they are supported by the fortresses on the Vistula connected by the
                    Vistula railway. Their centre is at Warsaw, with Novogeorgievsk, formerly
                    Modlin, in the north, at the mouth of the Bug, and Ivangorod, formerly Demblin,
                    in the south, at the mouth of the Wieprz. Novogeorgievsk is a strongly fortified
                    camp, which requires a garrison of 12,000 men, and may shelter an army of 50,000
                    men. The town Sierock, at the junction of the Bug and Narew, is now fortified to
                    protect the rear of N ovogeorgie vsk.</p>
                <p>The citadel of Warsaw protects the railway bridge over the Vistula, and six
                    forts—rather out of date, however—protect the capital. The fortress of
                    Ivangorod, on the right bank of the Vistula, is now supported by six forts, four
                    of which are situated on the right bank and two on the left. The Vistula line of
                    fortresses has, however, the great disadvantage of being easily taken from the
                    rear by armies advancing from East Prussia or Galicia. Brest-Litowsky, at the
                    western issue from the marshes of the Pripet, the towns of Dubno and Lutsk, now
                    about to be fortified, and Bobruisk constitute the second line of defence.</p>
                <p>The educational institutions of Poland are represented by a university with 1000
                    students in 1881; 18 gymnasiums and 8 progymnasiums for boys, with 8269 scholars
                    in 1878; 3 “real-schulen,” with 914 scholars; and 3279 primary schools, with
                    113,084 boys and 57,260 girls. There are also excellent technical schools, an
                    institute of agriculture and forestry at Nowa-Alexandrya, and several seminaries
                    for teachers. In 1881 the number of scholars was 1 to 35 of the aggregate
                    population, only 19 per cent, of the children of school age receiving
                    instruction in school. The Jewish children mostly are taught in the <hi
                    rend="italic">heders,</hi> where they receive almost no instruction at all.</p>
                <p>The school is the great means used by the Russian Government for the so-called
                    “Russification” of Poland. The teaching in the former <hi rend="italic">Szkota
                    Giowna,</hi> now the university of Waτsaw (even that of Polish literature), has
                    been carried on in Russian since 1873, both by a few Polish professors and by
                    the new Russian ones. Polish is taught in primary and secondary schools only
                    twice a week, in the lower classes; and the scholars are prohibited from
                    speaking Polish within the walls of the lyceums. In all official communications
                    Russian is obligatory, and a gradual elimination of Poles from the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n323/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0323-0312"/> administration is steadily going on, Polish
                    employés being either limited in number (to a fourth, for instance, for the
                    examining magistrates), or else totally excluded from certain administrations
                    (such as that of certain railways). The vexatious measures of Russian rule keep
                    up a continuous feeling of discontent; and, though it was allowed in 1864 that
                    the agrarian measures would conciliate the mass of the peasantry with the
                    Russian Government, it now appears that the peasants, while gaining in those
                    feelings of self-respect and independence which were formerly impossible to
                    them, are not accommodating themselves to Russian rule; the national feeling is
                    rising into activity with them as formerly with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >szlachia,</hi> and it grows every day.</p>
                <p>There are 27 towns the population of which exceeded 10,000 inhabitants in
                    1880-82, and 66 towns having a population of more than 5000. The list of the
