                    Mediterranean, bounded on the W. by Languedoc, on the N. by Venaissin and
                    Dauphiné, and on the E. by Italy. It now forms the departments of
                    Bouches-du-Rhône, Var, and Basses-Alpes, with portions of Vaucluse and Alpes
                    Maritimes. It was divided into Upper Provence, containing the four seneschalates
                    of Forcalquier, Castellane, Sisteron Digne, and the Valley of Barcelonnette; and
                    Lower Provence, containing the eight seneschalates of Aix, Arles, Brignoles,
                    Grasse, Marseilles, Draguignan, Hyères, and Toulon. In ancient as in modern
                    times the most important city was Marseilles (Massilia), a chief seat of trade
                    for the Greek merchants of the Mediterranean, who extended their power along the
                    coast and founded Agde, Antibes, Grasse, and Nice. They afterwards called in the
                    aid of the Romans (125 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) against the Ligurian
                    inhabitants of the surrounding country, and the new-comers soon made themselves
                    masters of the territory which later formed the provinces of Languedoc,
                    Dauphiné, and Provence. The new province, of which the capital was Aquae Sextiae
                    (Aix), was called Provincia Gallica until the total conquest of Gaul, when the
                    name of the district was changed to Gallia Narbonensis. In the 4th century of
                    the Christian era, when the greater part of Languedoc, or Narbonensis Prima, had
                    become subject to the Visigoths, and the Burgundians had spread to the Viennois,
                    Provincia came to be applied only to the country lying between the Rhone, the
                    Durance, and the Alps which was still held by the Romans. But they could not
                    withstand for long the advancing tide of barbarian power. Although the
                    Visigothic king Theodoric I. was defeated by Aetius before Arles in 425 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and their united armies in turn defeated Attila in
                    451, yet Theodoric II. imposed the emperor Avitus on the Romans, and Euric by
                    the capture of Arles (480) made the Visigoths masters of Provence. Their defeat
                    at the battle of Bouglé in 507 by Clovis and Gundibald, king of the Burgundians,
                    placed Provence at the mercy of the latter, who ceded it in 511 to Theodoric,
                    king of the Ostrogoths, as guardian of the Visigothic king. The powers so gained
                    were, however, resigned by his successor Witiges in 536 to Theodebert, king of
                    the Franks, who had previously overthrown the Burgundian kingdom. On the death
                    of Clotaire I. (561) Provence was divided between his sons Sigebert, king of
                    Austrasia, and Gontran, king of Burgundy, Marseilles falling to the former and
                    Arles to the latter. When Gontran died in 593 the province was united under his
                    nephew Childebert, only to be divided again by his sons and reunited under
                    Clotaire II. (613), until the sons of Dagobert, Sigebert II. and Clovis II.
                    (633) parted it between them. In 719 the Saracens crossed the Pyrenees and made
                    themselves masters of almost all Septimania, or Languedoc, and in 739 they
                    joined with Maurontis, a Byzantine governor of Marseilles, in his attempt to
                    drive out the Franks. Fortunately for Europe their forces were completely
                    defeated by Charles Martel, who again united Provence to the Frankish kingdom.
                    On the division of the Carlovingian empire in 843 Provence fell to Lothair, who
                    left it with the title of king to his son Charles (855), at whose death without
                    issue in 863 it was seized by Charles the Bald. In 879 his brother-in-law Boson,
                    a son-in-law of the emperor Louis 11., and governor of Vienne, was elected king
                    by the synod of Mantale, when his united provinces became known as Cisjuran
                    Burgundy. His son, Louis the Blind, obtained the crown of Italy (900), but was
                    deposed by Hugo, who, in his turn obtaining the Italian kingdom, ceded Provence
                    in 932 to Rudolph II., king of Transjuran Burgundy. The two Burgundies thus
                    united received the name of the Kingdom of Arles, which lasted in a phantom form
                    until 1032, but Provence was always governed by princes whose powers gradually
                    increased, until the county was changed from a beneficiary to an hereditary
                    fief. The line of beneficiary counts begins with Boson I. (926), who was
                    reinvested by Rudolph II. in 934. He was succeeded by Boson II. (948), whose son
                    William I. (968) signalized his reign by driving out from the stronghold of
                    Fraxinet the Moorish pirates who had seized it in 889, and thence ravaged the
                    neighbouring country. His brother Rothbold, who held the fief until 1008, was
                    followed by his nephew William II., and, as the union of the kingdom of Arles
                    with the German empire was by this time almost nominal, the counts of Provence
                    claimed independence, and William’s sons, Geoffrey-Bertrand I. and William III.,
                    divided the county in 1018 as an allodial fief. William III. died in 1053 and
                    Geoffrey-Bertrand handed over to his nephews the northern part, or the county of
                    Forcalquier, he himself retaining the main province to which his son Bertrand
                    II. succeeded in 1063. At his death without issue in 1093 the county was ruled
                    by his mother Étiennette, who was followed (1100) by her daughter Gerberge, wife
                    of Gilbert, viscount of Milhaud and Gévaudan. Their daughter Douce was married
                    to Raymond-Bérenger, count of Barcelona, of the house of Aragon, and Provence
                    passed to him in 1112. But his succession was not undisputed. Raymond de S.
                    Gilles, count of Toulouse and Venaissin, a great-grandson of Rothbold, had about
                    1085 laid claim to the county of Forcalquier, and his pretensions were probably
                    partly admitted. The excitement of the crusades put a stop to further action,
                    and in 1096, accompanied by Count Gilbert, he led the Provençal contingent,
                    which was, however, more distinguished for foraging than fighting. On his death
                    in 1105 his claims were revived by his son Alfonse Jourdain, who succeeded in
                    obtaining from Raymond-Bérenger an extension of the county of Venaissin.
                    Raymond-Bérenger I. died in 1130, and was succeeded by his son Bérenger-Raymond,
                    whose rights were disputed by Raymond de Baux, husband of his mother’s sister
                    Etiennette. In the war which ensued the count was killed before Melgueil,
                    leaving a young son, Raymond-Bérenger II. (1144), to the guardianship of his
                    uncle, Raymond-Bérenger of Aragon. The claims of Raymond de Baux were renewed by
                    his son Hugo, on whose defeat in 1162 the emperor Frederick I. gave his niece
                    Richilda in marriage to the young count, and invested him with the fiefs of
                    Provence and Forcalquier. His only daughter Douce had been betrothed to the
                    count of Toulouse, who accordingly on the death of Raymond-Bérenger II. (1166)
                    claimed the county, but was defeated by Alphonso I. of Aragon, who invested his
                    brother Raymond-Bérenger III., on whose death in 1181 the fief reverted to
                    Alphonso I. to pass to his son Alphonso II. (1196). This prince died in 1209,
                    and was succeeded by his son Raymond-Bérenger IV., who, seeing that the great
                    cities were nests of intrigue for rivals to the throne, set himself to destroy
                    their independence. Through all changes of rulers the cities had kept their
                    internal freedom and old Roman self-government. The election of the governing
                    body had always remained in the hands of the citizens, but the office of chief
                    magistrate, after ceasing to be filled by a nominee of the Byzantine emperor,
                    had become vested either in certain families or in the bishops. In the 12th
                    century measures of reform were imitated from the Italian republics, the chief
                    characteristic of which was the election for life of a stranger as chief
                    magistrate or podestà. The power of the podestàs was too great to be broken at
                    once, and, though the Albigenses in Avignon capitulated in 1226, and Nice,
                    Grasse, Toulon, and Marseilles afterwards submitted to Raymond-Bérenger IV., it
                    was left to his son-in-law, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles of Anjou</hi> (see <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n901/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0901-0878"/> vol. V. pp. 422-23), to replace the podestàs by
                    governors of his own nomination (1246). Charles died in 1285, leaving the states
                    of Anjou, Provence, and Naples to his son Charles II., under whose rule peace
                    and prosperity to some extent revived. But the efforts of his son Robert (1309)
                    in the cause of the Guelphs called for increased taxation, and he left a
                    troubled heritage to his granddaughter Joan of Naples (1343). To avenge the
                    murder of his brother Andrew, the husband of Joan, at whose instigation the
                    crime had been committed, Louis of Hungary marched into Italy (1347), and made
                    himself master of the kingdom of Naples. Joan fled to Provence, and by timely
                    concessions to her people secured their favour in her efforts to regain the
                    Neapolitan crown. But money was needed; so Avignon, where the popes had resided
                    since 1305, was sold to Pope Clement VI., and Joan won back Naples. An important
                    part in the affair was played by the Provençal estates, which consisted of the
                    three houses of clergy, nobility, and commons, and were supreme in all financial
                    matters, however absolute the counts might be in other branches of government.
                    This power of the purse was jealously guarded, and the subsidies granted to the
                    prince were never considered as other than <hi rend="italic">dons</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gratuits,</hi> the name by which they were called even after the
                    union with France, when they became an annual tribute. Owing to the right of <hi
                    rend="italic">répartition</hi> to definite objects of the sums raised by
                    taxation, the Provençaux were not on the whole badly governed, for, though the
                    estates had only the right of petition for legislation, yet when the need arose
                    they could very effectually speak with the voice of the whole people. The
                    representation of the bulk of the nation in the tiers-état was particularly
                    good, for the deputies, who were paid, were returned not only by the twenty-five
                    country electorates, or vigueries, but from thirty-seven communes as well. The
                    English constitution may therefore be indebted to Provence for the important
                    step which was taken by the younger Simon de Montfort in first summoning the
                    representatives of cities and boroughs to the parliament of 1265. The earliφt
                    recorded session of the estates was in 1146, and the meetings continued at
                    intervals until 1639, when they ceased until 1787. The sessions not being
                    annual, the powers of the estates in ordinary matters were delegated to a
                    general assembly, composed of the archbishop of Aix, the procureurs joints, who
                    were representatives of each of the estates of the clergy and the nobility, and
                    the whole of the tiers-état. This assembly gradually superseded the estates
                    until in 1639 it replaced them altogether. To meet sudden emergencies there was
                    a “great council,” which consisted of the archbishop and three consuls of Aix as
                    procureurs du pays, and the procureurs joints of the three estates, under the
                    presidency of the grand seneschal. This officer was the representative of the
                    counts in judicial affairs, and during their absence from the country in
                    military matters also. His powers were not only administrative, but to a great
                    extent legislative, and they were therefore fated either to increase at the
                    expense of the sovereign or to be cut down by a firm ruler. Joan chose the
                    latter course, and deprived the grand seneschal of his powers over the state
                    domains, and his right to remove judges and pardon capital crimes. And she not
                    only reduced his power but appointed an Italian to the office, upon which the
                    nation rose in revolt, and Louis of Anjou, seizing the opportunity to press his
                    claims to the throne, led an army into Provence in 1368. The pretensions of
                    Louis were met by Joan’s offer to adopt him as her heir, and on her death in
                    1382 he succeeded to the county. The reign of Louis I. was passed in the
                    unsuccessful pursuit of his claims to the kingdom of Naples, and his son Louis
                    II. (1384) and grandson Louis HL (1417) continued the same unprofitable contest.
                    René (1434), a brother of Louis III., was not less inclined to give up his
                    rights, which had revived in force from his adoption by Joan II. of Naples, but,
                    though fortune at first smiled on him, he was at last forced to resign his claim
                    in favour of the house of Aragon. The count, or titular king, was an
                    accomplished musician and a lover of literature and the arts; and, the latter
                    part of his reign being on the whole peaceful, he was able to give free play to
                    his inclinations. The artistic fame of his court has lasted to the present day,
                    but it was the interest which he took in his subjects’ material welfare, and his
                    administration of wise laws, which caused his people to lament the death of René
                    the Good. He died in 1480, and, leaving only a daughter Margaret, the ill-fated
                    wife of Henry VI. of England, bequeathed the county to his nephew Charles of
                    Maine. Charles III. died in the following year, making Louis XI. of France his
                    heir, and in 1486 Charles VIII. by letters patent reunited the county to the
                    kingdom of France.</p>
                <p>The union was confirmed by the estates with the full approval of the people; but
                    the emperor was not inclined to relinquish without a struggle his claims to
                    overlordship, and he found a willing tool in the constable, Charles of Bourbon,
                    who entered Provence at the head of the imperialist army in 1524. His adventure
                    met with failure, and the invasion by the emperor Charles V. himself in 1536 was
                    equally unsuccessful. In 1501 Louis XIII., with the view of strengthening his
                    own authority, replaced the “conseil eminent,” which in the time of the counts
                    had been the highest court of justice, by a “parlement,” consisting at first of
                    the grand seneschal, a president, and eleven nominated councillors. The
                    functions of the court were strictly judicial, but before its abolition in 1790
                    it had often assumed legislative rights, and consequently played a conspicuous
                    part in the civil wars of the 16th and 17 th centuries. The principles of the
                    Reformation made what little progress they did in Provence from external rather
                    than internal causes, and the people themselves never took kindly to doctrines
                    which in many ways assumed an extremely bizarre and heretical form. The 13th
                    century had witnessed Simon de Montfort’s crusade against the Albigenses of
                    Languedoc, and the ruin which heresy had brought on that province cannot have
                    given the prosperous Provençaux any great love for new doctrines. The Waldenses
                    of the 16 th century were therefore chiefly confined to the mountainous
                    districts, but the persecutions ordered by the parlement brought the horrors of
                    civil war on the whole country. The extreme Catholics formed the Holy League
                    against the Protestants, and the two parties were equally at enmity with Henry
                    III., who tried to please both without satisfying either. In time the royalists
                    and Protestants united under the name of <hi rend="italic">Bigarrais,</hi> but
                    it was not until Henry IV. had come to the throne, and Marseilles, the last
                    stronghold of the League, had submitted, that the worn-out country was again at
                    peace. Richelieu tried to increase the taxation of the people without their
                    consent, but the disorders of the Cascaveous were the result, and a similar
                    attempt by Mazarin in 1647 led to disturbances in connexion with the Fronde
                    which lasted until 1652. In 1707, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the
                    army of the allies under Prince Eugene invaded the province, and the horrors of
                    war were followed by those of the plague of 1720, when 100,000 persons perished,
                    Marseilles alone losing 50,000 out of a population of 90,000. The dispute
                    between the Jesuits and Jansenists waxed warm about 1726, but the victory of the
                    former only preceded their suppression by Pope Clement XIV. in 1773 in return
                    for the cession of Avignon and the county of Venaissin, which had twice changed
                    hands since their reunion with Provence in 1663. On the re- <pb break="no"
