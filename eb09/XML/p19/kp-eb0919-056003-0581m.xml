                <p><label type="entry">POSSESSION</label> is a legal term derived from Roman law.
                    The Roman conception of possession has been generally adopted, but the Roman
                    deductions from the conception have not been universally followed. The subject
                    of possession, in itself a difficult one, has become more difficult owing to the
                    various senses in which the term has been interpreted. Thus it has been said to
                    be either a right or a fact conferring a right, or both together. The latter is
                    the view of Savigny, the leading authority upon the subject <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Recht des Besitzes,</hi> translated by Sir Erskine Perry, 1848). Further,
                    there is a want of agreement among legal writers as to the amount of right or
                    rights that it confers. All that can be said with safety is that possession
                    stands in a position intermediate between simple detention and absolute
                    ownership, and that it implies two elements, a physical and a mental
                    one,—physical detention and mental intention to hold the thing possessed as
                    one’s own. In the words of the <hi rend="italic">Digest,</hi> “Apiscimur
                    possessionem corpore et animo, neque per se animo aut per se corpore” (xli. 2,
                    3, 1). The difficulties which have been stated being borne in mind, the
                    definition of Professor Hunter may be accepted as being at least as good as any
                    other that has been suggested: “Possession is the occupation of anything with
                    the intention of exercising the rights of ownership in respect of it” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Roman Law,</hi> p. 209). Possession is inchoate or incomplete
                    ownership; it is on its way to become ownership. In the case of the public
                    domain of Rome <hi rend="italic">{ager publicus)</hi> the possession was really
                    the important matter, the <hi rend="italic">dominium</hi> being practically of
                    no value. Possession in Roman law was either <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">civil.</hi> The former was mere occupation, the latter such
                    occupation as ripened by prescription into ownership. Possession exclusive
                    against the world (including the true owner) was called “adverse possession.” A
                    servitude, such as a right of way, could not be held in true possession, but was
                    said to be in “quasi-possession. ’ The quasi-possessor had, however, possessory
                    remedies.</p>

                <p>In Roman law a broad distinction was drawn between possession and ownership <hi

                    type="authorial"><p>^ <hi rend="superscript"> le</hi> distinction is very
                    important, as it affects the contract of sale. The contract was not to transfer
                    ownership, as in English law, but only <hi rend="italic">vacua</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">possessio.</hi></p></note> They were protected by different
                    remedies,—possession by interdict, ownership by action. This difference can only
                    be explained by history. Here again, unfortunately, authorities differ.
                    According to Savigny, a Roman citizen who had become a tenant of part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">dger</hi><hi rend="italic">publicus</hi> could not by any length
                    of holding obtain more than a quasi-ownership, but one of which it would have
                    been morally unjust to have deprived him. “The only legal remedies of which the
                    tenants could avail themselves, if ejected or threatened with disturbance, were
                    the possessory interdicts, summary processes of Roman law which were either
                    expressly devised by the praetor for their protection, or else, according to
                    another theory, had in older times been employed for the provisional maintenance
                    of possessions pending the settlement of questions of legal right” (Maine, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ancient Law,</hi> ch. viii.). Savigny regards the protection of
                    possession as an extension of the protection of the person. The same view was
                    taken by the English Court of Exchequer in Rogers <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Spence, 13 Meeson and Welsby’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> 581. According to
                    Professor Hunter <hi rend="italic">(Roman Law,</hi> pp. 206, 221), Savigny
                    overlooked the needs of aliens. It was the needs of aliens, incapable of the
                    full proprietary rights of Roman citizens, that led to the invention by the
                    praetor of a means of giving them equitable rights in the land, and protecting
                    them in the enjoyment of these rights. Savigny attributes only two rights to
                    possession in Roman law—acquisition of ownership by possession for a given time
                    <hi rend="italic">(usucapio, longi temporis possessio)</hi> and protection of
                    possession from disturbance <hi rend="italic">(interdictum).</hi> Others have
                    included further rights,— <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> the right to use
                    force in defence of possession, and the right to have the burden of proof, in a
                    contest as to the title, thrown upon the adversary: “In pari causa possessor
                    potior haberi debet.” The position of the possessor in Roman law was a very
                    strong one. If a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> possessor, he could bring an
                    action for <hi rend="italic">furtum</hi> even against the owner; if a <hi
                    rend="italic">mala fide</hi> possessor of land, he was so far protected that he
                    could not be ejected by force. A <hi rend="italic">mala fide</hi> possessor of
                    movables could, however, acquire no rights.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This does not agree with English law, where in certain cases
                    a thief can give a good title to stolen goods, though he has no title
                    himself.</p></note></p>
                <p>It has been already stated that there is both a physical and a mental element in
                    the conception of possession. This does not necessarily mean that corporal
                    contact is in all cases requisite, or that the intention to hold the thing
                    possessed as one’s own may not be abandoned for a time. The control may be
                    potential as well as actual. An estate may be possessed without the possessor
                    going upon the land at all, and the possession of goods may be given by
                    delivering the key of the warehouse in which they are stored. In international
                    law the possession of part as giving the right to the whole has been of great
                    importance. The possession of the coast of a newly-discovered country gives a
                    right to the inland territory within certain limits (see Twiss, <hi
                    rend="italic">International Law,</hi> vol. i. p. 170). Where goods are pledged
                    or bailed for a specific purpose the intention of the pledgor or bailor to hold
                    them as his own is suspended during the existence of the limited right of the
                    pledgee or bailee, to whom a fragment of the possession has passed. In Roman law
                    the pledgor had <hi rend="italic">possessio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">usucapionem,</hi> the pledgee <hi rend="italic">possessio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">interdicta.</hi> The possession of the
                    pledgee or bailee has been called “derivative possession.” Possession may be
                    exercised through another (“animo nostro, corpore alieno”), as through a
                    servant, who has not true possession.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Much of the law of master and servant is based upon the
                    Roman law of master and slave. The servant, like the slave, has not possession
                    of his master’s goods even though they are in his custody, unless, indeed, the
                    circumstances are such that he ceases to be a servant and becomes a
                    bailee.</p></note> Possession so exercised has been called “representative
                    possession.” As soon as the representative determines to assume control on his
                    own behalf or to submit to the control of another, the possession of the
                    principal is gone. Possession may be transferred or lost. It is lost when either
                    the <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">animus</hi> (to use
                    the terms of Roman law) ceases to exist. It may be lost by the representative in
                    cases where the principal might have lost it.</p>
                <p>In both Roman and English law the possessory tended to supersede the proprietary
                    remedies from their greater convenience,—that is to say, the plaintiff based his
                    claim or the defendant his right upon possession rather than property. The
                    English possessory action may have been directly suggested by the interdict.
                    Bracton (103b) identifies the assise of novel disseisin, the most common form of
                    possessory action, with the interdict <hi rend="italic">unde vi.</hi> In England
                    ejectment had practically superseded other real actions before the latter were
                    (with the exception of dower, writ of dower, and <hi rend="italic">quare
                    impedit)</hi> expressly abolished by 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 27, s. 36. The action
                    for the recovery of land, introduced by the Judicature Acts, is the modern
                    representative of the action of ejectment. The right of a party to recover
                    possession is enforced by a writ of possession.</p>
                <p>Possession gives in English law, speaking generally, much the same rights as in
                    Roman law. Thus it serves to found a title (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Limitation,
                    Prescription),</hi> and to throw the onus of proof upon the claimant. In an
                    action for the recovery of land the defendant need only allege that he is in
                    possession by himself or his tenant, and (where such an allegation is necessary)
                    that he had no notice to quit. The chief differences between Roman and English
                    law, arising to some extent from the differences in the history of the two
                    systems, are that the former did not give to derivative possessors (except in
                    the case of pledge) the remedies of possessors, as does English law, and that
                    Roman law is stricter than English in requiring that possession to found <hi
                    rend="italic">usucapio</hi> should (except in the case of <hi rend="italic"
                    >jus</hi><hi rend="italic">aquae ducendaè)</hi> be <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">justo titulo,</hi> or under colour of right (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Prescription).</hi> There is one case of constructive
                    possession which is peculiar to English law, —that is, where possession is said
                    to be given by a deed operating under the Statute of Uses (see “Orme’s Case,”
                    <hi rend="italic">Law Reports,</hi> 8 Common Pleas, 281).</p>
                <p>In English law the doctrine of possession becomes practically important in the
                    following cases. (1) Possession serves as a convenient means of division of
                    estates (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Real Estate).</hi> One of the divisions of
                    estates is into estates in possession and estates in reversion or remainder. It
                    also serves as a division of <hi rend="smallcaps">Personal Estate</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> A chose in action is said to be reduced into
                    possession when the right of recovery by legal proceedings has become a right of
                    enjoyment. (2) Possession gives a title against a wrongdoer. In the case of real
                    property it is regarded as <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >facie</hi> evidence of seisin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Seisin” and “possession” are used sometimes as synonyms, as
                    generally by Bracton; at other times they are distinguished: thus there can be
                    possession of a term of years, but no seisin (Noy, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Maxims,</hi> p. 2). It seems doubtful, however, how far in English law a tenant
                    for years has true possession, for he is in law only a bailiff or servant of the
                    landlord. But he certainly has possessory remedies, like the quasi-possessor in
                    Roman law.</p></note> In the case of personal property the mere possession of a
                    finder is sufficient to enable him to maintain an action of trover against one
                    who deprives him of the chattel<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Compare the <hi rend="italic">Code</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Napoléon,</hi> art. 2279: “En fait de meubles la possession vaut

                    Delamirie, 1 Strange’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> 504). (3) What is called
                    “unity of possession” is one of the means whereby an easement is extinguished.
                    Thus the owner of close A may have had a right of way over close B, while the
                    latter belonged to a different owner. If the two closes come to be owned <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n583/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0583-0562"/> by the same person, the right of way is
                    extinguished, but may under certain circumstances revive on the separation of
                    the ownership. (4) Possession is very important as an element in determining the
                    title to goods under 13 Eliz. c. 5, the Bills of Sale Act, 1878 (41 and 42 Vict.
                    c. 31, ss. 4, 8), and the Bankruptcy Act, 1883 (46 and 47 Vict. c. 52, s. 44).
                    It may be said that as a general rule retention of possession by the transferor
                    on an absolute assignment or a colourable delivery of possession to the
                    transferee is strong <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi>
                    evidence of fraud. “Apparent possession” is defined by section 4 of the Bills of
                    Sale Act. (5) Possession of goods or documents of title to goods is generally
                    sufficient to enable agents and others to give a good title under the Factors’
                    Acts (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Factors).</hi> (6) In criminal law the question
                    of possession is important in founding the distinction between larceny and
                    embezzlement. If the goods are in the possession of the master and he gives them
                    to the custody of his servant for a specific purpose, and the servant steals
                    them, it is larceny; if they have never come into the master’s possession, as if
                    a clerk receives money on his master’s behalf, it is embezzlement. Recent
                    possession of stolen goods is always regarded as a presumption that the person
                    in whose possession they are stole them or received them knowing them to have
                    been stolen. In the case of a charge of receiving stolen goods evidence may be
                    given that there was found in the possession of the accused other property
                    stolen within the preceding period of twelve months, 34 and 35 Vict. c. 112, s.
                    19. (For possession in criminal law, see Stephen, <hi rend="italic">Digest of
                    the Criminal Law,</hi> note xi. ). (7) Actions of possession of ships fall
                    within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Division. This jurisdiction in the case
                    of British vessels depends upon the Admiralty Court Act, 1861 (24 Vict. c. 10,
                    s. 8), in the case of foreign vessels (in which the jurisdiction is rarely
                    exercised) upon the general powers of the court as a maritime court.</p>
                <p>The doctrines of adverse possession (in the old English sense, which was not
                    identical with the Roman law, for the real owner must have actually or by
                    fiction been disseised) and of <hi rend="italic">possessio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fratris</hi> are now of only antiquarian interest. The Statutes of Limitation,
                    3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 27 and 37 and 38 Vict. c. 57, have superseded the first.
                    The only question now is, not whether possession has been adverse or not, but
                    whether twelve years have elapsed since the right accrued (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Limitation).</hi> The maxim “possessio fratris de feodo
                    simplici sororem facit esse haeredem” (Coke upon Littleton, 14b) has been
                    altered by the rules of descent introduced by 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 106, under
                    which descent is traced from the purchaseι. At one time possessory suits were
                    occasionally maintained in England, and more frequently in Ireland, for the
                    quieting of possession after proof of three years’ possession before the filing
                    of the bill. But such suits are now obsolete (see Neill <hi rend="italic"
                    >v.</hi> Duke of Devonshire, 8 <hi rend="italic">Appeal Cases,</hi> 146). There
                    was one characteristic case in old English law in which possession was
                    maintained by means of what was called “continual claim,” made yearly in due
                    form, where the person having the right was prevented by force or fear from
                    exercising it (Coke upon Littleton, 253b). Continual claim was abolished by 3
                    and 4 Will. IV. c. 27, s. 11.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> In Scotland possessory actions still exist <hi
                    rend="italic">eo nomine.</hi> Actions of molestation, of removing, and of maills
                    and duties are examples. A possessory judgment is one which entitles a person
                    who has been in possession under a written title for seven years to continue his
                    possession (Watson, <hi rend="italic">Law Dict.,s.v.“</hi> Possessory
                    Judgment").</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> Here the law in general agrees with that
                    of England. But in Maryland, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Vermont the
                    doctrine <hi rend="italic">&lt;A</hi><hi rend="italic">possessio fratris</hi>
                    apparently still exists (Bouvier, <hi rend="italic">Law Diet.,</hi> “Possessio
                    Fratris”). Possessory rights are taxed in some of the States. Louisiana follows
                    Roman law closely. Possession of incorporeal rights (to use the unscientific
                    language of the Code) is called quasi-possession, and the division of possession
                    into natural and civil is maintained (Civil Code, §§ 3389-3419).</p>
