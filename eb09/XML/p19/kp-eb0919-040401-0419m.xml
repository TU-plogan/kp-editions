                    travellers. His history needs to be introduced by some account of the preceding
                    generation of his family, and of the state of the world which rendered their and
                    his extensive travels possible.</p>
                <p>Under <hi rend="smallcaps">China,</hi> in the introductory portion (vol. v. 627
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> we have briefly indicated the circumstances which in
                    the last half of the 13th century and first half of the 14th threw Asia open to
                    Western travellers to a degree unknown before and since. We first hear of the
                    Polo family in the year 1260. The vast wave of Tartar conquest, set in motion by
                    Jenghiz Khan, and continuing to advance for some years after his death, had
                    swept away all political barriers from the China Sea to the western frontier of
                    Russia. This huge extent of empire continued for a time to own a supreme chief
                    in the Great Khan, the head of the house of Jenghiz, whose headquarters were in
                    the Mongolian steppe. Practically indeed the empire soon began to split up into
                    several great monarchies under the descendants of his four sons, in order of age
                    Juji, Jagatai, Oghotai, and Tuli. At the date we have named the supreme khanate
                    had recently devolved upon Kublai, son of Tuli, and, after the founder, the
                    ablest of his house. In the beginning of his reign Kublai carried out the
                    transfer of the seat of rule from Karakorum on the northern verge of the
                    Mongolian plains to the populous and civilized regions that had been conquered
                    in the further East, a transfer which eventually converted the Tartar khan into
                    a Chinese emperor.</p>
                <p>Barka, the son of Juji, and the first of the house of Jenghiz to turn Moslem,
                    reigned on the steppes of the Volga, where a standing camp, which eventually
                    became a great city under the name of Sarai, had been established by his brother
                    and predecessor Batu.</p>
                <p>Hulagu, a younger brother of Kublai, after taking Baghdad, and putting the caliph
                    Mosta'sim to death, had become practically independent ruler of Persia,
                    Babylonia, Mesopotamia, and Armenia,—though he and his sons and his sons’ sons
                    continued to the end of the century to stamp the name of the Great Khan upon
                    their coins, and to use the Chinese seal of state which he conferred.</p>
                <p>The house of Jagatai had settled upon the pastures of the Hi and in the valley of
                    the Jaxartes, and ruled also the populous cities of Samarkand and Bokhara.</p>
                <p>Kaidu, grandson of Oghotai, who had been the immediate successor of Jenghiz,
                    refused to recognize the transfer of supreme authority to his cousins, and
                    through the long life of Kublai was a thorn in the side of the latter. His
                    immediate authority was exercised in what we should now call Chinese Turkestan
                    and Southern Central Siberia.</p>
                <p>Northern China had been conquered by Jenghiz and his successors from the Tartar
                    dynasty called <hi rend="italic">Kin</hi> or “Golden,” who had held it about a
                    century. But southern China still remained in the hands of the native dynasty,
                    whose capital was the great city now known as Hang-chow-foo. Their dominion was
                    still substantially intact, but its subjugation was a task to which Kublai soon
                    turned his attention, and it became the most prominent transaction of his
                    reign.</p>
                <p>In India the most powerful sovereign was the Turk sultan of Delhi; but, though
                    both Sind and Bengal owned his supremacy, no part of peninsular India had yet
                    been invaded. The Dravidian kingdoms of the south were still untouched by
                    foreign conquest, and the accumulated gold of ages lay in their temples and
                    treasuries an easy prey for the coming Moslem.</p>
                <p>In the Indo-Chinese peninsula and the Eastern Islands a variety of kingdoms and
                    dynasties were expanding and contracting, of which we have but dim and shifting
                    glimpses. Their advance in wealth and art, far beyond what the present state of
                    those regions would suggest, is attested by the vast and magnificent mediaeval
                    remains of architecture which are found at intervals over both the <pb

                <p>Indo-Chinese continental countries and the islands, as at Pagân in Burmah, at
                    Ayuthia in Siam, at Ongkor and many other places in Camboja, at Borobodor and
                    Brambanan in Java. All these remains are deeply marked by Hindu influence.</p>
                <p>Venetian genealogies and traditions of uncertain value trace the Polo family to
                    Sebennico in Dalmatia, and before the end of the 11th century names of its
                    members are found in the Great Council of the republic. But the ascertained line
                    of the traveller begins only with his grandfather. Andrea Polo of S. Felice was
                    the father of three sons, Marco, Nicolo, and Mafieo, of whom the second was the
                    father of the subject of this article. They were presumably “noble,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> belonging to the families who had seats in the Great
                    Council, and were enrolled in the Libro d’Oro; for we know that Marco the
                    traveller is officially so styled <hi rend="italic">(nobilis vir).</hi> The
                    three brothers were engaged in commerce: the elder Marco, resident apparently in
                    Constantinople and in the Crimea, does not enter into the history.</p>
                <p>In 1260 we find Nicolo and Maffeo at Constantinople. How long they had been
                    absent from Venice we do not know. Nicolo was a married man, and had left his
                    wife there. In the year named the two brothers went on a speculation to the
                    Crimea, whence a succession of chances and openings carried them to the court of
                    Barka Khan at Sarai, and further north, and eventually across the steppes to
                    Bokhara. Here they fell in with certain envoys who had been on a mission from
                    the Great Khan Kublai to his brother Hulagu in Persia, and by them were
                    persuaded to make the journey to Cathay in their company. And thus the first
                    European travellers of whom we have any knowledge reached China. Kublai, when
                    they reached his court, was either at <hi rend="smallcaps">Cambaluc</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.), i.e.,</hi> Peking, which he had just rebuilt on a vast
                    scale, or at his beautiful summer seat at Shangtu in the country north of the
                    great wall (“In Xanadu did Cubla Khan,” &amp;c.). It was the first time that the
                    khan, a man full of energy and intelligence, had fallen in with European
                    gentlemen. He was delighted with the Venetian brothers, listened eagerly to all
                    that they had to tell of the Latin world, and decided to send them back as his
                    envoys to the pope, with letters requesting the despatch of a large body of
                    educated men to instruct his people in Christianity and in the liberal arts. The
                    motive of the khan’s request was doubtless much the same that some years back
                    influenced the black king of Uganda on Lake Nyanza to make a similar request
                    through the traveller Stanley. With Kublai, as with his predecessors, religion
                    was chiefly a political engine. The khan must be obeyed; how man should worship
                    God was no matter to him. But Kublai was the first of his house to rise above
                    the essential barbarism of the Mongols, and he had been able enough to discern
                    that the Christian church could afford the aid he desired in taming his
                    countrymen. It was only when Rome had failed lamentably to meet his advances
                    that he fell back upon the lamas and their trumpery as, after a fashion,
                    civilizing instruments.</p>
                <p>The brothers arrived at Acre in April 1269. They learned that Clement IV. had
                    died the year before, and no new pope had yet been chosen. So they went home to
                    Venice, where they found that Nicolo’s wife was dead, but had left a son Marco,
                    now a fine lad of fifteen.</p>
                <p>The papal interregnum was the longest that had been known, at least since the
                    dark ages. After the Polos had spent two years at home there was still no pope;
                    and the brothers resolved on starting again for the East, taking young Mark with
                    them. At Acre they took counsel with an eminent churchman, Tedaldo, archdeacon
                    of Liège, and took from him letters to authenticate the causes that had hindered
                    their mission. They had not yet left Ayas on the Cilician coast (then one of the
                    chief points for the arrival and departure of the land-trade of Asia), when news
                    overtook them that a pope had been elected in the person of their friend
                    Archdeacon Tedaldo. They hastened back to Acre, and at last were able to execute
                    Kublai’s commission and to obtain a papal reply. But, instead of the hundred
                    teachers asked for by the Great Khan, the new pope (styled Gregory X.) could
                    supply but two Dominicans; and these lost heart and turned back, when they had
                    barely taken the first step of their journey.</p>
                <p>The second start from Acre must have taken place about November 1271; and from a
                    careful consideration of the indications and succession of chapters in Marco
                    Polo’s book, it would seem that the party proceeded from Ayas to Sivas, and then
                    by Mardin, Mosul, and Baghdad to Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">0rmus),</hi> with the purpose of going on to China by sea;
                    but that, some obstacle having interfered which compelled them to abandon this
                    plan, they returned northward through Persia. Traversing Kerman and Khorasan
                    they went on to Balkh and Badakhshan, in which last country—an Oriental
                    Switzerland, as it has been called—they were long detained by the illness of
                    young Marco. In a passage touching on the charming climate of the hills of
                    Badakhshan, Marco breaks into an enthusiasm which he rarely betrays, but which
                    is easily understood by those who have known what it is, with fever in the
                    blood, to escape to the exhilarating air and fragrant pine-groves of the
                    Himalaya. They then ascended the upper Oxus through Wakhân to the plateau of
                    Pamir (a name first heard in Marco’s book). Those regions, so attractive to
                    geographers, were never described again by any European traveller till the
                    spirited expedition in 1838 of that excellent officer the late Lieutenant John
                    Wood of the Indian navy, whose narrative abounds in the happiest incidental
                    illustration of Marco Polo’s chapters. Crossing the Pamir highlands, the
                    travellers descended upon Kashgar, whence they proceeded by Yarkand to Khotan.
                    These are regions which remained almost absolutely closed to our knowledge till
                    within the last twenty years, when the temporary overthrow of the Chinese power,
                    and the enterprise of travellers like the late Mr Johnson and Mr Robert Shaw,
                    followed by the missions of Sir Douglas Forsyth and his companions, and of Mr
                    Ney Elias, again made them known.</p>
                <p>From Khotan they passed on to the vicinity of Lake Lop (or Lob), reached still
                    more recently, for the first time since Marco Polo’s journey, by the
                    indefatigable Russian officer Prejevalsky, in 1871. Thence the great desert of
                    Gobi was crossed to Tangut, as the region at the extreme north-west of China,
                    both within and without the Wall, was then called.</p>
                <p>In his account of the passage of the Gobi, or desert of Lop, as he calls it, Polo
                    gives some description of the terrors with which the suggestions of solitude and
                    desolation have peopled such tracts in most parts of the world, a description
                    which reproduces with singular identity that of the Chinese pilgrim <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hwen T’sang</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> in passing the
                    same desert in the contrary direction six hundred years before.</p>
                <p>The Venetians, in their further journey, were met and welcomed by the Great
                    Khan’s people, and at last reached his presence at Shangtu, in the spring of
                    1275. Kublai received them with great cordiality, and took kindly to young Mark,
                    by this time about one and twenty years of age. The “young bachelor,” as the
                    book calls him, applied himself diligently to the acquisition of the divers
                    languages and written characters chiefly in use among ths multifarious
                    nationalities included in the khan’s court and administration; and Kublai,
                    seeing that he was both <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n421/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0421-0406"/> clever and discreet, soon began to employ him in
                    the public service. Μ. Pauthier, his most recent French editor, has found in the
                    Chinese annals a record that in the year 1277 a certain Polo was nominated as a
                    second-class commissioner or agent attached to the imperial council, a passage
                    which we may without scruple apply to the young Venetian.</p>
                <p>His first public mission was one which carried him through the provinces of
                    Shansi, Shensi, and Szechuen, and the wild country on the coast of Tibet, to the
                    remote province of Yunnan, called by the Mongols <hi rend="italic"
                    >Karâjang,</hi> and into northern Burmah (Mien). Marco, during his stay at
                    court, had observed the khan’s delight in hearing of strange countries, of their
                    manners, marvels, and oddities, and had heard his frank expressions of disgust
                    at the stupidity of envoys and commissioners who could tell of nothing but their
                    official business. And he took care to store his memory or his note-book with
                    all curious facts that were likely to interest Kublai, and these, on his return
                    to court, he related with vivacity. This first journey led him through a country
                    which twenty years ago was an almost absolute <hi rend="italic">terra
                    incognita,—</hi> though within that time we have learned much regarding it
                    through the journeys of Cooper, Garnier, Richthofen, Gill, Baber, and others. In
                    this region there existed, and there still exists, in the deep valleys of the
                    great rivers, and in the alpine regions which border them, a vast ethnological
                    garden, as it were, of tribes of very various origin, and in every stage of
                    semi-civilization or barbarism; and these afforded many strange products and
                    eccentric traits of manners to entertain the emperor.</p>
                <p>Marco rose rapidly in favour, and was often again employed on distant missions,
                    as ' well as in domestic administration; but we are able to gather but few
                    details of his employment. At one time we know that he held for three years the
                    government of the great city of Yangchow; on another occasion we find him
                    visiting Karakorum on the north of the Gobi, the former residence of the Great
                    Khans; again in Champa, or southern Cochin-China; and, once more, on a mission
                    to the southern states of India. We are not informed whether his father and
                    uncle shared in such employments, though they are specially mentioned as having
                    rendered material service to the khan, in forwarding the capture of the city of
                    Siang-yang-foo (on the Han river) during the war against southern China, by the
                    construction of powerful artillery engines— a story, however, perplexed by
                    chronological difficulties, which here we must pass over.</p>
                <p>In any case the elder Polos were gathering wealth, which they longed to carry
                    back to their home in the lagoons, and after their long exile they began to
                    dread what might follow old Kublai’s death. The khan, however, was deaf to all
                    suggestions of departure; and but for a happy chance we should have lost our
                    mediaeval Herodotus.</p>
                <p>Arghun, khan of Persia, the grandson of Kublai’s brother Hulagu, lost in 1286 his
                    favourite wife, Bolgana <hi rend="italic">(BulughAn</hi> or “Sable ”) by name.
                    Her dying injunction was that her place should be filled only by a lady of her
                    own Mongol tribe. Ambassadors were despatched to the court of Khânbâligh to
                    obtain such a bride. The message was courteously received, and the choice fell
                    on the lady Cocachin (Kukàchim), a maiden of seventeen, “moult bele dame et
                    avenant.” The overland road from Peking to Tabriz was not only of portentous
                    length for so delicate a charge, but was then imperilled by war; so the envoys
                    of Arghun proposed to return by sea. Having made acquaintance with the
                    Venetians, and eager to profit by their experience, especially by that of Marco,
                    who had just returned from his mission to India, they begged the khan as a
                    favour to send the Franks in their company. He consented with reluctance, but
                    fitted out the party nobly for the voyage, charging them with friendly messages
                    to the potentates of Christendom, including the king of England. They appear to
                    have sailed from the port of Chwan-chow (or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Chinchew,</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    y</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> in Fuhkien, which was then the great haven of
                    foreign trade, and was known to Western strangers as Zaitιin, in the beginning
                    of 1292. The voyage was an ill-starred one, involving long detention on the
                    coast of Sumatra, and in the south of India; and two years or more passed before
                    they arrived at their destination in Persia. Two out of the three envoys, and a
                    vast proportion of their suite perished by the way; but the three hardier
                    Venetians survived all perils, and so did the young lady, who had come to look
                    on them with filial regard. It proved that Arghun Khan had been dead even before
                    they quitted China; his brother reigned in his stead; and his son Ghazan
                    succeeded to the lady’s hand. She took leave of the kindly Venetians, not
                    without tears; they went on to Tabriz, and after a long delay there departed for
                    Venice, which they seem to have reached about the end of 1295.</p>
                <p>The first biographer of Marco Polo was the famous geographical collector John
                    Baptist Ramusio, who wrote more than two centuries after the traveller’s death.
                    Facts and dates sometimes contradict his statements, but his story is told with
                    great life and picturesqueness, and we need not hesitate to accept, at least as
                    a genuine tradition, a romantic story, too long for repetition here, of the
                    arrival of the Polos at their family mansion in the parish of St John
                    Chrysostom, of their appearance at its door in worn and outlandish garb, of the
                    scornful denial of their identity, and of the shrewd stratagem by which they
                    secured acknowledgment from the society of Venice.</p>
                <p>Some years pass ere we hear more of Marco Polo; and it is then in a militant
                    capacity.</p>
                <p>Jealousies, always too characteristic of Italian communities, were in the case of
                    Venice and Genoa sharpened by direct commercial rivalry, and had been growing in
                    bitterness throughout the 13th century. In 1298 the Genoese made preparations on
                    a great scale to strike a blow at their rivals on their own ground, and a
                    powerful fleet of galleys, under Lamba Doria as admiral, made straight for the
                    Adriatic. Venice, on hearing of the Genoese armament, hastily equipped a fleet
                    still more numerous, and placed it under the command of Andrea Dandolo. The crew
                    of a Venetian galley at this time amounted, all told, to 250 men, under a <hi
                    rend="italic">comito</hi> or master, but besides this officer each galley
                    carried a <hi rend="italic">sopracomito</hi> or gentleman commander, who was
                    usually a noble. On one of the galleys of Dandolo’s fleet went Marco Polo in
                    this last capacity.</p>
                <p>The hostile fleets met before the island of Curzola on the 6th September, and
                    engaged next morning. The battle ended in a complete victory to Genoa, the
                    details of which may still be read, inscribed on the façade of the church of St
                    Matthew in that city. Sixty-six Venetian galleys were burnt in the Bay of
                    Curzola, and eighteen were carried to Genoa, with 7000 prisoners, one of whom
                    was Marco Polo. The captivity was of less than a year’s duration; for by the
                    mediation of Milan peace was made, on honourable terms for both republics, by
                    July 1299; and Marco Polo was probably restored to his family during that or the
                    following month.</p>
                <p>But his captivity was memorable as being the means of bringing about the record
                    of his remarkable experiences in the East. Up to this time he had doubtless
                    often related his stories of Cathay among his friends; and from these stories
                    indeed, and the frequent employment in them (as it would seem) of a numerical
                    expression unfamiliar in those days, he had acquired the nickname of <hi
                    rend="italic">Marco</hi><pb break="no"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Millioni.</hi> Yet it would seem that he had committed nothing
                    to writing.</p>
                <p>The narratives not only of Marco Polo but of several other famous mediaeval
                    travellers <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Ibn Batuta, Friar Odoric, Nicolo Conti)
                    seem to have been extorted from them by a kind of pressure, and committed to
                    paper by other hands. This indicates indeed how little the literary ambition
                    which besets so many modern travellers weighed with the class in those days. It
                    is also perhaps an example of that intense dislike to the use of pen and ink
                    which still prevails among ordinary respectable folk on the shores of the
                    Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>But, in the prison of Genoa, Marco Polo fell in with a certain person of writing
                    propensities, Rusticiano or Rustichello of Pisa, who also was a captive of the
                    Genoese. His name is known otherwise to literary antiquaries as that of a
                    respectable kind of literary hack, who abridged and recast several of the French
                    romances of the Arthurian cycle which were then in fashion. He it was,
                    apparently, who persuaded Marco Polo to defer no longer the committal to paper
                    of his wonderful experiences. In any case it was he who wrote down these
                    experiences at Marco’s dictation; and he is the man therefore to whom we owe the
                    existence of this record, and possibly the preservation even of the traveller’s
                    name and memory.</p>
                <p>We learn but little of Marco Polo’s personal or family history after this
                    captivity; but we know that at his death he left a wife, Donata by name (perhaps
                    of the family of Loredano, but this is uncertain), and three daughters, Fantina
                    and Bellela married, the former to Marco Bragadino, and Moreta then a spinster,
                    but married at a later date to Ranuzzo Dolfino. One last glimpse of the
                    traveller is gathered from his will, which is treasured in the library of St
                    Mark’s. On the 9th January 1324 the traveller, now in his seventieth year, and
                    sinking day by day under bodily infirmity, sent for a neighbouring priest and
                    notary to make his testament. We do not know the exact time of his death, but it
                    fell almost certainly within the year 1324, for we know from a scanty series of
                    documents, commencing in June 1325, that he had at the latter date been some
                    time dead. He was buried in accordance with his will, in the church of St
                    Lorenzo, where the family burying-place was marked by a sarcophagus, erected by
                    his filial care for his father Nicolo, which existed till near the end of the
                    16th century. On the renewal of the church in 1592 this seems to have been cast
                    aside and lost.</p>
                <p>The copious archives of Venice have yielded up a few traces of our traveller.
                    Besides his own will just alluded to, there are in the library the wills of his
                    uncle Marco and of his younger brother Maffeo; a few legal documents connected
                    with the house property in St John Chrysostom, and other papers of similar
                    character; and two or three entries in the record of the Maggior Consiglio. We
                    have mentioned the sobriquet of Marco Millioni which he got from his young
                    townsmen. Ramusio tells us that he had himself noted the use of this name in the
                    public books of the commonwealth, and this statement has been verified of late
                    years in one of those entries in the books of the Great Council (dated 10th
                    April 1305), which records as one of the securities in a certain case the
                    “Nobilis vir <hi rend="italic">March,us Paulo</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Milion.”</hi> It is alleged that long after the traveller’s death there was
                    always in the Venetian masques one individual who assumed the character of Marco
                    Millioni, and told Munchausen-like stories to divert the vulgar. Such, if this
                    be true, was the honour of our great man in his own country. One curious
                    parchment among those preserved is the record of the judgment of the court of
                    requests (Curia Petitionum) upon a suit brought by the “Nobilis Vir Marcus Polo”
                    against Paulo Girardo, who had been an agent of his, to recover the value of a
                    certain quantity of musk for which Girardo had not accounted. Another curious
                    document brought to light within the last few years is a catalogue of certain
                    curiosities and valuables which were collected in the house of the unhappy
                    Marino Faliero, and this catalogue comprises several objects that Marco Polo had
                    given to one of the Faliero family. Among these are two which would have been of
                    matchless interest had they survived, viz.—“Unum anulum con inscriptione que
                    dicit Cuibile Can Marco Polo, et unum torques cum multis animalibus Tartarorum
                    sculptis que res donum dedit predictus Marcus quidam (cuidam) Fale-trorum.”</p>
                <p>The most tangible record of Polo’s memory in Venice is a portion of the Ca’
                    Polo—the mansion (there is every reason to believe) where the three travellers,
                    after their absence of a quarter century, were denied entrance. The court in
                    which it stands was known in Ramusio’s time as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corte,</hi><hi rend="italic">del Millioni,</hi> and now is called Corte
                    Sabbionera. That which remains of the ancient edifice is a passage with a
                    decorated archway of Italo-Byzantine character pertaining to the 13th century.
                    With this exception, what was probably the actual site of the mansion is now
                    occupied by the Malibran theatre.</p>
                <p>No genuine portrait of Marco Polo exists. There is a medallion portrait on the
                    wall of the Sala dello Scudo in the ducal palace, which has become a kind of
                    type; but it is a work of imagination no older than 1761. The oldest professed
                    portrait is one in the gallery of Monsignor Badia at Rome, which is inscribed
                    <hi rend="italic">Marcus</hi><hi rend="italic">Polus Venetus Totius Orbis
                    et</hi><hi rend="italic">Indie Peregrator Primus.</hi> It is a good picture, but
                    evidently of the 16th century at earliest, and the figure is of the character of
                    that time. The Europeans at Canton have attached the name of Marco Polo to a
                    figure in a Buddhist temple there containing a gallery of “Arhans” or Buddhist
                    saints, and popularly known as the “temple of the five hundred gods.” There is a
                    copy of this at Venice, which the Venetian municipality obtained on the occasion
                    of the Geographical Congress there in 1881. But the whole notion was a
                    groundless fancy.</p>
                <p>The book indited by Rusticiano the Pisan, which has preserved Marco Polo’s fame,
                    consists essentially of two parts. The first, or prologue, as it is termed, is
                    the only part unfortunately which consists of actual personal narrative. It
                    relates in a most interesting, though too brief, fashion the circumstances which
                    led the two elder Polos to the khan’s court, with those of their second journey
                    accompanied by Marco, and of the return to the West by the Indian seas and
                    Persia. The second and staple part of the book consists of a long series of
                    chapters of very unequal length and unsystematic structure, descriptive of the
                    different states and provinces of Asia, with occasional notices of their sights
                    and products, of curious manners and remarkable events, and especially regarding
                    the emperor Kublai, his court, wars, and administration. A series of chapters
                    near the close treats in a wordy and monotonous manner of sundry wars that took
                    place between various branches of the house of Jenghiz in the latter half of the
                    13th century. This last series is either omitted or greatly curtailed in all the
                    MS. copies and versions except one.</p>
                <p>It was long a doubtful question in what language the work was originally written.
                    That this had been some dialect of Italian was a natural presumption, and a
                    contemporary statement could be alleged in its favour. But there is now no doubt
                    that the original was French. This was first indicated by Count Baldelli-Boni,
                    who published an elaborate edition of two of the Italian texts at Florence in
                    1827, and who found in the oldest of these indisputable signs that it was a
                    translation from the French. The argument has since been followed up by others;
                    and a manuscript in rude and peculiar French, belonging to the National Library
                    of Paris, which was printed by the Société de Géographie in 1824, has been
                    demonstrated (as we need not hesitate to say) to be either the original or a
                    very close transcript of the original dictation. A variety of its
                    characteristics are strikingly indicative of the unrevised product of
                    dictation,'and are such as would necessarily have disappeared either in a
                    translation or in a revised copy. Many illustrations could be adduced of the
                    fact that the use of French was not a circumstance of a surprising or unusual
                    nature; for the language had at that time, in some points of view, even a wider
                    diffusion than at present<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n423/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0423-0408"/>, and examples of its literary employment by
                    writers who were not Frenchmen are very numerous. It is superfluous to allege
                    instances here, when we observe that Rusticiano himself, the scribe of the
                    narrative, was a compiler of French romances.</p>
                <p>Some eighty MSS. of the book are known, and their texts exhibit considerable
                    differences. These fall under four principal types. Of these type i. is found
                    completely only in that old French codex which has been mentioned. Type ii. is
                    shown by several valuable MSS. in purer French, the best of which formed the
                    basis of the edition prepared by the late Μ. Pauthier in 1865. It exhibits a
                    text pruned ana revised from the rude original, but without any exactness,
                    though perhaps under some general direction by Marco Polo himself, for an
                    inscription prefixed to one of the MSS. records the presentation of a copy by
                    the traveller himself to the Seigneur Thibault de Cepoy, a distinguished
                    Frenchman known to history, at Venice in the year 1306. Type iii. is that of a
                    Latin version prepared in Marco Polo’s lifetime, though without any sign of his
                    cognizance, by Francesco Pipino, a Dominican of Bologna, and translated from an
                    Italian copy. In this, condensation and curtailment are carried a good deal
                    further than in type ii. Some of the forms under which this type appears
                    curiously illustrate the effects of absence of effective publication, not only
                    before the invention of the press, but in its early days. Thus the Latin version
                    published by Grynaeus at Basel in the <hi rend="italic">Novus Orbis</hi> (1532)
                    is different in its language from Pipino’s, and yet is clearly traceable to that
                    as its foundation. In fact it is a retranslation into Latin from some version of
                    Pipino (Marsden thinks the Portuguese printed one of 1502). It introduces also
                    changes of its own, and is quite worthless as a text; and it is curious that
                    Andreas Muller, who in the 17 th century took much trouble with editing Polo
                    according to his lights, should have unfortunately chosen as his text this
                    fifth-hand version. It may be added that the French editions published in the
                    middle of the 16th century were translations from Grynaeus’s Latin. Hence they
                    complete this curious and vicious circle of translation —French, Italian,
                    Pipino’s Latin, Portuguese, Grynaeus’s Latin, French.</p>
                <p>The fourth type of text deviates largely from those already mentioned; its
                    history and true character are involved in obscurity. It is only represented by
                    the Italian version prepared for the press by G. B. Ramusio, with most
                    interesting preliminary dissertations, and published at Venice two years after
                    his death, in the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Navigationi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e Viaggi.</hi> Its peculiarities are great. Ramusio seems to imply
                    that he made some use of Pipino’s Latin, and various passages confirm this. But
                    many new circumstances, and anecdotes occurring in no other copy, are
                    introduced; many names assume a new shape; the whole style is more copious and
                    literary in character than that of any other version. Whilst a few of the
                    changes and interpolations seem to carry us further from the truth, others
                    contain facts of Asiatic nature or history, as well as of Polo’s alleged
                    experiences, which it is extremely difficult to ascribe to any hand but the
                    traveller’s own.</p>
                <p>We recognize to a certain extent tampering with the text, as in cases where the
                    proper names used by Polo have been identified, and more modern forms
                    substituted. In some other cases the editorial spirit has been more meddlesome
                    and has gone astray. Thus the age of young Marco has been altered to correspond
                    with a date which is itself erroneous. 0rmus is described as an island, contrary
                    to the old texts, and to the facts of its position in Polo’s time. In speaking
                    of the oil-springs of Caucasus the phrase “camelloads” has been substituted for
                    “ship-loads,” in ignorance that the site was Baku on the Caspian.</p>
                <p>But on the other hand there are a number of new circumstances certainly genuine,
                    which can hardly be ascribed to any one but Polo himself. We will quote one
                    only. This is the account which Ramusio’s version gives of the oppressions
                    exercised by Kublai’s Mohammedan minister Ahmed, telling how the Cathayans rose
                    against him and murdered him, with the addition that Messer Marco was on the
                    spot when all this happened. Not only is the whole story in substantial
                    accordance with the Chinese annals, even to the name of the chief conspirator
                    (<hi rend="italic">Vanchu</hi> in Ramusio, <hi rend="italic">Jf</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">ang-cheu</hi> in the Chinese
                    records), but the annals also tell of the courageous frankness of “Polo,
                    assessor of the privy council,” in opening Kublai’s eyes to the iniquities of
                    his agent.</p>
                <p>To sum up, we can hardly doubt that we have, imbedded in the text of this most
                    interesting edition of Ramusio’s, the supplementary recollections of the
                    traveller, noted down at a later period of his life, but perplexed by
                    translation and retranslation and editorial mistakes. The most important
                    desideratum still remaining in reference to Polo’s book is the recovery of the
                    original from which Ramusio derived the passages peculiar to his edition.</p>
                <p>That Marco Polo has been so universally recognized as the prince of mediaeval
                    travellers is due rather to the width of his experience, the vast compass of his
                    journeys, and the romantic nature of his personal history than to transcendent
                    superiority of character or capacity. Enthusiastic biographers, beginning with
                    Ramusio, have placed him on the same platform with Columbus. But he has left no
                    trace of the genius and lofty enthusiasm, the ardent and justified previsions,
                    which mark the great admiral as one of the lights of the human race. It is a
                    juster praise that the spur which his book eventually gave to geographical
                    studies, aud the beacons which it hung out at the eastern extremities of the
                    earth, helped to guide the aims, though hardly to kindle the fire of the greater
                    son of the rival republic. His work was at least a link in the providential
                    chain which at last dragged the New World to light.</p>
                <p>But Polo also was the first traveller to trace a route across the whole longitude
                    of Asia, naming and describing kingdom after kingdom, which he had seen with his
                    own eyes; the first to speak of the new and brilliant court which had been
                    establisheα at Peking; the first to reveal China in all its wealth and vastness,
                    and to tell us of the nations on its borders, with all their eccentricities of
                    manners and worship; the first to tell more of Tibet than its name, to speak of
                    Burmah, of Laos, of Siam, of Cochin-China, of Japan, of Java, of Sumatra, and of
                    other islands of the Great Archipelago, that museum of beauty and marvels, of
                    Nicobar and Andaman Islands with their naked savages, of Ceylon and its sacred
                    peak, of India, not as a dream-land of fables, but as a country seen and
                    partially explored; the first in mediaeval times to give any distinct account of
                    the secluded Christian empire of Abyssinia, and of the semi-Christian island of
                    Socotra, and to speak, however dimly, of Zanzibar, and of the vast and distant
                    Madagascar; whilst he carries us also to the remotely opposite region of Siberia
                    and the Arctic shores, to speak of dog-sledges, white bears, and reindeer-riding
                    Tunguses. That all this rich catalogue of discoveries (as they may fitly be
                    called) should belong to the revelation of one man and one book is ample ground
                    enough to justify a very high place in the roll of fame.</p>
                <p>Indeed it is remarkable in how large a proportion of the Old World modern
                    travellers and explorers have been but developing what Marco Polo indicated in
                    outline,—it might be said, without serious hyperbole, only travelling in his
                    footsteps, most certainly illustrating his geographical notices. At the moment
                    when these lines are written a British mission is starting to survey for
                    political reasons a tract upon the Oxus; Marco Polo traversed this tract. For
                    twenty years Russian and English explorers have been trying to solve the problem
                    of the Pamir watershed; Marco Polo explored it. Till within the last quarter
                    century the cities of eastern Turkestan, such as Kashgar, Yarkand, and Khotan,
                    were known only from the compilation of Oriental fragments; Marco had visited
                    them all. Within a shorter period dense darkness hung over the tracts between
                    western China and Upper Burmah; these also had been traversed by Marco Polo.
                    France is now scattering the brands of war in Tong-king, in Fuhkien, and in
                    Madagascar; all these were within Marco Polo’s knowledge and find mention in his
                    book. And how vast an area has he described from personal knowledge which
                    remains outside of the fields that we have indicated! Readers of the book would
                    welcome a little more of egotistical detail. Impersonality is carried to excess;
                    and we are often driven to discern only by indirect and doubtful induction
                    whether he is speaking of places from personal knowledge or from hearsay. In
                    truth, though there are delightful exceptions, and though nearly every part of
                    the book suggests interesting questions, a desperate meagreness and baldness
                    does affect considerable parts of the narrative. In fact his work reminds us
                    sometimes of his own description of Khorasan— “On chevauche par beaus plains et
                    belles costieres, là ou il a moult beaus herbages et bonne pasture et frais
                    assez . . . et aucune fois y treuve l’en un desert de soixante milles ou de
                    mains, esquel desers ne treuve l’en point d’eaue; mais la convient porter o lui
                    !”</p>
                <p>The diffusion of the book was hardly so rapid as has been sometimes alleged. It
                    is true that we know from Gilles Mallet’s catalogue of the books collected in
                    the Louvre by Charles V., dating c. 1370-75, that no less than five copies of
                    Marco Polo’s work were then in the collection; but on the other hand the number
                    spread over Europe of MSS. and early printed editions of Mandeville, with his
                    lying wonders, indicates a much greater popularity. Dante, who lived
                    twenty-three years after the book was dictated, and who touches so many things
                    in the seen and unseen worlds, never alludes to Polo, nor, we believe, to
                    anything that can be connected with him; nor can any trace of Polo be discovered
                    in the book of his contemporary Marino Sanudo the elder, though this worthy is
                    well acquainted with the work, later by some years, of Hay ton the Armenian, and
                    though many of the subjectson which he writes in his own book <hi rend="italic"

                    experiences. Perhaps indeed the most notable circumstance bearing in the same
                    direction is the fact that the author of Mandeville, whoever he really was, and
                    who plundered right and left, never plunders Polo, a thing only to be accounted
                    for by his being ignorant of Polo’s existence. The only literary work we know of
                    belonging to the 14th century which snows a thorough acquaintance with Polo’s
                    book is the poetical romance of <hi rend="italic">Baudouin</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de Sebourg,</hi> which borrows themes from it largely.</p>
                <p>Marco Polo contributed so vast an amount of new facts to the knowledge of the
                    earth’s surface, that one might have expected his <pb break="no"

                <p>book to have a sudden effect upon geography. But no such result occurred for a
                    long time. Doubtless several causes contributed to this, of which the unreal
                    character attributed to the book as a collection of romantic marvels, rather
                    than of geographical and historical facts, may have been one,—a view that the
                    diffusion of Mandeville’s fictions, far outdoing Polo’s facts in marvel, perhaps
                    tended to corroborate, whilst supplanting the latter in popularity. But the
                    essential causes were the imperfect nature of publication; the traditional
                    character of the prevailing geography, which hampered the propagation of true
                    statements; and the entire absence of scientific principle in what did pass for
                    geography, so that there was no organ competent to the assimilation of so huge a
                    mass of new knowledge.</p>
                <p>The late Sir Francis Palgrave wrote a book called <hi rend="italic">The Merchant
                    and the Friar,</hi> in which it is feigned that Marco Polo comes to England, and
                    becomes acquainted with Roger Bacon. Had Roger Bacon indeed known either the
                    traveller or his book, we cannot doubt, from the good use he makes, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Opus Majτιs,</hi> of William of Rubruk, that he would have turned
                    the facts to good account.</p>
                <p>But the world with which the map makers of the 13th and 14th centuries dealt was,
                    in its outline, that handed down by traditions of the craft, as sanctioned by
                    some fathers of the church, such as Orosius and Isidore, and sprinkled with a
                    combination of classical and mediaeval legends. Almost universally the earth’s
                    surface fills a circular disk, rounded by the ocean,—a fashion that already was
                    ridiculed by Herodotus (iv. 36), as it was in a later generation by Aristotle
                    <hi rend="italic">{Meteorol.,</hi> ii. 5). This was the most persistent and the
                    most obstructive dogma of the false geography. The central point of the circle
                    is occupied by Jerusalem, because it was found written in Ezekiel :—“Haec dicit
                    Dominus Deus, Ista est Jerusalem, in medio gentium posui eam, et in circuitu
                    ejus terras,”—supposed to be corroborated by the Psalmist’s expression, regarded
                    as prophetic of our Lord’s passion—“Deus autem Rex noster ante saecula operatus
                    est salutem in medio terrae” (Ps. lxxiv. 12). Paradise occupied the extreme
                    east, because it was found in Genesis that the Lord planted a garden eastward in
                    Eden. Gog and Magog were set in the far north or north-east because it was again
                    said in Ezekiel; ’ ‘ Ecce ago super te Gog principem capitis Mosoch et Thubal .
                    . . et ascendere te faciam de lateribus aquilonis.” This last legend of Gog and
                    Magog, shut up by a mountain-barrier, plays a prominent part in the romantic
                    history of Alexander, which had such enormous currency in those ages, and
                    attracted especial attention in the 13th century, owing to the general
                    identification of the Tartar hordes with those impure nations whom the hero had
                    shut up. It is not wonderful that the Tartar irruption into the West, heard of
                    at first with as much astonishment as it would produce now, was connected with
                    this old belief.</p>
                <p>The loose and scanty nomenclature of the cosmography was mainly borrowed from
                    Pliny and Mela, through such fathers as we have named; whilst vacant spaces were
                    occupied by Amazons, Arimaspians, and the realm of Prester J ohn. A favourite
                    representation of the inhabited earth was a great T within an 0 (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Map).</hi></p>
                <p>Such schemes of the world had no place for the new knowledge. The first genuine
                    attempt at a geographical compilation absolutely free from the traditional <hi
                    rend="italic">idola</hi> seems to be that in the <hi rend="italic">Portulano
                    Mediceo</hi> at Florence. In this, some slight use seems to be made of Polo. But
                    a far more important work is one of the next generation, the celebrated Catalan
                    map of 1375 in the Paris library. This also is an honest endeavour on a large
                    scale to represent the known world on the basis of collected facts, casting
                    aside all theories, pseudo-scientific and pseudo-theological; and a very
                    remarkable work it is. In this work Marco Polo’s influence on maps is perhaps
                    seen to the greatest advantage. As regards Central and Further Asia, and
                    partially as regards India, his book is the basis of the map. His names are
                    often much perverted, and it is not always easy to understand the view that the
                    compiler took of his itineraries. Still we have Cathay admirably placed in the
                    true position of China, as a great empire filling the south-east of Asia. The
                    trans-Gangetic peninsula is absent, but that of India proper is, for the first
                    time in the history of geography, represented with a fair approximation to
                    correct form and position. We really seem to see in this map something like the
                    idea of Asia that the traveller himself would have presented, had he bequeathed
                    us a map.</p>
                <p>In the following age we find more frequent indications that Polo’s book was
                    diffused and read. And now that the spirit of discovery was beginning to stir,
                    the work was regarded in a juster light as a book of facts, and not as a mere
                    <hi rend="italic">Romman du Grant Kaan.</hi> But the age produced new supplies
                    of information in greater abundance than the knowledge cf geographers was
                    prepared to digest or co-ordinate; and, owing partly to this, and partly to his
                    unhappy reversion to the fancy of a circular disk, the map of Fra Mauro (1459),
                    one of ’ the greatest map-making enterprises in history, and the result of
                    immense labour in the collection of facts and the endeavour to combine them,
                    really gives a much less accurate idea of Asia than the <hi rend="italic">Carta
                    Catalana.</hi></p>
                <p>When Μ. Libri, in his <hi rend="italic">Hist, des Sciences</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mathématiques,</hi> speaks of Columbus as “jealous of Polo’s laurels,” he
                    speaks rashly. In fact Columbus knew of Polo s revelations only at second-hand,
                    from the letters of the Florentine Paolo Toscanelli and the like; we cannot find
                    that he ever refers to Polo by name. Though, to the day of his death, Columbus
                    was full of imaginations about Zipangu (Japan) and the land of the Great Khan,
                    as being in immediate proximity to his discoveries, these were but accidents of
                    his great theory. It was his intimate conviction of the absolute smallness of
                    the earth, of the vast extension of Asia eastward, and of the consequent
                    narrowness of the western ocean on -which his life’s project was based.</p>
                <p>When, soon after the discovery of the New World, attempts were made to combine
                    the new and old knowledge, the results were unhappy. The earliest of such
                    combinations tried to realize the ideas of Columbus regarding the identity of
                    his discoveries with the Great Khan’s dominions; but even after America had
                    vindicated its independent existence, and the new knowledge of the Portuguese
                    had introduced China where the Catalan map had presented Cathay, the latter
                    country, with the whole of Polo’s nomenclature, was shunted to the north,
                    forming a separate system. Henceforward the influence of Polo’s work on maps was
                    simply injurious; and when to his names was added a sprinkling of Ptolemy’s, as
                    was usual throughout the 16th century, the result was a hotch-potch conveying no
                    approximation to any representation of facts.</p>
                <p>Gradually the contributions of Ptolemy and Polo are used more sparingly, but in
                    Sanson’s map (1659) a new element of confusion appears in numerous features
                    derived from the “Nubian Geographer,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Edrisi.</p>
                <p>It is needless to follow the matter further. With the increased knowledge of
                    northern Asia from the Russian side, and of China from the maps of Martini,
                    followed by the later Jesuit surveys, and with the real science brought to bear
                    on Asiatic geography by such men as De ΓIsle and D’An ville, mere traditional
                    nomenclature gradually disappeared; and the task which Polo has provided for the
                    geographers of later days has been chiefly that of determining the true
                    localities which his book describes under obsolete or corrupted names.</p>
                <p>Before concluding, a word or two seems necessary on the subject of the alleged
                    introduction of important inventions into Europe by Marco Polo. Assertions or
                    surmises of this kind have been made in regard to the mariner’s compass, to
                    gunpowder, and to printing. Though the old assertions as to the first two are
                    still occasionally repeated in books of popular character, no one who has paid
                    any attention to the subject now believes Marco can have had anything to do with
                    their introduction. But there is no doubt that the resemblance of early European
                    block-books to those of China is in some respects so striking that it seems
                    clearly to indicate the derivation of the art from that country. There is,
                    however, not the slightest reason for connecting this introduction with the name
                    of Polo. His fame has so overshadowed later travellers that the fact has been
                    generally overlooked that for some years in the 14th century not only were
                    missions of the Roman church established in the chief cities of eastern China,
                    but a regular overland trade was carried on between Italy and China, by way of
                    Tana (Azoff), Astrakhan, Otrar, Kamul (Kami), and Kan-chow. Many a traveller
                    other than Marco Polo might have brought home the block-books, and some might
                    have witnessed the process of making them. This is the less to be ascribed to
                    Polo, because he so curiously omits to speak of the process of printing, when,
                    in describing the block-printed paper-money of China, his subject seems
                    absolutely to challenge a description of the art. (H. Y. )</p>
