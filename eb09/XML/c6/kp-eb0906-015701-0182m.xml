                    part of the town is about a mile and a half in circuit, and occupies a rocky
                    promontory of but slight elevation, surrounded on three sides by the sea, and
                    protected on the land side by a lake, a moat, and drawbridges. The Galle Face
                    affords a favourite promenade for the European population; Pettah is mainly
                    inhabited by natives and half castes; and Colpetty is a beautiful suburb. Most
                    of the streets are finely shaded with a species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hibiscus</hi> planted by the Dutch; and the most of the older European houses
                    bear the marks of Dutch occupation. Colombo contains the Government offices and
                    courts, and is the residence of the civil and military authorities, the seat of
                    a Church of England bishop, and a centre for Roman Catholic, Wesleyan, Baptist,
                    and other missionary organizations. The principal buildings are the Government
                    or Queen’s House, the court-house, the town-hall, the lunatic asylum, the
                    lazaretto, the military barracks and hospitals at Galle Face, Wellicadde jail,
                    and Wolfendahl church; among the public institutions may be mentioned St
                    Thomas’s college and collegiate school, founded by Bishop Chapman in 1821;
                    Wesley college; the industrial school; the medical school, established in 1870,
                    with six scholarships attached; a branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, with a
                    museum; the United Service library; the military-medical and the
                    colonial-medical libraries and museums; the Pettah library, established in 1829;
                    the agri-horticultural society; and the model farm inaugurated by Prince Alfred.
                    The cinnamon gardens and the circular walk are pleasant places of resort; the
                    former date from the Dutch occupation, and were long celebrated for their beauty
                    and luxuriance. The town is supplied with gas and water by a company incor
                    porated under Acts passed in 1862 and 1867. The principal articles of
                    manufacture in Colombo are coffee, oil, and coir; the first of these especially
                    keeps a large number of mills in operation. There are also a good many saw-mills
                    in the town and neighbourhood, and the Government maintains a foundry and
                    ironworks. The supply of ice is in the hands of a company. The harbour is small,
                    and the roadstead is safe only during the south-east monsoon, but various
                    improvements now in progress promise to make Colombo one of the chief ports of
                    Southern India. The first stone of a great breakwater was laid by the Prince of
                    Wales in 1875. The population of Colombo is of very various origin :—Sinhalese,
                    Parsees, Chinese, Malabars, Arabs, Persians, Kaffirs, Afghans, descendants of
                    Portuguese and Dutch, and half castes of all colours. . In 1874 the total number
                    of inhabitants was given as 97,129, of whom 42,160 were Sinhalese, 22,389 Moors,
                    20,633 Tamils and Chatties, and 1765 Europeans. Colombo was originally known as
                    the Kalantotta or Kalany ferry. By the Arabs the name was changed to Kalambu,
                    and the town is mentioned by Ibn Batuta about 1340 as the largest and finest in
                    Serendib. In 1517 the Portuguese effected a settlement, and in 1520 they
                    fortified their port and bade defiance to the native besiegers. In 1586 the town
                    was again invested by Raja Singh, but without success. On its capture by the
                    Dutch in 1656 it was a flourishing colony with convents of five religious
                    orders, churches, and public offices, inhabited by no fewer than 900 noble
                    families and 1500 families dependant on mercantile or political occupations. In
                    1796 it was surrendered to the British.</p>
