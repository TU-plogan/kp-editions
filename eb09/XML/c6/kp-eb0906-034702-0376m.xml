                <p><label type="entry">COPPER</label> is a metal which has been known to and used by
                    the human race from the most remote periods. Its alloy with tin (bronze) was the
                    first metallic compound in common use by mankind, and so extensive and
                    characteristic was its employment at an early stage in pre-historic times that
                    the epoch is known in archaeological chronology as the Bronze Age. Metallic
                    relics of that age in the form of arms, ornaments, and domestic implements are
                    still very abundant. By the Greeks and Romans both the metal and its alloys were
                    indifferently known as <hi rend="italic">χaλκoς</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >aes.</hi> As, according to Pliny, the Roman supply was chiefly drawn from
                    Cyprus, it came to be termed <hi rend="italic">aes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cyprium,</hi> which was gradually shortened to <hi rend="italic">cyprium,</hi>
                    and corrupted into <hi rend="italic">cuprum,</hi> whence comes our copper, the
                    French <hi rend="italic">cuivre,</hi> and the German <hi rend="italic"
                    >kupfer.</hi></p>
                <p>Copper (chemically, <hi rend="italic">Cuprum,</hi> Cu) is a brilliant metal of a
                    peculiar red colour, in which respect it differs from all others excepting,
                    perhaps, titanium. The atomic weight of copper is 63 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 3, and its specific gravity varies between 8 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 91 and 8 ’ 95, according to the treatment to which it may have been
                    subjected. It takes a brilliant polish, is in a high degree malleable and
                    ductile, and in tenacity it only falls short of iron, exceeding in that quality
                    both silver and gold. By different authorities its melting point is stated at
                    from 1000° C. to 1398° C. In electric conductivity it stands next to silver; the
                    conducting power of silver being equal to 100, that of perfectly pure copper is
                    given by Matthiessen as 96 ’ 4 at 13° C. On solidifying from its molten
                    condition it expands. Copper is not affected by exposure in dry air, but in a
                    moist atmosphere it becomes coated with green carbonate. When heated or rubbed
                    it emits a peculiar disagreeable odour.</p>
                <p>Copper, according to Walchner, is as widely distributed in nature as iron, and
                    occurs in all soils, and ferruginous mineral waters and ores. It has been
                    discovered in seaweed; in the blood of certain Cephalopoda and Ascidia, and of a
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Limulus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in straw, hay,
                    eggs, cheese, meat, and other food-stuffs; in the liver and kidneys, and, in
                    traces, in the blood of man and other animals; it has also been shown by Church
                    to exist to the extent of 5 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9 per cent, in
                    turacin, the colouring-matter of the wing-feathers of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tτιraco.</hi> The ores containing copper in sufficient proportion to render its
                    extraction economically practicable are numerous. It occurs not unfrequently
                    native, sometimes in very great masses, as on the south shores of Lake Superior,
                    where pieces of 150 tons weight have sometimes been obtained. Native copper most
                    frequently occurs in masses of irregular form in rocky fissures, and often
                    crystallized. The principal ores of copper are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cuprite,</hi><hi rend="italic">Melaconite,</hi><hi rend="italic">Malachite,

                    or red oxide of copper,. Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, is a mineral which
                    crystallizes in the cubic system, and contains 88 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    78 of metal. It occurs in most cupriferous mines, but never by, itself in large
                    quantities. Melaconite, or black oxide of copper, CuO, contains, when pure, 79
                    <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 85 of the metal. It was formerly largely worked
                    in the Lake Superior region, and is abundant in some of the mines of Tennessee
                    and the Mississippi valley. Malachite, or green carbonate of copper, CuCO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, Cu(HO) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is a beautiful
                    and valuable ore containing about 56 per cent, of the metal; it is obtained in
                    very large quantities from South Australia, Siberia, and other localities.
                    Frequently intermixed with the green carbonate is the blue carbonate of copper,
                    chessylite or azurite, 2CuCO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, Cu(H0) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, an ore containing when pure 55*16 per cent, of the
                    metal. It was formerly characteristic of Chessy, near Lyons. Atacamite is a
                    hydrated oxychloride of copper, occurring chiefly in Chili and Peru; it
                    crystallizes in the rhombic system. Chrysocolla is a hydrated silicate of
                    copper, CuSiO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O,
                    containing in the pure state 30 per cent, of the metal; it is an abundant ore in
                    Chili, Wisconsin, and Missouri. The sulphur compounds of copper are, however,
                    the most valuable in an economical point of view. Chalcocite, redruthite,
                    copper-glance, or vitreous copper, is a sulphide, Cu <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> S, containing very nearly 80 per cent, of copper. Copper pyrites, or
                    chalcopyrite, a sulphide of copper and iron, CuFeS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    crystallizes in the pyramidal system and contains 34 ’ 6 per cent, of copper
                    when pure; but many of the ores, such as those worked specially by wet processes
                    on account of the presence of a large proportion of sulphide of iron, contain
                    less than 5 per cent, of copper. Cornish ores are almost entirely pyritous; and
                    indeed it is from such ores that by far the largest proportion of copper is
                    extracted throughout the world. In Cornwall copper lodes usually run east and
                    west. They occur both in the <hi rend="italic">killas</hi> or clay-slate, and in
                    the <hi rend="italic">growan</hi> or granite. Erubescite, bornite, or horseflesh
                    ore is a sulphide of copper andiron much richer in copper than the ordinary
                    pyrites, and containing 56 or 57 or, according to the formula FeCu <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, 62 <hi rend="italic"
                    >5</hi> per cent, of copper. Tetrahedrite, fahlerz, or grey copper, a sulphide
                    crystallizing in the cubical system, contains from 30 to 48 per cent, of copper,
                    with arsenic, antimony, iron, and sometimes zinc, silver, or mercury. The
                    numerous other compounds of copper have more interest from a mineralogical than
                    from a metallurgical point of view.</p>
                <p>Copper is obtained from its ores by two principal methods, which may be
                    denominated—(1) the pyro-metallurgical or dry method, and (2) the
                    hydro-metallurgical or wet method; and a small proportion of metallic copper is
                    procured by (3) the electro-metallurgical method.</p>
                <p>The methods of working vary according to the nature of the ores treated and local
                    circumstances. The dry method, or ordinary smelting, cannot be profitably
                    practised with <pb break="no"

                    for which and for still poorer ores the wet process is preferred.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Smelting.</hi> —In Great Britain ordinary copper smelting is
                    almost entirely centred at Swansea in Wales, although it is also practised in
                    Lancashire. The processes there employed for extracting copper are technically
                    known as the “English method,” in contradistinction to numerous other modified
                    processes adopted at Continental and other foreign smelting centres. The
                    following is an outline of the English method as conducted at Swansea.</p>
                <p>The ores are divided by the smelter into two general classes—those containing
                    sulphur, and those having little or no sulphur. The former are subdivided
                    according as they contain much silica, iron pyrites, tin, arsenic, &amp;c., or a
                    larger or smaller quantity of copper. The object of this classification of ores
                    in the yard is to enable the operative smelter to make up a constant working
                    mixture, having the following characters :—</p>
                <p>1. The copper present is not under 9 nor above 14 per cent.; if under the former
                    it would be unprofitably poor; if over the latter, the slags would have a
                    tendency to retain copper, creating a loss.</p>
                <p>2. After being calcined for an ordinary length of time, it will fuse easily
                    without the necessity of adding flux, giving a clean and easily fused slag.</p>
                <p>3. The mat or coarse metal obtained from fusion contains as nearly as possible 30
                    per cent of copper.</p>
                <p>4. The mixture does not contain ores having impurities calculated to make the
                    copper of too low a quality.</p>
                <p>There is no definite or fixed rule to guide the smelter in these classifications,
                    except a practised eye in distinguishing the character of ores, and the report
                    of the assayer.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Calcination of the Ores.—</hi> The mixture of ores being
                    selected according to these rules, it is carried to hoppers on the top of a
                    large reverberatory furnace, termed the calcining furnace, and is then let down
                    into the hearth, where, after drying a little, it is spread equally over the
                    bottom, and covered to a depth of from 6 to 8 inches. The quantity of ore put in
                    varies, according to the size of the furnace, from 3 tons to 4 tons. The fire of
                    the furnace is kept low at first; after two or three hours the ore on the sur
                    face becomes visibly red, and the heat is gradually increased to a yellow red;
                    but this heat penetrates to the depth of only about 2 inches, consequently the
                    ore has to be stirred and turned over by means of long iron paddles every hour,
                    so as to expose a new surface to the action of the air and fire. The calcination
                    lasts generally from twelve to twenty-four hours, the length of time being
                    dependent on the proportions of silica and sulphide of iron in the charge.
                    Calcining furnaces are now very commonly provided .with Siemens regenerators and
                    heated with gas. The following changes take place :—the sulphur is partly burned
                    off, forming sulphurous and sulphuric acids, and partly volatilized in the free
                    state; arsenic is volatilized and oxidized; and part of the copper and iron lose
                    sulphur and combine with oxygen, forming oxides.</p>
                <p>When the ore is sufficiently calcined, it is let down into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cubs</hi> or vaults beneath, by openings in the floor. Water is added to the
                    hot ore in the cubs to prevent dust and assist further oxidation; the ore is
                    then removed to a yard, and there stored up, ready for the fusing furnace. The
                    following analysis of ore, before and after calcining, will give an idea of the
                    changes that have taken place :—</p>

                <p>When oxides and carbonates, such as the Australian ores, are on hand, they are

                <p>The composition of the slag from this operation is very variable; it always
                    contains copper, and has to be remelted.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Roasting.—</hi> This operation has been often identified
                    with calcining, from which, however, it is distinct. The roasting differs from
                    the fusing furnace by having a large opening in the side for putting in the
                    charge, and it is furnished with more air-holes in the bridge. The charge for an
                    ordinary-sized furnace is 3 tons. When the metal is brought to fusion, the
                    air-holes of the furnace are all opened, and a free current is allowed to pass
                    over the surface of the fused mass: the heat of the fire is then regulated so as
                    to keep the charge in a sort of semi-fluid state. This is continued for about
                    twenty-four hours, during which a great portion of the sulphur is driven off,
                    and the iron, by uniting with silica and other matters, forms scoria, which is
                    from time to time skimmed off. When all the impurities are removed, and the mat
                    or regulus acquires the composition of sulphide of copper, Cu <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S, then (except when the regulus has been very rich)
                    begins another operation termed the second roasting, or roasting proper,
                    requiring other twenty-four hours. In this last roasting, when the air-holes are
                    opened, a brisk effervescence ensues over the surface of the fluid mass.</p>
                <p>The chemical reactions which give rise to this effervescence may be explained
                    thus, The oxygen of the air combines in the first place with a portion of the
                    sulphur. forming sulphurous acid. A portion of the copper is also oxidized, to
                    form the sub-oxide, and instantly reacts upon another portion of the sulphide,
                    reducing the metal. The reactions are chemically represented thus :—</p>
                <p>2Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O + Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S = 6Cu +
                    SO,.</p>
                <p>The process is a very beautiful one, and exhibits a nice adaptation of principles
                    to practice. The sponge regulus has a specific gravity of 5, the reduced copper
                    of about 8; so that the copper sinks to the bottom, where it is protected, and a
                    new surface of regulus becomes exposed to the action of the air.</p>
                <p>If the ore be pure, or if no <hi rend="italic">select</hi> copper be required,
                    the operation of roasting is continued until the whole of the copper is reduced;
                    when it is tapped out into sand-moulds, forming <hi rend="italic">coarse copper,
                    bed copper, pimpled copper,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">blistered copper,</hi>
                    according to quality. The term, <hi rend="italic">coarse copper</hi> is applied
                    occasionally to all these kinds except the blistered. If the ingot sets with
                    contraction and exhibits a smooth hollow surface, it is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >bed,</hi> and generally indicates the presence of other metals, as tin. When
                    the surface of the ingot is covered with pimples, it is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >pimpled</hi> copper, and indicates the presence of sulphur. When covered with
                    large scales of oxide of copper, it is termed <hi rend="italic">blistered;</hi>
                    but this is only when the copper is good and ready for refining. The following
                    analysis of blister copper is given by Le Play :—</p>

                <p>To make select copper, the roasting is carried on until about one-fourth of the
                    copper in the regulus is reduced; the furnace is then tapped, and the reduced
                    metal is obtained at the bottom of the first and second ingots, or pigs, as <hi
                    rend="italic">copper bottoms,</hi> which contain most of the metallic
                    impurities. The regulus is collected and again roasted, which produces the
                    purest metal the ordinary process of smelting can give; it is termed <hi
                    rend="italic">best selected.</hi></p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Refining.—</hi> In this operation, the remainder of the
                    sulphur and foreign metals present in the copper is removed, and the metal is
                    brought into a condition fit for the market. The refining furnace is similar in
                    general form to a roasting furnace, except that the bottom inclines gradually
                    down from all sides towards a deep part, or well, which is near the end door. It
                    has also a large door on one side, but neither opening in the roof nor side
                    tap-hole. Siemens’s regenerative furnace has been very generally introduced for
                    refinery purposes. When the copper is to be finally ladled out of the furnace
                    the deep part, or well, allows of the ladle being dipped into the metal till the
                    last portions are quite baled out. From 6 to 8 tons of copper from the roasting
                    furnace are put into the refining furnace, the doors and air-holes of which are
                    closed, and the heat is raised until the metal is in fusion, when the air-holes
                    are opened. A short roasting is generally required, which is done in the manner
                    above described, and the scoria which collects is carefully skimmed off. The
                    separation of impurities is facilitated by occasionally stirring the metal with
                    a rake. Some refiners throw pieces of green wood upon the surface, under the
                    impression that it assists the escape of sulphur. The roasting is continued
                    until a ladleful of the metal taken out sets with contraction. If the metal be
                    very coarse, it will set with a surface having a frothy appearance; if finer, it
                    sets with expansion, first round the edge, then swelling towards the centre,
                    forming a little mound or cone, and occasionally boiling over and throwing up
                    jets of metal, forming a miniature volcano. When the setting of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n379/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0379-0350"/> metal in the ladle is favourable, the charge is
                    ready for the operation of <hi rend="italic">poling.</hi> A quantity of charcoal
                    or anthracite coal is first thrown upon the metal to prevent oxidation by the
                    air, and then the end of a large pole of green wood, generally of birch or oak,
                    is inserted into the melted copper, and kept pressed down to the bottom of the
                    metal, which spurts and boils violently. This operation, it will be at once
                    apparent, consists in the reduction of an oxide or suboxide. Since oxide of
                    copper dissolves in metallic copper, as a salt dissolves in water, and makes it
                    brittle, to put pieces of wood or charcoal upon the surface would not remove the
                    oxygen; hence the necessity of poling, in order to bring the carbonaceous
                    matters into contact with the dissolved oxide. As the poling proceeds the
                    refiner takes from time to time small samples called assays, which he hammers
                    and breaks for examination. When the copper reaches the proper “pitch” the assay
                    bends without breaking, and if cut and broken the fracture is fibrous, and
                    presents a silky lustre. When this pitch is attained the pole is withdrawn, and
                    a quantity of charcoal thrown upon the surface; and, if the copper is for
                    rolling or hammering, a little lead is added to the charges to insure
                    toughness.</p>
                <p>In making what is termed best selected copper, the refining is performed in the
                    manner described, but no lead is added. This quality of copper is used for the
                    manufacture of fine alloys, such as the best brass, or Muntz’s yellow metal.
                    Copper a little over-poled is generally preferred for these purposes.</p>
                <p>When the copper is brought to the proper pitch by the refining operation it is
                    ladled out into moulds. The following are the forms in which British smelted
                    copper is usually cast :—</p>

                <p>During the ladling out the refiner takes an assay at short intervals, as the

                    depends upon refining, that the best copper by a defect in this operation will
                    be rendered unmarketable.</p>
                <p>A great variety of improvements in copper-smelting have been proposed and
                    patented, one or two of which have been usefully applied. Several modifications
                    of the various processes are also adopted, to suit the quality of the ores and
                    the kind of copper to be produced. These are all suggested by the experience of
                    the smelters in dealing with the materials at their disposal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wet Processes.</hi> —Several methods of extracting copper by
                    the wet way have been more or less in practice at various periods; but it is
                    only of recent years that one of these has been established on a scale of great
                    commercial extent and importance. From a very early time it has been known that
                    the water which drained from mines containing ρyritous copper ores, and which
                    from the oxidation of the sulphide of copper contained some proportion of cupric
                    sulphate, yielded metallic copper by precipitation in the presence of malleable
                    or cast iron. The copper obtained in this way is known as cementation copper,
                    and from the Spanish and Portuguese pyrites mines a considerable amount of
                    metallic copper has long been so precipitated. The process now very extensively
                    adopted for treating Spanish and Portuguese pyrites, and some ores of similar
                    composition from other countries is that patented by Mr William Henderson in
                    1859. Mr Henderson’s process is in several essential particulars the same as one
                    patented in 1842 by Mr William Longmaid, which, however, was chiefly designed
                    for the production of sulphate of soda, copper being only a by-product. There
                    can be no doubt that Mr Henderson is the practical originator of the wet
                    process, which in Great Britain now occupies a most important position among
                    metallurgical industries.</p>
                <p>The ores treated by the Henderson process are remarkably constant in character,
                    and the following may be taken as representing their average composition :—</p>

                <p>The pyrites is first employed by alkali manufacturers and other consumers of
                    sulphuric acid as a source of that substance, in burning for which the ore loses
                    about 30 per cent, of its weight. It is this burnt pyrites which forms the raw
                    material of the process. The various stages it undergoes are briefly as
                    under.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Grinding.—</hi> The burnt ore, as received from the acid
                    burners, is first mixed with about 15 per cent, of common salt, and ground to a
                    fine powder by passing it between a pair of heavy cast-iron rolls. As the amount
                    of sulphur left in the burnt ore is apt to vary, it is necessary to ascertain
                    its proportion in each parcel of burnt pyrites. When the sulphur falls short of
                    the proportion necessary for effecting the decomposition which follows, a
                    sufficient quantity of “green” or unburned pyrites, is added to produce a proper
                    balance. If, on the other hand, the sulphur has been insufficiently extracted,
                    “dead” roasted ore is added.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Calcination.—</hi> This operation is accomplished in
                    several kinds of furnaces, that used by the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Company
                    being a large muffle or close furnace. By others a patent furnace with a
                    revolving hearth and mechanical stirring arrangement has been adopted with good
                    results; and some use open reverberatory furnaces heated by gas from Siemens’s
                    generators. During the roasting the mixture is frequently stirred, and, in the
                    case of hand-worked furnaces, turned with long rabbles, and the completion of
                    the operation is ascertained by test assays. When the copper has been brought
                    into a soluble condition, the charge is raked out of the furnace and permitted
                    to cool under a screen at its mouth. By the calcination the sulphur in the
                    compound is first oxidized, sulphate of sodium is formed, and at the same time
                    the chlorine from the sodium chloride unites with the copper to form cupric
                    chloride. A small proportion of cuprous chloride is also formed, and special
                    precautions have to be taken to prevent the extensive formation of this
                    compound, which is dissolved only with difficulty. The hydrochloric acid and
                    other gaseous products evolved during the calcination are condensed as “tower
                    liquor” in ordinary condensing towers, and the product is used in the subsequent
                    process of lixiviation.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Lixiviation.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The calcined ore
                    is conveyed to tightly-caulked wooden tanks, in which it receives repeated
                    washings with hot water, tower liquor, and dilute hydrochloric acid, till all
                    the soluble copper is thereby extracted. The product of the later washings is
                    pumped or drawn up by a modification of Giffard’s injector, to serve as a first
                    liquor for subsequent charges of the lixiviating tanks, and no solution under a
                    definite strength is permitted to pass on to the next stage in the process. The
                    insoluble residue in the tanks consists of “purple ore,” an almost pure ferric
                    oxide, largely used in “fettling” blast furnaces, and for smelting purposes;
                    besides which it is available as jeweller’s rouge.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Precipitation.—</hi> The precipitation of metallic copper
                    from the solution of its chloride is accomplished in large <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n380/mode/1up"

                    that cementation copper is obtained from solutions of the sulphate. The solution
                    is run into the tanks, in which there are miscellaneous heaps of old malleable
                    iron; the chlorine combined with the copper unites with the iron, and metallic
                    copper in a state of fine division is thrown down. The completion of the
                    precipitation is ascertained by dipping a bright steel knife into the solution
                    in the tank, and when no deposit of copper covers the steel the liquor is run
                    off and a new charge conveyed into the tank. The tanks are drained periodically
                    for removing the precipitate, which is first roughly separated from small pieces
                    of iron, after which it is more thoroughly freed from iron, &lt;kc., by washing
                    in water in a rocking sieve apparatus. The precipitate so obtained should
                    contain 80 per cent, of metallic copper, which is either smelted directly for
                    blister copper, or may be fused with the white metal of the ordinary smelting
                    process, and subsequently roasted.</p>
                <p>It has been found possible to extract in this process with profit the small
                    proportions of lead, silver, and gold which Spanish pyrites is known to contain.
                    Two processes are in operation for this purposes—one devised by Mr F. Claudet
                    and the other by Mr W. Henderson, the original patentee of the wet process. The
                    liquors from the first three washings contain practically all these metals, and
                    they alone are treated. Mr Claudet precipitates them from the solution by means
                    of iodide of potassium. Mr Henderson dilutes his solutions to from 20° to 25°
                    Twaddell, and adds a very weak solution of a lead salt, such as the acetate, by
                    which he obtains a cream-coloured precipitate containing about 53 per cent, of
                    lead, 5 or 6 per cent, of silver, and 3 oz. of gold to each ton of the
                    precipitate.</p>
                <p>The importance of the wet process may be estimated from the fact that although it
                    originated only in 1860, already 14,000 tons of copper are annually produced by
                    it in Great Britain alone, out of an annual production for the whole world
                    estimated at from 126,000 to 130,000 tons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alloys of Copper.</hi> —Copper unites with facility with
                    almost all other metals, and a large number of its compounds are of the highest
                    importance in the arts. Indeed copper is much more important and valuable as a
                    constituent element in numerous alloys than it is as pure metal. The principal
                    alloys in which it forms a leading ingredient are—1st, brass; 2d, bronze; and
                    3d, German or nickel silver; and under these several heads their respective
                    applications and qualities will be found. These alloys are each much diversified
                    as regards the relative proportions of the various metals which enter into their
                    constitution, and these differences similarly modify the appearance and physical
                    properties of the compounds. In this way for practical purposes they may be
                    regarded as a great number of separate metals, each possessed of distinct
                    qualities which fit it for special industrial uses. The following tables,
                    compiled from various authorities, represent the analysis of typical examples of
                    the several alloys: —</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Salts of Copper.</hi> —Several salts of copper possess
                    considerable industrial value, chiefly for the formation of blue and green
                    pigments, in dyeing and calico-printing, and fur the deposition of metallic
                    copper by electro-metallurgy, &amp;c. The principal salts of copper are the
                    acetate, the carbonate, and the sulphate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acetate of Copper</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Verdigris.—</hi>
                    This salt is found in commerce in the two forms of basic and neutral acetate.
                    The principal seat of the manufacture of the basic acetate is Montpellier in
                    France, where the marc and other refuse of grapes, after the expression of the
                    juice for wine-making, is employed as a source of the acetic acid necessary.
                    Sheets of copper are placed among this refuse, and these soon become coated with
                    a deposit of verdigris, which has only to be scraped off, kneaded up with water,
                    and pressed into cakes. The neutral salt is prepared from basic acetate by
                    dissolving it in pyroligneous acid (wood vinegar) and evaporating the solution
                    to the crystallizing point. It is also formed by the double decomposition of the
                    acetates of lead and calcium with sulphate of copper. Verdigris is much used as
                    a pigment both in oil and water-colour painting and in dyeing, and as a basis of
                    compound pigments.</p>

                    copper, as well as by various other processes. The sulphate of copper is very
                    largely used as a basis for the preparation of other copper compounds, in
                    electrometallurgy, in calico-printing, and in the American amalgamation method
                    of extracting silver from its ores. In medicine it is employed as an emetic. On

                <p>Of pigments other than those above-mentioned having a copper basis, there may be
                    enumerated the native carbonate, mountain or mineral green; Brunswick green, an
                    oxychloride obtained by moistening copper foil exposed to the atmosphere with
                    hydrochloric acid or solution of ammonium chloride; Scheele’s green (Cu <hi

                    copper. Casselmann’s green, a pigment discovered in 1865, is a compound of
                    cupric sulphate with potassium or sodium acetate. While it almost rivals
                    Schweinfurt green in brilliancy, it possesses the advantage of being entirely
                    free from arsenic, which renders the latter pigment and Scheele’s green so
                    virulently poisonous. At the same time it must be remembered that all copper
                    compounds are poisonous, although the preparations that do not contain arsenic
                    are not so deleterious in their manufacture and applications as are the others.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(j. pa.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Copper Assaying.</hi> —In
                    the Cornish method of assaying there are five operations,—the fusion for
                    regulus, the roasting of the regulus, fusion for coarse copper, refining, and
                    the cleaning of the slags. (1) The sample of ore is first inspected to ascertain
                    its quality, and is then reduced to powder. If too much sulphur is present it
                    may be expelled by roasting the ore, or by using nitre in the fusion; in some
                    cases it may be requisite to add sulphur in order to obtain a good regulus. A
                    flux is employed consisting usually of lime, borax, fluor-spar, and glass, which
                    form a slag with the excess of iron in the ore. The button of regulus obtained
                    must be such that it separates easily from the slag without breaking. (2) The
                    regulus ground to a fine powder is next roasted for from 20 to 30 minutes, the
                    heat applied being raised towards the end of the operation; the sulphides of
                    iron and copper are thus converted into oxides. (3) In the fusion for coarse
                    copper a flux of sodium bicarbonate with tartar or borax and nitre is employed;
                    a button of metallic copper is obtained which breaks with a fine-grained and
                    greyish or orange-coloured fracture. (4) Refining consists first in the fusion
                    of the button of coarse copper and the oxidation by the air of sulphur and
                    foreign metals present in it; secondly, in the addition of refining flux, with
                    the production of <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> copper, or copper <hi rend="italic"
                    >at tough pitch.</hi> Commonly a flux of three parts by measure of tartar, two
                    of nitre, and a little salt is melted in the crucible employed for the previous
                    operation, and into it the button of coarse copper is dropped; the surface of
                    the fused copper having become clear of oxides, a little refining flux is now
                    added, and in about a couple of minutes the contents of the crucible are
                    transferred to the mould. (5) The slags from the two last operations are mixed
                    with tartar or charcoal and fused; and the weight of the small prills or shots
                    of copper obtained is ascertained. Assaying by the wet way is usually conducted
                    by treating a weighed sample of the ore with nitric acid, neutralizing with
                    ammonia, and adding standard solution of potassium cyanide till the blue colour
                    of the liquid is discharged, copper-ammonium-cyanide, free ammonium cyanide,
                    ammonium formate, and urea being produced. Silver, nickel, cobalt, and zinc may
                    interefere with the estimation of the copper by this method; the first may be
                    removed by adding a little hydrochloric acid; from the three other metals the
                    copper can be freed by precipitating it as sulphide by means of sodium
                    thiosulphate, the sulphide obtained being decomposed by nitric acid, and the
                    copper estimated by ammonia and potassium cyanide in the usual manner. Before
                    analysis by the wet way it is often advisable to roast the copper ore in order
                    to expel sulphur. Steinbeck’s p'rocess for determining the amount of copper in
                    poor ores and schists consists in the treatment of the pulverized rock with
                    hydrochloric acid, digestion in the cold, subsequent boiling with nitric acid,
                    precipitation of the copper from the resulting solution by zinc in presence of
                    platinum, and finally the titration of a solution of the precipitated copper. Dr
                    Haen’s method of estimation is based upon the formation of free iodine when
                    excess of potassium iodide is mixed with solution of a copper salt,—the
                    sulphate, for example. Copper is estimated gravimetrically in the metallic
                    state, as in Luckow’s electrolytical process; as cuprous sulphide, Cu <hi

                    cupric salts. Before the blowpipe, copper compounds give with microcosmic salt
                    or borax a green bead, which becomes blue on cooling; when ignited on charcoal
                    in the inner flame with sodium carbonate and cyanide, they aflbrd scales of
                    metallic copper; most of them, also, when heated in the inner, impart to the
                    outer flame a brilliant green coloration.</p>
