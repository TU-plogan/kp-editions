                    to the date of his birth, for there is no clear evidence on the subject, nor as
                    to his age at the time of his martyrdom, which took place on the 14th September
                    258. He was of patrician family, and highly educated, and for some time occupied
                    as a teacher of rhetoric in Carthage, in the neighbourhood of which he was born.
                    He had either inherited or acquired considerable wealth. Of an enthusiastic
                    temperament, accomplished in classical literature and the rhetorical art which
                    he taught, he seems while a pagan to have courted discussion with the converts
                    to Christianity. Confident in his own powers, he entered ardently into what was
                    no doubt the great question of the time at Carthage as elsewhere. He sought to
                    vanquish, but was himself vanquished by, the new religious force which was
                    making such rapid inroads on the decaying paganism of the Roman empire.
                    Caecilius, a presbyter of Carthage, is supposed to have been the instrnment of
                    his conversion, and he assumed this name accordingly at his baptism, which seems
                    to have taken place about 245 or 246.</p>
                <p>Cyprian carried all his natural enthusiasm and brilliant powers into his new
                    profession. He devoted his wealth to the relief of the poor and other pious
                    uses; and so, according to his deacon Pontius, who wrote a diffuse and vague
                    account of his “life and passion,” “realized two benefits— the contempt of the
                    world’s ambition, and the observance of that mercy which God has preferred to
                    sacrifice.” The result of his charity and activity as a Christian convert was
                    his unanimous call by the Christian people to the head of the church in
                    Carthage. “His reluctant diffidence was overpowered by the acclamations of the
                    whole city, who environed his house and compelled him by their friendly violence
                    to assume the distinguished and, it might be, dangerous office. He yielded to
                    preserve the peace of the city.”</p>
                <p>The time was still one of fierce persecution directed against the Christians
                    according to the temper or caprice of the Roman emperors; and the head of the
                    church at Carthage became a prominent object of attack. During the persecution
                    of Decius in 250 he was exposed to imminent danger, and was compelled for a time
                    to seek safety in retreat. Under Gallus, the successor of Decius, the
                    persecution was relaxed, and Cyprian returned to Carthage. Here he held several
                    councils for the discussion of the affairs of the church, especially for grave
                    questions as to the rebaptism of heretics, and the re-admission into the church
                    of the <hi rend="italic">lapsi,</hi> or those who had fallen away through fear
                    during the heat of the Decian persecution. Cyprian, although inspired by lofty
                    notions of the prerogatives of the church, and inclined to severity of opinion
                    towards heretics, and especially heretical dissentients from the divine
                    authority of the episcopal order and unity of Christendom, was leniently
                    disposed towards those who had temporarily fallen from the faith. He set himself
                    in opposition to Novatian, a presbyter of Rome, who advocated their permanent
                    exclusion from the church; and it was Cyprian’s influence which probably guided
                    the tolerant measures of the Carthaginian synods on the subject. This question
                    plunged him into controversy, of which, as well as many other matters, we have
                    an interesting glimpse in the numerous letters which he wrote during his
                    episcopate, and which have been preserved to our time.</p>
                <p>Among the early documents of church history there are few more interesting
                    memorials then these letters of Cyprian, addressed to a great variety of
                    friends, particularly to two bishops of Rome, Cornelius and Stephen, and dealing
                    with many points of church discipline and doctrine. They show clearly the
                    substantial equality of all Christian bishops at the time, who all equally
                    received the name of “pope” (papa), and addressed each other as colleagues. The
                    bishop of Carthage, for example, speaks of “his brother” the bishop of Rome, and
                    does not hesitate to dispute his opinion when it does not seem to him a good or
                    sound one. Stephen of Rome had espoused the cause of one Basilides, a bishop of
                    Spain, who had been deposed from his see; but Cyprian manfully defends <hi
                    rend="italic">(Epist.</hi> lxvii.) the sentence pronounced against the latter,
                    and does not hesitate to say in the same epistle that Basilides had gone to Rome
                    and deceived there his colleague Stephen <hi rend="italic">(Stephanum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">collegam</hi><hi rend="italic">nostrum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fefellit).</hi> Some of the letters were written during his retirement under
                    the Deciau persecution—the forty, or nearly that number, which stand first in
                    the series,— others belong to the later period of his life, and a few to a still
                    earlier period. It is by no means easy to determine their several dates, as the
                    first of the series (according to Migne’s order, that usually followed), which
                    is one of the most interesting of the whole, is without any chronological
                    indication. We give a sentence or two from this letter, as showing the more
                    human, poetical, and pleasing aspect of Cyprian’s character. It is the vintage
                    time when he writes to his “dearest Donatus,”and both the season and the place,
                    he says,invite to repose. “The pleasant aspectof the gardens harmonizes with the
                    gentle breezes of a mild autumn in soothing and∙cheering the senses; the
                    neighbouring thickets insure us solitude; and the vagrant trailings of the vine
                    branches, creeping in pendant mazes among the reeds that support them, have made
                    for us a leafy shelter. Pleasantly here we clothe our thoughts in words.”</p>
                <p>Valerian followed Gallus upon the imperial throne in 253, and the persecutions of
                    the Christians were socn renewed. Cyprian was at first banished from Carthage,
                    but found refuge in a pleasant retreat at Ceritis, “near the sea-shore, in a
                    spot shaded with verdant groves, beside a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n782/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0782-0747"/> clear and healthful stream of water.” But soon he
                    was recalled, taken into custody, and finally condemned to death. The severity
                    of Valerian spared the mass of the Christian people, and vented itself chiefly
                    on the bishops, who refused to sacrifice to the emperor. When brought before the
                    proconsul, the great bishop of Carthage was briefly interrogated: “Art thou
                    Thascius Cyprian, the bishop of so many impious men î The emperor commands thee
                    to sacrifice.” Cyprian replied, “I will not sacrifice;” and, persisting in his
                    refusal notwithstanding remonstrances, he was condemned to death. On hearing his
                    sentence Cyprian only said, “God be thanked;” and, being conducted to a
                    neighbouring field, he was beheaded.</p>
                <p>Besides his letters, various brief treatises of Cyprian have descended to modem
                    times, on such subjects as “The Lapsed,” “The Unity of the Church,” “the Lord’s
                    Prayer,” “Works and Alms.” But the characteristics of his time and of his own
                    mind are chiefly to be sought in his letters. A general account of him will be
                    found in any of the larger church histories, as those of Milman, Neander,
                    Schaff. (J. T.)</p>
