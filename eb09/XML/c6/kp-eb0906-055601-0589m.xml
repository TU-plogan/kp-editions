                    the crust or deposit formed by wines in bottles and casks in which they are
                    undergoing fermentation. Red are usually richer in argol than white wines. A ton
                    of grapes yields, according to the nature of the fruit, quantities varying
                    between 1 and 2 lb of argol, of which, in good samples, an average of about 83
                    per cent, is cream of tartar. French red wines examined by Μ. Fauré contained
                    from O6664 to *19728 per cent, by weight of this salt, and white wines from <hi

                    to l ’ 201 grammes per litre in the wines of Tonnerre. The manufacture of cream
                    of tartar is conducted as follows. Ground granulated argol is wetted and then
                    dissolved in water at a temperature of 100° C.; after two or three days, during
                    which insoluble impurities subside, the clear liquid is drawn off into earthen
                    vessels. The crystals it deposits are re-dissolved in boiling water holding
                    finely comminuted pipe-clay and animal-charcoal in suspension. The solution
                    after standing till a thin film of crystals appears on its surface is run into
                    conical coolers, the sides of which become in eight or nine days coated with
                    fine clear crystals, colouring matters having been precipitated by the clay and
                    charcoal. The crystals are then bleached and dried by exposure to sunlight and
                    air. In Venice tho impurities of the crude tartar are separated by repeated
                    crystallizations, and finally by adding white of egg and wood-ashes to the
                    boiling solution, and removing the scum formed. The name “cream of tartar” was
                    originally given to the crust of minute pure white crystals formed on the
                    surface of cooling solutions. Cream of tartar is a colourless, transparent salt,
                    crystallizing in four-sided prisms belonging to the trimetric system, and having
                    a specific gravity of about 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 96. It is
                    precipitated when a potassium salt is added to a solution of free tartaric acid.
                    It is soluble in alkalies, alkaline carbonates, and mineral acids, but insoluble
                    in acetic acid and alcohol. Its insolubility in the last mentioned is the cause
                    of its separation from wines as they mature. One part by weight of the salt is
                    soluble at 0° C. in about 416 (Chancel), and at 100° C. in about fifteen parts
                    of water. The solution has an acid reaction, and dissolves many metallic oxides,
                    furnishing double tartrates. When heated, cream of tartar is decomposed, with
                    the formation of potassium carbonate (the <hi rend="italic">sal-</hi><hi

                    and carbon, inflammable gases possessing an odour of burnt bread being at the
                    same time evolved. Potassium carbonate is produced also when the salt is kept
                    moist or in solution for some years. Cream of tartar— <hi rend="italic"

                    Tartars, even those intended for the manufacture of tartaric acid, should be
                    free from any considerable quantity of calcium tartrate, as the moisture of the
                    air soon converts that salt into calcium carbonate. The substances most used to
                    adulterate cream of tartar are calcium chloride and sulphate, and the chloride
                    and acid sulphate of potassium.</p>
