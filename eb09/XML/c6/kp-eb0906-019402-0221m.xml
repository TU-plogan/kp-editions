                    (1445-1509), called the father of modern history, was born at the castle of
                    Comines. He lost both father and mother in his earliest years. In 1463 his
                    godfather, Philip of Burgundy, summoned him to court, and soon after transferred
                    him to the household of his son, afterwards known as Charles the Bold. He
                    speedily acquired considerable influence over the mind of Charles, and in 1468
                    was appointed chamberlain and councillor; consequently when in the same year
                    Louis XL entrapped himself at Peronne, Comines was able both to soften the
                    passion of the duke and to give useful advice to the king, whose life he did
                    much to save. Three years later he was charged with an embassy to Louis, who
                    gained him over to himself by many brilliant promises. In 1472 he left Burgundy
                    for the court of France. He was at once made chamberlain and councillor; a
                    pension of 6000 livres was bestowed on him; he received the principality of
                    Talmont, the confiscated property of the family of La Tremville; and many other
                    dignities and presents of land were conferred on him by the king. He was
                    employed to carry out the intrigues of Louis in Burgundy, and spent several
                    months as envoy in Italy. On his return he was received with the utmost favour,
                    and in 1479 obtained a decree confirming him in possession of his
                    principality.</p>
                <p>On the death of Louis a suit was commenced against Comines by the family of La
                    Tremville, and he was cast in heavy damages. He plotted against the regent, Anne
                    de Beaujeu, and joined the party of Orleans. Having attempted to carry off the
                    king, and so free him from the tutelage of his sister, he was arrested, and put
                    in one of his old master’s iron cages at Loches. In 1489 he was banished to one
                    of his own estates for ten years, and made to give bail to the amount of 10,000
                    crowns of gold for his good behaviour. Recalled to the council in 1492, he
                    strenu ously opposed the Italian expedition of Charles VIII., in which, however,
                    he took part, notably as representing the king in the negotiations which
                    resulted in the treaty of Vercelli. During the rest of his life, notwithstanding
                    the accession of Louis XII., whom he had served as duke of Orleans, he held no
                    position of importance; and his last days were disturbed by law suits. He died
                    at Argenton in 1509.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> to which Comines owes his reputation as a
                    statesman and man of letters, were written during his latter years; the first
                    six books are assigned to 1488-94, and the next two to 1497-1501. Hallam says of
                    them that they “almost make an epoch in historical literature;” and Saint-Beuve,
                    after speaking of Comines as being in date the first truly modern writer, and
                    comparing him with Montaigne, says that his history remains the definitive
                    history of his time, and that from it all political history took its rise. None
                    of this applause is undeserved, for the pages of Comines abound with
                    excellences. He analyzes motives and pictures manners; he delineates men and
                    describes events; his reflections are pregnant with suggestiveness, his
                    conclusions strong with the logic of facts.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> remained in MS. till 1524, when part of them
                    were printed by Galliot du Pré, the remainder first seeing light in 1525.
                    Subsequent editions were put forth by Denys Sauvage in 1552, by Denys Godefroy
                    in 1649, and by Lenglet Dufresnoy in 1747. That of Mademoiselle Dupont (1841-48)
                    is the best. Various translations of Comines into English have appeared, from
                    that of T. Danett in 1596 to that, based on the Dupont edition, which was
                    printed in Bohn’s series in 1855.</p>
