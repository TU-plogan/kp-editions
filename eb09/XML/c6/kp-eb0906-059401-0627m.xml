                <p><label type="entry">CROeSUS</label>, king of Lydia, was the son and successor of
                    Alyattes. It was supposed by Clinton and Bähr that for fifteen years he shared
                    the throne with his father; however that may be, he became sole king on the
                    death of Alyattes, about 568 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (according to the
                    computation of Rawlinson), when, Herodotus tells us, he was thirty-five years
                    old. Jïe speedily reduced all the Greek cities in Asia Minor, and soon most of
                    the tribes to the west of the River Halys (the Kizil Irmak) were subject to him.
                    The wealth, meanwhile, which he had inherited from his father had been
                    enormously increased, until it far surpassed that of any other sovereign with
                    whom the Greeks were acquainted. He was therefore to them the type of human
                    prosperity; and the bitter contrast of his fall powerfully impressed itself on
                    their imagination, which became in part the creator of the vividly dramatic
                    story so finely told by Herodotus. The most famous incident in that story was
                    the visit of Solon. After ostentatiously displaying all his treasures, the king
                    asked the sage who was the happiest man he had ever known. Tellus of Athens, was
                    the reply, for he lived while his country was prosperous; he was surrounded with
                    children and children’s children, who were both beautiful and good; and he died
                    upon the field of battle after having gained a gallant victory over the enemy.
                    And next to him Solon counted two Argive youths, Cleobis and Bito, whose
                    strength and skill won prizes at the games, who, when the oxen failed to appear
                    from the fields in time, piously drew their mother’s car forty-five furlongs to
                    the festival of Juno, and as reward received the praises of all men, and were
                    allowed to die in the very temple of the goddess, after offering their
                    sacrifices and feasting at the holy banquet in her honour. For two reasons,
                    added the wise man, Croesus with all his fortune was not to be held so fortunate
                    as these,—the gods ’ are jealous of human prosperity, and no man can be called
                    fully happy till a happy death has closed a happy life. Soon after misfortunes
                    began to thicken about Craesus. His son, despite all the care with which, being
                    warned in a dream, he drew him from the dangers of battle, and sought to shield
                    him even from accident, was unintentionally slain at a boar-hunt by Adrastus.
                    News came also of the conquests of Cyrus, who had overcome Astyages, the
                    brother-in-law of Croesus. The oracle of Delphi prophesied that if Craesus went
                    to war he would “destroy a mighty empire,” and that he was to flee when a “mule”
                    sat on the throne of Media; and, secure in what appeared to him the most
                    unambiguous of prophecies, Craesus invaded Cappadocia. But the mighty empire he
                    was to destroy proved to be his own; he was repulsed, and soon Sardis was
                    stormed and taken by Cyrus. Craesus, careless of life, was about to be slain,
                    when one of his sons, hitherto dumb, in his fear overcame his infirmity, and
                    made known his father’s rank. Craesus w as therefore spared to be taken as a
                    prisoner before Cyrus. He was placed on a funeral pyre, and, as he watched the
                    rising flames, he thought of Solon, whose name burst from his lips. When
                    questioned, he repeated the warning of the sage, which so powerfully affected
                    tho mind of Cyrus that he ordered the flames tobe extinguished. The efforts of
                    the soldiers, however, were in vain; but, as Herodotus narrates, the prayers of
                    Craesus prevailed upon Apollo, whose temples he had formerly enriched with
                    costly gifts, to send a heavy fall of rain which quenched the fire. The wisdom
                    of Craesus gained the friendship of Cyrus, who also made him minister to his
                    son, Cambyses. But, having ventured to reprove Cambyses for an act of cruelty,
                    Craesus was forced to seek safety in flight; and here ends the story of his
                    life. It is said that, when ho reproached the oracle which had led to his fall,
                    he received the convincing answer that Cyrus was the “mule” foretold, as he was
                    the son of a Median princess and a Persian subject. Apollo, it was added, had
                    done what he could by prevailing on the fates to delay the fall of Craesus full
                    three years.</p>
