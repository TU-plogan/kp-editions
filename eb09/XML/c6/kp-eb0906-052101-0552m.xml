                    watchmaker. He was born in Paris, in the Quartier St Antoine, on the 28th
                    November 1792. The year of his birth was a critical one for France and for
                    Europe. The ruins of the Bastille, which adjoined the place of his birth,
                    already symbolized the wreck of the ancient order of things. The National
                    Assembly had in the autumn decreed the deposition of the king; the National
                    Convention had been appointed to try him as Louis Capet (21st September), and
                    three days later France was declared a republic. While the childhood of the
                    future philosopher was passing in the Quartier St Antoine, the king -was
                    guillotined in the neighbouring Place de la Revolution; Christianity was
                    deposed, like the monarch himself, and the worship of reason solemnly
                    inaugurated; Marie Antoinette passed through her bitter humiliations to
                    execution. Before the boy was old enough to be sent to the secondary school of
                    the Quartier, Danton and Robespierre had risen, tyrannized, and fallen; the
                    Girondists had gone down before the Jacobins, and Bonaparte had been proclaimed
                    consul. A youth whoso predilections were tow ards letters or philosophy had his
                    lot cast in especially troubled times. At the age of ten young Cousin was sent
                    to the secondary or grammar school of the Quartier St Antoine, named <hi
                    rend="italic">Lycée.</hi><hi rend="italic">Charlemagne,</hi> a seminary of a
                    rank analogous to the Prussian gymnasium. He <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> e he
                    studied until he was eighteen. This embraced the time of the Consulate and the
                    First Empire,—the period of the power of Bonaparte down to very near the
                    commencement of its decline. The <hi rend="italic">Lycée</hi> had a connection
                    with the university, and -when Cousin left the secondary school, he was <hi
                    rend="italic">crowned</hi> in the ancient hall of the Sorbonne for the Latin
                    oration delivered by him there, in the general concourse of his school
                    competitors. This juvenile distinction may be taken as the sign and promise of
                    that fervid oratorical power for which in after years he was so remarkable.
                    Curiously enough, it was this very hall of the Sorbonne which afterwards
                    witnessed the greatest oratorical triumphs of his manhood, and it was in a suite
                    of rooms under the same roof that he passed in quiet reflective seclusion the
                    latter years of his long and active intellectual life. The careful classical
                    training of the <hi rend="italic">Lycée</hi> had at this early period strongly
                    disposed him to Literature. He was already known among his compeers for a
                    decided superiority in Greek and familiarity with the best Greek authors. From
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lycée</hi> he passed to the Normal School of Paris,—an
                    institution of the higher educational order corresponding very much to the
                    faculty of arts in our Scottish universities. It was destined to train the best
                    youths of the secondary schools for teachers in the more advanced departments.
                    At fiιst simply a pupil, he vëry soon became a monitor or <hi rend="italic"
                    >maître-répétiteur</hi> in Greek. His impulse at this time was entirely towards'
                    letters. But it was now his fortune to meet with a powerful influence in a
                    somewhat opposite direction. This was. the teaching of Laromiguière, who was
                    then lecturing on philosophy in the Normal School. Cousin was through life
                    essentially open to and impressible by outward influences; and the earnestness
                    and striking power of intellectual analysis displayed by the thinker in France
                    who first opened up to him the questions of philosophy, and first, though only
                    slightly, broke up the beaten path of Condillacism, were very certain to modify
                    his character and studies. In the second preface to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fragmens</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophiques,</hi> in which he manfully and
                    candidly states the varied philosophical influences of his life and their
                    relation to his own opinions, he speaks of the grateful emotion excited by the
                    memory of the day in 1811, when as a pupil in the Normal School destined to
                    letters, he heard Laromiguière for the first time. “That day decided my whole
                    life. Laromiguière taught the philosophy of Locke and Condillac, happily
                    modified on some points, with a clearness and grace which in appearance at least
                    removed difficulties, and with a charm of spiritual <hi rend="italic"
                    >bonhomie</hi> which penetrated and subdued.” Cousin was set forthwith to
                    lecture on philosophy, and he speedily obtained the position of master of
                    conferences <hi rend="italic">(maître de conférences)</hi> in the school. It was
                    the practice of his pupils, who were usually in the third year of their course,
                    to take notes and make a summary of tho lectures delivered, and thereafter to
                    meet in conference, the master presiding, for the purpose of discussing the
                    principal points contained in them. This was the revival of a process very much
                    akin to the mediaeval practice of <hi rend="italic">determining</hi> as it was
                    called. Cousin in the first preface to the <hi rend="italic">Fragmens</hi>
                    refers with great pleasure to the cherished memories of this period, when, he
                    himself young and ardent and surrounded by sympathetic pupils, they together,
                    forgetful of all else, essayed “the eternal problems” of speculative
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>The youthful thinker very soon, however, passed beyond the point of view of
                    Laromiguière. Royer-Collard was lecturing in the chair of the history of modern
                    philosophy in the faculty of letters. Cousin was very speedily attracted by him,
                    and the teaching of Royer-Collard formed the second great philosophical impulse
                    of his life. This teacher, as he tells us, “by the severity of his logic, the
                    gravity and weight of his words, turned me by degrees, and not without
                    resistance, from the beaten path of Condillac into the way which has since
                    become so easy, but which was then painful and unfrequented, that of the
                    Scottish philosophy.” In 1815-16 Cousin attained the position of <hi
                    rend="italic">suppléant</hi> or assistant to Royer-Collard in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n553/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0553-0522"/> chair of the faculty of letters. But there was
                    still another mind which influenced the young and susceptible philosopher at
                    this early period. This was Maine-de-Biran,— the expounder of the volitional
                    theory of cause, and the upholder of a highly spiritual philosophy. Cousin
                    regarded Maine de-Biran as the unequalled psychological observer of his time in
                    France, alike in the delicacy and the depth of his analysis. All these men
                    strongly influenced both the method and the matter of his philosophical thought.
                    To Laromiguière he himself attributes the lesson of decomposing thought, even
                    though the reduction of it to sensation was inadequate. Royer-Collard taught him
                    that even sensation is subject to certain internal laws and principles which it
                    does not itself explain, which are superior to analysis and the natural
                    patrimony of the mind. De Biran made a special study of the phenomena of the
                    will. He taught him to distinguish in all cognitions, and especially in the
                    simplest facts of consciousness, the fact of voluntary activity, that activity
                    in which our personality is truly revealed. It was through this “triple
                    discipline,” as he calls it, that Cousin’s philosophical thought was first
                    developed, and that in 1815 he entered on the public teaching of philosophy in
                    the Normal School and in the faculty of letters<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Fragmens</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophiques,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Preface
                    Deuxième.</p></note>. But the energy and impressibility of the young professor
                    were not to be limited by the philosophical thought of his own country. He
                    betook himself to the study of German, worked at Kant and Jacobi, and then
                    sought to master the <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Nature</hi> of Schelling.
                    By this he was at first greatly attracted. The influence of Schelling became
                    manifest in his teaching, and it may be observed very markedly in the earlier
                    form of his philosophy. He sympathized with the principle of faith of Jacobi,
                    but regarded it as arbitrary so long as it was not recognized as grounded in
                    reason. In 1817 he went to Germany, and met Hegel at Heidelberg. In this year
                    appeared Hegel’s <hi rend="italic">Encyclopcedia of the Philosophical
                    Sciences,</hi> of which Cousin had one of the earliest copies. He thought Hegel
                    not particularly amiable; bub the two became friends. The following year Cousin
                    went to Munich, where he met Schelling for the first time, and spent a month
                    with him and Jacobi, obtaining a deeper insight into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophy of Nature.</hi> His contrast of Hegeland Schelling is interesting..
                    No two people, he tells us, can be more unlike than the master and the disciple.
                    “Hegel lets fall words few and profound, and somewhat enigmatic; his speech is
                    strong but embarrassed; his immovable countenance, his clouded forehead, seem
                    the image of thought which turns back on itself. Schelling is thought developed.
                    His language is like his look, rapid, full of <hi rend="italic">éclat</hi> and
                    life. He is naturally eloquent.”</p>
                <p>Cousin’s future course in life as a professor of philosophy seemed now to be
                    determined. But the political troubles of the country were to interfere for a
                    time with this promising career. In the events of 1814-15 Cousin took the
                    royalist side. He at first adopted the views of the party of which Royer-Collard
                    was the philosophical chief, known as <hi rend="italic">doctrinaire.</hi> He
                    seems then to have gone further than this party, and even to have approached the
                    extreme Left or <hi rend="italic">Carbonari</hi> section of politicians. This
                    has been alleged, though it is not in accordance with the usual moderation of
                    his character and political views. Then came a reaction against liberalism, and
                    in 1821-22 Cousin was deprived of his offices alike in the faculty of letters
                    and in the Normal School. The Normal School itself was swept away. He simply
                    shared at the hands of a narrow and illiberal Government, influenced mainly by
                    the priesthood, the fate of Guizot, who was ejected from the chair of history.
                    Such was the spirit which actuated the fiιst restoration and the Government of
                    Louis XVIII. This enforced abandonment of public teaching was not wholly an evil
                    to the young speculator. He again set out for Germany with a view to further
                    philosophical study. And here there occurred a curious episode in his life.
                    While at Berlin in 1824-25 he was arrested and thrown into prison, either on
                    some ill-defined political charge at the instance of the French police, or on
                    account of certain incautious expressions which he had let fall in conversation.
                    This imprisonment was in fact the result of the persistent persecution of the
                    man who exercised free thought and preached toleration, at the hands of the
                    priestly party in France, who, ruling a weak king, had already deprived the
                    professor of his public offices. Cousin was liberated at the end of six
                    months,—having thus for an abstract philosopher had a tolerable taste of
                    political martyrdom. He continued under the suspicion of the French Government
                    for three years longer. It was during this period, however, that he thought out
                    and developed what is distinctive in his philosophical doctrine. His
                    eclecticism, ontology, and his philosophy of history were declared in principle
                    and in most of their salient details in the <hi rend="italic">Fragmens</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophiques</hi> of 1826. The preface to the second edition
                    (1833) and the <hi rend="italic">Avertissement</hi> to the third (1838) aimed at
                    a vindication of his principles from hostile contemporary criticism. Even the
                    best of his later books, the <hi rend="italic">Philosophie Ecossaise,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Du Vrai, du Beau, et</hi><hi rend="italic">du Bien,</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophie</hi><hi rend="italic">de Locke</hi> were
                    simply matured revisions of his lectures during the period from 1815 to 1820.
                    The lectures on Locke were first sketched in 1819, and fully developed in the
                    course of 1829.</p>
                <p>During the seven years of forced abandonment of teaching, he produced, besides
                    the <hi rend="italic">Fragmens,</hi> the edition of the works of Proclus (6
                    vols. 1820-27), and the works of Descartes (11 vols., 1826). He also commenced
                    his <hi rend="italic">Translation of Plato</hi> (13 vols.), which occupied his
                    leisure time from 1825 to 1840.</p>
                <p>We see in the <hi rend="italic">Fragment</hi> very distinctly the fusion of the
                    different philosophical influences of his life to which wø have referred, and by
                    which his opinions were finally moulded and matured. For Cousin was as eclectic
                    in cast of thought and personal habit of mind, as he was in philosophical
                    principle and system. It is with the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fragmens</hi> of 1826 that the first great widening of his reputation is
                    associated. In 1827 followed the <hi rend="italic">Cours de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la Philosophie.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1828 popular feeling forced the king (Charles X.) to a change of ministry, and
                    Μ. Martignac returned to the constitutional Charter of 1814, which sought to
                    conciliate liberty and order, but which had been most unfaithfully worked under
                    the restoration. A more enlightened and tolerant spirit seems to have arisen,
                    and Μ. de Vatimesnil, minister of public instruction, recalled Cousin along with
                    Guizot to their professorial positions in the university. Cousin’s re-appearance
                    in the chair, “on the occasion,” as he said, “of the return of the
                    constitutional hopes of France,” was marked by an enthusiastic demonstration on
                    the part of students and auditors. The professoriate in Paris reached its golden
                    age, at least in this century, when Guizot, Villemain, and Cousin were now
                    colleagues in the faculty of letters.</p>
                <p>The three years which followed 1828 was the period of Cousin’s greatest
                    distinction and triumph as a lecturer. He re-appeared in sympathy with the
                    national feeling of the time; he had suffered for his adherence to popular
                    principles; his return to the chair was at once a compensation for what he had
                    undergone, and the symbol of the triumph of constitutional ideas. This prepared
                    a ready sympathy for him. The hall of the Sorbonne was crowded with auditors as
                    the hall of no philosophical teacher in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n554/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0554-0523"/> Paris had been since the days of Abelard. The
                    lecturer had a singular power of identifying himself for the time with the
                    system which he expounded, and the historical character he pourtray el. Clear
                    and comprehensive in the grasp of the general outlines of his subject, he was at
                    the same time exceedingly methodical and vivid in the representation of details.
                    In exposition he had the rare art of unfolding and aggrandizing. Beginning with
                    the simple or particular, he proceeded readily and easily to complete the
                    listener’s grasp of the matter in hand. There was a rich deep-toned resonant
                    eloquence mingled with the speculative exposition; his style of expression was
                    clear, elegant, and forcible, abounding in happy turns and striking antitheses.
                    To this was joined a singular power of rhetorical climax. His philosophy
                    exhibited in a striking manner the generalizing tendency of the French
                    intellect, and its logical need of grouping details round central principles.
                    The pretension even to grasp and formalize the history of philosophy was
                    dazzling to the imagination of a Parisian auditory, however little ground it
                    might have in fact or reason.</p>
                <p>There was withal a moral earnestness and elevation in his spiritual philosophy
                    which came home to the hearts of his hearers, and which seemed to afford a
                    ground for higher development in national literature and art, and even in
                    politics, than the traditional philosophy of France had appeared capable of
                    yielding. It was thus not to be wondered at that the philosophical orator was
                    received with enthusiasm, and that his lectures produced more ardent disciples,
                    imbued at least with his spirit, than it has been the fortune of any other
                    professor of philosophy in France to gather round him in this century. Tested by
                    the power and effect of his teaching influence, Victor Cousin occupies a
                    foremost place in the rank of professors of philosophy, who like Jacobi and
                    Schelling in Germany and Dugald Stewart in Scotland, have united the rare gifts
                    of speculative, expository, and imaginative faculty. Tested even by the strength
                    of the reaction which his writings have in some cases occasioned, his influence
                    is hardly less remarkable, and the degree of petulant detraction to which he
                    himself and his philosophy have been subjected even in France may be taken as
                    the tribute of envy to his power. The taste for philosophy,—especially its
                    history,—was revived in France to an extent unknown since the 17th century.</p>
                <p>Among the more distinguished men who were influenced by the teaching and example
                    of Cousin, and who have carried on philosophical work in his manner and spirit,
                    we may note Jouffroy, Damiron, Garnier, Barthelemy St Hilaire, Ravaisson,
                    Rémusat, Jules Simon, and Franck. Jouffroy and Damiron were first fellow
                    students, and then auditors and disciples. Jouffroy, however, always kept firm
                    to the early—the French and Scottish—impulses of Cousin’s teaching. The best
                    research in the history of philosophy, and the best thought of France during the
                    period from 1830 to 1848, were doubtless due to the teaching and writings of
                    Cousin. In fact, for fully fifty years of the philosophical life of France,
                    Cousin has been the greatest power. He continued to lecture regularly for two
                    years and a half after his return to the chair. The three bloody days of July
                    1830 led to the flight of Charles X. This was followed by the accession of Louis
                    Philippe, “<hi rend="italic">by</hi> the will of the people,”—which meant very
                    much the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> of Paris and the middle class of tho
                    country. Cousin sympathized entirely with the revolution of July, and he was at
                    once recognized by the new Government as a friend of national liberty and
                    constitutional rights. Writing in June 1833 he explains both his philosophical
                    and his political position :—</p>
                <p>“I had the advantage of holding united against me for many years, both the
                    sensational and the theological school. In 1830 both schools descended into the
                    arena of politics. The sensational school quite naturally produced the demagogic
                    party, and the theological school became quite as naturally absolutism, safe to
                    borrow from time to time the mask of the demagogue in order the better to reach
                    its ends, as in philosophy it is by scepticism that it undertakes to restore
                    theocracy. On the other hand, he who combated any exclusive principle in science
                    was bound to reject also any exclusive principle in the state, and to defend
                    representative government.”</p>
                <p>The Government was not tardy in honouring his public services as a professor and
                    bis contributions to the philosophical literature of the country. He was induced
                    by the ministry of which his friend Guizot was the head to take a part in
                    national administration. He ceased to lecture, but retained the title of
                    professor of philosophy. He became a member of the council of public instruction
                    and counsellor of state, and in 1832 he was made a peer of France. Finally, he
                    accepted the position of minister of public instruction in 1840 under Thiers. He
                    was besides director of the Normal School and virtual head of the university,
                    and from 1840 a member of the Institute (Academy of the Moral and Political
                    Sciences). His character and his official position at this period gave him great
                    power in the university and in the educational arrangements of the country. In
                    fact, during the seventeen and a half years of the reign of Louis Philippe,
                    Cousin mainly moulded the philosophical and even the literary tendencies of the
                    cultivated class in France.</p>
                <p>But the most important work he accomplished during this period was doubtless the
                    organization of primary instruction in the country. It was to the efforts of
                    Cousin that France owed her advance, in primary education, from 1830 to 1848.
                    Prussia and Saxony had set the national example, and France was guided into it
                    by Cousin. Forgetful, as has been well said, of “national calamity and of
                    personal wrong,” he looked to Prussia as affording the best example of an
                    organized system of national education; and he was persuaded that “to carry back
                    the education of Prussia into France afforded a nobler (if a bloodless) triumph
                    than the trophies of Austerlitz and Jena.” In the summer of 1831, commissioned
                    by the Government, he proceeded to Germany, visiting Frankfort and Saxony, and
                    spending some time in Berlin. The result was a series of reports to the
                    minister, afterwards published as <hi rend="italic">Rapport</hi><hi

                    and soon afterwards through his influence there was passed the law of primary
                    instruction. (See his <hi rend="italic">Expose des Motifs</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>In the words of a reviewer at the time <hi rend="italic">(Edinburgh Review,</hi>
                    July 1833), these documents “mark an epoch in the progress of national
                    education, and are directly conducive to results important not only to France
                    but to Europe.” The <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> was translated by Mrs Austin
                    in 1834. The translation was frequently reprinted in the United States of
                    America. The legislatures of New Jersey and Massachusetts distributed it in the
                    schools at the expense of the States. Cousin remarks that, among all the
                    literary distinctions which he had received, “None has touched me more than the
                    title of foreign member of the American Institute for Education.” To the
                    enlightened views of the ministries of Guizot and Thiers under the citizen-king,
                    and to the zeal, energy, and ability of Cousin in the work of organization,
                    France owes what is best in her system of primary education,—a national interest
                    which had been neglected under the Revolution, the Empire, and the Restoration
                    (see <hi rend="italic">Exposé,</hi> p. 17). In the first two years of the reign
                    of Louis Philippe more was done for the <pb break="no"

                    sought or accomplished in all the history of France. France since then has,
                    perhaps, owing to political troubles and ecclesiastical obstacles, followed but
                    falteringly in the steps of Prussia; but some considerable progress has been
                    made on the lines laid down by Cousin in a spirit of far-seeing patriotism. If,
                    in 1866, about 30 per cent, of the military conscripts were unable to read, yet
                    we must put alongside of this the fact that, w lιile in 1824, the year of the
                    accession of Charles X., out of the 44,000 communes of France 25,000 were
                    without schools, in that same year of 1866 there were 41,000 free and public
                    schools for boys, and 14,000 for girls. In connection with his services to
                    education we ought not to omit a notice of his noble and eloquent defence of
                    university studies in the Chamber of Peers in 1844, when he stood manfully forth
                    against the clerical party on the one hand, and the levelling or Philistine
                    party on the other. His speeches on this occasion were afterwards published in a
                    most interesting tractate entitled <hi rend="italic">Defense de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Université et de la Philosophie.</hi></p>
                <p>This period of official life from 1830 to 1848 w as spent by him, so far as
                    philosophical study was concerned, in revising his former lectures and writings,
                    in maturing them for publication or re-issue, and in research into certain
                    periods of the history of philosophy. In 1835 appeared <hi rend="italic">De la

                <p>During this period also he seems to have turned with fresh interest to those
                    literary studies which in his youth he had abandoned for speculation under the
                    influence of Laromiguière and Royer-Collard. To this renewed interest we owe his
                    studies of men and women of note in France in the 17th century. This was an
                    epoch of the national history whose spiritualism, alike in philosophy and
                    religion, had a special attraction for him. He turned to it with increasing
                    regard in his latter years, as best representing his own personal convictions
                    and feelings. As the results of his work in this line, we have, besides the <hi

                    Longueville, Madame de Sablé, Madame de Chevreuse, Madame de Hautefort. There is
                    as yet no complete edition of his numerous works, which is a great
                    desideratum.</p>
                <p>When the reign of Louis Philippe came to a close through the opposition of his
                    ministry, with Guizot at its head, to the demand for electoral reform and
                    through the disgraceful policy of the Spanish marriages, Cousin, who was opposed
                    to the Government on these points, lent his sympathy to Cavaignac and the
                    Provisional Government. He published a pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Justice</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Charité,</hi> the
                    purport of which showed the moderation of his political views. It was markedly
                    anti-socialistic. But from this period he passed almost entirely from public
                    life, and ceased to wield the personal influence which he had done during the
                    preceding years. After the <hi rend="italic">coup d'état</hi> of the 2d
                    December, he was deprived of his position as permanent member of the superior
                    council of public instruction. From Napoleon and the empire he stood essentially
                    aloof. A decree of 1852 placed him along with Guizot and Villemain in the rank
                    of honorary professors. His sympathies were apparently with the monarchy, under
                    certain constitutional safeguards. Speaking in 1853 of the political issues of
                    the spiritual philosophy which he had taught during his lifetime, he says,—“It
                    conducts human societies to the true republic, that dream of all generous souls,
                    which in our time can be realized in Europe oMy by constitutional
                    monarchy.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Preface.</p></note></p>
                <p>During the last years of his life, he occupied a suite of rooms in the Sorbonne,
                    where he lived very simply and unostentatiously. The chief feature of the rooms
                    was the noble library, the cherished collection of a lifetime, which was spread
                    over the walls of each apartment. Besides Latin and Greek classics, representing
                    the studies of his youth, it was rich in philosophical literature, especially
                    historical. The compartments for Italian and English literature and philosophy
                    were especially full and interesting; and the whole was so carefully and
                    methodically arranged that its learned possessor could quite readily lay his
                    hand on any volume of his treasures. The present writer may perhaps be pardoned
                    for saying that he well recollects a forenoon spent with him in these rooms,
                    some twelve years ago. The kindliness of his manner, the richness of his talk,
                    his wonderful acquaintance with British literature, politics, and philosophy,
                    the massive head with hair slightly turned to grey, and the kindling dark brown
                    eyes, are elements in the picture of a very pleasant memory.</p>
                <p>Μ. Cousin died at Cannes on the 13th January 1867 in his sixty-fifth year. In the
                    front of the Sorbonne, below the lecture-rooms of the faculty of letters, is a
                    tablet recording an extract from the will of Victor Cousin, in which he
                    appropriately bequeathes his noble and cherished library to the halls of his
                    professorial work and triumphs.</p>
                <p>There are three distinctive points in the philosophy of Μ. Cousin. These are his
                    method, the results of his method, and the application of the method and its
                    results to history,—especially to the history of philosophy. It is usual to
                    speak of his philosophy as eclecticism. It is eclectic only in a secondary and
                    subordinate sense. All eclecticism that is not self-condemned and inoperative
                    implies a system of doctrine as its basis,—in fact, a criterion of truth.
                    Otherwise, as Cousin himself remarks, it is simply a blind and useless
                    syncretism. And Cousin saw and proclaimed from an early period in his
                    philosophical teaching the necessity of a system on which to base his
                    eclecticism. This is indeed advanced as an illustration or confirmation of the
                    truth of his system,—as a proof that the facts of history correspond to his
                    analysis of consciousness. These three points—the method, the results, and the
                    philosophy of history—are with him intimately connected; they are developments
                    in a natural order of sequence. They become in practice Psychology, Ontology,
                    and Eclecticism in history.</p>
                <p>First, as to method. On no point has Cousin more strongly and frequently insisted
                    than the importance of the method which philosophy may adopt. That which he
                    adopts, and the necessity of which he so strongly proclaims, is the ordinary one
                    of observation, analysis, and. induction. This may seem commonplace enough, but
                    it is really nut so; it makes all the difference in the world as to the
                    character of a philosophy wſhether we follow the reflective analysis of
                    experience, or a deductive method of the con struction of notions. The
                    observational method Cousin <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n556/mode/1up"

                    which Descartes began and abandoned, and which Locke and Condillac applied, but
                    applied imperfectly, and which Reid and Kant used with more success, yet not
                    completely. He insists that this is the true method of philosophy as applied to
                    consciousness, in which alone the facts of experience appear. But the proper
                    condition of the application of the method is that it shall not through
                    prejudice of system omit a single fact of consciousness. If the authority of
                    consciousness is good in one instance, it is good in all. If not to be trusted
                    in one, it is not to be trusted in any. Previous systems have erred in not
                    presenting the facts of consciousness, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    consciousness itself, in their totality. The observational method applied to
                    consciousness gives us the science of psychology. This is the basis and the only
                    proper basis of ontology or metaphysics—the science of being—and of the
                    philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction
                    as the complement of his method, by which he means inference as to reality
                    necessitated by the data of consciousness, and regulated by certain laws found
                    in consciousness, viz., those of the reason. By his method of observation and
                    induction as thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off very
                    clearly, on the one hand from the deductive construction of notions of an
                    absolute system, as represented either by Schelling or Hegel, which Cousin
                    regards as based simply on hypothesis and abstraction, illegitimately obtained;
                    and on the other, from that of Kant, and in a sense, of Hamilton, both of which
                    in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology, and merely relative or
                    phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of
                    ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual
                    consciousness, he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or
                    universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is with him the function of
                    philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but common
                    sense is not with him philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is
                    simply the material on which the philosophical method works, and in harmony with
                    wſhich its results must ultimately be found.</p>
                <p>The three great results of psychological observation are Sensibility, Activity or
                    Liberty, and Reason.</p>
                <p>These three facts are different in character, but are not found apart in
                    consciousness. Sensations, or the facts of the sensibility, are necessary; we do
                    not impute them to ourselves. The facts of reason are also necessary, and reason
                    is not less independent of the will than the sensibility. Voluntary facts are
                    alone marked in the eyes of consciousness with the characters of imputability
                    and personality. The will alone is the person or <hi rend="italic">Me.</hi> The
                    me is the centre of the intellectual sphere without which consciousness is
                    impossible. We find ourselves in a strange world, between two orders of
                    phenomena which do not belong to us, which we apprehend only on the condition of
                    our distinguishing ourselves from them. Further, we apprehend by means of a
                    light wſhich does not come from ourselves. All light comes from the reason, and
                    it is the reason which apprehends both itself, and the sensibility which
                    envelopes it and the will wſhich it obliges but does not constrain.
                    Consciousness then is composed of these three integrant and inseparable
                    elements. But Reason is the immediate ground of knowledge, and of consciousness
                    itself.</p>
                <p>But there is a peculiarity in Μ. Cousin’s doctrine of activity or freedom, and in
                    his doctrine of reason, wſhich enters deeply into his system. This is the
                    element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This is the heart of what is
                    new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a
                    generic term which means a cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to
                    itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so, although
                    it is preceded by deliberation and determination, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    reflection, for we are always conscious that even after determination we are
                    free to will or not to will. But there is a primary kind of volition, which has
                    not reflection for its condition, wſhich is yet free and spontaneous. We must
                    have willed thus spontaneously first, otherwise we could not know, before our
                    reflective volition, that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as
                    reflective, but it is the primary act of the two. This view of liberty of will
                    is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity; it excludes reflective
                    volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of
                    creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind, wſhich are done as a
                    rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation.</p>
                <p>But it is in his doctrine of the Reason that the distinctive principle of the
                    philosophy of Cousin lies. The reason given to us by psychological observation,
                    the reason of our consciousness, is impersonal in its nature. We do not make it;
                    its character is precisely the opposite of individuality; it is universal and
                    necessary. The recognition of universal and necessary principles in knowledge is
                    the essential point in psychology; it ought to be put first and emphasized to
                    the last that these exist, and that they are wſholly impersonal or absolute. The
                    number of these principles, their enumeration and classification, is an
                    important point, but it is secondary to that of the recognition of their true
                    nature. This was the point which Kant missed in his analysis, and this is the
                    fundamental truth which Cousin thinks he has restored to the integrity of
                    philosophy by the method of the observation of consciousness. And how is this
                    impersonality or absoluteness of the conditions of knowledge sought to be
                    established? The answer is in substance that Kant went wrong in putting
                    necessity first as the criterion of those laws. This brought them within the
                    sphere of reflection, and gave as their guarantee the impossibility of thinking
                    them reversed; and led to their being regarded as wholly relative to human
                    intelligence, restricted to the sphere of the phenomenal, incapable of revealing
                    to us substantial reality—necessary, yet subjective. But this test of necessity
                    is a wholly secondary one; these laws are not thus guaranteed to us; they are
                    each and all given to us, given to our consciousness, in an act of spontaneous
                    apperception or apprehension, immediately, instantaneously, in a sphere above
                    the reflective consciousness, yet within the reach of knowledge. And “all
                    subjectivity with all reflection expires in the spontaneity of apperception. The
                    reason becomes subjective by relation to the voluntary and free self; but ⅛
                    itself it is impersonal; it belongs not to this or to that self in humanity; it
                    belongs not even to humanity. We may say with truth that nature and humanity
                    belong to it, for without its laws both would perish.”</p>
                <p>But wſhat is the number of those laws? Kant reviewing the enterprize of Aristotle
                    in modern times has given a complete list of the laws of thought, but it is
                    arbitrary in classification, and may be legitimately reduced. According to
                    Cousin, there are but two primary laws of thought, that of causality and that of
                    substance. From these flow naturally all the others. In the order of nature,
                    that of substance is the first and causality second. In the order of acquisition
                    of our knowledge, causality precedes substance, or rather both are given us in
                    each other, and are contemporaneous in consciousness.</p>
                <p>These principles of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically,
                    enable us to pass beyond the limits of the relative and subjective to objective
                    and absolute reality,—enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or <pb

                    science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the
                    data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or
                    impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free
                    cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force— lying
                    out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and
                    volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other
                    than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me
                    as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain
                    as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each
                    other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to
                    the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each
                    other is the order of the universe.</p>
                <p>But these two forces, the me and the not-me, are reciprocally limitative. As
                    reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena, attention and
                    sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct causes,
                    correlative and reciprocally finite, to which they are related, so, from the
                    notion of this limitation, we find it impossible under the same guide not to
                    conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last cause
                    of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper
                    effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and is sufficient for the reason. This
                    is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and
                    the world. He is absolute substance only in so far as he is absolute cause, and
                    his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates, and he
                    creates necessarily.</p>
                <p>This theodicy of Cousin laid him open obviously enough to the charge of
                    pantheism. This he repels, and his answer may be summed up as follows. Pantheism
                    is properly the deification of the law of phenomena, the universe God. But I
                    distinguish the two finite causes self and not-self from each other and from the
                    infinite cause. They are not mere modifications of this cause or properties, as
                    with Spinoza,—they are free forces having their power or spring of action in
                    themselves, and this is sufficient for our idea of independent finite reality. I
                    hold this, and I hold the relation of these as effects to the one supreme cause.
                    The God I plead for is neither the deity of Pantheism, nor the absolute unity of
                    the Eleatics, a being divorced from all possibility of creation or plurality, a
                    mere metaphysical abstraction. The deity I maintain is creative, and necessarily
                    creative. The deity of Spinoza and the Eleatics is a mere substance, not a cause
                    in any sense. As to the necessity under which Deity exists of acting or
                    creating, this is the highest form of liberty, it is the freedom of spontaneity,
                    activity without deliberation. His action is not the result of a struggle
                    between passion and virtue. He is free in an unlimited manner, the purest
                    spontaneity in man is but the shadow of the freedom of God. He acts freely but
                    not arbitrarily, and with the consciousness of being able to choose the opposite
                    part. He cannot deliberate or will as we do. His spontaneous action excludes at
                    once the efforts and the miseries of will and the mechanical operation of
                    necessity.</p>
                <p>The elements found in consciousness are also to be found In the history of
                    humanity and in the history of philosophy. In external nature there are
                    expansion and contraction which correspond to spontaneity and reflection.
                    External nature again in contrast with humanity expresses spontaneity; humanity
                    expresses reflection. In human history the East represents the spontaneous
                    stage; the Pagan and Christian world represent stages of reflection.</p>
                <p>This was afterwards modified, expanded, and more fully expressed by saying that
                    humanity in its universal development has three principal moments. First, in the
                    spontaneous stage, where reflection is not yet developed, and art is imperfect,
                    humanity has thought only of the immensity around it. It is preoccupied by the
                    infinite. Secondly, in the reflective stage, mind has become an object to
                    itself. It thus knows itself explicitly or reflectively. Its own individuality
                    is now the only or at least the supreme thing. This is the moment of the finite.
                    Thirdly, there comes an epoch in which the self or me is subordinated. Mind
                    realizes another power in the universe. The finite and the infinite become two
                    real correlatives in the relation of cause and product. This is the third and
                    highest stage of development, the relation of the finite and the infinite. As
                    philosophy is but the highest expression of humanity, these three moments -will
                    be represented in its history. The East typifies the infinite, Greece the finite
                    or reflective epoch, the modern era the stage of relation or correlation of
                    infinite and finite. In theology, the dominant philosophical idea of each of
                    these epochs results in pantheism, polytheism, theism. In politics wø have in
                    correspondence also with the idea, monarchy, democracy, constitutionalism.</p>
                <p>Eclecticism thus means the application of the psychological method to the history
                    of philosophy. Confronting the various systems co-ordinated as sensualism,
                    idealism, scepticism, mysticism, with the facts of consciousness, the result was
                    reached “that each system expresses an order of phenomena and ideas, which is in
                    truth very real, but which is not alone in consciousness, and which at the same
                    time holds an almost exclusive place in the system; whence it follows that each
                    system is not false but incomplete, and that in reuniting all incomplete
                    systems, we should have a complete philosophy, adequate to the totality of
                    consciousness.” Philosophy, as thus perfected, would not be a mere aggregation
                    of systems, as is ignorantly supposed, but an integration of the truth in each
                    system after the false or incomplete is discarded.</p>
                <p>Such is the system in outline. The historical positicn of the system lies in its
                    relations to Kant, Schelling, and Hegel. Cousin was opposed to Kant in asserting
                    that the unconditioned in the form of infinite or absolute cause was but a mere
                    unrealizable tentative or effort on the part of the mind, something different
                    from a mere negation, yet not equivalent to a positive thought. With Cousin the
                    absolute as the ground of being is grasped positively by the intelligence, and
                    it renders all else intelligible; it is not as with Kant a certain hypothetical
                    or regulative need.</p>
                <p>With Schelling again Cousin agrees in regarding this supreme ground of all as
                    positively apprehended, and as a source of development, but he utterly
                    repudiates Schelling’s method. The intellectual intuition either falls under the
                    eye of consciousness, or it does not. If not, how do you know it and its object
                    which are identical <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> If it does, it comes within the
                    sphere of psychology; and the objections to it as thus a relative, made by
                    Schelling himself, are to be dealt with. Schelling’s intellectual intuition is
                    the mere negation of knowledge.</p>
                <p>Again, the pure being of Hegel is a mere abstraction,— an hypothesis
                    illegitimately assumed, which he has nowhere sought to vindicate. The very point
                    to be established is the possibility of reaching being <hi rend="italic">per
                    se</hi> or pure being; yet in the Hegelian system this is the very thing assumed
                    as a starting-point. Besides this, of course, objections might be made to the
                    method of development, as not only subverting the principle of contradiction,
                    but as galvanizing negation into a means of advancing or developing the whole
                    body of human knowledge and reality. The intellectual intuition of Schelling, as
                    above consciousness, the pure being of Hegel, as an empty abstraction,
                    unvindicated.</p>

                <p>illegitimately assumed, and arbitrarily developed, are equally useless as bases
                    of metaphysics. This led Cousin, still holding by essential knowledge of being,
                    to ground it in an analysis of consciousness,— in psychology.</p>
                <p>The absolute or infinite—the unconditioned ground and source of all reality— is
                    yet apprehended by us as an immediate datum or reality; and it is apprehended in
                    consciousness,-—under its condition, that, to wit, of distinguishing subject and
                    object, knower and known. The doctrine of Cousin was, as is well known,
                    criticised by Sir W. Hamilton in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review of</hi>
                    1829, and it was animadverted upon about the same time by Schelling. The latter
                    Cousin calls the greatest thinker, and the former the greatest critic of the
                    age. Hamilton’c objections are as follows. The correlation of the ideas of
                    infinite and finite does not necessarily imply their correality, as Cousin
                    supposes; on the contrary, it is a presumption that finite is simply positive
                    and infinite negative of the same,—that tho finite and infinite are simply
                    contradictory relatives. Of these “the positive alone is real, the negative is
                    only an abstraction of the other, and in the highest generality even an
                    abstraction of thought itself.” A study of the few sentences under this head
                    might have obviated the trifling criticism of Hamilton’s objection which has
                    been set afloat recently, that the denial of a knowledge of the absolute or
                    infinite implies a foregone knowledge of it. How can you deny the reality of
                    that which you do not know? The answer to this is that in the case of
                    contradictory statements,—A and not A,—the latter is a mere negation of the
                    former, and posits nothing; and the negation of a notion with positive
                    attributes, as the finite, does not extend beyond abolishing the given
                    attributes as an object of thought. The infinite or non-finite is not
                    necessarily known, ere the finite is negated, or in order to negate it; all that
                    needs be known is the finite itself; and the contradictory negation of it
                    implies no positive. Nbn-organized may or may not correspond to a positive,— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> an object or notion with qualities contradictory of the
                    organized; but the mere sublation of the organized does not posit it, or suppose
                    that it is known beforehand, or that anything exists corresponding to it. This
                    is one among many flaws in the Hegelian dialectic, and it paralyzes the whole of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Logic.</hi> Secondly, The conditions of intelligence,
                    which Cousin allows, necessarily exclude the possibility of knowledge of the
                    absolute,—they are held to be incompatible with its unity. Here Schelling and
                    Hamilton argue that Cousin’s absolute is a mere relative. Thirdly, It is
                    objected that in order to deduce the conditioned, Cousin makes his absolute a
                    relative; for he makes it an absolute cause, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a
                    cause existing absolutely under relation. As such it is necessarily inferior to
                    the sum total of its effects, and dependent for reality on these—in a word, a
                    mere potence or becoming. Further, as a theory of creation, it makes creation a
                    necessity, and destroys the notion of tho divine. Cousin made no reply to
                    Hamilton’s criticism beyond alleging that Hamilton’s doctrine necessarily
                    restricted human knowledge and certainty to psychology and logic, and destroyed
                    metaphysics by introducing nescience and uncertainty into its highest
                    sphere,—theodicy.</p>
                <p>The attempt to render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to
                    find them in the sphere of spontaneous apperception, and above reflective
                    necessity, can hardly be regarded as successful. It may be that we first of all
                    primitively or spontaneously affirm cause, substance, time, space, &amp;c., in
                    this way. But these are still in each instance given us as realized in a
                    particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much
                    less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their
                    application. We might thus get particular instances or cases of these laws, but
                    we could never get the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute
                    impersonality. And as they are not supposed to be mere generalizations from
                    experience, no amount of individual instances of the application of any one of
                    them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of
                    their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity.
                    We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal
                    application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is
                    grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far
                    and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course
                    questions still to be solved.</p>
                <p>But if these three correlative facts are immediately given, it seems to be
                    thought possible by Cousin to vindicate them in reflective consciousness. He
                    seeks to trace the steps which the reason has spontaneously and consciously, but
                    irreflectively, followed. And here the question arises— Can we vindicate in a
                    reflective or mediate process this spontaneous apprehension of reality <hi
                    rend="italic">1</hi></p>
                <p>The self is found to be a cause or force, free in its action, on the ground that
                    we are obliged to relate the volition of consciousness to the self as its cause,
                    and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is
                    immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection
                    working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and
                    charactér. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of
                    causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us
                    either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an
                    ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant <hi rend="italic">a
                    cause</hi> of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further,
                    the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary,
                    would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its
                    effect,—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the
                    first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or
                    ground,—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.</p>
                <p>The same criticism is even more emphatically applicable to the influence of a
                    not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of
                    them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this,
                    even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being
                    independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of
                    sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of
                    forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our
                    sensations, it could never-tell us, for the simple reason that such a notion is
                    not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot acid to the number
                    of our notions,—cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is
                    to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but <hi
                    rend="italic">what</hi> that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even
                    suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be adequate to the effect. Sensation
                    might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not fro:n a world
                    of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful,
                    acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a
                    suppositionis, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of
                    probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality,— a will—in our
                    own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by
                    reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the
                    realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension.
                    The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from
                    the two limited forces <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n559/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0559-0528"/> which he names self and not-seff. Immediate
                    spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by
                    reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is
                    a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative
                    or finite.</p>
                <p>The truth is that Μ. Cousin’s doctrine of the spontaneous apperception of
                    impersonal truth amounts to little more than a presentment in philosophical
                    language of the ordinary convictions and beliefs of mankind. This is important
                    as a preliminary stage, but philosophy properly begins when it attempts to
                    co-ordinate or systematize those convictions in harmony, to conciliate apparent
                    contradiction and opposition, as between the correlative notions of finite and
                    infinite, the apparently conflicting notions of personality and infinitude, self
                    and not-self; in a word, to reconcile the various sides of consciousness with
                    each other. And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence
                    and being,—whether and how we are to relate our fundamental, intellectual, and
                    moral conceptions to what is beyond our experience, or to an infinite being,—are
                    problems which Cousin cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth
                    the outstanding problems of modern philosophy.</p>
                <p>Cousin’s doctrine of spontaneity in volition can hardly be said to be more
                    successful than his impersonality of the reason through spontaneous
                    apperception. Sudden, unpremeditated volition may be the earliest and the most
                    artistic, but it is not the best. Volition is essentially a free choice between
                    alternatives, and that is best which is most deliberate, because it is most
                    rational. Aristotle long ago touched this point in his distinction between <hi
                    rend="italic">βoυλησιs</hi> and τrpoαip∈σις. The sudden and unpremeditated wish
                    represented by the former is wholly inferior in character to the free choice of
                    the latter, guided and illumined by intelligence. In this we can deliberately
                    resolve upon what is in our power; in that we are subject to the vain impulse of
                    wishing the impossible. Spontaneity is pleasing, sometimes beautiful, but it is
                    not in this instance the highest quality of the thing to be obtained. That is to
                    be found in a guiding and illumining reflective activity.</p>
                <p>Eclecticism is not open to the superficial objection of proceeding without a
                    system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to the
                    objection of assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached
                    all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their
                    combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that <hi rend="subscript">
                    k</hi> which is not in the individual consciousness <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> In
                    a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there, and we ought not
                    at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely
                    to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements, and combinations
                    of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of
                    applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are
                    developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all
                    be the case; but we may find at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or
                    co-operative, as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the
                    question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general
                    consciousness of mankind is assumed to be non-existent or impossible.</p>
                <p>It was the tendency of the philosophy of Cousin to outline things and to fill up
                    the details in an artistic and imaginative interest. This is necessarily the
                    case, especially in the application to history of all formulas supposed to be
                    derived either from an analysis of consciousness, or from an abstraction called
                    pure thought. Cousin was observational and generalizing rather than analytic and
                    discriminating. His search into principles was not profound, and his power of
                    rigorous consecutive development was not remarkable. These qualities are
                    essential to the formation of a lasting body of philosophic knowledge. He has
                    left no distinctive principle of philosophy which is likely to be permanent. But
                    he has left very interesting psychological analyses,and several new’, just, and
                    true expositions of philosophical systems, especially that of Locke and the
                    philosophers of Scotland. He was at the same time a man of impressive power, of
                    rare and wide culture, and of lofty aim,—far above priestly conception and
                    Philistine narrowness. He was familiar w ith the broad lines of nearly every
                    system of philosophy ancient and modern. His eclecticism was the proof of a
                    reverential sympathy with the struggles of human thought to attain to certainty
                    in the highest problems of speculation. It was eminently a doctrine of
                    comprehension and of toleration. In these respects it formed a marked and
                    valuable contrast to the arrogance of absolutism, which really means a supreme
                    egoism, to the narrow dogmatism of sensationalism, and to the not less narrow
                    doctrine of church authority, preached by the theological school of his day. His
                    spirit, while it influenced the youth of France, saved them from the effects of
                    all these lowering influences. As an earnest educational reformer, as a man of
                    letters and learning, w ho trode “the large and impartial ways of knowledge,”
                    and who swayed others to the same paths, as a thinker influential alike in the
                    action and the reaction to which he led,—in some cases the petulant detraction
                    which may pass as a tribute to power,—Cousin stands out conspicuously among the
                    memorable Frenchmen of the 19 th century.</p>
                <p>We might be inclined to modify the strength of some of the follow ing
                    expressions, but we cannot help feeling that they are in the main true :—“A
                    profound and original thinker, a lucid and eloquent w riter, a scholar equally
                    at home in ancient and in modern learning, a philosopher superior to all
                    prejudices of age or country, party or profession, and whose lofty eclecticism,
                    seeking truth under every form of opinion, traces its unity even through the
                    most hostile systems.” Such was the estimate of Victor Cousin by the acutest
                    critic and most resolute opponent of his philosophy in this century.<note
