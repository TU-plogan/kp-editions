                    Toulouse, and rapidly gained a great reputation as a lecturer on Justinian. He
                    was an unsuccessful candidate for the chair of law at his native place in 1554,
                    but in the same year he was appointed to a similar position at Cahors, and about
                    a year after L’Hôpital called him to Bourges. Duaren, however, who also held a
                    professorship at Bourges, stirred up the students against the new professor, and
                    such was the disorder produced in consequence that Cujas was glad to yield to
                    the storm, and accept an invitation ho had received to the university of
                    Valence. Recalled to Bourges at the death of Duaren in 1559, he remained there
                    till 1567, when he returned to Vxlence, whore he gained a European reputation,
                    and collected students from all parts of the Continent, among whom may be
                    mentioned Joseph Scaliger and De Thou. In 1573 Charles IX. appointed Cujas
                    counsellor to the Parliament of Grenoble, and in the following year a pension
                    was bestowed on him by Henry III. Margaret of Savoy induced him to remove to
                    Turin: but after a few months (1575) he once more took his old place at Bourges.
                    But the religious wars drove him thence. He was called by the king to Paris, and
                    permission was granted him by the Parliament to lecture on civil law in the
                    university of the capital. A year after, however, he finally took up his
                    residence at Bourges, where he remained till his death in 1590, in spite of a
                    handsome offer made him by Gregory XIII. in 1584 to attract him to Bologna.</p>
                <p>The life of Cujas was altogether that of a scholar and teacher. In the religious
                    wars which filled all the thoughts of his contemporaries he steadily refused to
                    take any part. <hi rend="italic">Nihil hoc ad edictum praetoris, “</hi> this has
                    nothing to do with the edict of the praetor,” was his usual answer to those who
                    spoke to him on the subject. His merit as a jurisconsult, which has been
                    surpassed by none, arose from the fact that he turned from the ignorant
                    commentators on Roman law to the Roman law itself. He consulted a very large
                    number of manuscripts, of which he had collected more than 500 in his own
                    library; but, unfortunately, he left orders in his will that his library should
                    be divided among a number of purchasers, and his collection was thus scattered,
                    and in great part lost. His emendations, of which a large number were published
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Observations and Corrections,</hi> were not
                    confined to law-books, but extended to many of the Latin and Greek classical
                    authors. In jurisprudence his study was far from being devoted solely to
                    Justinian; he recovered and gave to the world a part of the Theodosian Code,
                    with explanations; and he procured the manuscript of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Basilica,</hi> a Greek abridgment of Justinian, afterwards published bÿ Fabrot
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Basilica).</hi> He also composed a commentary on the
                    <hi rend="italic">Consuetudines</hi><hi rend="italic">Feudorum,</hi> and on some
                    books of the Decretals. In the <hi rend="italic">Paratitla,</hi> or summaries
                    which he made of the Digest, and particularly of the Code of Justinian, he
                    condensed into short axioms the elementary principles of law, and gave
                    definitions remarkable for their admirable clearness and precision. His lessons,
                    which he never dictated, w ere continuous discourses, for which he made no other
                    preparation than that of profound meditation on the subjects to be discussed. He
                    was in patient of interruption, and upon the least noise he would instantly quit
                    the chair and retire. He was strongly attached to his pupils, and Scaliger
                    affirms that he lost more than 4C00 livres by lending money to such of them as
                    were in want.</p>
                <p>In his lifetime Cujas published an edition of his works (Neville, 1577). It is
                    beautiful and exact, but incomplete; it is now very scarce. The edition of
                    Colombet (1634) is also incomplete. Fabrot, however, collected the whole in the
                    edition which he published at Paris (1658), in 10 vols, folio, and which was
                    reprinted at Naples (1722, 1727), in 11 vols, folio, and at Naples and at Venice
                    (1758), in 10 vols, folio, with an index forming an eleventh volume. In the
                    editions of Naples and Venice there are some additions not to be found in that
                    of Fabrot, particularly a general table, which will be found very useful, and
                    interpretations of all the Greek words used by Cujas.</p>
