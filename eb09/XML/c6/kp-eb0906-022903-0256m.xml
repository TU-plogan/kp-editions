                    still the aim and interest of all his thinking was also theirs, namely, the
                    renovation of the conditions of the social union. If, however, we classify him,
                    not thus according to aim, but according to method, then he takes rank among men
                    of a very different type from these. What distinguishes him in method from his
                    contemporaries is his discernment that the social order cannot be transformed
                    until all the theoretic conceptions that belong to it have been rehandled in a
                    scientific spirit, and maturely gathered up into a systematic whole along with
                    the rest of our knowledge. This presiding doctrine connects Comte with the
                    social thinkers of the 18th century,—indirectly with Montesquieu, directly with
                    Turgot, and more closely than either with Condorcet, of whom he was accustomed
                    to speak as his philosophic father.</p>
                <p>Isidore-Auguste-Marie-Frauçois-Xavier Comte was born in January 1798, at
                    Montpellier, where his father was a receiver-general of taxes for the district.
                    He was sent for his earliest instruction to the school of the town, and in 1814
                    was admitted to the École Polytechnique. His youth was marked by a constant
                    willingness to rebel against merely official authority; to genuine excellence,
                    whether moral or intellectual, he was always ready to pay unbounded deference.
                    That strenuous application which was one of his most remarkable gifts in manhood
                    showed itself in his youth, and his application was backed or inspired by
                    superior intelligence and aptness. After he had been two years at the Ecole
                    Polytechnique he took a foremost part in a mutinous demonstration against one of
                    the masters; the school was broken up, and Comte like the other scholars was
                    sent home. To the great dissatisfaction of his parents, he resolved to return to
                    Paris (1816), and to earn his living there by giving lessons in mathematics.
                    Benjamin Franklin was the youth’s idol at this moment. “I seek to imitate the
                    modern Socrates,” he wrote to a school friend, “not in talents, but in way of
                    living. You kno,w that at five and twenty he formed the design of becoming
                    perfectly wise, and that he fulfilled his design. I have dared to undertake the
                    same thing, though I am not yet twenty.” Though Comte’s character and aims were
                    as far removed as possible from Franklin’s type, neither Franklin nor any man
                    that ever lived could «surpass him in the heroic tenacity with which, in the
                    face of a thousand obstacles, he pursued his own ideal of a vocation.</p>
                <p>For a moment circumstances led him to think of seeking a career in America, but a
                    friend who preceded him thither warned him of the purely practical spirit that
                    prevailed in the new country. “If Lagrange were to come to the United States, he
                    could only earn his livelihood by turning land surveyor.” So Comte remained in
                    Paris, living as he best could on something less than £80 a year, and hoping,
                    when he took the trouble to break his meditations upon greater things by hopes
                    about himself, that he might by-and-by obtain an appointment as mathematical
                    master in a school. A friend procured him a situation as tutor in the house of
                    Casimir Périer. The salary was good, but the duties were too miscellaneous, and
                    what was still worse, there was an end of the delicious liberty of the garret.
                    After a short experience of three weeks Comte returned to neediness and
                    contentment. He was not altogether without the young man’s appetite for
                    pleasure; yet when he was only nineteen we find him wondering, amid the gaieties
                    of the carnival of 1817, how a gavotte or a minuet could make people forget that
                    thirty thousand human beings around them had barely a morsel to eat. Hardship in
                    youth has many dιawbacks, but it has the immense advantage over academic ease of
                    making the student’s interest in men real, and not merely literary,</p>
                <p>Towards 1818 Comte became associated as friend and disciple with a man who was
                    destined to exercise a very decisive influence upon the turn of his speculation.
                    Henry, count of Saint Simon, was second cousin of the famous duke of Saint
                    Simon, the friend of the Regent, and author of the most important set of memoirs
                    in a language that is so incomparably rich in memoirs. He was now nearly sixty,
                    and if he had not gained a serious reputation, he had at least excited the
                    curiosity and interest of his contemporaries by the social eccentricities of his
                    life, by the multitude of his schemes and devices, and by the fantastic
                    ingenuity of his political ideas. Saint Simon’s most characteristic faculty was
                    an exuberant imagination, working in the sphere of real things. Scientific
                    disciplinedidnυthing for him; he had never undergone it, and he never felt its
                    value. He was an artist in social construction; and if right ideas, or the
                    suggestion of right ideas, sometimes came into his head, about history, about
                    human progress, about a stable polity, such ideas were not the products of
                    trains of ordered reasoning; they were the intuitional glimpses of the poet, and
                    consequently as they professed to be <hi rend="smallcaps">íl</hi><pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0257-0230"/> real matter, even the right ideas were as often
                    as not accompanied by wrong ones.</p>
                <p>The young Comte, now twenty, was enchanted by the philosophic veteran. In after
                    years he so far forgot himself as to write of Saint Simon as a depraved quack,
                    and to deplore his connection with him as purely mischievous. While the
                    connection lasted he thought very differently. Saint Simon is described as the
                    most estimable and lovable of men, and the most delightful in his relations; he
                    is the worthiest of philosophers. Even after the association had come to an end,
                    and at the very moment when Comte was congratulating himself on having thrown
                    off the yoke, he honestly admits that Saint Simon’s influence has been of
                    powerful service in his philosophic education. “I certainly,” he writes to his
                    most intimate friend, “am under great personal obligations to Saint Simon; that
                    is to say, he helped in a powerful degree to launch me in the philosophical
                    direction that I have now definitely marked out for myself, and that I shall
                    follow without looking back for the rest of my life.” Even if there were no such
                    unmistakable expressions as these, the most cursory glance into Saint Simon’s
                    writings is enough to reveal the thread of connection between the ingenious
                    visionary and the systematic thinker. We see the debt, and we also see that when
                    it is stated at the highest possible, nothing has really been taken either from
                    Comte’s claims as a powerful original thinker, or from his immeasurable
                    pre-eminence over Saint Simon in intellectual grasp and vigour and coherence. As
                    high a degree of originality may be shown in transformation as in invention, as
                    Molière and Shakespeare have proved in the region of dramatic art. In philosophy
                    the conditions are not different. <hi rend="italic">Il</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>It is no detriment to Comte’s fame that some of the ideas which he recombined and
                    incorporated in a great philosophic structure had their origin in ideas that
                    were produced almost at random in the incessant fermentation of Saint Simon’s
                    brain. Comte is in no true sense a follower of Saint Simon, but it was
                    undoubtedly Saint Simon who launched him, to take Comte’s own word, by
                    suggesting to his strong and penetrating mind the two starting points of what
                    grew into the Comtist system—first, that political phenomena are as capable of
                    being grouped under laws as other phenomena; and second, that the true
                    destination of philosophy must be social, and the true object of the thinker
                    must be the reorganization of the moral, religious, and political systems. We
                    can readily see what an impulse these far-reaching conceptions would give to
                    Comte’s meditations. There were conceptions of less importance than these, in
                    which it is impossible not to feel that it was Saint Simon’s wrong or imperfect
                    idea that put his young admirer on the track to a right and perfected idea. The
                    subject is not worthy of further discussion. That Comte would have performed
                    some great intellectual achievement, if Saint Simon had never been born, is
                    certain. It is hardly less certain that the great achievement which he did
                    actually perform was originally set in motion by Saint Simon’s conversation,
                    though it was afterwards directly filiated with the fertile speculations of
                    Turgot and Condorcet. Comte thought almost as meanly of Plato as he did of Saint
                    Simon, and he considered Aristotle the prince of all true thinkers; yet their
                    vital difference about Ideas did not prevent Aristotle from calling Plato
                    master.</p>
                <p>After six years the differences between the old and the young philosopher grew
                    too marked for friendship. Comte began to fret under Saint Simon’s pretensions
                    to be his director. Saint Simon, on the other hand, perhaps began to feel
                    uncomfortably conscious of the superiority of his disciple. The occasion of the
                    breach between them (1824) was an attempt on Saint Simon’s part to print a
                    production of Comte’s as if it were in some sort connected with Saint Simon’s
                    schemes of social reorganization. Comte was never a man to quarrel by halves,
                    and not only was the breach not repaired, but long afterwards Comte, as we have
                    said, with painful ungraciousness took to calling the encourager of his youth by
                    very hard names.</p>
                <p>In 1825 Comte married. His marriage was one of tħose pf which “magnanimity owes
                    no account to prudence,” and it did not turn out prosperously. His family were
                    strongly Catholic and royalist, and they were outraged by his refusal to have
                    the marriage performed other than civilly. They consented, however, to receive
                    his wife, and the pair went on a visit to Montpellier. Madame Comte conceived a
                    dislike to the circle she found there, and this was the too early beginning of
                    disputes which lasted for the remainder of their union. In the year of his
                    marriage we find Comte writing to the most intimate of his correspondents:—“I
                    have nothing left but to concentrate my whole moral existence in my intellectual
                    work, a precious but inadequate compensation; and so I must give up, if not the
                    most dazzling, still the sweetest part of my happiness.” We cannot help admiring
                    the heroism which cherishes great ideas in the midst of petty miseries, and
                    intrepidly throws all squalid interruptions into the background which is their
                    true place. Still, we may well suppose that the sordid cares that come with want
                    of money made a harmonious life none the more easy. Comte tried to find pupils
                    to board with him, but only one pupil came, and he was soon sent away for lack
                    of companions. “I would rather spend an evening,” wrote the needy enthusiast,
                    “in solving a difficult question, than in running after some empty-headed and
                    consequential millionaire in search of a pupil.” A little money was earned by an
                    occasional article in <hi rend="italic">Le Producteur,</hi> in which he began to
                    expound the philosophic ideas that were now maturing in his mind. He announced a
                    course of lectures (1826), which it was hoped would bring money as well as fame,
                    and which were to be the first dogmatic exposition of the Positive Philosophy. A
                    friend had said to him, “You talk too freely, your ideas are getting abroad, and
                    other people use them without giving you the credit; put your ownership on
                    record.” The lectures were intended to do this among other things, and they
                    attracted hearers so eminent as Humboldt the cosmologist, as Poinsot the
                    geometer, as Blainville the physiologist.</p>
                <p>Unhappily, after the third lecture of the course, Comte had a severe attack of
                    cerebral derangement, brought on by intense and prolonged meditation, acting on
                    a system that was already irritated by the chagrin of domestic failure. He did
                    not recover his health for more than a year, and as soon as convalescence set in
                    he was seized by so profound a melancholy at the disaster which had thus
                    overtaken him, that he threw himself into the Seine. Fortunately he was rescued,
                    and the shock did not stay his return to mental soundness. One incident of this
                    painful episode is worth mentioning. Lamennais, then in the height of his
                    Catholic exaltation, persuaded Comte’s mother to insiston her son being married
                    with the religious ceremony, and as the younger Madame Comte apparently did not
                    resist, the rite was duly performed, in spite of the fact that the unfortunate
                    man was at the time neither more nor less than raving mad. To such shocking
                    conspiracies against common sense and decency does ecclesiastical zealotry bring
                    even good men like Lamennais. On the other hand, philosophic assailants of
                    Comtism have not always resisted the temptation to recall the circumstance that
                    its founder was once out of his mind,—an unworthy and irrelevant device, that
                    cannot be excused even by the provocation of Comte’s own occasional acerbity. As
                    has been justly said, if Newton once suffered a cerebral attack without on that
                    account forfeiting our veneration for th a <pb break="no"

                    suffered in the same way, and still not have forfeited our respect for what is
                    good in the systems of Positive Philosophy and Positive Polity.</p>
                <p>In 1828 the lectures were renewed, and in 1830 was published the first volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Course of Positive Philosophy.</hi> The sketch and ground
                    plan of this great undertaking had appeared in 1826. The sixth and last volume
                    was published in 1842. The twelve years covering the publication of the first of
                    Comte’s two elaborate works were years of indefatigable toil, and they were the
                    only portion of his life in which he enjoyed a certain measure, and that a very
                    modest measure, of material prosperity. In 1833 he was appointed examiner of the
                    boys in the various provincial schools who aspired to enter the Ecole
                    Polytechnique at Paris. This and two other engagements as a teacher of
                    mathematics secured him an income of some £400 a year. He made Μ. Guizot, then
                    Louis Philippe’s minister, the important proposal to establish a chair of
                    general history of the sciences. If there are four chairs, he argued, devoted to
                    the history of philosophy, that is to say, the minute study of all sorts of
                    dreams and aberrations through the ages, surely there ought to be at least one
                    to explain the formation and progress of our real knowledge? This wise
                    suggestion, which still remains to be acted upon, was at first welcomed,
                    according to Comte’s own account, by Guizot’s philosophic instinct, and then
                    repulsed by his “metaphysical rancour.”</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Comte did his official work conscientiously, sorely as he grudged the
                    time which it took from the execution of the great object of his thoughts. We
                    cannot forbear to transcribe one delightful and touching trait in connection
                    with this part of Comte’s life. “I hardly know if even to you,” he λvrites in
                    the expansion of domestic confidence to his wife, “I dare disclose the sweet and
                    softened feeling that comes over me when I find a young man whose examination is
                    thoroughly satisfactory. Yes, though you may smile, the emotion would easily
                    stir me to tears if I were not carefully on my guard.” Such sympathy with
                    youthful hope, in union with the industry and intelligence that are the only
                    means of bringing the hope to fulfilment, shows that Comte’s dry and austere
                    manner veiled the fires of a generous social emotion. It was this which made the
                    over worked student take upon himself the burden of delivering every year from
                    1831 to 1848 a course of gratuitous lectures on astronomy for a popular
                    audience. The social feeling that inspired this disinterested act showed itself
                    in other ways. He suffered the penalty of imprisonment rather than serve in the
                    national guard; his position was that though he would not take arms against the
                    new monarchy of July, yet being a republican he would take no oath to defend it.
                    The only amusement that Comte permitted himself was a visit to the opera. In his
                    youth he had been a play-goer, but he shortly came to the conclusion that
                    tragedy is a stilted and bombastic art, and after a time comedy interested him
                    no more than tragedy. For the opera he had a genuine passion, which he gratified
                    as often as he could, until his means became too narrow to afford even that
                    single relaxation.</p>
                <p>Of his manner and personal appearance we have the following account from one who
                    was his pupil :—“Daily as the clock struck eight on the horologe of the
                    Luxembourg, while the ringing hammer on the bell was yet audible, the door of my
                    room opened, and there entered a man, short, rather stout, almost what one might
                    call sleek, freshly shaven, without vestige of whisker or moustache. He was iι
                    variably dressed in a suit of the most spotless black, as if going to a dinner
                    party; his white neck-cloth was fresh from the laundress’s hands, and his hat
                    shining like a racer’s coat. He advanced to the arm-chair prepared for him in
                    the centre of the writing-table, laid his hat on the left·hand corner; his
                    snuff-box was deposited on the same side beside the quire of paper placed in
                    readiness for his use, and dipping the pen twice into the ink-bottle, then
                    bringing it to within an inch of his nose, to make sure it was properly filled,
                    he broke silence: ‘ We have said that the chord AB,’ &amp;c. For three quarters
                    of an hour he continued his demonstration, making short notes as he went on, to
                    guide the listener in repeating the problem alone; then, taking up another
                    cahier-which lay beside him, he went over the written repetition of the former
                    lesson. He explained, corrected, or commented till the clock struck nine; then,
                    with the little finger of the right hand brushing from his coat and waistcoat
                    the shower of superfluous snuff which had fallen on them, he pocketed his
                    snuff-box, and resuming his hat, he as silently as when he came in made his exit
                    by the door which I rushed to open for him.</p>
                <p>In 1842, as we have said, the last volume of the <hi rend="italic">Positive
                    Philosophy</hi> was given to the public. Instead of that contentment which we
                    like to picture as the reward of -twelve years of meritorious toil devoted to
                    the erection of a high philosophic edifice, the author of this great
                    contribution found himself in <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>,the midst of a very
                    sea of small troubles. And they were troubles of that uncompensated kind that
                    harass without elevating, and waste a man’s spirit without softening or
                    enlarging it. First, the jar of temperament between Comte and his wife had
                    become so unbearable that they separated (1842). It is not expedient for
                    strangers to attempt to allot blame in such cases, for it is impossible for
                    strangers to know all the deciding circumstances. We need only say that in spite
                    of one or two disadvantageous facts in her career which do not concern the
                    public, Madame Comte seems to have uniformly comported herself towards her
                    husband with an honourable solicitude for his well-being. Comte made her an
                    annual allowance, and for some years after the separation they corresponded on
                    friendly terms. Next in the list of the vexations that greeted Comte on emerging
                    from the long tunnel of philosophizing, was a lawsuit with his publisher. The
                    publisher had impertinently inserted in the sixth volume a protest against a
                    certain foot-note, in which Comte had used some hard words about Μ. Arago. Comte
                    threw himself into the suit with an energy worthy of Voltaire, and he won it.
                    Third, and worst of all, he had prefixed a preface to the sixth volume, in which
                    he deliberately went out of his way to rouse the active enmity of the very men
                    on whom depended his annual re-election to the post of examiner for the
                    Polytechnic School. The result of this perversity was that by-and-by he lost the
                    appointment, and with it one-half of his very modest income. This was the
                    occasion of an episode, which is of more than merely personal interest.</p>
                <p>Before 1842 Comte had been in correspondence with our distinguished countryman, J
                    S. Mill. Mr Mill had been greatly impressed by Comte’s philosophic ideas; he
                    admits that his own <hi rend="italic">System of Logic</hi> owes many valuable
                    thoughts to Comte, and that, in the portion of that work which treats of the
                    logic of the moral sciences, a radical improvement in the conceptions of logical
                    method was derived from the <hi rend="italic">Positive Philosophy.</hi> Their
                    correspondence, which was extremely full and copious, and which we may hope will
                    one day be made accessible to the public, turned principally upon the two great
                    questions of the equality between men and women, and of the expediency and
                    constitution of a sacerdotal or spiritual order. When Comte found himself
                    straitened, he confided the entire circumstances to his English friend. As might
                    be supposed by those who know the affectionate anxiety with which Mr Mill
                    regarded the welfare of any one whom he believed to be doing good work in the
                    world, he at once took pains to have Comte’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n259/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0259-0232"/> loss of income made up to him, until Comte should
                    have had time to repair that loss by his own endeavour. Mr ΛIill persuaded
                    Grote, Molesworth, and Raikes Currie to advance the sum of £240. At the end of
                    the year (that is in 1845) Comte had taken no steps to enable himself to
                    dispense with the aid of the three Englishmen. Mr Mill applied to them again,
                    but with the exception of Grote, who sent a small sum, they gave Cυmte to
                    understand that they expected him to earn his own living. Mr Mill had suggested
                    to Comte that he should write articles for the English periodicals, and
                    expressed his own willingness to translate any such articles from the French.
                    Comte at first fell in with the plan, but he speedily surprised and disconcerted
                    Mr Mill by boldly taking up the position of “high moral magistrate,” and
                    accusing the three defaulting contributors of a scandalous falling away from
                    righteousness and a high mind. Mr Mill was chilled by these pretensions; they
                    struck him as savouring of a totally unexpected charlatanry; and the
                    correspondence came to an end. For Comte’s position in the argument one feels
                    that there is much to be said. If you have good reason for believing that a
                    given thinker is doing work that will destroy the official system of science or
                    philosophy, and if you desire its destruction, then you may fairly be asked to
                    help to provide for him the same kind of material freedom that is secured to the
                    professors and propagators of the official system by the state or by the
                    universities. And if it is a fine thing for a man to leave money behind him in
                    the shape of an endowment for the support of a scientific teacher of whom he has
                    never heard, why should it not be just as natural and as laudable to give money,
                    while he is yet alive, to a teacher whom he both knows and approves of? On the
                    other hand, Grote and Molesworth might say that, for anything they could tell,
                    they would find themselves to be helping the construction of a system of which
                    they utterly disapproved. And, as things turned out, they would have been
                    perfectly justified in this serious apprehension. To have done anything to make
                    the production of the <hi rend="italic">Positive Polity</hi> easier would have
                    been no ground for anything but remorse to any of the three. It is just to Comte
                    to remark that he always assumed that the contributors to the support of a
                    thinker should be in all •essentials of method and doctrine that thinker’s
                    disciples; aid from indifferent persons he counted irrational and humiliating.
                    But is an endowment ever a blessing to the man who receives it? The question is
                    difficult to answer generally; in Comte’s case there is reason in the doubts
                    felt by Madame Comte as to the expediency of relieving the philosopher from the
                    necessity of being in plain and business-like relations with indifferent persons
                    for a certain number of hours in the week. Such relations do as much as a
                    doctrine to keep egoism within decent bounds, and they must be not only a
                    relief, but a wholesome corrective to the tendencies of concentrated thinking on
                    abstract subjects.</p>
                <p>What finally happened was this. From 1845 to 1848 Comte lived as best he could,
                    as well as made his wife her allowance, on an income of £200 a year. We need
                    scarcely say that he was rigorously thrifty. His little account books of income
                    and outlay, with every item entered down to a few hours before his death, are
                    accurate and neat enough to have satisfied an ancient Roman householder. In
                    1848, through no fault of his own, his salary was reduced to £80. Μ. Littré and
                    others, with Comte’s approval, published an appeal for subscriptions, and on the
                    money thus contributed Comte subsisted for the remaining nine years of his life.
                    By 1852 the subsidy produced as much as £200 a year. It is worth noticing, after
                    the story we have told, that Mr Mill <hi rend="smallcaps">wλs</hi> one of the
                    subscribers, and that Μ. Littré continued his assistance after he had been
                    driven from Comte’s society by his high pontifical airs. We are sorry not to be
                    able to record any similar trait of magnanimity on Comte’s part. His character,
                    admirable as it is for firmness, for intensity, for inexorable will, for iron
                    devotion to what he thought the service of mankind, yet offers few of those
                    softening qualities that make us love good men and pity bad ones. He is of the
                    type of Brutus or of Cato—a model of austere fixity of purpose, but ungracious,
                    domineering, and not quite free from petty bitterness.</p>
                <p>If you seek to place yourself in sympathy with Comte it is best to think of him
                    only as the intellectual worker, pursuing in uncomforted obscurity the laborious
                    and absorbing task to which he had given up his whole life. His singularly
                    conscientious fashion of elaborating his ideas made the mental strain more
                    intense than even so exhausting a work as the abstract exposition of the
                    principles of positive science need have been, if he had followed a more
                    self-indulgent plan. He did not write dow n a word until he had first composed
                    the whole matter in his mind. When he had thoroughly meditated every sentence,
                    he sat down to write, and then, such was the grip of his memory, the exact order
                    of his thoughts came back to him as if without an effort, and he wrote down
                    precisely what he had intended to write, without the aid. of a note or a
                    memorandum, and without check or pause. For example, he began and completed in
                    about six weeks a chapter in the <hi rend="italic">Positive Philosophy</hi>
                    (vol. v. ch. 55), which would fill forty of the large pages of this <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopaedia.</hi> Even if his subject had been merely narrative
                    or descriptive, this would be a very satisfactory piece of continuous
                    production. When we reflect that the chapter in question is not narrative, but
                    an abstract exposition of the guiding principles of the movements of several
                    centuries, with many threads of complex thought running along side by side all
                    through the speculation, then the circumstances under which it was reduced to
                    literary form are really astonishing. It is hardly possible for a critic to
                    share the admiration expressed by some of Comte’s disciples for his style. We
                    are not so unreasonable as to blame him for failing to make his pages
                    picturesque or thrilling; we do not want sunsets and stars and roses and
                    ecstasy; but there is a certain standard for the most serious and abstract
                    subjects. When compared with such philosophic writing as Hume’s, Diderot’s,
                    Berkeley’s, then Comte’s manner is heavy, laboured, monotonous, without relief,
                    and without light. There is nowand then an energetic phrase, but as a whole the
                    vocabulary is jejune; the sentences are overloaded; the pitch is flat. A
                    scrupulous insistence on making his meaning clear led to an iteration of certain
                    adjectives and adverbs, which at length deaden the effect beyond the endurance
                    of all but the most resolute students. Only the profound and stimulating
                    interest of much of the matter prevents one from thinking of Rivarol’s
                    ill-natured remark upon Condorcet, that he wrote with opium on a page of lead.
                    The general effect is impressive, not by any virtues of style, for we do not
                    discern one, but by reason of the magnitude and importance of the undertaking,
                    and the visible conscientiousness and the grasp with which it is executed. It is
                    by sheer strength of thought, by the vigorous perspicacity with which he strikes
                    the lines of cleavage of his subject, that he makes his way into the mind of the
                    reader; in the presence of gifts of this power we need not quarrel with an
                    ungainly style.</p>
                <p>Comte pursued one practice which ought to be mentioned in connection with his
                    personal history, the practice of what he styled <hi rend="italic">hygiène
                    cérébrale.</hi> After he had acquired wliat he considered to be a sufficient
                    stock of material, and this happened before he had completed the <hi

                    scrupulously from <pb break="no"

                    transactions, and everything else whatever, except two or three poets (notably
                    Dante) and the <hi rend="italic">Imitatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Christi.</hi> It
                    is true that his friends kept him informed of what was going on in the
                    scientific world. Still this partial divorce of himself from the record of the
                    social and scientific activity of his time, though it may save a thinker from
                    the deplorable evils of dispersion, moral and intellectual, accounts in no small
                    measure for the exaggerated egoism, and the absence of all feeling for reality,
                    which marked Comte’s later days.</p>
                <p>Only one important incident in Comte’s life now remains to be spoken of. In 1845
                    he made the acquaintance of Madame Clotilde de Vaux, a lady whose husband had
                    been sent to the galleys for life, and who was therefore, in all but the legal
                    incidents of her position, a widow. Very little is known about her qualities.
                    She wrote a little piece which Comte rated so preposterously as to talk about
                    George Sand in the same sentence; it is in truth a flimsy performance, though it
                    contains one or two gracious thoughts. There is true beauty in the saying—“A <hi
                    rend="italic">is unworthy of a noble nature to diffuse its painf</hi> Madame de
                    Vaux’s letters speak well for her good, sense and good feeling, and it would
                    have been better for Comte’s later work if she had survived to exert a wholesome
                    restraint on his exaltation. Their friendship had only lasted a year when she
                    died (1846), but the period was long enough to give her memory a supreme
                    ascendency in Comte’s mind. Condillac, Joubert, Mill, and other eminent men have
                    shown what the intellectual ascendency of a woman can be. Comte was as
                    inconsolable after Madame de Vaux’s death as D’Alembert after the death of
                    Mademoiselle L’Espinasse. Every Wednesday afternoon he made a reverential
                    pilgrimage to her tomb, and three times every day he invoked her memory in words
                    of passionate expansion. His disciples believe that in time the world will
                    reverence Comte’s sentiment about Clotilde de Vaux, as it reveres Dante’s
                    adoration of Beatrice—a parallel that Comte himself was the first to Lit upon.
                    It is no doubt the worst kind of cynicism to make a mock in a realistic vein of
                    any personality that has set in motion the idealizing thaumaturgy of the
                    affections. Yet we cannot help feeling that it is a grotesque and unseemly
                    anachronism to apply in grave prose, addressed to the whole world, those terms
                    of saint and angel which are touching and in their place amid the trouble and
                    passion of the great mystic poet. Only an energetic and beautiful imagination,
                    together with a mastery of the rliythm and swell of impassioned speech, can
                    prevent an invitation to the public to hearken to the raptures of intense
                    personal attachment from seeming ludicrous and almost indecent. Whatever other
                    gifts Comte may have had—and he had many of the rarest kind,—poetic imagination
                    was not among them, any more than poetic or emotional expression was among them.
                    His was one of those natures whose faculty of deep feeling is unhappily doomed
                    to be inarticulate, and to pass away without the magic power of transmitting
                    itself.</p>
                <p>Comte lost no time, after the completion of his <hi rend="italic">Course of
                    Positive Philosophy,</hi> in proceeding with the <hi rend="italic">System of
                    Positive Polity,</hi> to which the earlier work was designed to be a foundation.
                    The first volume was published in 1851, and the fourth and last in 1854. In
                    1848, when the political air was charged with stimulating elements, he founded
                    the Positive Society, with the expectation that it might grow into a reunion as
                    powerful over the new revolution as the Jacobin Club had been in the
                    revoluti&lt;√* of 1789. The hope was not fulfilled, but a certain number of
                    philosophic disciples gathered round Comte, and eventually formed themselves,
                    under the guidance of the new ideas of the latter half of his life, into a kind
                    of church.</p>
                <p>In the years 1849,1850, and 1851, Comte gave three courses of lectures at the
                    Palais Royal. They were gratuitous and popular, and in them he boldly advanced
                    the whole of his doctrine, as well as the direct and immediate pretensions of
                    himself and his system. The third course ended in the following uncompromising
                    terms—“In the name of the Past and of the Future, the servants of Humanity—both
                    its philosophical and its practical servants—come forward to claim as their due
                    the general direction of this world. Their object is to constitute at length a
                    real Providence in all departments,—moral, intellectual, and material.
                    Consequently they exclude once for all from political supremacy all the
                    different servants of God—Catholic Protestant, or Deist—as being at once
                    behindhand, and a cause of disturbance.” A few weeks after this invitation, a
                    very different person stepped forward to constitute himself a real
                    Providence.</p>
                <p>In 1852 Comte published the <hi rend="italic">Catechism of Positivism.</hi> In
                    the preface to it he took occasion to express his approval of Louis Napoleon’s
                    <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> of the second of December, —“a fortunate
                    crisis which has set aside the parliamentary system, and instituted a
                    dictatorial republic.” Whatever we may think df the political sagacity of such a
                    judgment, it is due to Comte to say that he did not expect to see his
                    dictatorial republic transformed into a dynastic empire, and, next, that he did
                    expect from the Man of December freedom of the press and of public meeting. His
                    later hero was the Emperor Nicholas, “the only statesman in Christendom,”—as
                    unlucky a judgment as that which placed Dr Francia in the Comtist Calendar.</p>
                <p>In 1857 he was attacked by cancer, and died peaceably on the 5th of September of
                    that year. The anniversary is always celebrated by ceremonial gatherings of his
                    French and English followers, who then commemorate the name and the services of
                    the founder of their religion. Comte was under sixty when he died. We cannot
                    help reflecting that one of the worst of all the evils connected with the
                    shortness of human life is the impatience which it breeds in some of the most
                    ardent and enlightened minds to hurry on the execution of projects, for which
                    neither the time nor the spirit of their author is fully ripe.</p>
                <p>In proceeding to give an outline of Comte’s system, we shall consider the <hi
                    rend="italic">Positive Polity</hi> as the more or less legitimate sequel of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Positive Philosophy,</hi> notwithstanding the deep gulf which
                    so eminent a critic as Dlr Mill insisted upon fixing between the earlier and the
                    later work. Tnere may be, as we think there is, the greatest difference in their
                    value, and the temper is not the same, nor the method. But the two are quite
                    capable of being regarded, and for the purposes of an account of Comte’s career
                    ought to be regarded, as an integral whole. His letters when he was a young man
                    of one-ai d-twenty, and before he had published a word, show how strongly
                    present the social motive was in his mind, and in what little account ho should
                    hold his scientific works, if he did not perpetually think of their utility for
                    the species, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> I feel,” he wrote, “that such
                    scientific reputation as I might acquire would give more value, more weight,
                    more useful influence to my political sermons.” In 1822 he published a <hi
                    rend="italic">Plan of the Scientific Works necessary to Reorganize Society.</hi>
                    In this opuscule he points out that modern society is passing through a great
                    crisis, due to the conflict of two opposing movements,—the first, a
                    disorganizing movement owing to the break-up of old institutions and beliefs;
                    the second, a movement towards a definite social state, in which all means of
                    human prosperity will receive their most complete development and most direct
                    application. How is this crisis to be dealt with 1 What are the undertakings
                    necessary in order to pass successfully through it towards an organic state î
                    The answer to this is that there are two <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n261/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0261-0234"/> series of works. The first is theoretic or
                    spiritual, aiming at the development of a new principle of co-ordinating social
                    relations, and the formation of the system of general ideas which are destined
                    to guide society. The second work is practical or temporal; it settles the
                    distribution of power, and the institutions that are most conformable to the
                    spirit of the system which has previously been thought out in the course of the
                    theoretic work. As the practical work depends on the conclusions of the
                    theoretical, the latter must obviously come first in order of execution.</p>
                <p>In 1826 this was pushed further in a most remarkable piece called <hi
                    rend="italic">Considerations on the Spiritual Power—</hi> the main object of
                    which is to demonstrate the necessity of instituting a spiritual power, distinct
                    from the temporal power and independent of it. In examining the conditions of a
                    spiritual power proper for modern times, he indicates in so many terms the
                    presence in his mind of a direct analogy between his proposed spiritual power
                    and the functions of the Catholic clergy at the time of its greatest vigour and
                    most complete independence,—that is to say, from about the middle of the 11th
                    century until towards the end of the 13th. He refers to De Maistre <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s memorable book, <hi rend="italic">Du Pape,</hi> as
                    the most profound, accurate, and methodical account of the old spiritual
                    organization, and starts from that as the model to be adapted to the changed
                    intellectual and social conditions of the modern time. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Positive Philosophy,</hi> again (vol. v. p. 344), he distinctly says that
                    Catholicism, reconstituted as a system on new intellectual foundations, would
                    finally preside over the spiritual reorganization of modern society. Much else
                    could easily be quoted to the same effect. If unity of career, then, means that
                    Comte from the beginning designed the institution of a spiritual power, and the
                    systematic reorganization of life, it is difficult to deny him whatever credit
                    that unity may be worth, and the credit is perhaps not particularly great. Even
                    the re-adaptation of the Catholic system to a scientific doctrine was plainly in
                    his mind thirty years before the final execution of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Positive Polity,</hi> though it is difficult to believe that he foresaw the
                    religious mysticism in which the task was to iand him. A great analysis was to
                    precede a great synthesis, but it was the synthesis on which Comte’s vision was
                    centred from the first. Let us first sketch the nature of the analysis. Society
                    is to be reorganized on the base of knowledge. What is the sum and significance
                    of knowledge <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> That is the question which Comte’s first
                    masterwork professes to answer.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Positive Philosophy</hi> opens with the statement of a
                    certain law of which Comte was the discoverer, and which has always been treated
                    both by disciples and dissidents as the key to his system. This is the Law of
                    the Three States. It is as follows. Each of our leading conceptions, each branch
                    of our knowledge, passes successively through three different phases; there are
                    three different ways in which the human mind explains phenomena, each way
                    following the other in order. These three stages are the Theological, the
                    Metaphysical, and the Positive. Knowledge, or a branch of knowledge, is in the
                    Theological state, when it supposes the phenomena under consideration to be due
                    to immediate volition, either in the object or in some supernatural being. In
                    the Metaphysical state, for volition is substituted abstract force residing in
                    the object, yet existing independently of the object; the phenomena are viewed
                    as if apart from the bodies manifesting them; and the properties of each
                    substance have attributed to them an existence distinct from that substance. In
                    the Positive state, inherent volition or external volition and inherent force or
                    abstraction personified have both disappeared from men’s minds, and the
                    explanation of a phenomenon means a reference of it, by way of succession or
                    resemblance, to some other phenomenon,—means the establishment of a relation
                    between the given fact and some more general fact. In the Theological and
                    Metaphysical state men seek a cause or an essence; in the Positive they are
                    content with a law. To borrow an illustration from an able English disciple of
                    Comte :—“Take the phenomenon of the sleep produced by opium. The Arabs are
                    content to attribute it to the ‘ will of God.' Molière’s medical student
                    accounts for it by a <hi rend="italic">soporific principle</hi> contained in the
                    opium. The modern physiologist knows that he cannot account for it at all. He
                    can simply observe, analyze, and experiment upon the phenomena attending the
                    action of the drug, and classify it with other agents analogous in character.”—
                    <hi rend="italic">(Dr Bridges.)</hi></p>
                <p>The first and greatest aim of the Positive Philosophy is to advance the study of
                    society into the third of the three stages,—to remove social phenomena from the
                    sphere of theological and metaphysical conceptions, and to introduce among them
                    the same scientific observation of their laws which has given us physics,
                    chemistry, physiology. Social physics will consist of the conditions and
                    relations of the facts of society, and will have two departments,—one, statical,
                    containing the laws of order; the other dynamical, containing the laws of
                    progress. While men’s minds were in the theological state, political events, for
                    example, were explained by the will of the gods, and political authority based
                    on divine right. In the metaphysical state of mind, then, to retain our
                    instance, political authority was based on the sovereignty of the people, and
                    social facts were explained by the figment of a falling away from a state of
                    nature. When the positive method has been finally extended to society, as it has
                    been to chemistry and physiology, these social facts will be resolved, as their
                    ultimate analysis, into relations with one another, and instead of seeking
                    causes in the old sense of the word, men will only examine the conditions of
                    social existence. When that stage has been reached, not merely the greater part,
                    but the whole, of our knowledge will be impressed with one character, the
                    character, namely, of positivity or scientifical-ness; and all our conceptions
                    in every pari of knowledge will be thoroughly homogeneous. ïhe gains of such a
                    change are enormous. The new philosophical unity will now in its turn regenerate
                    all the elements that went to its own formation. The mind will pursue knowledge
                    without the wasteful jar and friction of conflicting methods and mutually
                    hostile conceptions; education will be regenerated; and society will reorganize
                    itself on the only possible solid base—a homogeneous philosophy.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Positive Philosophy</hi> has another object besides the
                    demonstration of the necessity and propriety of a science of society. This
                    object is to show the sciences as branches from a single trunk,—is to give to
                    science the ensemble or spirit of generality hitherto confined to philosophy,
                    and to give to philosophy the rigour and solidity of science. Comte’s special
                    object is a study of social physics, a science that before his advent was still
                    to be formed; his second object is a review of the methods and leading
                    generalities of all the positive sciences already formed, so that we may know
                    both what system of inquiry to follow in∙our new science, and also where the new
                    science will stand in relation to other knowledge.</p>
                <p>The first step in this direction is to arrange scientific method and positive
                    knowledge in order, and this brings us to another cardinal element in the
                    Comtist system, the classification of the sciences. In the front of the inquiry
                    lies one main division, that, namely, between speculative and practical
                    knowledge. With the latter we have no concern. Speculative or theoretic
                    knowledge js divided into abstract and concrete. The former is concerned with
                    the laws that regulate phenomena in all conceivable cases: <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n262/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0262-0235"/> the latter is concerned with the application of
                    these laws. Concrete science relates to objects or beings; abstract science to
                    events. The former is particular or descriptive; the latter is general. Thus,
                    physiology is an abstract science; but zoology is concrete. Chemistry is
                    abstract; mineralogy is concrete. It is the method and knowledge of the abstract
                    sciences that the Positive Philosophy has to reorganize in a great whole.</p>
                <p>Comte’s principle of classification is that the dependence and order of
                    scientific study follows the dependence of the phenomena. Thus, as has been
                    said, it represents both the objective dependence of the phenomena and the
                    subjective dependence of our means of knowing them. The more particular and
                    complex phenomena depend upon the simpler and more general. The latter are the
                    more easy to study. Therefore science will begin with those attributes of
                    objects which are most general, and pass on gradually to other attributes that
                    are combined in greater complexity. Thus, too, each science rests on the truths
                    of the sciences that precede it, while it adds to them the truths by which it is
                    itself constituted. Comte’s series or hierarchy is arranged as follows :—(1)
                    Mathematics (that is, number, geometry, and mechanics), (2) Astronomy, (3)
                    Physics, (4) Chemistry, (5) Biology, (6) Sociology. Each of the members of this
                    series is one degree more special than the member before it, and depends upon
                    the facts of all the members preceding it, and cannot be fully understood
                    without them. It follows that the crowning science of the hierarchy, dealing
                    with the phenomena of human society, will remain longest under the influence of
                    theological dogmas and abstract figments, and will be the last to pass into the
                    positive stage. You cannot discover the relations of the facts of human society
                    without reference to the conditions of animal life; you cannot understand the
                    conditions of animal life without the laws of chemistry; and so with the
                    rest.</p>
                <p>This arrangement of the sciences, and the Law of the Three States, are together
                    explanatory of the course of human thought and knowledge. They are thus the
                    double key of Comte’s systematization of the philosophy of all the sciences from
                    mathematics to physiology, and his analysis of social evolution, which is the
                    base of sociology. Each science contributes its philosophy. The co-ordination of
                    all these partial philosophies produces the general Positive Philosophy.
                    “Thousands had cultivated science, and with splendid success; not one had
                    conceived the philosophy which the sciences when organized would naturally
                    evolve. A few had seen the necessity of extending the scientific method to all
                    inquiries, but no one had seen how this was to be effected The Positive
                    Philosophy is novel as a philosophy, not as a collection of truths never before
                    suspected. Its novelty is the organization of existing elements. Its very
                    principle implies the absorption of all that great thinkers had achieved; while
                    incorporating their results it extended their methods What tradition brought was
                    the results; what Comte brought was the organization of these results. He always
                    claimed to be the founder of the Positive Philosophy. That he had every right to
                    such a title is demonstrable to all who distinguish between the positive
                    sciences and the philosophy which coordinated the truths and methods of these
                    sciences into a doctrine.”—(6 <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                    >H. Lewes.)</hi></p>
                <p>We may interrupt our short exposition here to remark that Comte’s classification
                    of the sciences has been subjected to a vigorous criticism by Mr Herbert
                    Spencer. Mr Spencer’s two chief points are these :—(1) He denies that the
                    principle of the development of the sciences is the principle of decreasing
                    generality; he asserts that there are as many examples of the advent of a
                    science being determined by increasing generality as by increasing speciality.
                    (2) He holds that any grouping of the sciences in a succession gives a radically
                    wrong idea of their genesis and their interdependence; no true filiation exists;
                    no science develops itself in isolation; no one is independent, either logically
                    or historically. Μ. Littré, by far the most eminent of the scientific followers
                    of Comte, concedes a certain force to Mr Spencer’s objections, and makes certain
                    secondary modifications in the hierarchy in consequence, while still cherishing
                    his faith in the Comtist theory of the sciences. Mr Mill, while admitting the
                    objections as good, if Comte’s arrangement pretended to be the only one
                    possible, still holds that arrangement as tenable for the purpose with which it
                    was devised. Mr Lewes asserts against Mr Spencer that the arrangement in a
                    series is necessary, on grounds similar to those which require that the various
                    truths constituting a science should be systematically co-ordinated although in
                    nature the phenomena are intermingled.</p>
                <p>The first three volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Positive Philosophy</hi> contain
                    an exposition of the partial philosophies of the five sciences that precede
                    sociology in the hierarchy /Their value has usually been placed very low by the
                    special followers of the sciences concerned; they say that the knowledge is
                    second-hand, is not coherent, and is too confidently taken for final. The
                    Comtist replies that the task is philosophic, and is not to be judged by the
                    minute accuracies of science. In these three volumes Comte took the sciences
                    roughly as he found them. His eminence as a man of science must be measured by
                    his only original work in that department,—the construction, namely, of the new
                    science of society. This work is accomplished in the last three volumes of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Positive Philosophy,</hi> and the second and third volumes of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Positive Polity.</hi> The Comtist maintains that even if
                    these five volumes together fail in laying down correctly and finally the lines
                    of the new science, still they are the first solution of a great problem
                    hitherto unattempted. “Modern biology has got beyond Aristotle’s conception; but
                    in the construction of the biological science, not even the most unphilosophical
                    biologist would fail to recognize the value of Aristotle’s attempt. So for
                    sociology. Subsequent sociologists may have conceivably to remodel the whole
                    science, yet not the less will they recognize the merit of the first work which
                    has facilitated their labours.”— <hi rend="italic">(Congreve.)</hi></p>
                <p>We shall now briefly describe Comte’s principal conceptions in sociology, his
                    position in respect to which is held by himself, and by others, to raise him to
                    the level of Descartes or Leibnitz. Of course the first step was to approach the
                    phenomena of human character and social existence with the expectation of
                    finding them as reducible to general laws as the other phenomena of the
                    universe, and with the hope of exploring these laws by the same instruments of
                    observation and verification as had done such triumphant work in the case of the
                    latter. Comte separates the collective facts of society and history from the
                    individual phenomena of biology; then he withdraws these collective facts from
                    the region of external volition, and places them in the region of law. The facts
                    of history must be explained, not by providential interven tions, but by
                    referring them to conditions inherent in the successive stages of social
                    existence. This conception makes a science of society possible. What is the
                    method <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> It comprises, besides observation and experiment
                    (which is, in fact, only the observation of abnormal social states), a certain
                    peculiarity of verification. We begin by deducing every well-known historical
                    situation from the series of its antecedents. Thus we acquire a body of
                    empirical generalizations as to social phenomena, and then we connect the
                    generalizations with the positive theory of human nature. A sociological
                    demonstration lies in the establishment of an accordance between the conclusions
                    of historical analysis and the preparatory conceptions of biological <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0263-0236"/> theory. As Mr Mill puts it :—“If a sociological
                    theory, collected from historical evidence, contradicts the established general
                    laws of human nature; if (to use Μ. Comte’s instances) it implies, in the mass
                    of mankind, any very decided natural bent, either in a good or in a bad
                    direction; if it supposes that the reason, in average human beings, predominates
                    over the desires, or the disinterested desires over the personal,—we may know
                    that history has been misinterpreted, and that the theory is false. On the other
                    hand, if laws of social phenomena, empirically generalized from history, can,
                    when once suggested, be affiliated to the known laws of human nature; if the
                    direction actually taken by the developments and changes of human society, can
                    be seen to be such as the properties of man and of his dwelling-place made
                    antecedently probable, the empirical generalizations are raised into positive
                    laws, and sociology becomes a science.” The result o. this method is an
                    exhibition of the events of human experience in co-ordinated series that
                    manifest their own graduated connection.</p>
                <p>Next, as all investigation proceeds from that which is known best to that which
                    is unknown or less well known, and as, in social states, it is the collective
                    phenomenon that is more easy of access to the observer than its parts, therefore
                    we must consider and pursue all the elements of a given social state together
                    and in common. The social organization must be viewed and explored as a whole.
                    There is a nexus between each leading group of social phenomena and other
                    leading groups; if there is a change i.ι one of them, that change is accompanied
                    by a corresponding modification of all the rest. “Not only must political
                    institutions and social manners, on the one hand, and manners and ideas, on the
                    other, be always mutually connected; but further, this consolidated whole must
                    be always connected by its nature with the corresponding state of the integral
                    development of humanity, considered in all its aspects of intellectual, moral,
                    and physical activity <hi rend="italic">”—(Comte.)</hi></p>
                <p>Is there any one clement which communicates the decisive impulse to all the
                    rest,—any predominating agency in the course of social evolution? The answer is
                    that all the other parts of social existence are associated with, and drawn
                    along by, the contemporary condition of intellectual development. The Reason is
                    the superior and preponderant element which settles the direction in which all
                    the other faculties shall expand. “It is only through the more and more marked
                    influence of the reason over the general conduct of man and of society, that the
                    gradual march of our race has attained that regularity and persevering
                    continuity which distinguish it so radically from the desultory and barren
                    expansion of even the highest animal orders, which share, and with enhanced
                    strength, the appetites, the passions, and even the primary sentiments of man.”
                    The history of intellectual development, therefore, is the key to social
                    evolution, and the key to the history of intellectual development is the Law of
                    the Three States.</p>
                <p>Among other central thoughts in Comte’s explanation of history are these :—The
                    displacement of theological by positive conceptions has been accompanied by a
                    gradual rise of an industrial régime out of the military régime;— the great
                    permanent contribution of Catholicism was the separation which it set up between
                    the temporal and the spiritual powers;-—the progress of the race consists in the
                    increasing preponderance of the distinctively human elements over the animal
                    elements;—the absolute tendency of ordinary social theories will be replaced by
                    an unfailing adherence to the relative point of view, and from this it follows
                    that the social state, regarded as a whole, has been as perfect in each period
                    as the co-existing condition of humanity and its environment would allow.</p>
                <p>The elaboration of these ideas in relation to the history of the civilization of
                    the most advanced portion of the human race occupies two of the volumes of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Positive Philosophy,</hi> and has been accepted by competent
                    persons of very different schools as a master-piece of rich, luminous, and
                    far-reaching suggestion. Whatever additions it may receive, and whatever
                    corrections it may require, this analysis of social evolution will continue to
                    be regarded as one of the great achievements of human intellect. The demand for
                    the first of Comte’s two works has gone on increasing in a significant degree.
                    It was completed, as we have said, in 1842. A second edition was published in
                    1864; a third some years afterwards; and while we write (1876) a fourth is in
                    the press. Three editions within twelve years of a work of abstract philosophy
                    in six considerable volumes are the measure of a very striking influence. On the
                    whole, we may suspect that no part of Comte’s works has had so much to do with
                    this marked success as his survey and review of the course of history.</p>
                <p>The third volume of the later work, the <hi rend="italic">Positive Polity,</hi>
                    treats of social dynamics, and takes us again over the ground of historic
                    evolution. It abounds with remarks of extraordinary fertility and
                    comprehensiveness; but it is often arbitrary; its views of the past are strained
                    into coherence with the statical views of the preceding volume; and so far as
                    concerns the period to which the present writer happens to have given special
                    attention, it is usually slight and sometimes random. As it was composed in
                    rather less than six months, and as the author honestly warns us that he has
                    given all his attention to a mere profound coordination, instead of working out
                    the special explanations more fully, as he had promised, we need not be
                    surprised if the result is disappointing to those who had mastered the
                    corresponding portion of the <hi rend="italic">Positive Philosophy.</hi> Comte
                    explains the difference between his two works. In the first his “chief object
                    was to discover and demonstrate the laws of progress, and to exhibit in one
                    unbroken sequence the collective destinies of mankind, till then invariably
                    regarded as a series of events wholly beyond the reach of explanation, and
                    almost depending on arbitrary will. The present work, on the contrary, is
                    addressed to those who are already sufficiently convinced of the certain
                    existence of social laws, and desire only to have them reduced to a true and
                    conclusive system.”</p>
                <p>What that system is it would take far more space than we can afford to sketch
                    even in outline. All we can do is to enumerate some of its main positions. They
                    are to be drawn not only from the <hi rend="italic">Positive Polity,</hi> but
                    from two other works,—the <hi rend="italic">Positivist Catechism: a Summary
                    Exposition of the Universal Religion, in Twelve Dialogues between a Woman and a
                    Priest of Humanity;</hi> and, second, <hi rend="italic">The Subjective
                    Synthesis</hi> (1856), which is the first and only volume of a work upon
                    mathematics announced at the end of the <hi rend="italic">Positive
                    Philosophy.</hi> The system for which the <hi rend="italic">Positive
                    Philosophy</hi> is alleged to have been the scientific preparation contains a
                    Polity and a Religion; a complete arrangement of life in all its aspects, giving
                    a wider sphere to Intellect, Energy, and Feeding than could be found in any of
                    the previous organic types,—Greek, Roman, or Catholic-feudal. Comte’s immense
                    superiority over such prae-Revolutionary Utopians as the Abbé Saint Γierre, no
                    less than over the group of post-revolutionary Utopians, is especially visible
                    in his firm grasp of the cardinal truth that the improvement of the social
                    organism can only be effected by a moral development, and never by any changes
                    in mere political mechanism, or any violences in the way of an artificial
                    redistribution of wealth. A moral transformation must precede any real advance.
                    The aim, both in public and private life, is to secure to the utmost possible
                    extent the victory of the social feeling over self-love, or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n264/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0264-0237"/> Altruism over Egoism. This is the key to the
                    regeneration of social existence, as it is the key to that unity of individual
                    life which makes all our energies converge freely and without wasteful friction
                    towards a common end. What are the instruments for securing the preponderance of
                    Altruism? Clearly they must work from the strongest element in human nature, and
                    this element is Feeling or the Heart. Under the Catholic system the supremacy of
                    Feeling was abused, and the Intellect was made its slave. Then followed a revolt
                    of Intellect against Sentiment. The business of the new system will be to bring
                    back the Intellect into a condition not of slavery, but of willing ministry to
                    the Feelings. The subordination never was, and never will be, effected except by
                    means of a religion, and a religion, to be final, must include a harmonious
                    synthesis of all our conceptions of the external order of the universe. The
                    characteristic basis of a religion is the existence of a Power without us, so
                    superior to ourselves as to command the complete submission of our whole life.
                    This basis is to be found in the Positive stage, in Humanity, past, present, and
                    to come, conceived as the Great Being.</p>
                <p>“A deeper study of the great universal order reveals to us at length the ruling
                    power within it of the true Great Being, whose destiny it is to bring that order
                    continually to perfection by constantly conforming to its laws, and which thus
                    best represents to us that system as a whole. This undeniable Providence, the
                    supreme dispenser of our destinies, becomes in the natural course the common
                    centre of our affections, our thoughts, and our actions. Although this Great
                    Being evidently exceeds the utmost strength of any, even of any collective,
                    human force, its necessary constitution and its peculiar function endow it with
                    the truest sympathy towards all its servants. The least amongst us can and ought
                    constantly to aspire to maintain and even to improve this Being. This natural
                    object of all our activity, both public and private, determines the true general
                    character of the rest of our existence, whether in feeling or in thought; which
                    must be devoted to love, and to know, in order rightly to serve, our Providence,
                    by a wise use of all the means which it furnishes to us. Reciprocally this
                    continued service, whilst strengthening our true unity, renders us at once both
                    happier and better. ’’</p>
                <p>The exaltation of Humanity into the throne occupied by the Supreme Being under
                    monotheistic systems made all the rest of Comte’s construction easy enough.
                    Utility remains the test of every institution, impulse, act; his fabric becomes
                    substantially an arch of utilitarian propositions, with an artificial Great
                    Being inserted at the top to keep them in their place. The Comtist system is
                    utilitarianism crowned by a fantastic decoration. Translated into the plainest
                    English, the position is as follows: “Society can only be regenerated by the
                    greater subordination of politics to morals, by the moral ization of capital, by
                    the renovation of the family, by a higher conception of marriage, and so on.
                    These ends can only be reached by a heartier development of the sympathetic
                    instincts. The sympathetic instincts can only be developed by the Religion of
                    Humanity.” Looking at the problem in this way, even a moralist who does not
                    expect theology to be the instrument of social revival, might still ask whether
                    the sympathetic instincts will not necessarily be already developed to theií
                    highest point, before people will be persuaded to accept the religion, which is
                    at bottom hardly more than sympathy under a more imposing name. However that may
                    be, the whole battle—into which we shall not enter—as to the bgitimateness of
                    Comtism as a religion turns upon this erection of Humanity into a Being. The
                    various hypotheses, dogmas, proposals, as to the family, to capital, &lt;fcc.,
                    are merely propositions measurable by considerations of utility and a balance of
                    expediencies. Many of these proposals are of the highest interest, and many of
                    them are actually available; but there does not seem to be one of them of an
                    available kind, which could not equally well be approached from other sides, and
                    even incorporated in some radically antagonistic system. Adoption, for example,
                    as a practice for improving the happiness of families and the welfare of
                    society, is capable of being weighed, and can in truth only be weighed, by
                    utilitarian considerations, and has been commended by men to whom the Comtist
                    religion is naught. The singularity of Comte’s construction, and the test by
                    which it must be tried, is the transfer of the worship and discipline of
                    Catholicism to a system in which “the conception of God is superseded” by the
                    abstract idea of Humanity, conceived as a kind of Personality.</p>
                <p>And when all is said, the invention does not help us. We have still to settle
                    what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> for the good of Humanity, and we can only do that
                    in the old-fashioned way. There is no guidance in the conception. No effective
                    unity can follow from it, because you can only find out the right and wrong of a
                    given course by summing up the advantages and disadvantages, and striking a
                    balance, and there is nothing in the Religion of Humanity to force two men to
                    find the balance on the same side. The Comtists are no better off than other
                    utilitarians in judging policy, events, conduct.</p>
                <p>The particularities of the worship, its minute and truly ingenious re-adaptations
                    of sacraments, prayers, reverent signs, down even to the invocation of a new
                    Trinity, need not detain us. They are said, though it is not easy to believe, to
                    haye been elaborated by way of Utopia. If so, no Utopia has ever yet been
                    presented in a style so little calculated to stir the imagination, to warm the
                    feelings, to soothe the insurgency of the reason. It is a mistake to present a
                    great body of hypotheses—if Comte meant them for hypotheses—in the most dogmatic
                    and peremptory form to which language can lend itself. And there is no more
                    extraordinary thing in the history of opinion than the perversity with which
                    Comte has succeeded in clothing a philosophic doctrine, so intrinsically
                    conciliatory as his, in a shape that excites so little sympathy and gives so
                    much provocation. An enemy defined Comtism as Catholicism <hi rend="italic"
                    >minus</hi> Christianity, to which an able champion retorted by calling it
                    Catholicism <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> Science. Hitherto Comte’s Utopia has
                    pleased the followers of the Catholic, just as little as those of the
                    scientific, spirit.</p>
                <p>The elaborate and minute systematization of life, proper to the religion of
                    Humanity, is to be directed by a priesthood. The priests are to possess neither
                    wealth nor material power; they are not to command, but to counsel; their
                    authority is to rest on persuasion, not on force. When religion has become
                    positive, and society industrial, then the influence of the church upon the
                    state becomes really free and independent, which was not the case in the Middle
                    Age. The power of the priesthood rests upon special knowledge of man and nature;
                    but to this intellectual eminence must also be added moral power and a certain
                    greatness of character, withou&lt;t which force of intellect and completeness of
                    attainment will not receive the confidence they ought to inspire. The functions
                    of the priesthood are of this kind :—To exercise a systematic direction over
                    education; to hold a consultative influence over all the important acts of
                    actual life, public and private; to arbitrate in cases of practical conflict; to
                    preach sermons recalling those principles of generality and universal harmony
                    which our special activities dispose us to ignore; to order the due
                    classification of society; to perform the various ceremonies appointed by the
                    founder of the religion. The authority of the priesthood is to rest wholly on
                    voluntary adhesion, and there is to be perfect freedom of speech and discussion;
                    though, by the way, we cannot forget Comte’s detestable congratulations to the
                    Czar Nicholas on the “wise vigilance” with which he kept watch over the
                    importation of Western books.</p>

                <p>From his earliest manhood Comte had been powerfully impressed by the necessityof
                    elevating the condition of women. (See remarkable passage in his letters to Μ.
                    Valat, pp. 84-7.) His friendship with Madame de Vaux had deepened the
                    impression, and in the reconstructed society women are to play a highly
                    important part. They are to be carefully excluded from public action, but they
                    are to do many more important things than things political. To fit them for
                    their functions, they are to be raised above material cares, and they are to be
                    thoroughly educated. The family, which is so important an element of the Comtist
                    scheme of things, exists to carry the influence of woman over man to the highest
                    point of cultivation. Through affection she purifies the activity of man.
                    “Superior in power of affection, more able to keep both the intellectual and the
                    active powers in continual subordination to feeling, women are formed as the
                    natural intermediaries between Humanity and man. The Great Being confides
                    specially to them its moral Providence, maintaining through them the direct and
                    constant cultivation of universal affection, in the midst of all the
                    distractions of thought or action, which are for ever withdrawing men from its
                    influence Beside the uniform influence of every woman on every man, to attach
                    him to Humanity, such is the importance and the diflìculty of this ministry that
                    each of us should be placed under the special guidance of one of these angels,
                    to answer for him, as it were, to the Great Being. This moral guardianship may
                    assume three types,— the mother, the wife, and the daughter; each having several
                    modifications, as shown in the concluding volume. Together they form the three
                    simple modes of solidarity, or unity with contemporaries,—obedience, union, and
                    protection,—as well as the three degrees of continuity between ages, by uniting
                    us with the past, the present, and the future. In accordance with my theory of
                    the brain, each corresponds with one of our three altruistic
                    instincts,—veneration, attachment, and benevolence.”</p>
                <p>How the positive method of observation and verification of real facts has landed
                    us in this, and much else of the same kind, is extremely hard to guess.
                    Seriously to examine an encyclopaedic system, that touches life, society, and
                    knowledge at every point, is evidently beyond the compass of such an article as
                    this. There is in every chapter a whole group of speculative suggestions, each
                    of which would need a long chapter to itself to elaborate or to discuss. There
                    is at least one biological speculation of astounding audacity, that could be
                    examined in nothing less than a treatise. Perhaps we have said enough to show
                    that after performing a great and real service to thought, Comte almost
                    sacrificed his claims to gratitude by the invention of a system that, as such,
                    and independently of detached suggestions, is markedly retrograde. But the world
                    has strong self-protecting qualities. It will take what is available in Comte,
                    while forgetting that in his work which is as irrational in one way as Hegel is
                    in anotheι.</p>
                <p>The English reader is specially well placed for satisfying such curiosity as he
                    may have about Comte’s philosophy. Miss Martineau condensed the six volumes of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophie</hi><hi rend="italic">Positive</hi> into two
                    volumes of excellent English (1853); Comte himself gave them a place in the
                    Positivist Library. The <hi rend="italic">Catechism</hi> was translated by Dr
                    Congreve in 1858. The <hi rend="italic">Politique Positive</hi> has been
                    reproduced in English (Longmans, 1875-7) by the conscientious labour of Comte’s
                    London followers. This translation is accompanied by a careful running analysis
                    and explanatory summary of contents, which make the work more readily
                    intelligible than the original. For criticisms, the reader may be referred to Mr
                    Mill’s <hi rend="italic">Auguste Comte and Positivism;</hi> Dr Bridges’s reply
