                <p><label type="entry">CRUSADES</label></p>
                <p>THE Crusades were a series of wars undertaken professedly for the purpose of
                    delivering the Holy Land from the dominion of the infidel, and so named from the
                    cross worn as a badge by those who devoted themselves to the enterprize. These
                    wars, it was held, were rendered necessary, not only by the profanation involved
                    in the fact of Mahometan rule over the country which had been the birthplace and
                    cradle of Christianity, but by the insults and injuries constantly inflicted on
                    Christian pilgrims. From age to age the belief had been growing that no work
                    could conduce more to the soul's health than a visit to the holy places of
                    Palestine, In proportion to the rapidity with which this belief had spread over
                    the Christian world, a feeling of vehement indignation was awakened by the
                    likelihood, if not the certainty, that the Saracen conqueror would put his ban
                    on the performance of that which was deemed to be an act of the highest
                    Christian duty.</p>
                <p>It is scarcely necessary to say that this was not a notion which can be traced
                    back to the earliest ages of the Christian church, and that the creed of the
                    first believers was in this respect in complete antagonism with the idea which
                    brought the Jews year by year to Jerusalem for the celebration of the Passover.
                    The local ritual which belonged to the only temple known to the Jews had for
                    them been displaced by a purely spiritual worship, which proclaimed that men
                    were as near to God in one place as in another. In whatever channel their
                    feelings might otherwise have run, the circumstances of the Christian church in
                    the first century left absolutely no room for the development of local
                    association. Yet a few years, and the history of this weary world would be
                    closed by the return of the Son of man to judgment, and by the summons which
                    should call the dead from their graves. But the course of events which led to
                    the establishment of Christianity as the religion of the Roman empire insured
                    the growth of a sentiment far more nearly allied to that of the Jewish pilgrims,
                    when gathered for the great annual feast in the city of David. The Christian
                    converts in Rome and Corinth, in Athens and Alexandria, had been worshippers of
                    the Capitoline Jupiter, or the Olympian Zeus, of Isis and Osiris, of Phaebus,
                    Artemis, or Mithras. That these converts had undergone a vast change for the
                    better we need not and we cannot doubt; but the framework of their old
                    associations had not been broken, and the men who had followed the jotirneyings
                    of Phaebus from his birthplace in Delos to his final home in Delphi, might now
                    with feelings immeasurably deeper and more earnest move from spot to spot noted,
                    in the gospel narratives, until the pilgrimage begun in the grotto of Bethlehem
                    ended on the mount of the ascension. The whole of Palestine thus became sacred
                    soil, but for a time the rapid growth of this local veneration called forth
                    something like remonstrance or warning. Teachers like Augustine could remind
                    their hearers that they were not to seek righteousness in the East, nor mercy in
                    the West, and that a voyage to the Holy Land was a useless task for men whose
                    faith placed them at once in the immediate presence of their Lord. But the
                    practice of some among them was not altogether consistent with their precepts.
                    Jerome could insist that heaven was not more easily approached from Palestihe
                    than from Britain; but the saint had crossed the sea to take up his abode in a
                    cave at Bethlehem, and had no rebuke to offer to the Roman ladies who followed
                    him, partly to feast upon his eloquence, and in part to derive strength and
                    comfort from contemplating the scenes of the Saviour’s ministry. Such feelings
                    seldom fail to provide their own „nourishment. The vehement devotion stirred by
                    the sight of Calvary would impart a priceless value to that instrument of
                    punishment which by bearing the body of Jesus had become veritably a tree of
                    life; and in due time the yearning for this relic was rewarded by its discovery.
                    Its genuineness had been attested by the healing of a dying woman who derived no
                    benefit from touching the crosses to which the two thieves had been fastened;
                    and the great churches built by the first Christian emperor and his mother over
                    the Holy Sepulchre and the Cave of the Nativity became sanctuaries which the
                    Christians regarded with a devotion immeasurably more passionate than that which
                    the Jews felt for the temple at Jerusalem. The stream of pilgrims, which
                    probably had long been gathering volume, now swelled into something like the
                    proportions of a flood; and each man found not merely that he could worship on
                    spots which brought him nearer to heaven, but that the devotion of the faithful
                    had done or was doing much to smooth the difficulties or lessen the dangers of
                    his journey. It was not wonderful that the enthusiasm thus fostered should give
                    birth to convictions which no calamities could destroy or even shake. According
                    to this new belief the shirt which the pilgrim wore when he entered Jerusalem
                    would, if used as his winding-sheet, carry him straight to heaven. His death, if
                    it happened during his sojourn in Palestine, made him an object of envy to his
                    kinsfolk and friends. If he returned home, he was treated as one whose sins had
                    been washed away, and perhaps as the bearer of relics whose virtues were so
                    potent as to make the weary journey to Jerusalem a work of supererogation.</p>
                <p>The tide of pilgrimage thus flowing steadily onwards was first arrested by the
                    armies of the Persian king, Khosru III., the grandson of Nushirvan. Jerusalem
                    was taken, 611 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.;</hi> 90,000 Christians, it is said,
                    were slaughtered; and the disaster was crowned by the carrying away of the true
                    cross into Persia. Marching on into Egypt, Khosru received a letter from a
                    citizen of Mecca, charging him to acknowledge Mahomet as the prophet of the one
                    God. He tore the letter into shreds. Mahomet replied only by warning him that
                    his treatment of the letter was a sign of the way in which his kingdom would be
                    treated by-and-by. The punishment of Khosru was to come, however, not from
                    Mahomet, but from the Emperor Heraclius, who, waking from the sluggish
                    inactivity of the earlier part of his reign, defeated the Persians in the passes
                    of Mount Taurus, and destroyed the birthplace of Zoroaster. In tho end Khosru
                    was murdered by his son Siroes, from whom Heraclius recovered the true cross by
                    a treaty which also delivered those of his subjects who had been taken prisoners
                    by the Persians. In the following year, 629, Heraclius himself knelt among the
                    worshippers in the church of the Holy Sepulchre. Eight years later, 637, the
                    disciples of Mahomet, now lords of Damascus, laid siege to Jerusalem; but after
                    a blockade of four months a treaty made with the caliph Omar in person secured
                    to the Christians not merely the safety of their persons and goods, but the free
                    exercise of their religion, subject only to the conditions that Mahometans
                    should have the right of admission to their churches at all hours; that the
                    cross should not be seen on the exterior of any building, or be carried about
                    the streets; and finally, that the Christians should be disarmed, and should
                    show respect to their conquerors by wearing a distinguishing dress and by rising
                    up at the approach of true believers. The hardships thus imposed may have been
                    sensibly felt; but pilgrims and merchants <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n656/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0656-0623"/> still came and went practically without let or
                    hindrance; and even the attack of the Fatimite caliph Hakem, four centuries
                    later, 1010, scarcely changed things for the worse. The rule of his predecessors
                    in Egypt had for the Christians been lighter than that of the Abbasside caliphs
                    of Baghdad; but the object on which the mad Hakem had set his heart was nothing
                    less than the destruction of the great Christian sanctuary. Such persecution as
                    there was fell on the Jews only, and the tax imposed on each pilgrim and levied
                    on his entering Jerusalem was pïobably not resented as a wrong. To the wealthier
                    Christians it brought an opportunity for securing a higher degree of merit by
                    paying the charge for their poorer brethren; while the completion of the first
                    Christian millennium removed a burden which had lain with increasing heaviness
                    on the spirits and energies of men, and gave a fresh impetus to the feeling
                    which carried the devout to the Holy Land. The end of the 10th century, it was
                    almost universally believed, would be the end of the world. The beginning of a
                    new age relieved them of this mental incubus, and the stream of pilgrims became
                    larger than ever. The path followed by these devotees was not always strewn with
                    roses. Inclement seasons, poverty, and sickness proved fatal to many; but these
                    disasters were not caused by the attack of open enemies, and the conversion of
                    Hungary removed a formidable obstacle for those who had to traverse the heart of
                    Europe in order to reach Palestine.</p>
                <p>A few years later these fairer prospects were permanently clouded by the advance
                    of the Seljukian Turks, who in their inroads into the Eastern empire found
                    themselves effectually aided by the subjects of the emperor. Thecauses of
                    discontent were indeed many and deep. Extortion and tyranny, both secular and
                    ecclesiastical, had alienated thousands, while the population was seriously
                    lessened by the accumulation of land in the hands of a few owners. Before the
                    close of the Γlth century, 1076, Jerusalem had opened her gates to the Seljukian
                    Toucush; and in place of a legal toll the pilgrims found themselves subjected
                    henceforth to indefinite extortion, to wanton insult, and to massacre. The
                    sanctuaries of the Christians were profaned, their worship was interrupted,
                    their patriarchs were thrown into dungeons. The effect of these changes was felt
                    not by the devout only. The supplying of their wants had called forth the
                    energies of merchants; and the fleets of Genoa, Pisa, and Amalfi hurried to the
                    ports of the Holy Land for the great Easter fair at Jerusalem. All these were
                    now driven away, and there remained only the miserable train of pilgrims, who
                    returned to Europe, if they returned at all, with tales of dire indignities done
                    to men, women, and children alike.</p>
                <p>The recital of these wrongs went far towards fanning into flame the feelings
                    which the popes had hitherto failed to waken in sufficient strength. The idea of
                    an armed host which should inflict summary vengeance on the oppressors of the
                    Christians had already dawned on the mind of the great Hildebrand, Gregory VII.;
                    it had been vehemently urged by his successor Victor III.; but neither had
                    struck the right chord. Such enterprizes can never be set in motion, with any
                    solid results, except when the flood tide of popular feeling gives its own
                    weight to the sanction of religious authority. Nor was this result more
                    satisfactory when, in 1081, Robert Guiscard set out from Brundusium (Brindisi)
                    with a fleet of 150 ships and a force of 30,000 men. Guiscard himself besieged
                    Dyrrhachium (Durazzo) in vain; under his son Bohemond his fleet was miserably
                    defeated. Four years later Guiscard made another attempt, which was frustrated
                    by his death at Cefalonia (Kephallenia). But Hildebrand had been dead only ten
                    years when a vast throng of clerks and laymen was gathered to meet Urban II. at
                    Piacenza (Placentia). In Italy, however, Urban felt that he could not look for
                    the enthusiasm which would justify him in making the final venture. From
                    Piacenza he made his way to his old home in the great abbey of Cluny, and in the
                    autumn of 1095 appeared at Clermont, in the territories of the count of
                    Auvergne.</p>
                <p>Here he found that there was no longer any need of holding back. To the north of
                    the Alps the indignation of the people had been roused to fever heat by the
                    preaching of Peter the Hermit. With the stature and ungainliness of a dwarf,
                    emaciated by the austerities of his self-imposed discipline, this man, who had
                    forsaken his wife and abandoned his military standard under the counts of
                    Boulogne, had returned from the Holy Land with his heart on fire, not so much
                    from the memory of the hardships which he had himself undergone as for the
                    cruelties and tortures which he had seen inflicted on his fellow-Christians.
                    Simeon, the patriarch of Jerusalem, to whom he first betook himself, could only
                    bewail the weakness of the emperor and of his government. “The nations of the
                    West shall take up arms in your cause,” was the reply of the hermit, who soon
                    afterwards, armed with the special blessing of Urban II., mounted his ass, and
                    with bare head and feet, carrying a huge crucifix, traversed the Teutonic lands,
                    rousing everywhere the uncontrollable indignation which devoured his own soul.
                    His vehemence carried all before him, none the less, perhaps, because he bade
                    them remember that no sins were too heinous to be washed away by the waters of
                    the Jordan, no evil habits too deadly to be condoned for the one good work which
                    should make them champions of the cross. Urban, however, and his counsellors,
                    knew well that before the fatal die could be prudently cast a serious task lay
                    before them. The system of feudalism substituted personal ascendency for the
                    dominion of law; and wherever the personal bond failed, the resort was
                    inevitably to private war. The practice of such wars had become virtually an
                    organized trade; and if a large proportion of the population should be drawn
                    away to fight against the infidel in Palestine, those who remained at home would
                    be without defence. Such wars were therefore formally condemned; the women and
                    the clergy, merchants and husbandmen, were placed under the special protection
                    of the church, and the Truce of God was solemnly confirmed. The nearer and more
                    immediate dangers being thus guarded against, Urban from a lofty scaffold
                    addressed the assembled multitude, dwelling in the first place, and perhaps not
                    altogether prudently, on the cowardice of the Turks, and on the title to victory
                    which birth in a temperate climate conferred on the Christians. They were thus
                    sure of success, and sure, too, to win an infinitely higher blessing—the
                    remission of their sins. Sufferings and torments more excruciating than any
                    which they could picture to themselves might indeed aw ait them; but the agonies
                    of their bodies would redeem their souls. “Go then,” he said, “on your errand of
                    love which will put out of sight all the ties that bind you to the spots which
                    you have called your homes. Your homes, in truth, they are not. For the
                    Christian all the world is exile, and all the world is at the same time his
                    country. If you leave a rich patrimony here, a better patrimony awaits you in
                    the Holy Land. They who die will enter the mansions of heaven, while the living
                    shall pay their vows before the sepulchre of their Lord. Blessed are they who,
                    taking this vow upon them, shall obtain such a recompense; happy they who are
                    led to such a conflict, that they may share in such rewards.” With the
                    passionate outburst, “It is the will of God, it is the will of God,” the vast
                    throng broke in upon the Pontiff’s words. “It is, indeed, His will,” the Pope
                    went on, “and let these words be your war-cry when you find yourselves in
                    presence of the enemy.</p>

                <p>Vou are soldiers of the cross; wear then on your breasts or on your shoulders the
                    blood-red sign of Him who died for the salvation of your souls.”</p>
                <p>So was sanctioned the mighty enterprize which hurled the forces of Latin
                    Christendom on the infidels who had crushed the East under the yoke of Islam;
                    and so it received its name. Of the thousands who hastened to put on the badge
                    the greater number were animated probably by the most disinterested motives,
                    while some had their eyes fixed on the results of more politic calculations. For
                    the multitude at large there was the paramount attraction of an enterprize which
                    the abbot Guibert boldly put before them as a new mode of salvation, which
                    enabled the layman without laying aside his habits of wild licence to reach a
                    height of perfection scarcely to be attained by the most austere monk or the
                    most devoted priest. Nay more, the assumption of the cross set the debtor free
                    from his creditor so long as he wore the sacred badge, opened the prison door
                    for the malefactor, annulled the jurisdiction of the lord over the burgher or
                    the peasant, and enabled the priest and the monk to escape from the monotony of
                    the parish and the cloister. It might be thought that these privileges would
                    tell hardly on the creditor, the capitalist, and the usurer; but these reaped
                    the most solid benefits. The princes who bound themselves by the vow must
                    provide equipments for themselves and their followers, and carry with them sums
                    of money sufficient for their needs. These sums must be raised by loan or
                    mortgage; and as all wished to get horses, arms, and money in exchange for
                    lands, the former became inordinately dear, the latter absurdly cheap. Thus the
                    real gain lay on the side of the merchant and the trader, or of the landowner
                    who was prudent enough to add to his own domains by availing himself of the
                    necessities of his neighbour. All this, however, had been effected by the a it
                    hority and sanction of the Holy See, which had taken under its protection the
                    dominions of all crusading princes. It was for the Pope to decide whether those
                    who had taken the vow should set off at once, whether some grace time should be
                    allowed, or whether the vow should be remitted altogether. The Pope became
                    therefore possessed of a dispensing power which placed him virtually above all
                    other sovereigns. His gains, moreover, were immediate. The crusades tended,
                    beyond doubt, to merge the smaller into larger fiefs, which again were absorbed
                    into the royal domain, thus largely promoting that growth of the sovereign power
                    which in the end broke up the feudal system. Those results belonged to the
                    distant future; but the Pope was enabled, rather he was constrained, to send his
                    legates into every land, both to enlist soldiers under the standard of the
                    cross, and to collect money for their support. He became thus at once the
                    administrator of vast revenues which were raised partly by subsidies imposed as
                    a necessary obligation on the clergy, and in part by the voluntary contributions
                    of the laity. With the Pope the ecclesiastical body generally acquired enormous
                    power. The lands of the church, though money might be borrowed upon them, could
                    not be alienated; but it was only in comparatively a few instances that it was
                    necessary to burden them at all. The monastic houses might send some of their
                    members to the Holy Land; the rest remained at home, and became mortgagees or
                    trustees of estates belonging to the crusaders. If these died without heirs, the
                    guardians became absolute owners; and of those who returned not a few withdrew
                    into the cloister, and endowed with their worldly goods the community which they
                    joined.</p>
                <p>In the enterprize sanctioned by the Council of Clermont, no nation, as such, took
                    any part; and this fact serves perhaps to explain the measure of its success and
                    its failure. Had it been necessary to wait for strictly national action, the
                    work perhaps would never have been done at all; but had it been a national
                    undertaking some attempt must have been made to establish a commissariat, and to
                    insure something like harmonious and efficient generalship. As it was, the
                    crusading army was simply a gathering of individual adventurers who depended on
                    their own resources, or of reckless pilgrims who neither possessed nor cared to
                    provide any. The contributions made to this army by the different countries of
                    Europe varied largely. From Italy, where the charm was in great part dispelled
                    by the struggle between Pope and anti-Pope, few came besides the Normans who had
                    fought under the standards of Robert Guiscard. The Spaniards were fully occupied
                    with a crusade nearer home, which was to turn the tide of Mahometan conquest
                    that had once passed the barriers of the Pyrenees and threatened to flow onwards
                    to the shores of the Baltic. In Germany there was no great eagerness among
                    partisans of emperors whom popes had sought to humble, to undertake a difficult
                    and dangerous pilgrimage. In England the condition of things which followed the
                    victory of William over Harold prevented both the conquerors and their subjects
                    from committing themselves to distant enterprizes, while the Red King was more
                    anxious to have the duchy of his brother Robert in pledge than ready to run the
                    risk of losing his own kingdom. Thus the task of reconquering Palestine fell to
                    princes of the second order. Foremost among these was Godfrey of Bouillon in the
                    Ardennes, duke of Lothringen (Lorraine), whose high personal character brought
                    to his standard, we are told, not less than 10,000 horsemen and 80,000 infantry,
                    and who was accompanied by his brothers Baldwin and Eustace count of Boulogne.
                    Next to him, perhaps, may be placed (1) Hugh, count of Vermandois, surnamed the
                    Great, according to some, as being the brother of Philip I., the French king, or
                    as others would have it, simply from his stature; (2) Robert, duke of Normandy,
                    who had pawned his duchy to his brother the English king, and who was destined
                    to end his days in the dungeons of Cardiff castle; (3) Robert, count of
                    Flanders, celebrated by his followers as the Sword and Lance of the Christians;
                    (4) Stephen, count of Chartres, Troyes, and Blois; (5) Adhemar (Aymer), bishop
                    of Puy, the first of the clergy who assumed the cross, and rewarded as such with
                    the office of Papal legate; (6) Raymond, count of Toulouse, lord of Auvergne and
                    Languedoc, the leader, it is said, of 160,000 horse and foot, and widely known
                    for his haughtiness and his avarice not less than for his courage and his
                    wisdom; (7) the politic and ambitious Bohemond, son of Robert Guiscard, who had
                    left to him, not his Apulian domains, but only the principality of Tarentum, to
                    which Bohemond was resolved to add a kingdom stretching from the Dalmatian coast
                    to the northern shores of the Aegean Sea; (8) Tancred, son of the Marquis Odo
                    the Good and of Emma, the sister of Robert Guiscard, the hero who beyond all his
                    colleagues appears as the embodiment of those peculiar sentiments which gave
                    rise to the crusades, and who approaches nearest to the idea of Chaucer’s “very
                    perfect gentle knight.”</p>
                <p>The Feast of the Assumption, August 15, 1096, had been fixed at the Council of
                    Clermont as the day on which the crusaders should set off for Constantinople;
                    but little more than half the interval had gone by, when the hermit Peter
                    undertook the task of leading to Palestine a motley crowd of men and women.
                    Peter was accompanied as far as Cologne by Walter the Pennyless, who thence led
                    his followers to Hungary, while another multitude marched under Emico, count of
                    Leiningen, and a fourth followed the guidance of the monk Gotschaík. Behind
                    those came, we are told, a throng of men, women, and children, amounting to
                    200,000, under standards on which were <pb break="no"

                    mysterious faith of Gnostics and Paulicians. These undisciplined multitudes
                    turned fiercely upon the Jews, who were massacred in the streets of Verdun,
                    Treves, and the great Rhenish cities, until the emperor interfered and took them
                    under his protection. Of the followers of Peter 7000 only, it is said, reached
                    Constantinople. These by the orders of the Emperor Alexius were at once conveyed
                    across the Bosphorus, and there, with the bands of Walter the Pennyless, fell
                    into a trap laid for them by the Seljukian Sultan David, surnamed Kilidj Arslan,
                    the Sword of the Lion. A heap of bones alone remained to tell the story of their
                    destruction, when the hosts under Godfrey came thither on their march to
                    Palestine. These had advanced unopposed as far as the Hungarian border, where
                    three weeks were lost in negotiations with the Hungarian king, who dreaded a
                    repetition of the violence which his people had suffered at the hands of the
                    rabble led by Peter and the moneyless Walter. With Stephen of Chartres, Robert
                    of Flanders, and Robert of Normandy, Hugh of Vermandois had set out to make his
                    way through Italy, and taken ship at Bari. Wrecked on the coast between Palos
                    and Durazzo, he was detained at the latter place until the pleasure of the
                    Emperor Alexius should be known. Alexius at once ordered that he should be
                    brought to Constantinople, and so charmed his prisoner by the gracious manner
                    which he could put on or off at will, that Hugh not only paid him homage and
                    declared himself his man, but promised so <hi rend="subscript"> b</hi> far as he
                    could to get his colleagues to follow his example.</p>
                <p>The tidings of Hugh’s detention roused the wrath of Godfrey, who, having in vain
                    demanded his release, marched from Philippopolis, and appeared before the walls
                    of Constantinople at Christmas 1096. Alexius saw before him a mighty host;
                    another not less formidable was on its way, he was told, under Bohemond and
                    Tancred; and Bohemond, as he knew, claimed by right of inheritance no small part
                    of his empire. These swarms he had brought upon his land by his appeals for the
                    aid of Western Christendom, and he was now anxious at one moment to rid himself
                    of their presence, at another to win the submission of the crusading chiefs, and
                    so obtain a hold on their future conquests. At length a compact was made by
                    which they gave him their fealty so long only as they remained within his
                    borders, and pledged themselves to restore those of their conquests which had
                    been recently wrested from the empire, while on his part he promised to supply
                    them with food and to protect all pilgrims passing through his dominions.
                    Bohemond, on reaching Constantinople, was indignant when he learnt that his
                    colleagues had become vassals of the emperor; but he soon found that he must at
                    least appear to follow their example, and he was repaid by a splendid bribe from
                    Alexius, who adopted Godfrey as his son. With Raymond of Toulouse Alexius had a
                    harder task. This chief, who scarcely regarded himself as the vassal even of the
                    French king, refused to do more than be the emperor’s friend on equal terms,
                    even though Bohemond threatened that, if the quarrel came to blows, he should be
                    on the side of Alexius. The latter, however, soon saw through the temper of
                    Raymond; and the harmony which followed this dispute was so thorough that Anna
                    Comnena could speak of him as shining among the barbarians as the sun among the
                    stars of heaven.</p>
                <p>It was not until the Feast of Pentecost, 1097, that the last of the bands of
                    Latin pilgrims was conveyed to the Asiatic shore. During the whole interval the
                    risk of conflict between the Latins and Greeks had been great. Between them
                    there was in truth a radical opposition. The crusading chiefs hated the idea of
                    a central authority, and clung to the right of private war as the dearest of
                    their privileges. Of public law they could scarcely be said to know anything.
                    The Greeks, on the other hand, were ready to put up with a large amount of
                    corruption in their rulers so long as these secured to them the protection of
                    person and property. Among the Latins, again, the clergy, having been brought by
                    Hildebrand and Damiani under the yoke of celibacy, had become a close order or
                    caste, which shrunk from the notion of allegiance to any temporal master. As a
                    rule the Greek priests were married; and as they owned the authority of the
                    emperor, they were despised by their Western brethren for their cowardice. In
                    short, there was nothing to bring the two peoples together, and everything to
                    exasperate the suspicion and hatred which had grown up between them.</p>
                <p>Whatever may have been the numbers of the crusaders (and the chaplain of Count
                    Baldwin could speak of them as six millions), they found themselves on the
                    eastern shore of the Bosphorus confronted by a formidable adversary in Kilidj
                    Arslan, who, retreating with his horsemen to the mountains, swooped down upon
                    the Christians, by whom his capital city of Nice (Nikaia) was vainly invested
                    for seven weeks. At length the city was surrendered, not to the crusaders but to
                    Alexius, and the former, advancing on their eastward march, were again
                    confronted by the Turks near the Phrygian Dorylaeum. The battle, desperately
                    contested, ended in the complete defeat of the latter; but the son of Kilidj
                    Arslan, hastening on before the. crusaders as they marched to Cogni, Erekli, and
                    the 1’isidian Antioch, gave out before the gates of each city that he was come
                    as a conqueror. On his way he had ravaged the land; in the towns the houses had
                    been plundered and the granaries emptied; and the crusaders had to journey
                    through a country which could supply nothing. The burning heat caused fatal
                    sickness; and as if these miseries were not enough, the acquisition of Tarsus
                    was followed by an attempt at private war between Tancred and Baldwin, owing to
                    a dispute for the precedence of their banners. The remissness of the enemy,
                    which might easily have cut them off in the passes of Mount Taurus, allowed them
                    to march safely through the defiles; and Baldwin, Godfrey’s brother, was enabled
                    to comply with a request for help made by the Greek or Armenian ruler of Edessa.
                    Welcomed into the city Baldwin made himself master, and the Latin principality
                    of Edessa thus established lasted for fifty-four or, as some have supposed,
                    forty-seven years.</p>
                <p>In the Syrian Antioch the crusaders hoped to win a splendid prize at the cost of
                    little effort or none. Its walls were mostly in ruins; but the Seljukian
                    governor, Baghasian, had resolved on determined resistance. The siege which
                    followed has no interest for the military historian. At no time was the blockade
                    complete, and it was brought to a successful issue only by treachery. Three
                    months had already passed when the crusaders found themselves in desperate
                    straits for want of food. They had wasted with frantic folly the cattle, the
                    corn, and the wine which had fallen into their hands; and when this first famine
                    was relieved by a foraging expedition under Tancred, the supplies so brought in
                    were wasted with equal recklessness. A second famine drove away not only
                    Taticius, the lieutenant of the Greek emperor, but William of Melun, whose
                    sledge-hammer blows dealt in battle had won him the surname of the Carpenter,
                    and even the hermit Peter. Taticius made his way to Cyprus; the other two were
                    caught and brought back to the camp by Tancred. It was at this time, when the
                    general prospect seemed so discouraging, that envoys from the Fatimite caliph of
                    Egypt offered to guarantee to all unarmed pilgrims an unmolested sojourn of one
                    πionth in Jerusalem, and to aid the crusaders on their march to the Holy City,
                    if they <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n659/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0659-0626"/> would acknowledge his supremacy within the bounds
                    of his Syrian empire. The reply of the crusaders was brief and definite. God had
                    destined Jerusalem for Christians; if any others held it, they were invaders who
                    must be cast out. This defiance was followed by a victory won over some
                    reinforcements which were hastening from Caesarea and other cities to the aid of
                    Baghasian. But the time went on; the siege was still protracted; and there were
                    rumours that a Persian army was approaching. To Bohemond it seemed that there
                    was no hope of success except from fraud, and that from fraud he might reap a
                    goodly harvest. In a renegade Christian named Phirouz he found a traitor ready
                    to do his work; and he was able now to announce in the council that he could
                    place the city in their hands, and that he would do so if they would allow him
                    to rule in Antioch as Baldwin ruled in Edessa. In spite of a protest from
                    Raymond of Toulouse the compact was accepted, 1098; and on the same night
                    Bohemond with a few followers climbed the wall, and having seized ten towers, of
                    which they killed all the guards, opened a gate, and admitted the Christian
                    hosts. In the confusion which followed their entrance some of the besieged shut
                    themselves up in the citadel. Of the rest 10,000, it is said, were massacred.
                    Baghasian escaped beyond the besieger’s lines; but he fell from his horse, and a
                    Syrian Christian, cutting off his head, carried it to the camp of the crusaders,
                    who now passed from famine to plenty, from extreme hunger to wild riot. They
                    were committing a blunder as well as a sin. The Persians were at hand; and the
                    Turks in the citadel found that the crusaders lay between themselves and the
                    hosts of Kerboga, prince of Mosul, and Kilidj Arslan. The Latin camp was again
                    wasted with famine. Stephen of Chartres, who had deserted it before the betrayal
                    of the city to Bohemond, had on his westward journey met the Emperor Alexius,
                    who was marching to the aid of the crusaders with a large body of pilgrims from
                    Europe. Stephen’s tidings were followed by an order for retreat, and the
                    pilgrims were compelled to turn back with their companions. Protesting in vain
                    against this shameful breach of his duty and his vow, Guy, a brother of
                    Bohemond, said in the vehemence of his rage that if God were all-powerful He
                    would not suffer such things to be done. '</p>
                <p>In Antioch the desperation of the crusaders made them listen eagerly to stories
                    of dreams and revelations from heaven. A Lombard priest had learnt in a vision
                    that the third year of the crusade should see the conquest of Jerusalem; and
                    those who had heard from the lips of the Saviour Himself a rebuke of the vices
                    which had caused all their disasters, had also been assured that in five days
                    the needful help would be granted to them. The impulse, once given, gained
                    strength. Peter Barthelemy, the chaplain of Raymond of Toulouse, related a
                    revelation made to him by St Andrew. The steel head of the spear which had
                    pierced the side of the Redeemer as He hung on the cross had been hidden,
                    according to this tale, in the church of St Peter; and the recovery of this
                    lance would be followed by immediate and decisive success. Two days were to be
                    spent in special devotion; on the third they were to search for the long-lost
                    weapon. The night had come, and their toil had thus far gone for nothing, when
                    the priest stepped down into the pit. After some strokes of his spade he came
                    upon the holy relic, which was carefully wrapped in a cloth of silk and gold.
                    The priest displayed the lance head; and in a few minutes the wonderful tidings
                    had been spread through the city. A few months later Arnold, the chaplain of
                    Bohemond, publicly denied the genuineness of the relic, and charged the chaplain
                    of Raymond with deliberate imposture. Barthelemy appealed to the ordeal of fire,
                    and passed it, to all appearance, successfully. The bystanders were loud in
                    their exultation; but Peter had been fatally injured, and in a few days he
                    died.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the holy lance, borne by the Papal legate Adhemar, had effectually
                    aided the crusaders in the decisive struggle with Kerboga, before whom Peter the
                    Hermit had appeared as an envoy charged to submit to him the alternative of
                    baptism or of retreat from a land which St Peter had bestowed upon the
                    Christians. The answer was a curt refusal, and a battle followed in which
                    Bohemond was severely pressed by Kilidj Arslan, and Kerboga was bearing down the
                    forces of Godfrey and Hugh of Vermandois, when some knights, clothed in white
                    armour and mounted on white horses, were seen riding along the slopes of the
                    neighbouring hills. “The saintó are come to our help,” cried the Papal legate,
                    and the imagination of the people at once beheld in these strangers the martyrs
                    St George, St Theodore, and St Maurice. The impulse imparted by this conviction
                    was irresistible. The complete defeat of Kerboga and Arslan was followed by the
                    surrender of the garrison in the citadel, and Bohemond remained lord of
                    Antioch.</p>
                <p>The crusaders as a body wished to set off at once on their march to Jerusalem;
                    but their leaders shrank from the danger of traversing waterless wastes at the
                    end of a Syrian summer. While some of the crusaders were busied with expeditions
                    against neighbouring cities, many more were pressed by more anxious cares,
                    arising from an outbreak of plague which proved fatal, among others, to the
                    Papal legate Adhemar.</p>
                <p>Ten months after the fall of Antioch the crusaders, having become masters of
                    Laodicea, were bidden by the Emperor Alexius to await his coming in June. But
                    with him their forbearance had reached its limit, and they bade him remember
                    that, having broken his compact, he had no longer any claim on their obedience.
                    Marching across the plain of Berytus and along the narrow strip of country once
                    celebrated for the wealth and splendour of the great Phoenician cities, the army
                    at length reached Jaffa, and thence turned inland to Ramlah, a town only sixteen
                    miles distant from Jerusalem. Two days later they came in view of the holy city.
                    At the sight of the distant walls and towers all fell on their knees, in an
                    outburst of thankfulness which could express itself only in sighs and tears,
                    while they stooped to kiss the sacred soil. The rest of the march they performed
                    with bare feet and in the garb of pilgrims; but their armour was again put on,
                    when Raymond of Toulouse with his followers invested the city from the western
                    side, while Godfrey and Tancred, with Robert of Normandy and Robert of Flanders,
                    blockaded it from the north. On the fifth day a desperate attempt was made to
                    storm the walls, with a single ladder and with no siege instruments. It was no
                    wonder that in spite of all their efforts the assailants should be beaten back
                    and hurled from the ramparts. Thirty days more passed away, while Gaston of
                    Bearn was busily occupied in directing the construction of siege engines of
                    timber brought from the woods of Shechem. During the whole of this time the
                    besiegers were in the greatest distress from lack of water. All the cisterns and
                    receptacles of any kind had been carefully destroyed by the enemy, whose
                    horsemen harassed or cut off the parties of Christians who were sent about the
                    country to search for it. Nor was the discipline of the camp by any means what
                    it should be; and the phantom of Adhemar of Puy appeared, it was said, to
                    denounce the licence which was provoking the divine judgments. But if there was
                    wild riot in some quarters, there was devotion and enthusiasm in others. Tancred
                    generously made up his quarrel with Bohemond, and like the Levites round the
                    walls of Jericho, the clergy moved round the city iu <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n660/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0660-0627"/> procession singing hymns and followed by the
                    laity. The Saracens, it is said, insulted them from the walls by throwing dirt
                    upon crucifixes. On the second day of the final assault, when it seemed that in
                    spite of almost superhuman efforts the crusaders must fail, a horseman was seen,
                    or supposed to be seen, waving his shield on Mount Olivet. “St George the Martyr
                    has again come to help us,” shouted Godfrey, and the cry, taken up and carried
                    along the ranks, banished every feeling of weariness, and sent them forth with
                    overwhelming strength for the supreme effort. It was Friday; and at the moment
                    in the afternoon when the last cry was uttered by the Saviour on His cross
                    Letold of Tournay, it is said, stood on the walls of Jerusalem, followed first
                    by his brother Engelbert, and then by Godfrey. The gate of St Stephen was
                    stormed by Tancred; the Provençale climbed up the ramparts by ladders; and the
                    city was in the hands of the Christians. So terrible, it is said, was the
                    carnage which followed that the horses of the crusaders who rode up to the
                    mosque of Omar were knee-deep in the stream, of blood. Infants were seized by
                    their feet and dashed against the walls or whirled over the battlements, while
                    the Jews were all burnt alive in their synagogue. In the midst of these horrors
                    Godfrey entered the church of the Sepulchre, clothed in a robe of pure white,
                    but bare-footed as well as bare-headed, and knelt at the tomb to offer his
                    thanksgiving for the divine goodness which had suffered them to realize the
                    yearning of their hearts. In the profound enthusiasm and devotion of the moment
                    his followers beheld the dead take part in the solemn ritual, and heard the
                    voice of Adhemar rejoicing in the prayers and resolutions of penitence offered
                    by the prostrate warriors of the cross. Among the living, too, there were those
                    who called forth the deepest gratitude; and the vast throng fell at the feet of
                    the hermit Peter, who thus saw the consummation of the enterprize which was
                    mainly his work, and of whom after the completion of his task we hear no more.
                    On the next day the horrors of that which had preceded it were deliberately
                    repeated on a larger scale. Tancred had given a guarantee of safety to 300
                    captives. In spite of his indignant protest these were all brought out and
                    killed; and a massacre followed in which the bodies of men, women, and children
                    were hacked and hewn until their fragments lay tossed together in heaps. The
                    work of slaughter ended, the streets of the city were washed by Saracen
                    prisoners.</p>
                <p>So ended the first and the most important of the crusades. Its history shows us
                    clearly the nature of these religious wars and the mode in which they were
                    carried on. Those which follow may be more briefly noticed, as they tend
                    generally to assume more and more of a political character. The first crusade
                    had to all appearance fully attained its object. Godfrey was really king of
                    Jerusalem, although he would not bear the title in a city where his Lord had
                    worn the crown of thorns. His reign lasted barely one year, and this year was
                    signalized less by his victory over the Fatimite caliph of Egypt than by the
                    promulgation of the code of laws known as the Assize of Jerusalem. These laws
                    embodied the main principles of feudalism, while they added a new feature in the
                    judicial courts, the king presiding in the court of the barons, his viscount in
                    that of the burgesses. On Godfrey’s death his brother Baldwin was summoned from
                    his principality of Edessa, 1100, and crowned king by the Patriarch Daimbert.
                    During his reign of eighteen years most of the old crusading chiefs passed away.
                    Stephen of Chartres was slain at Ramlah in 1101. Four years later Raymond died
                    on the sea coast. In 1112 Tancred was cut off in the prime of manhood, three
                    years after Bohemond had ended his stormy career at Antioch. The Emperor
                    Alexius, the only man who derived lasting benefit from these expeditions,
                    outlived them all. If his empire was to last, the Turks must be drawn off from
                    the nearer regions of Asia Minor. This result the crusades accomplished, and
                    thus prolonged the existence of the empire for three centuries and a half. The
                    second successor of Godfrey was his kinsman Baldwin du Bourg, in whose reign,
                    1118-31, Tyre became the seat of a Latin archbishopric. After Baldwin IL, the
                    uneventful reign of Fulk of Anjou (1131-44) was followed by that of his son
                    Baldwin III., a boy thirteen years of age (1144-62), in whose days the fall of
                    Edessa called forth again the religious enterprize of the West. Of this second
                    crusade St Bernard was the apostle, as the hermit Peter had been of the first.
                    In the Council of Vezelai, 1146, Louis VII., the French king, put on the
                    blood-red cross, and his example was reluctantly followed some months later by
                    the Emperor Conrad. The story of this expedition brings before us a long series
                    of disasters. Conrad lost thousands in an attempted march across Asia Minor;
                    Louis took ship at Attaleia and succeeded in making his way to Jerusalem. Conrad
                    at length reached Ptolemais; and the two sovereigns, abandoning the project of
                    rescuing Edessa, resolved to turn their arms against Damascus, 1148. The siege
                    was a miserable failure, brought about, it is said, by the treachery of the
                    barons of Palestine. Bernard himself was for the moment overwhelmed by the
                    completeness of the catastrophe; but the conviction of the reality of his own
                    mission soon assured him that the fault lay in the sinfulness of the pilgrims—an
                    idea which, having fixed itself in some minds, had its issue in the pathetic and
                    awful tragedies called the Children’s Crusades. None but innocent hands, it was
                    thought, could accomplish the work of conquest in the Holy Land; and in 1212 the
                    great experiment was tried, with 30,000 children, so the tale went, under the
                    boy Stephen, and 20,000 German boys and girls under the peasant lad Nicholas, to
                    end in death by sea or on land, or in the more fearful horrors of the
                    slave-market. For the present this notion was only in embryo; and the monk John
                    had more success in reviving old feelings by declaring that the places of the
                    fallen angels had been filled by the spirits of those who had died as champions
                    of the cross in Bernard’s crusade. In 1162 Baldwin III. died at the early age of
                    thirty-three. The great aim of his brother Amalric, who succeeded him, 1162, was
                    to obtain possession of Egypt and thus to prevent Noureddin, the sultan of
                    Aleppo, from establishing himself in a country which would enable him to attack
                    the Latin kingdom from the south as he already could from the north. It may be
                    said that nothing but his own greed for money stood in the way of his success;
                    and Saladin, the nephew of Noureddin, was thus enabled to rise to power in
                    Egypt, and finally, by setting aside the Fatimite caliph, to put an end to a
                    schism which had lasted 200 years. Nor was this all. Amalric’s son and
                    successor, Baldwin IV., was a leper, who, being obliged by his disease to
                    appoint another as his delegate, fixed on Guy of Lusignan, the husband of his
                    sister Sibylla. For the time the arrangement came to naught; but when in 1186
                    the death of Baldwin IV. was followed in a few months by that of Baldwin V., the
                    infant son of Sibylla by her first marriage, Guy managed to establish himself by
                    right of his wife as king of Jerusalem. Over his kingdom the storm was now ready
                    to burst. The army of Saladin assailed Tiberias; and Raymond, count of Tripolis,
                    the son of Raymond of Toulouse, although he had refused to own his allegiance to
                    Guy, hastened to Jerusalem to beg the king to confine himself to a defensive w
                    arfare, which could not fail to be crowned with success. His advice was
                    rejected; and the fatal battle of Tiberias, 1187, almost destroyed the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n661/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0661-0628"/> army which should have defended the capital,
                    while the true cross fell into the hands of the conquerors. Against the
                    comparatively defenceless city Saladin now advanced; but he pledged himself
                    that, if it were surrendered, he would provide for the inhabitants new homes in
                    Syria, and would supply them with the money which they might need. His offer was
                    refused, and Saladin made a vow that he would take ample vengeance. But when at
                    length the issue was seen to be inevitable and the besieged threw themselves on
                    his mercy, Saladin agreed that the nobles and fighting men should be sent to
                    Tyre, and that the Latin inhabitants should be reduced to slavery, only if they
                    failed to pay a ransom fixed according to age and sex. Having entered the city
                    Saladin advanced to the mosque of Omar. As he approached, the cross, which still
                    flashed on its summit, was hurled to the ground and trailed through the mire.
                    Thus fell the Latin kingdom eighty-eight years after Godfrey became the Defender
                    of the Holy Sepulchre. At no time had it exhibited any signs of real stability.
                    Resting on the rule that no faith was to be kept with the unbeliever, it
                    justified treachery. It recognized no title to property except in the
                    Christians, and the temptation thus held out to robbery went far to demoralize
                    the people. It kept up constant irritation by petty forays, while it did little
                    to promote military science or discipline. Its leaders were for the most part
                    devoid of statesmanship. As banded together rather for a religious than a
                    political purpose, they could withdraw from the enterprize as soon as they had
                    fulfilled their vows, and thus the cohesion needed for its permanent success was
                    unattainable. More than all, it had to put up with, if it did not sanction, the
                    growth of societies, each of which claimed independent jurisdiction over its own
                    members. The great military orders of the Hospital and the Temple had come into
                    existence as fraternities devoted to works of mercy in behalf of poor pilgrims.
                    But under the conditions of their sojourn in Palestine it was necessary to bear
                    arms; the bearing of arms involved the need of discipline; and the military
                    discipline of a brotherhood animated by monastic enthusiasm became formidable.
                    These orders were further strengthened by privileges and immunities conferred,
                    some by the kings of Jerusalem, some by the popes. Their freedom from tithe
                    brought them into direct antagonism with the clergy, and the clergy in their
                    turn complained that these orders gave shelter to excommunicated persons, while
                    the fiercest enmity of the Templar was reserved for his brother of the order of
                    the Hospital of St John. On a kingdom composed of such elements as these the old
                    curse of the house divided against itself cannot fail to descend.</p>
                <p>It may have been something like the insight of a statesman which led King Amalric
                    to fix his thoughts on the conquest of Egypt, as the means, not only of
                    preventing the co-operation of hostile powers to the north and the south of the
                    Latin kingdom, but of opening a country of vast resources to the merchant and
                    the trader. There can be no doubt that these considerations prompted the Lateran
                    Council, 1179, to declarethat the first object of every crusade should be the
                    conquest of Damietta; but with this determination these enterprizes ceased to be
                    strictly crusades, and the old spirit is seen again only in the royal saint,
                    Louis IX. For the time the fall of Jerusalem seemed to waken again the impulse
                    which had stirred the hearts of Godfrey and Tancred. On the plain between Gisors
                    and Trie the pleadings of William, archbishop of Tyre, prevailed with Henry II.
                    of England and Philip Augustus of France to assume the cross, 1188. Having thus
                    far shown a marked reluctance to the undertaking, Henry may now have really
                    meant to fulfil his promise; but the quarrels and treachery of his sons
                    interposed a fatal hindrance, and soon brought him to his grave. For his son and
                    successor, Richard, the idea of rescuing the holy city from the Turk had an
                    irresistible attraction, and his whole mind was bent on raising money for the
                    purpose. This task done, he met the French king at Vezelai, where forty-four
                    years ago Louis VII. had listened to the vehement eloquence of Bernard. The two
                    sovereigns made their way to Sicily, while the Emperor Frederick I. (Barbarossa)
                    was advancing with his host to Constantinople. Frederick himself was drowned in
                    a Cilician river, 1190, and of those whom he had brought across the Bosphorus
                    not a tenth, it is said, reached Antioch. The efforts of the Latins of Palestine
                    were now directed chiefly against Acre, which had been besieged for two years
                    before Richard and Philip set foot on the Holy Land. The former was prostrated
                    with fever; but his fiery zeal proved stronger than his sickness, and Saladin
                    was compelled, 1191, to assent to a compact which bound him to surrender the
                    true cross, and to give hostages for the payment of 200,000 pieces of gold
                    within forty days. The money was not paid in time, and the hostages, numbering
                    3000 or more, were all, it is said, slaughtered on the summit of a hill from
                    which the tragedy might be seen in the camp of Saladin. The sequel of the story
                    tells us of battles won and lost to little purpose. The victory of Richard at
                    Azotus opened the road to Jaffa and Jerusalem, and the army had advanced as far
                    as Ramlah, when the men of Pisa, with the knights of the Hospital and the
                    Temple, insisted that the troops could never be kept together after the recovery
                    of Jerusalem, and thus that its re-conquest would really be fatal to the
                    crusade. In June 1192 Richard again led his forces towards the holy city, and
                    was again foiled by the lack of a commissariat and the destruction of the wells
                    and cisterns which for miles round had been shattered by the enemy. His prowess
                    was signally shown in the relief of Jaffa; but in the issue he obtained from
                    Saladin simply a truce for three years and eight months, which insured to
                    pilgrims the right of entering Jerusalem untaxed; and thus, leaving the Holy
                    Land, he set out on the homeward journey which was to be interrupted by a long
                    captivity in a Tyrolese castle as the prisoner of Henry VI. Although this third
                    crusade had been marked by the woful waste of splendid opportunities, it had
                    still secured to the Christians the possession of a long strip of coast, bounded
                    by two important cities, which might serve as a base of operation in future
                    enterprizes, while it had also done much to neutralize the results which Saladin
                    had looked for from his earlier victories.</p>
                <p>The fourth crusade may be dismissed in a few words. It was an enterprize set on
                    foot by the knights of St John, 1193, seconded by Pope Celestine III. in the
                    hopes of getting rid of the Emperor Henry VI., the son of Barbarossa, who
                    claimed the island of Sicily, and encouraged by Henry as a means for promoting
                    his own designs. Henry had no intention of going on the errand himself; but his
                    barons with their followers defeated the Turks between Tyre and Sidon, 1196,
                    recovered Jaffa which had been taken after Richard’s departure, obtained
                    possession of Berytus, and lost all that they had gained by their folly and
                    disunion in the siege of the castle of Thoron, 1197. Jaffa was again taken by
                    the Saracens; and the Latin kingdom became little more than a title with which
                    Isabella, the sister of Baldwin IV., linked that of Cyprus on her marriage with
                    Amalric of Lusignan, who had succeeded his brother Guy as sovereign of that
                    island.</p>
                <p>The fifth crusade was an undertaking of vastly greater importance. Innocent III.,
                    who now sat in St Peter’s chair, was a man of incomparably loftier genius than
                    Urban IL, and he was raised to the Pontifical throne, 1198, at a time when the
                    European world generally seemed in a state of dissolution. He saw at once how in
                    such a state <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n662/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0662-0629"/> of tilings the crusades had served and would
                    serve to promote the Papal power. But if the popes had thus the means and the
                    justification for interfering in the affairs of every kingdom, and acquired the
                    power of demanding contributions, levying subsidies, and dispensing with or
                    enforcing vows, the mode in which the revenues so raised had been administered
                    had roused a wide and deep suspicion which might more than counterbalance all
                    the gains. Hence it came to pass that Innocent, even in the plenitude of his
                    spiritual pretensions, was compelled to defend himself against charges of
                    personal corruption; and when in Fulk of Neuilly he had found an apostle not
                    less devoted and only less eloquent than Bernard, the same suspicion came in to
                    chill enthusiasm and lead men to criticise rather than to worship. Nevertheless,
                    a goodly company prepared for the great work was at length brought together,
                    1201, the most prominent among the leaders being Simon of Montfort, Walter of
                    Brienne, and Geoffrey of Villehardouin, the historian of the crusade. But the
                    story of previous crusades had at least opened men’s eyes to the fearful,risks
                    of a march across Asia Minor, and the army wholly lacked the means of transport
                    by sea. In this strait whither could they betake themselves but to Venice î For
                    85,000 silver marks the doge, Henry Dandolo, covenanted to convey them to the
                    Holy Land; but when the fleet was ready, 51,000 marks only were forthcoming,
                    although the counts of Flanders and St Pol had sold all their plate and strained
                    their credit to the utmost. To the amazement of the crusaders the doge announced
                    that the 34,000 marks would be remitted if they would conquer for the republic
                    the town of Zara, which had been unjustly taken from her by the Hungarian king.
                    To Venice at this time came Alexius, the son of the Byzantine Emperor Isaac
                    Angelus, whom his brother Alexius had blinded and thrust into a dungeon The
                    pleadings of the younger Alexius may have wakened in the mind of Dandolo some
                    thought of what was soon to be achieved at Constantinople; but for the present
                    he stuck to his bargain about Zara with inflexible pertinacity. Zara was taken,
                    November 15,1202; and the crusaders expressed their wish to hasten at once to
                    the Holy Land. Dandolo replied that the new conquest must be guarded against the
                    king of Hungary, and that famine in Western Asia rendered the eastward voyage
                    during the winter impracticable. Envoys from Byzantium were also earnest in
                    insisting that the ends of the crusade would be best promoted by placing Alexius
                    on the imperial throne, and that the crusaders’ mission was rather the
                    establishment of right everywhere than the wresting of a particular spot from
                    the grasp of the Infidel. They added that the first care of Alexius would be to
                    bring the Eastern Church into submission to the Roman See, while his second
                    would be to provide 400,000 marks for the service of the crusaders, and to
                    accompany them himself to the Holy Land. On hearing these tidings Innocent
                    professed amazement and indignation; but Dandolo was resolved that neither
                    threats nor interdicts should interfere with the execution of his will. The
                    Venetian fleet at length, 1203, reached Scutari, where they received a message
                    from the usurper Alexius promising help if during their stay they would do his
                    subjects no harm. The reply was a summons to come down from his throne; and the
                    appeal lay only to the sword. With ordinary courage Alexius must have carried
                    the day; by giving the order for retreat he sealed his own doom, and on his
                    flight from the city the blinded Isaac Angelus, drawn from his prison, was again
                    wrapped in the imperial robes, and his son Alexius raised to share his dignity.
                    But fresh disappointments were in store for the crusaders. Alexius gave them to
                    understand that the winter must be spent in Constantinople; and Dandolo
                    effectually supported him by saying that until the spring the Venetian fleet
                    should not move. In the meantime feuds and factions were doing their old work in
                    Constantinople. The young Alexius, offended at the plainness of speech which
                    told him that solemn compacts must be adhered to, sent a squadron of fire ships
                    against the Venetians. The project failed; and in a little while his throne was
                    filled by Alexius Ducas, called Mourzoufle from the darkness and shagginess of
                    his eye-brows. Dandolo insisted on the restoration of Alexius; and Mourzoufle
                    had him killed in prison. This deed was held to justify the crusaders in placing
                    a Latin emperor on the Byzantine throne; and this task was achieved after a
                    second siege, 1204, which was followed by riot and carnage altogether
                    disgraceful to Western chivalry. Innocent III. might well ask how the return of
                    the Greek Church to ecclesiastical unity was to be looked for when they saw
                    incthe Latins only works of darkness for which they might justly loathe them
                    worse than dogs. The committee of twelve—half French, half Venetian—charged with
                    the election of an emperor, fixed their choice on Dandolo; but the old man, who
                    had well-nigh completed his tale of a hundred winters, cared little for the
                    office, while the Venetians had no wish to see one man at once doge and emperor.
                    Two only remained who could well be made competitors for the throne—the marquis
                    of Montferrat, and Baldwin of Flanders. The choice of the electors fell on the
                    latter, who was a descendant of Charles the Great, and a cousin of the French
                    king; and Baldwin was crowned by the Papal legate in the great church of
                    Justinian.</p>
                <p>The crusaders had thus done great things, although not precisely the things which
                    at the outse’ Innocent would have had them do. The old schism of the Greek
                    Church had been brought to an end, and the dominion of the Holy' See vastly
                    enlarged. But the benefits secured to Venice were at least more enduring. The
                    conquest of Zara was the first step only toward the establishment of a great
                    maritime empire; the factories at Pera were exposed only to attacks by sea, and
                    here her ships could guard them. Her settlements were seen in the' richest
                    islands of the AEgean; and this development of her greatness seemed to foster a
                    spirit of independence which Innocent III. regarded with instinctive suspicion.
                    It was the fault of the Venetians, he said, that the whole enterprize had not
                    been brought already to a brilliant consummation. What might not an army which
                    had done so much at Zara and Byzantium have achieved in the Holy Land?</p>
                <p>The Latin empire thus set up was not more durable than the kingdom of Jerusalem.
                    Baldwin, as emperor, was really nothing more than a chief among his peers; and
                    although he thus lacked the authority of the sovereigns whose title he bore, he
                    attempted tasks which even they must have failed to accomplish. By the crusaders
                    the Greek people were regarded as barbarians or heathens, and their clergy as
                    the ministers of a false faith. The former were excluded from all offices and
                    dignities; the Assize of Jerusalem was substituted for the Code of Justinian;
                    ani no native was allowed to take part in the administration.of this law. Such
                    changes could portend nothing but future evil; nor were other signs of speedy
                    downfall wanting. The conquerors began to quarrel, and Baldwin found himself at
                    open war with Boniface of Montferrat, now lord of Thessalonica. Like Boniface,
                    the other chiefs of the crusade had been splendidly rewarded. The count of Blois
                    received the dukedom of Nice; and the Venetian Dandolo became the sovereign of
                    Romania, with Geoffrey of Villehardouin as his marshal. But the power of the
                    Eastern Caesars w as rather divided than crushed. New empires sprung up at Nice,
                    Trebizoud, and Durazzo; and the Latins encountered an enemy still more
                    formidable in the Bulgarian Calo-John, who ordered a massacre of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n663/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0663-0630"/> Latins in Thrace, 1205. Eager for vengeance,
                    Baldwin inarched against him; but he was taken prisoner, and the army was saved
                    only by the skill and heroism of Villehardouin, who has left ùs a narrative of
                    the campaign. The liberation of Baldwin was demanded by the Pope; the reply was
                    that he had died. The cause was never known; and for a year his brother Henry,
                    who was elected to succeed him, refused to take the title of emperor. The ten
                    years of Henry’s reign, 1206-1216, stand out in pleasant contrast with the lives
                    of the emperors who were to follow him. Henry at the least saw that his brother
                    had made a fatal mistake in confining the work of government exclusively to the
                    Latins. Greeks were again admitted to public offices and honours; to the
                    imposition of a foreign liturgy or of a foreign dogma Henry offered a passive
                    resistance, while his throne, placed on the right hand of the patriarch’s chair
                    in the church of Sancta Sophia, was significant of his thoughts on the question
                    of Papal supremacy. With his death the male line of the counts of Flanders came
                    to an end. In a fatal moment the offer of his crown was accepted by Peter of
                    Courtenay, count of Auxerre, the husband of Henry’s sister Yolande. Like
                    Baldwin, Peter fell into the hands of his enemies on his eastward journey, and
                    died without seeing the city of which he was the sovereign, 1218. During the
                    reign of his successor Robert, the second son of Yolande, the range of Latin
                    dominion was rapidly narrowed. When Robert died, Baldwin, Yolande’s youngest
                    son, was still a child only seven years old; and John of Brienne, the titular
                    king of Jerusalem, was raised to the imperial throne. At length, after his
                    death, the second Baldwin became emperor; but the twenty-five years of his reign
                    he spent chiefly in distant lands, begging for help in money. In vain the Pope
                    proclaimed a crusade in his behalf. The end was drawing nigh. The envoys sent by
                    him to Michael Palaeologus were bidden to tell their master that he might have
                    peace on the payment of an annual tribute amounting to the whole revenue from
                    customs and excise at Constantinople. A few years later, 1261, Baldwin was
                    driven from the imperial city, and spent the rest of his days wandering over
                    Europe and telling the story of his misfortunes. So fell the Latin empire,
                    having dealt the death-blow to the hopes which were dearest to the heart of Pope
                    Innocent III. The reconcilement of the Eastern with the Western Church would, he
                    knew, be best achieved by a close union between the subjects of the Eastern and
                    the Western empires. The policy of the Latin emperors had opened a gulf of
                    sépara*· tion which has not to this day been closed, and had converted the
                    dislike and suspicion of former generations into vehement jealousy or furious
                    hatred.</p>
                <p>When the Latin empire fell the era of the crusades was fast drawing to its close;
                    and of the expeditions which had been undertaken before its downfall one only
                    was prompted by the spirit which had animated the hearers of Urban II. at
                    Clermont. The conditions of the conflict were widely changed; and the course
                    adopted by the Christian leaders showed their conviction that the surest road to
                    Jerusalem was by way of Egypt. Again and again this plan might have been carried
                    out successfully; and again and again the crusaders threw the chance away. Thus,
                    in the year 1219, the Syrian Sultan Coradin had offered peace to the besiegers
                    of Damietta, pledging himself to surrender not merely the true cross but the
                    whole of Palestine, with the exception of two forts for the protection of
                    pilgrims bound to Mecca. The offer was rejected; Damietta was taken and
                    plundered; and in the spring of 1220 the army insisted on attempting the
                    conquest of Egypt. The Sultan Kameel offered them terms as favourable as those
                    of Coradin, and these were also refused. The Nile rose; and the Egyptians
                    inundated the camp of their enemies, who in their turn were compelled to sue for
                    peace by surrendering Damietta. This disaster made the Pope Honorius III., who
                    had been elected on the death of Innocent, still more anxious for the fulfilment
                    of the crusading vow which had long since been taken by the Emperor Frederick
                    IL, the grandson of Barbarossa. In a conference at Ferentino, 1223, it was
                    agreed that Frederick should marry Iolante, the daughter of the titular king of
                    Jerusalem, and thus go forth as his heir to recover his own inheritance. Two
                    years were allowed for preparation; but it was found necessary at San Germano to
                    grant two more. When at length Frederick married Iolante in 1225, he declared
                    that his father-in-law, John of Brienne, was king only by right of his wife, on
                    whose death the title had passed to her daughter, and that thus Frederick was
                    now king of Naples, Sicily, and Jerusalem. Still the months rolled away, and the
                    vow of Frederick remained unfulfilled. Honorius had already been obliged to
                    remonstrate; his successor Gregory IX., 1227, found himself constrained to use
                    sharper weapons. The contrast between the two men was marked indeed. In Gregory
                    IX., chosen Pope at the age of fourscore years, the ascetic severity of Gregory
                    the Great was united with the iron will of Gregory VII. Frederick was a young
                    man of thirty-three, born and bred in Sicily, steeped in the luxury of a
                    gorgeous and voluptuous court, where the charms of art and the refinements of
                    literature and philosophy in some measure redeemed the sensuous indulgence at
                    which Gregory would have stood aghast. The Pope had indeed enough to disquiet
                    him in the reports which came from this Sicilian paradise. Frederick was
                    spending his days amongst a motley company gathered from all the countries of
                    Europe,—a company in which Christians, Jews, and Saracens mingled freely. A
                    society such as this could exist only in an atmosphere of tolerance, and
                    tolerance in Gregory’s eyes was only another name for indifference, and
                    indifference of heresy: The spell, therefore, must be broken; and Frederick must
                    be sent forth to do battle in distant lands with the Infidels to whom he showed
                    so dangerous a liking in his own. At length his forces were gathered at
                    Brindisi, 1228, but fever broke out among them; and Frederick, having embarked,
                    was compelled after three days to put into the harbour of Otranto. Gregory could
                    endure no more. Frederick was solemnly excommunicated, and the excommunication
                    was followed by interdict. Papal messengers forbade him now to leave Italy until
                    he had made satisfaction for his offences against the church. Frederick retorted
                    by sending his own envoys to demand the removal of the interdict, and then
                    sailed to Ptolemais. Here he found friends in the Teutonic Knights and their
                    grand-master Herman of Salza; and although he was ready to fight, he was still
                    more willing to gain his ends without bloodshed. At length a treaty signed by
                    the Sultan Kameel, 1229, surrendered to Frederick the whole of Jerusalem with
                    the exception of the mosque of Omar, and restored to the Christians the towns of
                    Jaffa, Nazareth, and Bethlehem. Success thus achieved exasperated rather than
                    appeased the Pontiff. The interdict followed him to the holy city, and when he
                    went to his coronation as king of Jerusalem in the Church of the Sepulchre, not
                    a single priest took part in the rite, and Frederick was compelled to crown
                    himself. The letters which he wrote to announce a success which he regarded as
                    splendid roused only a storm of indignation. Gregory charged him with a
                    monstrous attempt to reconcile Christ and Belial, and to set up the impostor
                    Mahomet as an object of veneration or worship.</p>
                <p>The treaty with Kameel, which closed the sixth crusade, was for ten years. On
                    neither side, probably, was it strictly kept, and the injuries done to pilgrims
                    on their <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n664/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0664-0631"/> way from Acre to Jerusalem were alleged as a
                    sufficient reason for sending out the expedition headed by Richard, earl of
                    Cornwall (brother of the English Henry III., and afterwards king of the Romans).
                    This expedition may be regarded as the seventh in the list of the crusades, and
                    deserves notice as having been brought to an end, like that of Frederick, by a
                    treaty, 1240. The terms of the later covenant were even more favourable to the
                    Christians; but two years later the Latin power, such as it was, was swept away
                    by the inroad of Korasmians, pushed onwards by the hordes of Jenghiz Khan. The
                    awful havoc thus caused was alleged by Pope Innocent IV. as a reason for again
                    summoning Christendom to the rescue of the Holy Land. But nearly seven years
                    passed away before the French king, Louis IX., was able to set sail for Egypt on
                    the eighth crusade. This royal saint, who lives for us in the quaint and graphic
                    chronicle of his seneschal Joinville, may with truth be said to have been
                    animated by a spirit of devotion and self-sacrifice which no other crusading
                    leader manifested in anything like the same measure. Intolerant in theory, if he
                    could be said to have any theory, and bigoted in language, Louis had that true
                    charity which would make him succour his enemies not less readily than his
                    friends. Nor was his bravery less signal than his gentleness. It was displayed
                    not only on the battle-field, but during the prolonged miseries of a captivity
                    in which he underwent keener pain for the sufferings of others than for his own.
                    He had, indeed, the highest virtues of the monk, the most ardent love of justice
                    and truth, the most vehement hatred of wrong; but as he laid no claim to the
                    qualities of a general, so most assuredly it cannot be said that he possessed
                    them. His dauntless courage saved his army from complete destruction at
                    Mansourah, 1249; but his offer to exchange Damietta for Jerusalem was rejected,
                    and in the retreat, during which they were corm pelled to fight at desperate
                    disadvantage, Louis was taken prisoner. With serene patience, with unwavering
                    firmness, and with an unclouded trust in God, he underwent sufferings for which
                    the Saracens, so Joinville tells us, frankly confessed that they would have
                    renounced Mahomet; and when the payment of his ransom set him free, he made a
                    pilgrimage in sackcloth to Nazareth, 1250. With a firmness which nothing could
                    shake he denied himself the solace of looking on the holy city. His sense of
                    duty would not allow him to reap the fruits of an enterprize in which he had
                    failed, and so to set an evil example to others. As a general he had achieved
                    nothing, but his humiliation involved no dishonour; and the genuineness of his
                    faith, his devotion, and his love had been fully tested in the furnace of
                    affliction.</p>
                <p>The crusading fire was now rapidly burning itself out. In the West there was
                    nothing to awaken again the enthusiasm which had been stirred by Peter the
                    Hermit and by Bernard; while in Palestine itself almost the only signs of
                    genuine activity were furnished by the antagonism of the religious military
                    orders. There was, in truth, disunion and schism everywhere. The relations
                    between the Venetians and the men of Genoa and Pisa were at best those of a
                    hollow truce; and the quarrels of the Templars and Hospitallers led in 1259 to a
                    pitched battle, in which almost all the Templars were slain. Some eight years
                    later the tidings that Antioch had been taken by the Infidels revived in St
                    Louis the old yearning for the rescue of the holy places; but he modestly
                    expressed his fear that his sins might again bring on the Christian arms the
                    disasters of his Egyptian expedition. Cheered by the sympathy of the Pope
                    Clement IV., he embarked with an army of 60,000 men, 1270; but a storm drove his
                    ships to Sardinia, and thence they sailed for Tunis. They had encamped, it is
                    said, on the site of Carthage, when a plague broke out. The saintly king was
                    among the victims; and this truest of all crusaders died uttering the words, “I
                    will enter Thy house, O Lord; I will worship in Thy sanctuary.” The arrival of
                    the English Edward, who was soon to succeed to the throne on the death of Henry
                    HI., brought about no immediate change in the circumstances of the crusaders. In
                    the following year Edward reached Acre, took Nazareth—the inhabitants of which
                    he massacred— fell sick, and during his sickness narrowly escaped being murdered
                    by an assassin sent by the emir of Joppa. Having made a peace for ten years, he
                    returned to Europe; and the ninth and last crusade was at an end. An earnest
                    attempt to renew the struggle was made in the Council of Lyons, 1274, by Gregory
                    X., Edward’s friend; and Rodolf of Hapsburg pledged himself to join the
                    expedition then decreed; but in less than two years Gregory died, and the scheme
                    fell to the ground. Of the attempts made in succeeding years to rekindle the old
                    enthusiasm it is enough to say that all proved abortive. The Holy Land could no
                    longer, as it seemed, furnish a home even for the military orders. The Teutonic
                    Knights made their way to Lithuania and Poland, the Hospitallers to Cyprus and.
                    to Rhodes. The Templars fell victims to a plot as iniquitous and treacherous as
                    any that has disgraced the annals of mankind. When their services had ceased to
                    be useful in Palestine the French king found that much benefit might be derived
                    from a confiscation of their vast possessions. The proceedings against the order
                    in England are scarcely to be compared with the surpassing horrors of the
                    proscription in France which ended in the burning of the grandmaster Du Molay;
                    but in both countries the power of falsehood in compassing the destruction of
                    men innocent of the particular crimes laid against them was seen as perhaps it
                    had never been seen before. The fury with which they were persecuted was indeed
                    a legitimate result of the crusades, for which the unbelief of the enemy
                    supplied the primary motive. The theory of putting down error by force had
                    received a sanction which was applied in the dealings of the popes with
                    Albigensian and other heretics.</p>
                <p>The narrative of the crusades brings out with sufficient clearness both their
                    causes and their consequences. We have seen that, while the popular impulse
                    which led to them could not issue in vigorous action without the sanction of
                    religion, the mere authority even of the popes was wholly powerless to set Latin
                    Christendom in motion until popular indignation had reached the fever heat. We
                    have been able to watch the effect of these enterprizes in changing the face not
                    only of the East but of the West, securing to the popes the exaction and
                    administration of vast revenues and of a dispensing power still more momentous
                    in its issues, strengthening and extending royal authority by the absorption of
                    fiefs, but for the moment increasing in incomparably larger measure the wealth
                    and influence of the clergy. We have seen the introduction of feudal principles
                    into Jerusalem and Constantinople, and have marked the effects which followed
                    the substitution of the Assize of Jerusalem for the Code of Justinian. The story
                    has shown us that the contact of Western with Eastern Christendom brought about
                    in some respects results precisely opposite to those which were anticipated from
                    it, and that the establishment of the Latin empire of Constantinople rendered
                    hopeless that union of the churches which Innocent III. had regarded as its
                    certain fruit. But if the crusades thus disappointed the expectations of their
                    promoters, they achieved some results the benefits of which have been felt from
                    that day to the present. They failed, indeed, to establish the permanent
                    dominion of Latin Christendom, whether in New Rome or in Jerusalem; but they
                    prolonged for nearly four centuries the life of the Eastern empire, and by so
                    doing they arrested <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n665/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0665-0632"/> the tide of Mahometan conquests as effectually as
                    it was arrested for Western Europe by Charles Martel on the plain of Tours. They
                    saved the Italian and perhaps even the Teutonic and the Scandinavian lands from
                    a tyranny which has blasted the fairest regions of the earth; and if they added
                    fuel to the flame of theological hatred between the Orthodox and the Latin
                    churches, if they intensified the feelings of suspicion and dislike between the
                    Eastern and the Western Christians, they yet opened the way for an interchange
                    of thought and learning which had its result in the revival of letters and in
                    the religious reformation which followed that revival. If, again, of their
                    leaders some showed themselves men of merciless cruelty and insatiable greed,
                    there were others who like Tancred approached the ideal of the knightly chivalry
                    of a later generation, and others again whose self-sacrifice, charity, and
                    heroic patience furnish an example for all time. The ulterior results of the
                    crusades were the breaking up of the feudal system, the abolition of serfdom,
                    the supremacy of a common law over the independent jurisdiction of chiefs who
                    claimed the right of private wars; and if for the time they led to deeds of
                    iniquity which it would be monstrous even to palliate, it must yet be admitted
                    that in their influence on later ages the evil has been assuredly outweighed by
                    the good.</p>
