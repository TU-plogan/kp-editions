                    >contrabannum)</hi> means, according to Ducauge, “merces <hi rend="italic"
                    >banno</hi> interdicta,” and was originally applied to a prohibited domestic
                    trade in time of peace, such as that in salt. The term does not occur in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Guidon de la Mer,</hi> or in Grotius, and is first used to denote
                    a prohibited neutral trade with a belligerent in the Treaty of Southampton (l7th
                    September 1625) between Charles I. and the States-General of Holland. That
                    treaty declared that all provisions <hi rend="italic">(munitions</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de bouche),</hi> provisions of war, ships, arms, sails, &amp;c.,
                    silver, iron, &amp;c., carried to Spanish ports, would along with the carrier
                    ships and their crews be good prize. It was partly from the general use of such
                    treaty-stipulations with neutrals, and partly from the custom of belligerents at
                    the beginning of a war to issue declarations which they formally intimated to
                    neutrals, and which forbade all trade in certain articles with the ports of
                    their enemies, that the international law of contraband grew up. An example of
                    the latter mode of proceeding is the “Placaart” issued in 1599 by the
                    States-General, which, like the Berlin Decrees, completely interdicted all trade
                    with Spain. The Treaty of Southampton itself was followed by two proclamations,
                    which assume a belligerent right to place restrictions on neutral commerce, and
                    which go the length of authorizing private ships to capture neutral bottoms
                    carrying contraband. The practice of contraband is of course much older than the
                    name. Thus in the Code of Justinian (iv. 41, 42) Marcian prohibits the sale to
                    <hi rend="italic">barbari alienigenae</hi> of oil, wine, several specified kinds
                    of arms, and generally of iron. So also the Decretals, Gregery IX. (v. 6-12),
                    and the Bull “In Caena Domini,” c. 7, denounced excommunication against such as
                    should supply Saracens with arms. It is in the 17th century that the military
                    policy and commercial interests of the various European nations begin to be
                    indicated in their treaties relating to contraband. Opinion varied so much with
                    the political situation, that it is difficult to extract from these treaties the
                    prevailing custom even of a single nation. At first provisions, that is corn,
                    &amp;c., seem generally to have been excluded from the list, and in 1674 a great
                    English lawyer, Sir Leoline Jenkins, told Charles II. that nothing ought to be
                    deemed contraband “but what is directly and immediately subservient to the use
                    of war, except it be in the case of besieged places” (which raises the distinct
                    question of blockade), or of a “general certification by Spain to all the
                    world.” The definition of the French Ordonnance de la Marine of 1681 is also
                    limited to munitions of war, and even to such as have “la forme d’un instrument
                    pouvant servir directement à l’usage de la guerre.” On the other hand, the early
                    writers on contraband, such as Dr Zouch <hi rend="italic">(De Jure</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fetiali,</hi> 1634) and Albericus Gentilis <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Advocationes</hi><hi rend="italic">Hispanicae),</hi> in discussing the
                    question “An res amicorum ad hostes transeuntes intercipere liceat î” seem to
                    assume that the belligerent has, apart from treaty, a right indefinitely to vary
                    the list of articles constituting munitions of war, and it is clear that the
                    test of “immediate subserviency” must vary with the character of the
                    hostilities, the resources of the combatants, and the actual position of the
                    conflict. In 1543 the English envoy, Sadler, challenged the Scotch fish trade to
                    France as a species of “aid,” a word often used in the older treaties of
                    alliance, but which can scarcely have been intended to cover the case of
                    habitual trade; and in 1589 Queen Elizabeth successfully justified the capture
                    of a fleet of sixty vessels, belonging to the Hanse confederation, and carrying
                    corn and naval munitions to Spain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> Continental jurists called this an attempt to starve Spain
                    out.</p></note> In all these cases some ordinance, placaart, or treaty was
                    appealed to, but these documents were of course liable to <hi rend="italic">ex
                    post facto</hi> interpretation, and such interpretations were acquiesced in from
                    necessity or from motives of policy. A powerful neutral, dissatisfied with the
                    decision of the captor’s prize court, might issue letters of reprisal. This was
                    done by England when a cargo of tobacco, bound for Holland, was condemned in
                    Spain on the ground that by its use “the consumption of victuals might be
                    prolonged.” The general principle, before the writings of Grotius permanently
                    affected the public law of Europe, was, therefore, that the private right of
                    neutral merchants to free trade must yield to the public right of the
                    belligerent to put such limits on neutral trade as were reasonably necessary in
                    the conduct of war,— that right being exercised in a public and legal manner.
                    After the Peace of Westphalia, the grand pensionary of Holland, John de Witt,
                    contended strongly for the extension of neutral rights, and in 1662 by treaty
                    with France the Dutch adopted the definition of contraband in the 12th and 13th
                    articles of the Treaty of the Pyrenees between France and Spain (1659), which
                    included munitions of war, and specially excluded almost everything in the
                    nature of ordinary provisions. For some time England maintained (as in her
                    Treaty of Whitehall with Sweden, 1661) the doctrine that money, ships, and
                    provisions were to be deemed contraband, but in her Treaty of Breda with Holland
                    (1667), and her Treaty of St Germain-en-Laye with France (1677), she practically
                    adopted the rule of the Pyrenees, with this extension, that the neutral trade
                    might take place even between two enemy ports, provided neither was blockaded.
                    This explains the singular agreement made by England and Holland in 1689 for a
                    wholesale blockade of the ports, harbours, and roadsteads of France. The
                    treaties of the 18th century proceeded for the most parton the Treaty of
                    Utrecht, “which embodied the French doctrine of contraband” (Hall, <hi
                    rend="italic">Rights and Duties of Neutrals,</hi> 1874). As, however, some
                    powers never contracted with each other on the subject, and as the treaties made
                    were for limited periods, and were often broken by the outbreak of war, there
                    was plenty of room for controversy and for the enforcement of national opinions.
                    The classical division of contraband by Grotius was as follows: “Sunt res quae
                    in bello tantum usum habent, ut arma; sunt quae in bello nullum habent usum, ut
                    quae voluptati inserviunt; sunt quae et in bello et extra bellum usum habent, ut
                    pecuniae, commeatus, naves, et quae navibus adsunt.” The only difficulty arises
                    in connection with the third class, of which Grotius says that the state of the
                    war must be considered, and that “if seizure is necessary for defence, the
                    necessity confers a right of arresting the goods” <hi rend="italic">(De Jure
                    Belli</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Pacis,</hi> iii. 1. 5). A
                    leading question in the 18th century was whether naval stores should be deemed
                    contraband, the <pb break="no"

                    Heineccius and Valin) inclining to the affirmative, while Bynkershυek <hi

                    of Utrecht, that goods, though possibly of warlike use, were not contraband, if
                    not worked into the form of an instrument of war. Other authors, as Vattel <hi
                    rend="italic">(Droit des Gens,</hi> iii. 7, 112) and Heineccius <hi

                    enemy—“si hostis laboret inopiâ”—and were prepared on this ground even to
                    include provisions as contraband. The first armed neutrality of 1789, alarmed by
                    the growing naval power of Great Britain, declared that only munitions of war
                    and sulphur should be contraband. (This is the <hi rend="italic">krieg</hi><hi

                    and France made large seizures of provisions, the former pretending that there
                    was a chance of reducing France by famine, and the French executive having
                    assumed the direction of the whole corn trade of their country. Both sides were
                    wrong, and were nobly rebuked by the counter declaration of the Danish minister,
                    Count Bernstorf, in which he explained that a neutral was neither a party nor a
                    judge, and could take no notice of a reciprocity of injuries. The United States
                    also energetically protested against the notion that provisions, not destined to
                    a blockaded port, could in any circumstances be contraband,—a position
                    inconsistent with the modern American doctrine that an actual <hi rend="italic"
                    >military</hi> destination even of luxuries will impress on the cargo a
                    contraband character. The second armed neutrality of 1800 took up the same
                    position as the first; and in 1803 England and Russia agreed that money, horses,
                    ships, and manufactured articles for naval use were to be confiscated, naval
                    stores, the produce of either country, being brought in for pre-emption. The
                    only existing treaties of England on this subject are those with Portugal in
                    1820 (munitions of war, sulphur, horses, money, and naval stores) and with
                    Brazil in 1827 (munitions of war and naval stores). Throughout the French wars,
                    however, the law administered by Lord Stowell and others in the English prize
                    court was much harsher than the treaty obligations of the nation. The
                    circumstances which Lord Stowell considered favourable to a cargo were these
                    :—1. Its being the product of the neutral country, and therefore a natural
                    export; 2. Its being in an unmanufactured state, as hemp or iron; 3. Its
                    destination to a commercial nota military port(“Jonge Margaretha,” 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">Rob. Adm. Rep.)</hi> Among modern jurists Ortolan <hi
                    rend="italic">(Diplomatie</hi><hi rend="italic">de la</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Afer.,</hi> ii. 190) and Heffter <hi rend="italic">(Le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Droit International,</hi> § 160), as quoted by Hall, agree that contraband
                    cannot be limited to munitions of war, but must extend to raw materials and
                    merchandize, if clearly destined for actual and immediate military use. Ortolan
                    expressly excludes provisions under all circumstances, but the tendency of
                    modern decision is to bring all articles to the test proposed by Mr Dana, the
                    editor of Wheaton,—“the right of the belligerent to prevent certain things from
                    getting into the military use of the enemy,”—a principle which is obviously
                    independent of the innocent or fraudulent intention of the owner of the cargo.
                    Mr Hall proposes a classification of contraband goods, not being munitions of
                    war, based on their more or less intimate connection with military operations.
                    Among these he includes horses, saltpetre, sulphur, materials of naval
                    construction, such as timber, cordage, pitch (stated by the British Government
                    during the Crimean war to be contraband), marine engines, &amp;c., and coal, if
                    its immediate destination be military. Thus in the Franco-German war, 1870,
                    vessels laden with coal were forbidden to sail from English ports to the French
                    fleet in the North Sea. France, on the other hand, still holds by the decision
                    in the case of “Il Volante” (an Austrian ship laden with <hi rend="italic">boiae
                    de construction</hi> from Lisbon to Messina, and captured in 1807 by the French
                    cruiser “Etoile de Bonaparte ”). that ship’s timber and naval stores are not
                    contiaband. Provisions of very various kinds, biscuits, cheese, wine, corn have
                    both in England and America been held contraband (The “Commercen,” 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">Wheaton’s Reports).</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> The “Commercen" was a Swedish'vessel, carrying English
                    provisions to a Spanish port for delivery to the British commissariat in the
                    Peninsular War. Sweden and Spain were British allies in the war with France, hut
                    neutral in the war with the United States, and there was no alliance between
                    France and the States. The particular cargo was therefore (unjustly) condemned
                    as enemy’s goods, but doctrines were laid down as to contraband.</p></note><hi

                    general subject of ships, however, belongs to the subject Neutrality. With
                    regard to clothing, money, and unwrought metals, there are no recent decisions,
                    but the rule would probably be applied that they may become contraband in
                    certain circumstances. The ordinary penalty of carrying contraband is
                    confiscation of cargo, but where the capture is only justified by special
                    circumstances, or, as it is sometimes expressed, where the contraband is
                    “conditional,” and where the cargo is ordinary neutral produce, and there is
                    perfect <hi rend="italic">bona</hi><hi rend="italic">fides</hi> of the owner,
                    the ship is merely carried in for pre-emption, which means the owner’s value <hi
                    rend="italic">plus</hi> 10 per cent., with indemnity for freight and expenses of
                    detention. Anciently, in cases of absolute contraband, both ship and cargo were
                    forfeited; it is said Russia still does this. The right of pre-emption <hi
                    rend="italic">(droit d’achat)</hi> is stated by Lord Stowell to apply to all
                    cargoes whatever bound for an enemy’s port; and it is settled that any attempt
                    at fraud, as false papers, or a concealed destination, will disentitle the
                    owners to compensation. The same circumstances occurring in the case of a cargo
                    of absolute contraband, even where the ship does not belong to the owner of the
                    contraband, may forfeit the ship.</p>
                <p>It will be remembered that the blockade runners of the American civil war raised
                    very nice questions on this point. It was impossible to prove that these vessels
                    after leaving Nassau were not going to Matamoras in Mexico, for they had only a
                    floating intention of “running.” The question, therefore, which came before the
                    Supreme Court of the United States in the “Bermuda” and “Peterhoff” cases was
                    whether the interposition of a neutral port between the neutral point of
                    departure and the belligerent destination did protect the cargo which was
                    admitted to be contraband There could be little doubt that the goods went
                    straight through Texas to the Confederate States. But in several cases these
                    cargoes were not condemned. The “Peterhoffs” cargo was army boots, artillery
                    harness, regulation blankets, chloroform, and quinine.</p>
                <p>Where the shipowner is innocent and does not own the cargo, he merely loses his
                    freight and expenses. Contraband articles also involve innocent parts of a cargo
                    in ccι fiscation when both belong to one owner. The United States and Prussia
                    are the only powers that have chosen the bold plan of entirely renouncing by
                    treaty between themselves the right of confiscation, for which they have
                    substituted an unlimited right of stoppage and detention and appropriation,
                    subject to full compensation. This is an arrangement which may probably become
                    more common, and will of course much weaken the effects of the law of
                    contraband. It is impossible to prevent the seizure of private property in war,
                    but it has been suggested that the value should be <pb break="no"

                    the neutral government for distribution. There is only one case in which a
                    return cargo has been confiscated on the ground that the outward cargo was
                    contraband, with fraudulent papers and fraudulent destination; the voyage was a
                    long one,—to the East Indies. Where a neutral vessel carries despatches to a
                    belligerent, as the ship has become a quasiservant of the enemy, the captor
                    generally not only seizes the papers but confiscates the ship. Despatches from
                    or to accredited diplomatic agents or consuls residing in a neutral country do
                    not fall under this rule, the neutral having an interest in their safe
                    transmission. But ignorance of the contents of despatches addressed to military
                    officials, or unaccredited agents, will not excuse their carriage. Even where
                    the despatches have been received through force or imposition, the English prize
                    court holds that the carrier is liable, because his suspicions ought to have
                    been roused. A very difficult question rose in the American civil war with
                    regard to the searching of mail bags. If the right were renounced absolutely,
                    all belligerent despatches would choose this safe route. It was arranged that
                    all British mails, certified to be such, should on capture be forwarded
                    unopened. The carriage of persons in the service of a belligerent also leads to
                    confiscation of the ship, if it amount to an intentional assistance of the
                    belligerent. The persons carried may be mere civilians, and the port of
                    destination neutral. The most common case is the carriage of soldiers. The
                    exception to this rule is the case of transport of diplomatic agents, which is
                    generally recognized as lawful, but which in the Trent affair the United States
                    Government repudiated.</p>
