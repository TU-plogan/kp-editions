                <p><label type="entry">CONGO</label>, a country of Western Africa, extending along
                    the coast of the Atlantic for about 185 English miles, from the River Zaire, or
                    Congo (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Africa,</hi> vol. í p. 254), which separates it
                    from Cacongo and Loango on the north, to the Dande, which marks the boundary of
                    Angola on the south. No very definite limit can be assigned on the eastern side;
                    but it is hardly to be regarded as Congo territory at more than 250 miles
                    inland. At one time the name Congo was applied not only to the country thus
                    defined, but also to Loango, Angola, and Benguela—in short, to all the territory
                    claimed by the Portuguese in this part of the continent.</p>
                <p>The coast of Congo presents for the most part a succession of low cliffs and
                    bluffs of red sandstone, sinking at intervals almost to the level of the sea;
                    and for about 30 to 60 miles inland the country remains comparatively flat. It
                    then begins to rise in irregular terraces till it reaches a height of about 1500
                    or 1600 feet; and its surface is broken with an endless variety of hill and
                    valley and undulating plateau. The prevailing rocks in the lower terraces are
                    mica, schist, gneiss, and shale; further inland there are extensive limestone
                    formations; and igneous rocks occur in several quarters. The whole country is
                    abundantly watered, partly by tributaries of the Zaire, and partly by
                    independent streams that flow westward to the Atlantic. Of the latter the more
                    important are the Ambrizzette, the Loge, and the Lifune; but even these are only
                    navigable for barges. The former, as far as Congo proper is concerned, are
                    individually insignificant. During the rainy season the surplus water is carried
                    down in a thousand torrents, but the beds are quite dry during most of the
                    year.</p>
                <p>The mineral wealth of Congo is only partially explored, and even the deposits
                    that are known to exist are very sparingly utilized. Copper mines have been
                    worked at intervals for a considerable period at Bembe; and, though now
                    abandoned by the Portuguese, they appeared to Lieutenant Grandy to contain a
                    good supply of ore. Very fine malachite is also found in other parts of the
                    country. Iron is obtained in the northern districts along the Zaire, where the
                    general diffusion of the metal is proved by the red ferruginous character of the
                    soil, and the fact that most of the streams are more or less chalybeate. A lake
                    of bitumen is reported at Kinsao, near Mangue Grande; the same substance occurs
                    at Musserra, and another deposit has been worked by the natives at Libongo. Red
                    gumcopal occurs in various places,—among others, near Mangue Grande and in the
                    Mossulo country; but the superstition of the natives interferes with its
                    excavation. That diamonds have ever been found there seems no reason to believe;
                    but garnets and even rubies occur. Salt is manufactured by the natives along the
                    coast.</p>
                <p>The climate of Congo is, in comparison with that of most tropical countries,
                    remarkably cool and agreeable. In the hot season the thermometer is seldom more
                    than from 80° to 86° Fahr, in the shade, and in the “cacimbo,” or cool season,
                    it usually ranges from 60° during the night to 75° during the day. This low
                    temperature is principally due to the westerly breeze which sets in from the
                    Atlantic about nine or ten o’clock in the morning, and continues blowing, not
                    unfrequently with considerable violence, till after sunset. As this breeze dies
                    away towards the interior, the heat is perceptibly greater; but the increasing
                    elevation of the country soon reduces the temperature to similar limits. The
                    different seasons of the year occur at slightly different periods, according to
                    the altitude and position of the several districts; but the hot or rainy season
                    may be regarded as extending from October to May or June, and the “cacimbo” as
                    occupying the rest of the year. In October there are usually light rains in the
                    lower country; and these are succeeded by the <hi rend="italic">Moula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">na Chintomba,</hi> or great rains, which are accompanied by
                    violent storms and thunder. Next follows, from December to March, a period known
                    as the “little dries,” and then comes another spell of heavy rains and
                    atmospheric disturbance. In the neighbourhood of Banza Umpata, about 200 miles
                    inland, the natives, according to Lieutenant Grandy, divide the year into the
                    following five seasons :— <hi rend="italic">Sevoo,</hi> or summer, from the
                    beginning of July to the middle of September; <hi rend="italic">Bangala,</hi> or
                    the dry season, to the end of November; <hi rend="italic">Masanza,</hi> to the
                    middle of February; <hi rend="italic">Kundey,</hi> or the period of the heavy
                    rains, to the middle of April; and <hi rend="italic">Kintombo,</hi> or spring,
                    to the end of June. In its effects on the human constitution, the climate of
                    Congo is much less deleterious than that of the coast regions further to the
                    north; and in the higher districts even the European can maintain himself with
                    ease in a fair state of health. Fevers and agues are not uncommon, but do not
                    last long; and the natives suffer from bronchitis, pleurisy, small-pox, and skin
                    diseases. The curious sleepdisease appeared in 1870, but did not spread through
                    the <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> country.</p>
                <p>The flora of Congo is rich and various; and the country may be divided with
                    remarkable precision into different zones, distinguished by the prevailing
                    character of the vegetation. According to Mr Monteiro, the traveller, as he
                    advances inland from Ambriz, finds during the first 25 miles baobabs,
                    euphorbias, aloes, “muxixes” or “mukazo” <hi rend="italic">(Sterculia
                    tomentosd),</hi> and a great abundance of <hi rend="italic">Sanseviera
                    angolensis;</hi> he passes next into a region of larger, shadier trees, which
                    continue for the next 35 miles, when the scene again changes, and the whole
                    forest becomes one tangled maze of the most luxuriant and beautiful creepers.
                    Near Bembe the country opens up and the oil-palm becomes the prevailing tree. In
                    the first zone the grasses are short and delicate, in the second they are
                    stronger and taller; in the third they develop into gigantic species with sharp
                    knife-like blades, from 5 to 16 feet in height, which cover vast open stretches,
                    and for several months in the year render communication through the country
                    almost impossible. The cashew tree is exceedingly abundant along the coast from
                    Congo to Ambrizzette. The principal objects of native cultivation are manioc or
                    cassava, yams, ground-nuts <hi rend="italic">(Åraclàs hypogaeaſ</hi> and maize.
                    Sesamum and sweet potatoes are sparingly grown. Coffee of good quality is found
                    wild in various parts, especially in the neighbourhood of Encoge. Chili pepper
                    is abundant, and forms the principal condiment in use among the natives, who not
                    unfrequently eat it to their own injury. The plantain, the papaw, the orange,
                    and the pine-apple are the principal fruits, but many others thrive well. Beans,
                    cabbages, pumpkins, cucumbers, melons, spinach, and other European vegetables
                    can be successfully cultivated, and the first two are used by the natives. Of
                    the beans, indeed, there are two species, the ordinary haricot and the
                    tree-bean; the latter is sometimes left to grow for two years. The principal
                    beverage of the inhabitants is the palm wine, but they also manufacture a beer
                    called “garapa,” from the Indian com. According to Selim Agha, who accompanied
                    Burton in 1863, cotton and rice come to perfection in four months, the cassava
                    takes six or nine, and three or four are sufficient for cabbages, lettuce,
                    endive, and carrots.</p>
                <p>The domestic animals of Congo consist chiefly of goats, swine, dogs, and cats;
                    and there are also a few sheep with coats of hair instead of wool. The goats are
                    beautiful creatures, but the swine and dogs are poor and half-starved. No beasts
                    of burden are employed by the natives; and the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n294/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0294-0267"/> mules, asses, and camels introduced by the
                    Portuguese died out. Horned cattle there are none, though they thrive well
                    enough on the coast under the white man’s care.</p>
                <p>The larger wild animals are similar to those of the neighbouring countries on the
                    south; but the River Zaire seems to be a natural limit for many species on the
                    north. The variety of birds is remarkable. Flamingoes, spoon-bills, herons,
                    ducks, and various other aquatic species abound in the rivers and marshes. The
                    common African crow, bright-coloured starlings, rollers, and doves are very
                    common in the lower country; and sun-birds and other insectivora frequent the
                    palm-trees. The white ant is the most abundant of the insect tribes; and
                    mosquitoes of a most virulent sort are very common. The chigoe <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pulex</hi><hi rend="italic">penetrans),</hi> introduced in 1870, spread
                    through the country, but seems to be dying out again. Bees abound, but are not
                    domesticated.</p>
                <p>Animal food is not in very general use, although the natives will eat the flesh
                    of almost any beast or bird. The Mussurongos consider the cat a great dainty;
                    field rats are regularly captured for the kitchen, by the various tribes; the
                    king-cricket, and some species of caterpillars, are sought after for the same
                    purpose; and the white ant is greedily devoured in the winged state.</p>
                <p>Congo is as destitute as the other countries of tropical Africa of what a
                    European would call a city. The native <hi rend="italic">Lanzas,</hi> or
                    townships, consist of a few hundred huts clustered together; and the Portuguese
                    settlements are merely commercial factories or military posts. The places of
                    most importance along the coast are Mangue Pequeño, Mangue Grande, Quinzao,
                    Moculla, Ambrizzette, Musserra, Quicimbo, Ambriz, and Libongo. On the River
                    Zaire may be mentioned King Antonio’s Town, Boma (anciently Lambi), and Vinda la
                    Nzadi, or Congo Town; but the last two are on the north side of the river, and
                    therefore are hardly to be included within our limits. The principal inland town
                    is São Salvador, or Congo Grande, with a population at one time extravagantly
                    estimated at 50,000; and Banza Noki to the north and Bembe and Encoge to the
                    south are worthy of mention. The number of villages is very considerable, and
                    together they must make up a fair population; but it is evident from the
                    condition of the country, as well as from the reports of the older travellers,
                    that formerly the inhabitants must have been much more numerous.</p>
                <p>The ordinary huts of the natives are formed of mats woven from a reedy grass, or
                    the fibres of plants. That of the chief is constructed more skilfully of palm
                    leaves, and is encompassed with a fence of reeds. In the coast towns the huts,
                    though each is built separate, are comparatively close to each other; while
                    further inland much more space is allowed to intervene, and hedges are
                    frequently grown round small groups. The Mushicongos build on a larger scale
                    than their Ambriz neighbours, and not unfrequently have two compartments. The
                    household furniture and utensils, in simplicity and rudeness, are on a par with
                    the domestic inclosures. Baskets are made of the fibres of the palm tree, and
                    bowls and bottles of gourds and other vegetables; earthen vessels are used for
                    boiling the victuals, and wooden spoons to eat them; while a mat of grass thrown
                    on a raised platform constitutes the only bedding.</p>
                <p>There is no political or ethnographical unity in the country. No one tribe is
                    predominant, and the king of Congo, whatever may have formerly been his
                    authority, is now no more than a local chieftain, like a dozen others. The
                    tribes numerically important are the Mussurongos, v.ſlio extend from the Zaire
                    as far south as Mangue Grande; the Mushicongos, who lie inland to the north of
                    Bembe; the Ambrizians along the coast, and inland as far as Quiballa; and the
                    Mossulos to the north of the Dande.</p>
                <p>Besides the king of Congo, the king of North Bamba, or of the district between
                    the Ambrizzette and the Loge, and the king of Encoge, with the title of “Dembo
                    Ambuilla,” possess a certain amount of prestige. Every “town” has its own
                    headman and assembly of “Maeotas,” or councillors; and these in company manage
                    its affairs. The office of headman confers no despotic power; and it descends by
                    inheritance not from father to son, but from uncle to nephew or niece. The
                    languages of the Mussurongo, Mushicongo, and Ambriz tribes are radically one;
                    and indeed the natives of the whole of this part of the coast, for a distance of
                    450 miles, can understand one another’s speech. Under the name of Fiote, this
                    common tongue has been the object of some little attention. Barbot gives a list
                    of 33 words, Douville a more extended vocabulary of what he calls <hi
                    rend="italic">la langue Magialoua,</hi> and the authors of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Congo Expedition</hi> a third and much better collection. Vowels and liquids
                    are numerous, and gutturals altogether absent, so that the language has a soft
                    and harmonious sound. In number of words it is remarkably rich. According to
                    Captain Burton, its likeness to the Kisawahili of Zanzibar is so great that he
                    was frequently able to understand whole sentences from this resemblance alone.
                    Along the coast a considerable number of the natives can speak Portuguese or
                    even English; but their pronunciation is extremely faulty, and they transfer the
                    idiom of their own speech to the foreign tongue.</p>
                <p>The religion, if such it can be called, of the Congoese is a gross fetishism, and
                    almost the only trace of their former superficial Christianization is the
                    superstitious value attached to some stray crucifix now employed as a charm, a
                    little more potent, it may be, than a string of beads or a land-shell filled
                    full of birds’ dung and feathers. Belief in witchcraft is very general, and
                    develops itself in the most trivial and irrational style. Circumcision is
                    practised by all the tribes; and the rite is usually performed on boys of from
                    eight to twelve years of age,, who have to undergo a preparatory discipline, and
                    live apart from the rest of the community for a month in a special hut. Polygamy
                    prevails,— every man having wives according to his wealth and rank. There is no
                    nuptial ceremony; but the bridegroom makes a present to the father-in-law,
                    provides the bride with her marriage outfit, and bears the cost of a family
                    feast. The costume of both men and women varies considerably with rank and the
                    degree of European influence; but in general it is very slight. The bodies of
                    the dead are not unfrequently desiccated by roasting, and then buried in the
                    huts which they formerly occupied. The interment is often delayed for a year or
                    more, that all the relatives may be present at the “wake.”</p>
                <p>Since the stoppage of the slave trade, a very considerable traffic has been
                    developed in the natural products of the country, and were it not for the
                    inherent indolence of the natives it might be increased almost to any extent.
                    The principal exports are the fibre of the baobab, first utilized as a paper
                    material by Mr Monteiro in 1858; ground nuts, which find a ready market,
                    especially in France, as an oil seed; ivory brought down from the interior; palm
                    oil, sesamum, coffee, and an inferior kind of Indian-rubber obtained from a
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Landolfia.</hi> The commercial prosperity of the
                    Congo River has been frequently interrupted by the attacks of the Mussurongo
                    pirates, but this annoyance has been somewhat checked by the vigorous measures
                    of the English cruisers. The last expedition of repression was that of Commodore
                    Sir W. Hewett in 1875.</p>
                <p>Congo was discovered by Diego Cam, probably in 1484. He erected a stone pillar at
                    the mouth of the river, which accordingly took the title of Rio de Padrão, and
                    established friendly relations with the natives, who reported that the country
                    was subject to a great monarch, Mwani Congo, or Lord of Congo, resident at
                    Ambasse Congo. The Portuguese were not long in making them <pb break="no"

                    Sousa was despatched on a formal embassy in 1490; and the first missionaries
                    entered the country in his train. The king was soon afterwards baptized, and
                    Christianity was nominally established as the national religion. In 1534 a
                    cathedral was founded, and in 1560 the Jesuits arrived with Paulo Dias de
                    Novaes. Of the prosperity of the country at this time the Portuguese have left
                    the most glowing and indeed incredible accounts. The attention of the Portuguese
                    was, however, turned more particularly to the southern districts of Angola and
                    Benguela, and their hold on Congo loosened. In 1627 their cathedral was removed
                    to Sãò Paul de Loanda, and São Salvador declined in importance. In the 18th
                    century, again, in spite of the invasions of the Dutch and French, some steps
                    were taken towards re-establishing their authority; in 1758 they formed a
                    settlement at Encoge; from 1784 to 1789 they carried on a war against the
                    natives of Mussolo; in 1791 they built a fort at Quincollo on the Loge, the
                    ruins of which are still existent, and for a time they worked the mines of
                    Bembe. At present, however, they possess no fort or settlement to the north of
                    Ambriz, which was first occupied in 1855. The connection of other European
                    nations with Congo has hitherto been either exploratory or commercial, and
                    nothing more powerful has been established than a “factory” or “comptoir.” In
                    1816 an expedition was despatched from England under the command of J. K.
                    Tuckey, R.N., for the examination of the Zaire. It reached the river on July
                    6th, and managed to push up stream as far as Sangala, the highest rapid; but
                    sickness broke out, the commander and several others died, and the expedition
                    had to return. A survey of the first twenty-five, miles of the river was
                    effected in 1826 by the “Levin” and the “Barracouta,” belonging to Captain
                    Owen’s expedition; and in 1827-29 the Frenchman Douville spent some time in
                    various parts of the country. In 1857 the German explorer, Dr Bastian, passed
                    from Ambriz inland as far as São Salvador; andin the same year Captain Hunt, in
                    the “Alecto,” made an attempt to ascend the river, but only reached the
                    cataracts. Captain Burton attained the same limit in 1863, and also proceeded
                    inland as far as Banza Noki. In 1872 an expedition under Lieutenant Grandy was
                    despatched from England for the purpose of advancing from the west coast to the
                    relief of Livingstone. Ambriz was chosen as the starting point, and Bembe was
                    reached in 11 days, on the 23d of March 1873. The 15th of May found the party at
                    Congo, but they were detained there till June 20th. Passing through Kilembella,
                    Moila, and Tungwa (a place of about 1600 inhabitants), they arrived at Banza
                    Umpala, on a tributary of the Zaire, about 200 miles inland, but were then
                    obliged to retrace their steps to Congo, whence they proceeded to Banza Noki and
                    the main liver, intending to push their way up the stream. The death of
                    Livingstone was soon after reported; and a recall shortly reached them, which
                    brought the expedition to a close. They found the natives “exceedingly timid,
                    superstitious, and suspicious, evidently believing that the foreigners had come
                    to interfere with their trade and country.” In 1875 a German expedition, under
                    Captain von Homeyer, commenced exploratory operations along the Congo for the
                    purpose of preparing the way for German colonization.</p>

                <p>'CONGREGATIONALISM, a designation assumed of late years by the religious
                    denomination formerly known as Independents. This change of name has arisen from
                    no radical alteration in the particular doctrinal or ecclesiastical opinions of
                    that sect (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Independents),</hi> but in order to express
                    more definitely the positive aspects of their church life and organization. The
                    negative term Independent implied chiefly a renunciation “of the authority of
                    pope, prelate, presbytery, prince, or parliament,” and thus brought into
                    prominence the antagonistic position of the churches so named towards National,
                    Episcopal, and Presbyterian Churches. The word Congregational has been now
                    almost universally substituted for it to indicate inore clearly the brotherhood
                    and fellowship maintained in their separate communities, the spiritual equality
                    of every member, the right and the duty of all in the church to have a voice in
                    its deliberations and decisions, the essential necessity for each society to
                    originate its own outward forms of life. As one of the latest exponents of
                    Congregationalism has said,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    on Theological and Ecclesiastical Questions,</hi> p. 371.</p></note> “ "When the
                    restraints of outward law are repudiated, it is necessary to insist with all the
                    greater intensity on making the polity of the church the expression Qf its own
                    highest life. Everything must be subordinated to this. The polity must come from
                    within; it must not be imposed from without; it may recognize outward
                    circumstances but must not be controlled by them. If the organization of the
                    church is to be a vital growth, the life which it is to reveal is the life which
                    the church has received from Christ. Ecclesiastical statesmen have no right to
                    construct various forms of polity to express the spirit and tendencies
                    prevailing among different races of men, in different countries, and in
                    different churches; the polity of the church must be created by the idea of the
                    church.” It is maintained that this conception of a church organization is
                    entirely in harmony with the genius of the New Testament, and is better
                    expressed by the word Congregational than Independent. In this sense it is
                    applicable to other communities, in particular to the Baptists, who sometimes
                    adopt it. Probably another reason for its employment has been the growing
                    tendency towards outward union among churches that were mainly characterized by
                    their isolation from each other. Independency was often regarded as a synonym
                    for non-catholicity, and there was so strict a jealousy against all possible
                    interference from without that close association or united action was
                    exceedingly difficult, even amongst those whose doctrinal beliefs and
                    ecclesiastical polity were the same. An endeavour has been made to overcome such
                    obstacles common to co-operation without destroying or infringing the
                    independence of the individual church, and the Congregationalists now have
                    numerous missionary societies for home and foreign work, an association in every
                    county, and a general Congregational Union for England and Wales. The last was
                    established after much discussion in 1833, when a declaration of faith, church
                    order, and discipline was adopted under these express conditions. “It is not
                    intended that the following statement should be put forth with any authority, or
                    as a standard to which assent should be required. Disallowing the utility of
                    creeds and articles of religion as a bond of union, and protesting against
                    subscription to any human formularies as a term of communion, Congregationalists
                    are yet willing to declare, for general information, what is commonly believed
                    among them, reserving to every one the most perfect liberty of conscience.” In
                    1871 a revision of the constitution of the Union took place, when the
                    “fundamental principle”of its existence ’ was thus re-asserted. “The Union
                    recognizes the right of every individual church to administer its affairs, free
                    from external control, and shall not, in any case, assume legislative authority
                    or become a court of appeal.” The objects it seeks to promote were then also
                    more definitely stated in these words, “to uphold and extend evangelical
                    religion primarily in connection with churches of the Congregational order; to
                    promote Scriptural views of church fellowship and organization; to strengthen
                    the fraternal relations of the Congregational churches, and facilitate
                    co-operation in everything affecting their common interests; to maintain
                    correspondence with the Congregational churches and other Christian communities
                    throughout the world; to obtain statistics relating to Congregational churches
                    at home and abroad.; to assist in procuring perfect religious equality for all
                    British subjects, and in <pb break="no"

                    social condition.” The chairman is elected annually by the vote of the delegates
                    from the churches present at the annual meeting. Unions of a similar character
                    exist in Scotland, Ireland, and the colonies. In 1876 it was computed<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Congregational Year Book,</hi> 1877.</p></note> that the total of
                    Congregational churches and branch churches in Great Britain and the colonies
                    was 3895, with other preaching places, supplied mainly by lay agency, to the
                    number of 1248. The ordained ministers, including the missionaries of the London
                    Missionary Society, were 3205; there were 17 colleges, employing 52 professors
                    and educating 430 students. The expenditure for missions at home and abroad, not
                    calculating the amounts expended by individual churches throughout the world for
                    special local missions, was £147,270. In 1875 the Congregationalists opened
                    their Memorial Hall and Library, which is erected in London on the site of the
                    old Fleet Prison, in commemoration of the heroism and spiritual fidelity of the
                    two thousand clergymen who were ejected “from their homes and livings as
                    ministers of Christ in the Church of England, under the stringent, inhuman, and
                    unjust provisions of the Act of Uniformity.” In that building the various
                    societies of the Congregationalists now hold their meetings.</p>
                <p>Congregationalism in the United States has, from the earliest period of its
                    existence, recognized the principle that each Christian society, though complete
                    in itself, is nevertheless related to all other churches of the same faith and
                    order. The weakness and scattered condition of those little communities which
                    followed the settlement of the Pilgrim Fathers threw them into close
                    association, they assisted each other by friendly advice, and from that sprang
                    the system of councils. These have now become important institutions exercising
                    considerable influence. It is claimed that, though every church is “independent
                    of all outward control,” “a fraternal fellowship is yet to be maintained among
                    these independent churches; and when insoluble difficulties arise, or specially
                    important matters claim decision—as where a pastor is to be settled or
                    dismissed, or a church itself is to adopt its creed and commence its organic
                    life—it is proper that the advice of other churches should be sought and given
                    in council; such action, however, in no case being anything more than a labour
                    of fraternal suasion or self-justification.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    is, and how it works,</hi> 3d ed., Boston, 1871</p></note> Increase Mather says,
                    “It has ever been their declared judgment that, where there is want either of
                    light or peace in a particular ehurch, it is their duty to ask for counsel, with
                    which neighbour churches ought to assist by sending their elders and other
                    messengers to advise and help them in their difficulties; and that in momentous
                    matters of common concernment particular churches should proceed with the
                    concurrence of neighbour churches; so in the ordination of a pastor, much more
                    in the deposing of one. Thus it has ever been in the churches of New England.”
                    Some writers contend that “Congregationalism differs from Independency by its
                    recognition of this practical fellowship between the churches.” The councils
                    thus summoned are dissolved as soon as the business is settled, and should the
                    church to which advice is offered be unwilling to accept and act upon it the
                    other churches may consider the desirability of withdrawing from any further
                    association with it. There are permanent councils in Connecticut, called
                    “consociations,” but they are not general in the States. In some of the county
                    unions of England a committee is appointed annually, to which churches may
                    appeal in any difficulty which they are unable to remove of themselves,—an
                    approach towards the American system. Ac cording to a religious census taken by
                    the Government there were in the United States in 1850, 1725 Congregational
                    churches with 807,335 sittings; these had increased in 1870 to 2887 churches and
                    1,117,212 sittings. For the education of the ministry there are seven
                    theological institutions. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">b.)</hi></p>
