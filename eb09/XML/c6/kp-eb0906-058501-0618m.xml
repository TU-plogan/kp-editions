                <p><label type="entry">CRIMEA</label>, the ancient Tauric Chersonese, called by the
                    Russians by the Tatar name Krym, or Crim, a peninsula in the Black Sea forming
                    part of the Russian government of Taurida, with the mainland of which it is
                    connected by the Isthmus of Perecop, about six miles wide. It is situated
                    between 44° 22' and 46° 10' bΓ. lat. and 32° 30' and 36° 40' E. long.; is
                    rhomboid in form, the angles being directed to the cardinal points; measures 125
                    miles from N. to S. and 200 miles from W. to the E. extremity of the peninsula
                    of Kertch, at the east angle of the quadrilateral; and contains an area of
                    between 9000 and 10,000 English square miles. Its coasts are washed by the Black
                    Sea, except to the north-east, where is the Sivash, “Putrid Sea,” a shallow
                    lagoon connected with the Sea of Azoff by a very narrow opening, and separated
                    from it by a low sandy tongue of land called the Tonga or Arabat Spit.</p>
                <p>Three parts of the Crimea are a continuation of the steppe of South Russia, the
                    remainder on the south and south-east coast consisting of hills and mountains of
                    calcareous rocks that have been disturbed by volcanic agency, and exhibit in
                    various parts diorite, melaphyre, aphrite, diabase, amygdaloid, and diorite
                    porphyry. The volcanic eruptions are more manifest near Cape St George, and at
                    Cape Laspy, Kastropolo, Aloupka, Yalta, and Byouk Lambat, and have formed the
                    eminences at Ayou-dagh, Kastel, Ouragou, and Kara-dagh, and to the south of
                    Sympheropol and Kara-sou-bazar. The mountains rise almost abruptly from the sea
                    to an altitude in some parts of fully 4000 feet, the highest, called by the
                    ancients Trapezus, “the Table Mountain” from the flatness of its summit, and now
                    called by the Tatars Tchadyr-dagh, “Tent Mountain,” being 4800 feet above the
                    level of the sea. Stalactite and stalagmite caverns are numerous, two of the
                    most remarkable being on the Tchadyr-dagh. Criumetopon, the “ram’s head” of
                    Strabo, was at the south part of the range, and may have been Cape Aïa to the
                    east of Balaclava, or the range of cliffs that extends from that promontory to
                    Aïtodor. The coast of the mountainous region is exceedingly picturesque, and
                    numerous vineyards have been formed along its sunny slopes; the soil consists of
                    decomposed rock, the chief component part being slate clay. The mud baths on the
                    sea shore at Saky are celebrated for the relief they afford in cases of
                    rheumatism, paralysis, skin diseases, &amp;c.; there is a hospital for naval and
                    military patients, and a private bathing establishment. In the peninsula of
                    Kertch are clusters of mud volcanoes near the town of Kertch and village of
                    Yeny-Kaleh, where the mud, quite cold and black, bubbles actively but silently
                    out of the earth; it is not utilized.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers are the Salghyr, its tributary the Kara-sou, the Belbeck,
                    Katcha, Alma, and Boulganack. They all rise on the northern slopes of the
                    mountain range; their beds are almost dry in autumn, but they become rapid and
                    dangerous torrents in spring.</p>
                <p>The general climate from the end of March to December is most salubrious and
                    delightful, the heat being moderate and the nights cool and serene; but the
                    summers are irregular, the thermometer sometimes rising to 90° and 100° Fahr, in
                    the shade—the mean annual temperature at Sympheropol being 50°, at Sevastopol
                    55°, and at Yalta 58°. The weather in the steppe and mountainous parts differ,
                    the former being subject to high winds, hailstorms (sometimes destructive),
                    snowstorms, and frost. In summer long droughts prevail, completely parching up
                    the verdure, which in July and August is quite burnt up. In some winters the
                    mountain tops are covered with snow, which continues on the higher summits until
                    May, yet their temperature is moderate. Ice is rarely seen on the south slopes,
                    and snow seldom falls, the winters throughout being mild, though rains are heavy
                    and winds variable. The greater heats, which last from May to September, are
                    endurable owing to sea and land breezes, the prevalent winds being S.E and E.,
                    when the weather is clear and dry; S. and S. W. winds are invariably accompanied
                    with rain. The autumn, particularly in August and September, is unhealthy on the
                    sea-shore of the south coast, fever and ague being prevalent but not dangerous;
                    an altitude, however, of 40 feet or 50 feet is security against attack. Dense
                    fogs occur in March, April, and May, sometimes lasting many hours, but they
                    seldom overspread the land.</p>
                <p>In ancient times the Crimea, the Tauric Chersonese, produced a great quantity of
                    corn, which was exported to various parts of Greece; we read that 2,100,000 <hi
                    rend="italic">medimni</hi> (a medimnus =12 gallons) were sent in one year from
                    Theodosia to Athens by Leucon, king of the Bosphorus (393-353 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). The population is now in some measure supplied with
                    com from Russia, the drought that has prevailed for many years preventing the
                    district from being a grain-producing country; but where the land is capable of
                    irrigation it is grown, and there is rich pasturage; much good land, however,
                    remains uncultivated from a dearth of manual labour. The grains sown are wheat,
                    barley, oats, rye, maize, millet, and peas; flax and tobacco are also planted.
                    The vine overspreads the declivities of the south coast, from the valley of the
                    Boulganack to Aloushta, and again at <pb break="no"

                    annually about 3,050,000 gallons of wine, sold new at 4s. 10d. to 5s. 6d. the
                    <hi rend="italic">vedro</hi> (2 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 86 gallons). A
                    small proportion is exported. Orchards are interspersed with the vineyards, but
                    the best apples are the produce of the valleys of the Alma, Belbeck, Katcha, and
                    Salghyr, the estimated value of the supply sent yearly into Russia being
                    £150,000. The more common indigenous trees and shrubs are the Tauric pine,
                    juniper, yew, oak, beech, which is abundant and attains a large size, elm, wych
                    elm, maple, ash, poplar, and fir; the last grows well on the highlands and on
                    the south slopes, where it reaches a great height; the Babylonian willow and
                    tamarind grow thickly by the side of streams; there is also the hide sumach <hi
                    rend="italic">(Rhus</hi><hi rend="italic">coriaria),</hi> hawthorn,
                    honey-suckle, barbariss, and the dog-rose, which becomes quite a tree, bearing
                    white, pink, and yellow blossoms. The wild fruitbearing trees are the mountain
                    ash, <hi rend="italic">kyzyl,</hi> a small red plum, the apple, pear, and vine;
                    it is said, that the wild olive is occasionally to be found. In the gardens of
                    the south coast large numbers of plants have been acclimatized, and trees of all
                    kinds grow to perfection, especially the cypress and magnolia. Wild flowers,
                    such as the white and violet crocus and sweet-scented violet, appear as early as
                    February, lilies of the valley and white and sweet peas being plentiful in May,
                    and in summer the woods are filled with peonies, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asphodelus</hi><hi rend="italic">taurica,</hi> veronica, geranium, and orchids.
                    In the highlands the vegetation is always vigorous. In July they are covered
                    with <hi rend="italic">Thymus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sideritis,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Galium,</hi><hi rend="italic">Myosotis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    cultivated the following fruits :—melons, <hi rend="italic">karpouz,</hi>
                    “water-melon,” large, of excellent flavour, and greatly consumed; strawberries,
                    gooseberries, raspberries, and currants; pomegranates, pears, figs, plums,
                    peaches, apricots, cherries, mulberries, quinces, walnuts, almonds, hazel-nuts,
                    and chesnuts; also many sorts of vegetables.</p>
                <p>Wolves, foxes, weazels, and hares are about the steppe and in the mountains,
                    where are also the Persian and roe deer; while the steppe is infested with the

                    forests of Tchadyr-dagh are preserved for the crown, but permission to shoot,
                    from June 29 (July 11), may be obtained. Domesticated animals include
                    double-humped camels, buffaloes, beeves, and several kinds of sheep, one sort
                    being distinguished by short curly hair of a bluish-grey colour; the merino
                    sheep was introduced in 1804, and the breed is well maintained. The horses are
                    small, hardy, and intelligent, but uncouth in appearance. The birds consist of
                    eagles, vultures, hawks, ospreys, storks, herons, and some other birds of prey;
                    partridges, which on the steppe are strong on the wing by the end of July; the
                    ordinary, double, and jack snipe, quails, pigeons, bustards, swans, geese,
                    bitterns, and wildfowl of every description, especially on the Sivash and
                    north-west coast; also crows, owls, thrushes, blackbirds, king-fishers, &amp;c.
                    Serpents that are harmless, lizards, and frogs are abundant. The scorpion,
                    mentioned by Pallas, is now very rare, but tarantula spiders and scolopendra,
                    both noxious, frequently make their appearance in dwellings. Caterpillars and
                    the mole cricket <hi rend="italic">(Gryllo</hi><hi rend="italic">Valpa
                    vulgaris)</hi> are very destructive in gardens. Bees are abundant, and produce
                    excellent honey and a great deal of wax. In the rivers are taken trout, roach,
                    dace, and cray-fish, and at their estuaries the sturgeon is sometimes found, and
                    the salmon is speared. A great variety of fish haunt the coast, such as red and
                    grey mullet, herring, mackerel, turbot, soles (at Eupatoria), plaice, whiting,
                    bream, haddock, pilchard, <hi rend="italic">soudak</hi> (the pike perch),
                    whitebait, eels, and a variety of shell-fish, crabs, &amp;c., but no lobsters.
                    ∙</p>
                <p>The Tatar population, the largest in the peninsula, amounted in 1874 to 127,682,
                    according to the census taken a few months after the promulgation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">oukaz</hi> on the new system of general conscription, in which the
                    Tatars were included. There are also Russians, Armenians, Gypsies, Greeks, Jews,
                    and some Germans. The Nogai of the steppe h¾ve long since disappeared as
                    natives, and are replaced by Tatars of almost pure Turkish descent, and speaking
                    a language closely assimilating the Turkish. The Tatars on the south coast are a
                    mixed race, largely alloyed with Greek, Italian, and Ottoman blood, and greatly
                    despised by the former; but all are Mahometans, and strict observers of the
                    Koran. The Tatars are extremely indolent, and never think of learning a trade;
                    they busy themselves about their fields and gardens from the end of May to about
                    the third week in August, but remain quite idle throughout the rest of the year.
                    They are most hospitable to strangers, every Tatar of means keeping an <hi
                    rend="italic">ôda,</hi> or house of call for travellers, the first duty of a
                    Tatar being the exercise of hospitality, on which he prides himself. Their
                    cottages are constructed, when possible, on the slopes of rising ground, the
                    rock forming the back of the habitation, which is usually whitewashed and kept
                    scrupulously clean, ensconced by fruit trees and verdure. The Tatars are very
                    abstemious, drinking milk and <hi rend="italic">bouza,</hi> a fermented liquor
                    made of millet; <hi rend="italic">koumyss,</hi> “mare’s milk,” is much employed
                    by them medicinally. The men wear baggy trowsers, a short embroidered jacket,
                    and a cap of lamb skin; the women colour their nails, eyebrows, and frequently
                    their hair, made up into numerous thin plaits, with <hi rend="italic">kna,</hi>
                    a mineral dye, and wear loose trowsers tightened at the ancles, a loose coat,
                    and a red cap ornamented with numerous coins; they tie a kerchief round the
                    waist, the opposite corners hanging down behind. The females, more especially on
                    the south coast, have quite given up wearing the <hi rend="italic">yashmak,
                    “</hi> veil,” since the occupation of the country by the allies in 1854-56. The
                    <hi rend="italic">mourzas,</hi> “nobles,” live in retirement, shunning
                    intercourse with Christians, but their women are not kept in seclusion , every
                    village has its <hi rend="italic">molla,</hi> who is also the “elder,” and
                    responsible to the authorities. The Armenians and Greeks hold the trade, as do
                    also the Jews who are Karaims, “readers” of the Holy Scriptures, adhering
                    strictly to the text of the Old Testament, and rejecting all oral traditions and
                    rabbinical writings, keeping themselves quite apart from the Talmudists, to whom
                    they are most odious. There are about 5000 Karaims in the peninsula. Russians
                    and Germans are chiefly engaged in agriculture, while the gypsies are the
                    artificers. The Russian language is very general throughout the peninsula.</p>
                <p>Sympheropol, the chief town and seat of government (population, 17,000), is
                    situated on the Salghyr, where was Ak-mesjyd, the second capital of the khanate.
                    Like all Russian towns, it has fine broad streets at right angles to each other,
                    and the usual whitewashed churches with green domes. Baghtchasarai and
                    Kara-sou-bazar were given up by Catherine II. to the exclusive occupation of the
                    Tatars, and have remained purely Oriental towns. Baghtchasarai, “garden palace,”
                    was the capital of the khans after the destruction of Solkhat, now Esky-Crim;
                    their palace is preserved to this day. Kertch, at the east end of the peninsula,
                    is a fairly thriving port of transit for produce from ports in the Sea of Azoff,
                    and imports into Russia of cattle and horses from the plains of the Kouban and
                    of Circassia. It is a military station of some importance, the entrance to the
                    straits of Kertch, or Yeny-Kaleh, the ancient Cimmerian Bosphorus, being
                    protected by the formidable Pavlovsky fortress, a combination of masked
                    batteries and covered ways over an extent of two miles., Theodosia, formerly
                    Caffa, where a small export and import trade is carried on, thrives as a
                    favourite watering-place. Sevastopol, in the superb harbour that bears its name,

                    1855. Eupatoria, formerly Khezlevé and Kozloff, is the great emporium for salt,
                    and during Turkish occupation was the principal port in the Crimea; its
                    inhabitants are chiefly Karaims, who have here a “spiritual institution” under

                    land-locked harbour to the east of Sevastopol, remarkable as being occupied by
                    the British during the war. Yalta is a small but fashionable watering-place on
                    the south coast, with excellent hotels and many inducements to visitors, the
                    season lasting from May to September. Near Yalta is Livadia, the residence of
                    the empress, and other imperial properties.</p>
                <p>The most valuable commercial production is salt, of which the yearly supply is
                    15,000,000 <hi rend="italic">pouds</hi> (apoud = 36 B&gt; English). Salt
                    entering Russia is excised at 30 copecks (9d.) per poud, and the entire revenue
                    to the Government from the salt-lakes in the Crimea is estimated at £1,785,714.
                    There are no manufactures, but the principal articles çf export are wine, <hi
                    rend="italic">feil</hi> (f.e., fuller’s earth), honey, wax, hides, lambskins,
                    and wool. A reddish marble from quarries near Tchadyr-dagh is exported in small
                    quantities. Communications in the peninsula are maintained by excellent
                    post-roads and bridle-paths; and a railroad which connects Sevastopol,
                    Baghtchasarai, and Sympheropol with the south of Russia was opened for traffic
                    in January 1875.</p>
                <p>The earliest known inhabitants of the Crimea were the Cimmerians, who were driven
                    out by the Scythians about 680-631 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and fled into
                    Asia Minor, leaving only a remnant, who took refuge in the mountains and were
                    afterwards known as the Tauri. These appear to have been a savage people, from
                    the fact that all strangers that landed, or were cast on their coast, were
                    sacrificed to the virgin goddess Iphigenia, afterwards apparently identified
                    with a goddess of their own mythology by the Grecians, who named the country the
                    Tauric peninsula after their predecessors, whence the Russian name Taurida. The
                    numerous crypts existing about the rocky heights were in all probability the
                    troglodyte caves of the Tauri; in some parts they were converted into hermitages
                    and retreats by the Greeks during Byzantine occupation, and were again so
                    utilized by their successors in the last century; these caves are to be seen at
                    Ak-Kaya, Tepe-Kerman, Katch-Kalen, Tcherkess-Kerman, Mangoup, Mangoush,
                    Tchyfout-Kaleh, Inkerman, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the year 658 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Heracleotes crossed the Axine,
                    as the Black sea was then called, and founded a colony near where is now
                    Sevastopol, the territory they occupied becoming known as the Heracleotic
                    Chersonese, to distinguish it from the Tauric Chersonese. The city of
                    Chersonesus flourished under its own free institutions during the space of 1000
                    years, and even longer, though it became a dependency of the Eastern empire; it
                    was taken in 988 by the Russian grand-prince Vladimir, who there received
                    baptism, and was completely destroyed in 1363, by Olgerd, grand prince of
                    Lithuania. In the 7th century B.C., other Grecians, the Milesians, settled at
                    Theodosia, and later at Nymphaeum and Panticapaeum (Kertch), which last city
                    became their metropolis under the authority of an archon, and afterwards of a
                    king, whose dominion, the kingdom of the Bosphorus, included Phanagoria on the
                    eastern shore of the Cimmerian Bosphorus, a city founded with others at the same
                    time as Panticapaeum, and the emporium of the people on the Asiatic shores of
                    the strait. Parisades, sovereign in 115 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> being
                    hard pressed by the Scythians, voluntarily ceded his dominion to Mithridates,
                    king of the Pontus, whose son Pharnaces, after his own downfall, was permitted
                    by Rome to assume the sovereignty of the Bosphorus, a sovereignty that continued
                    until a late period under the protection of the Roman empire. The peninsula was
                    overrun successively by the Alans (62 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> the
                    Goths, whose descendants, peaceably employed in agriculture, remained until the
                    early part of the !4th century, the Huns in 376, the Khozars in the 8th century,
                    expelled by the Byzantines in 1016, and the Kiptchaks, who possessed themselves,
                    about 1050, of Khazary, by which name the peninsula was called, after the
                    Khozars, they being in their turn expelled by the Mongols, about 1237.
                    Penticapaeum, or Cerchio (Kertch), was for a time (1343), occupied by the
                    Venetians, their successors being the Genoese, who had established themselves at
                    Caffa (Theodosia) in 1263-67, and to whom the seaboard known as Gothia,
                    extending to Cembalo (Balaclava), was ceded in 1315. Cembalo, Soldaia (Soudak),
                    and Caffa were strongly fortified by them, Caffa being the centre of an
                    extensive Asiatic trade that included Persia, India, and China. The ruins of the
                    Genoese fortifications still remain.</p>
                <p>After the destruction of the Golden Horde by Tamerlane, the Tatars of the Crimea
                    elected, about 1428, a khan for themselves, a descendant through Toktamish of
                    Jinghis Khan, one Hadgy, who assumed the name of Ghyrey, his capital being at
                    Solkhat, now Esky-Crim. This khanate continued independent until the conquest of
                    Crim by Mahomet II. (1475), who made the khan prisoner, and sent the Genoese and
                    other Christians into servitude and slavery. The khans, thenceforth the vassals
                    of the sultans, were at the head of a warlike race, by whom the Russian
                    provinces were being continually devastated until the year 1777, when Suwaroff
                    dispersed the troops of Dyvlett Ghyrey, who fled to the Caucasus, and the
                    usurper Selim Ghyrey ascended the throne under the protection of Catherine II.
                    He was, however, forced to appeal to Russia for succour against revolt amongst
                    his own subjects, and the Crimea was eventually annexed to the Russian empire by
                    order of the empress, August 1, 1783, the treaty for its cession by the Porte
                    being signed January 9, 1784.</p>
                <p>The Crimea was occupied by the allied forces of Great Britain, France, and
                    Sardinia during the Russo-Turkish war of 1853-56. The British and French troops
                    landed near Eupatoria, September 14, 1854, and did not evacuate the peninsula
                    until July 12, 1856, during which period were fought the battles of the Alma,
                    Tchernaya, Balaclava, and Inkerman, and the formidable fortress of Sevastopol
                    was reduced by siege.</p>
