                    1538-1608), of Riccarton, one of the earliest and one of the ablest writers on
                    the law of Scotland, and a poet of some note, was born about the year 1538. It
                    is probable that he was the eldest son of William Craig of Craigfintray, or
                    Craigston, in Aberdeenshire, but beyond the fact that he was in some way related
                    to the Craigfintray family nothing regarding his birth is known with certainty.
                    He is first heard of as a student at St Andrews, where he was entered at St
                    Leonard’s College in <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n575/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0575-0542"/> 1552, and where he took the B.A. degree in
                    1555. From St Andrews he went to France, like most of his countrymen of that day
                    who were destined for the bar, to study the canon and the civil law. He himself
                    makes more than one allusion in his works to what he had learned at Paris, but
                    as the civil law was not at that time publicly taught there, it is more than
                    probable that he attended the lectures of the great civilians of some of the
                    other French schools. He returned to Scotland about 1561, and, after spending
                    some time in acquiring a practical acquaintance with, the forms of court
                    procedure, was admitted advocate in February 1563. In 1564 he was appointed
                    justice-depute by the justicegeneral, Archibald, earl of Argyll; and in this
                    capacity he presided at many of the criminal trials of the period. He is not
                    mentioned as deputy of the justice-general after 1573; and in the course of the
                    following year he appears as sheriff of Edinburgh, so that he probably resigned
                    the one office on being nominated to the other. In 1606 he is described as
                    procurator for the church; and this completes the list of his regular
                    preferments, although his name is found in more than one commission of
                    importance. He never became a Lord of Session, a circumstance that was
                    unquestionably due to his own choice. His extensive practice, added to the
                    emoluments of his various offices, no doubt, much exceeded what he would have
                    had as a judge; but in truth he probably felt that his studious and retiring
                    disposition unfitted him for the rough work, diplomatic and military as well as
                    judicial, that was in those days expected of a Scotch judge. In this respect he
                    presents a striking contrast to his contemporary Balfour, who was implicated in
                    every conspiracy of his time, and to whom no office, judicial, ecclesiastical,
                    or military, came amiss. Craig even, it is said, refused the honour of
                    knighthood which the king wished to confer on him in 1604, when he came to
                    London as one of the Scottish commissioners regarding the union between the
                    kingdoms—the only political object he seems to have cared about; but in
                    accordance with James’s commands he has always been styled and reputed a knight.
                    Craig was married to Helen, daughter of Heriot of Trabroun in Haddingtonshire,
                    by whom he had four sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Sir Lewis Craig,
                    was raised to the bench in 1604, and among his other descendants are several
                    well-known names in the list of Scotch lawyers. He died on the 26th February
                    1608.</p>
                <p>The greatest of Craig’s literary labours is his treatise on the feudal law. The
                    object of the <hi rend="italic">Jus</hi><hi rend="italic">Feudale</hi> was to
                    assimilate the laws of England and Scotland, but instead of this, it is the
                    first, and by no means the least, in the series of works which has built up and
                    solidified that of Scotland into a separate system. Craig’s anxiety to promote
                    the union of the kingdoms led him to prepare two other elaborate treatises,—the
                        <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Unione Regnorum
                        Britannice</hi><hi rend="italic">Tradatus</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                        i</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">De Jure</hi><hi rend="italic">Successionis
                        Regni</hi><hi rend="italic">Anglioe.</hi> But while he was alive to the
                    benefits of union, his <hi rend="italic">De Hominio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Disputatio,</hi> in which he combats the assertion that Scotland was a fief
                    of the English crown, shows that he was no less determined to maintain the
                    historical independence of his country. Craig’s first poem appeared in 1565. It
                    is an <hi rend="italic">Epithalamium</hi> in honour of the ill-fated marriage of
                    the Queen and Darnley. It contains passages of real poetic feeling, but as a
                    whole it is laboured and heavy; and this fault, as perhaps might be expected of
                    a learned feudal lawyer, more or less disfigures all Craig’s subsequent
                    efforts.</p>
                <p>..,⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> ce</hi> Pt h⅛ poems, none of Craig’s works appeared
                    during his lifetime, and some of them exist even now only in manuscript. 1 ne
                    first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Jus</hi><hi rend="italic">Feudale</hi>
                    was not published until 1655, nearly fifty years after its author’s death. It
                    was edited by Robert Burnet of Crimond, afterwards a judge in the Court of
                    Session, who had married Craig’s granddaughter, and was the father of the famous
                    bishop of Salisbury. A second edition, edited by Menckenius, was published at
                    Leipsic, in 1716; while the last and best edition appeared at Edinburgh in 1732,
                    with a short life by the editor, James Baillie. Manuscripts of the <hi
                        rend="italic">De Jure</hi><hi rend="italic">Successionis</hi> belong to the
                    Advocates’ Library and to the Edinburgh University Library, but the book itself
                    has never been published. A translation of it by James Gatherer, afterwards a
                    Scotch bishop, appeared in 1703. The <hi rend="italic">De Unione</hi> exists
                    only in manuscript, in the Advocates’ Library; and the same is true of the <hi
                        rend="italic">De Hominio,</hi> although a translation of it, under the title
                        <hi rend="italic">Scotland's Sovereignty asserted,</hi> was published by
                    George Ridpath, London, 1695. Most of the poems have been reprinted in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Delitiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetarum Scotorum.</hi> There
                    is an excellent life of Craig by Mr Fraser Tytler, Edinburgh, 1823.</p>
