                <p>According to Van Beneden, R. Leuckart, and some others, the Sponges also have
                    their place among Caelentera,-— a view which has of late years received much
                    support in consequence of the profounder study of the calcarious<note

                    by Miklucho-Maclay and diligently followed up by Haeckel. There is much to be
                    said in favour of regarding the sponges as an aberrant (and, at the same time,
                    degraded) coelenterate class, but, for the present, it will be well to treat
                    them as a group apart.</p>
                <p>It is usual to consider the Caelentera (with or without the sponges) as a primary
                    group, or sub-kingdom, of animals; and a high authority has stated that the
                    institution of this group has been the greatest improvement in the arrangement
                    of the animal kingdom effected since the time of Cuvier. But, should we so
                    interpret the results of certain recent embryological inquiries as to throw the
                    Caelentera into one great division along with all the higher invertebrates, such
                    a mode of treatment would reduce Caelentera to the rank of a province.</p>

                    given the same name to a very different group of animals. He denotes by it the
                    majority of the nematoid worms, placing in a separate section (Amorphocaela)
                    Gordius and its allies, whose alimentary canal is more or less atrophied. In
                    this sense Caelentera is nearly equivalent to Caelelminthes of Cuvier.</p>

                    to add, however, that the Caelentera are invariably destitute of cavities
                    comparable (morphologically) to the blood vessels, perivisceral spaces, and
                    other serous passages of the higher animals. Such cavities, hitherto usually
                    overlooked, undoubtedly exist in some cases, as appears from the investigations

                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Almost the only comprehensive
                    details on this subject which we possess are contained in the Russian memoir by
                    Kowalewsky, already referred to.</p></note> Inner and outer layers of epithelial
                    tissue, splinted by connective tissue (in close relation with which we usually
                    find muscular fibres), are always developed.</p>
                <p>Neither the absence of nervous tissues nor the presence of those curious
                    microscopic organs known as thread-cells can henceforth be enumerated among the
                    characters common to and distinctive of Caelentera. Though a nervous system
                    .remains to be discovered in many, it certainly exists in some; and in yet other
                    cases, where anatomical evidence is wanting, its presence may reasonably be
                    conjectured from purely physiological data.</p>
                <p>Most, if not all, Caelentera have thread-cells; but these exist likewise in other
                    organisms, notably in certain mollusks which were formerly supposed to derive
                    them from the coelenterate animals on which they preyed.</p>
                <p>The plant-like aspect of many Caelentera arises in two ways. In the simple (not
                    compound) coelenterates, such as most sea-anemones, the tentacles or prehensile
                    appendages are so arranged as to simulate, when not too closely inspected, the
                    petals of ordinary flowers (particularly flowers with numerous narrow petals,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Mesembryanthe-rnum) or the strap-shaped corollas of
                    composite plants, like dahlias. In the compound species buds and branches are
                    formed, marking changes in direction of growth; and hence those wonderful
                    phytoid aggregates which for so many centuries puzzled naturalists.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Affinities.—</hi> The nearest relations of Caelentera are
                    undoubtedly the Echinoderms, whose remarkable vascular system is developed from
                    one or more rudiments primarily formed as diverticula of the alimentary canal.
                    The Caelentera exhibit, even more perfectly than the echinoderms, a radiated
                    arrangement of their parts, and, to a lesser degree, have this primitive
                    disposition controlled by a superinduced bilateral symmetry. On the other hand
                    the affinities of coelenterates to worms, save through the echinoderms, are very
                    obscure.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the mutual

                <p>Of animals inferior to the Caelentera in complexity of structure their nearest
                    reputed allies are the Infusoria. We are not yet able, however, to demonstrate
                    the existence of any relationship of this kind, in spite of all that has been
                    urged in its favour by Claparède, Greef, and other eminent anatomists. <hi
