                    law, or a complete and exclusive statement of some portion of the law. Such, at
                    least, is the sense in which the word is used when it is proposed to recast the
                    laws of a country like England in the form of a code. Many collections of laws,
                    however, which are commonly known as codes, would not correspond to this
                    definition. The Code of Justinian, the most celebrated of all, is not in itself
                    a complete and exclusive system of law. It is a collection of imperial
                    constitutions, just as the Pandects are a collection of the opinions of
                    jurisconsults. The Code and the Pandects together being, as Austin says,
                    “digests of Roman law in force at the time of their conception,” would, if
                    properly arranged, constitute a code. Codification in this sense is merely a
                    question of the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of the laws, and has nothing to do
                    with their goodness or badness from an ethical or political point of view.
                    Sometimes codification only means the changing of unwritten into written law; in
                    the stricter sense it means the changing of unwritten or badly written law into
                    law well written.</p>

                    state had the force of law. The practice of collecting the constitutions of the
                    emperors seems to have been begun by private lawyers—such at all events is the
                    character of the oldest collection, known as the <hi rend="italic">Codex
                    Gregorianus</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Hermogenianus,</hi>
                    which formed the model for the imperial codes of Theodosius and Justinian. The
                    Theodosian code was the work of a commission of sixteen, to whom, in 435 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the emperor intrusted the task of collecting the
                    edicts and constitutions from the time of Constantine. It was finished in 438,
                    and promulgated as the law of the empire.</p>
                <p>In 528 the Emperor Justinian ordered a new collection to be made, and appointed a
                    commission of ten for that purpose, including the celebrated Tribonian. The
                    commissioners were to compile one code out of the “three codes— Gregorian,
                    Hermogenian, and Theodosian,” and the constitutions which had been ordained
                    since the last of these was confirmed. The commissioners had full power to make
                    such changes as might be necessary in the language of the constitutions, and to
                    omit all that was unnecessary, obsolete, or inconsistent. The collection was to
                    include rescripts as well as constitutions, and was to supersede (as the
                    Theodosian code also did) the sources from which it had been compiled. The code
                    was finished within fourteen months, but a revised edition was rendered
                    necessary by some new decisions and constitutions of the emperor. In 534 the new
                    code was published and the first edition superseded. The second is the Code we
                    now possess; the first has been lost. The Code is divided into twelve books, and
                    each book into titles, under which the constitutions are arranged in
                    chronological order, and with the names of the emperors by whom they were
                    enacted. There is a general correspondence between the order of the Digest and
                    the Code of Justinian, but neither the Digest nor any of the codes pretended to
                    scientific classification. The arrangement was dictated by the order of writers
                    on the Praetorian Edict.</p>
                <p>The same causes which made these collections necessary in the time of Justinian
                    have led to similar undertakings among modern peoples. The actual condition of
                    laws until the period when they are consciously remodelled is one of confusion,
                    contradiction, repetition, and disorder; and to these evils the progress of
                    society adds the burden of perpetually increasing legislation. Some attempt must
                    be made to simplify the task of learning the laws by improving their expression
                    and arrangement. This is by no means an easy task in any country, but in our own
                    it is surrounded with peculiar difficulties. The independent character of
                    English law has prevented us from attempting what has already been done for
                    other systems which have the basis of the Roman law to fall back upon.</p>
                <p>The most celebrated modern code is the <hi rend="italic">Code Napoleon.</hi> The
                    necessity of a code in France was mainly caused by the immense number of
                    separate systems of jurisprudence existing in that country before 1789,
                    justifying Voltaire’s sarcasm that a traveller in France had to change laws
                    about as often as he changed horses. The conception of a general code for the
                    whole country had occurred to jurists and statesmen before Napoleon, and the
                    Convention, in fact, discussed two projects presented by Cambacérès, one of
                    which had been found too complicated and the other too condensed. Napoleon, on
                    becoming consul, appointed a commission headed by Μ. Tronchet to review previous
                    efforts and present a new project. In four months the project was presented to
                    the Government, submitted to the judges, and discussed by the Council of
                    State—Napoleon himself taking part in the deliberations. At first published
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Code Civil</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Français</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it was afterwards entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Code Napoleon,—</hi> the emperor wishing to attach his name to a
                    work which he regarded as the greatest glory of his reign. The Code Napoléon
                    consists of 2281 articles, arranged under titles and divided into three books,
                    preceded by a preliminary title. The subjects of the different books are—lst,
                    “Des personnes”; 2d, “Des biens et des différents modifications de la
                    propriété;” 3d, “Des différents manières d’acquérir la propriété.” The code, it
                    has been said, is the product of Roman and customary law, together with the
                    ordinances of the kings and the laws of the Revolution. In form it has passed
                    through several changes caused by the political vicissitudes of the country, and
                    it has of course suffered from time to time important alterations in substance,
                    but it still remains virtually the same in principle as it left the hands of its
                    framers. The code has produced a vast number of commentaries, among which may be
                    named those of Duran ton, Troplong, and Demolombe. The remaining French codes
                    are the <hi rend="italic">Code de procedure civile,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Code de commerce,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Code</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d'instruction criminelle,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Code</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">pénal.</hi> The merits of the French code have entered into the
                    discussion on the general question of codification. Austin agrees with Savigny
                    in condemning the ignorance and haste with which it was compiled. “It contains,”
                    says Austin, “no definitions of technical terms (even the most leading), no
                    exposition of the <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi> of distinctions (even the
                    most leading), no exposition of the broad principles and rules to which the
                    narrower provisions expressed in the code are subordinate; hence its fallacious
                    brevity.” The French coc.es have, however, taken firm root in most of the
                    countries of continental Europe. Introduced by French conquest they nevertheless
                    were eagerly adopted by the people after the French arms had withdrawn. The
                    Penal Code, for example, was thus established in Italy, Sicily, Holland,
                    Belgium, the Rhine Provinces, Poland, and Switzerland. The principles of the
                    French code prevail in most of the Latin races.</p>
                <p>The Prussian code <hi rend="italic">(Code FrédériP)</hi> was published by
                    Frederick the Great in 1751. It was intended to take the place of “Roman, common
                    Saxon, and other foreign subsidiary laws and statutes,” the provincial laws
                    remaining in force as before. One of the objects of the king was to destroy the
                    power of the advocates, whom he hoped to render useless. The Italian civil code,
                    published in 1866, on the establishment of Italian unity, is founded mainly on
                    the French code. The object of all these codes was to frame a common system to
                    take the place of several systems of law, rather than to restate in an exact and
                    exhaustive form the whole laws of a nation, which is the problem of English
                    codification. The French and Prussian codes, although they have been of great
                    service in simplifying the law, have failed to prevent outside themselves that
                    accumulation of judiciary and statute law which in England has been the chief
                    motive for codification. A more exact parallel to the English problem may be
                    found in the <hi rend="italic">Code of the State of New York.</hi> The revised
                    constitution of the State, as adopted in 1846, “ordered the appointment of two
                    commissions, one to reduce into a written and a systematic code the whole body
                    of the law of the State, and the other to revise, reform, simplify, and abridge
                    the rules and practice, pleadings, &amp;c., of the courts of record.” By an Act
                    of 1837, the State Legislature declared that the body of substantive law should
                    be contained in three codes—the Political, the Civil, and the Penal. The works
                    of both commissions, completed in 1865, now fills six volumes, containing the
                    Code of Civil Procedure (including the law of evidence), the Book of Forms, the
                    Code of Criminal Procedure, the Political Code, the Penal Code, and the Civil
                    Code. In the introduction to the Civil Code it is claimed that in many
                    departments of the law the codes have “provided for every possible case, so that
                    when a new case arises it is better that it should be provided for by new
                    legislation.” The New York code is defective in tho <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0125-0106"/> important points of definition and arrangement.
                    Much interest has attached to the Penal Code drawn up by Edward Livingston for
                    tho State of Louisiana, about 50 years ago. The system consists of a Code of
                    Crime and Punishments, a Code of Procedure, a Code of Evidence, a Code of Reform
                    and Prison Discipline, and a Book of Definitions. “Though the State for which
                    the codes were prepared,” says Chief·Justice Chase, “neglected to avail itself
                    of the labours assigned and solicited by itself, they have proved, together with
                    their introductions, a treasure of suggestions to which many States are indebted
                    for useful legislation.” A complete edition of Livingston’s works has recently
                    been published by the National Prison Association of the United States.</p>
                <p>Since the time of Bentham, the codification of the law of England has been the
                    dream of our most enlightened jurists and statesmen. In the interval between
                    Bentham and our own time there has been an immense advance in the scientific
                    study of law, but it may be doubted whether the problem of codification is at
                    all nearer solution. Interest has mainly been directed of late to the historical
                    side of legal science, to the phenomena of the evolution of laws as part of the
                    development of society, and from this point of view the question of remodelling
                    the law is one of minor interest. To Bentham the problem presented itself in the
                    simplest and most direct form possible. What he proposed to do was to set forth
                    a body of laws, clearly expressed, arranged in the order of their logical
                    connection, exhibiting their own <hi rend="italic">rationale,</hi> and excluding
                    all other law. On the other hand the problem has in some respects become easier
                    since the time of Bentham. With the Benthamite codification the conception of
                    reform in the substantive law is more or less mixed up. If codification had been
                    possible in his day, it would, unless it had been accompanied by the searching
                    reforms which have been effected since, and mainly through his influence,
                    perhaps have been more of an evil than a good. The mere dread that, under the
                    guise of codification or improvement in form, some change in substance may
                    secretly be effected has long been a practical obstacle in the way of legal
                    reform. But the law has now been brought into a state of which it may be said
                    that, if it is not the best in all respects that might be desired, it is at
                    least in most respects as good as the conditions of legislation will permit it
                    to be. Codification, in fact, may now be treated purely as a question of form.
                    What is proposed is that the law, being, as we assume, in substance what the
                    nation wishes it to be, should be made as accessible as possible, and as
                    intelligible as possible. These two essential conditions of a sound system of
                    law are, we need hardly say, far from being fulfilled in England. The law of the
                    land is embodied in thousands of statutes and tens of thousands of reports. It
                    is expressed in language which has never been fixed by a controlling authority,
                    and which has swayed about with every change of time, place, and circumstance.
                    It has no definitions, no rational distinctions, no connection of parts. Until
                    the passing of the Judicature Act it was pervaded throughout its entire sphere -
                    by the flagrant antinomy of law and equity, and that Act has only ordered, not
                    executed, its consolidation. No lawyer pretends to know more than a fragment of
                    it. Few practical questions can be answered by a lawyer without a search into
                    numberless Acts of Parliament and reported cases. To laymen, of course, the
                    whole law is a sealed book. As there are no authoritative general principles, it
                    happens that the few legal maxims known to the public, being apprehended out of
                    relation to their authorities, are as often likely to be wrong as to be right,
                    It is hopeless to think of making it possible for every man to be his own
                    lawyer, but we can at least try to make it possible for a lawyer to know the
                    whole law. The earlier advocates of codification founded their case mainly on
                    the evils of judiciary law, <hi rend="italic">iae.,</hi> the law contained in
                    the reported decisions of the judges. Bentham’s bitter antipathy to judicial
                    legislation is well known, Austin’s thirty-ninth lecture <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Lectures,</hi> ed, 1869) contains an exhaustive criticism of the tenable
                    objections to judiciary law. All such law is embedded in decisions on particular
                    cases, from which it must be extracted by a tedious and difficult process of
                    induction. Being created for particular cases it is necessarily uncomprehensive,
                    imperfect, uncertain, and bulky, These are evils which are incident to the
                    nature of judiciary laws. Of late years the defective form of our existing
                    statute law has also given rise to loud complaints. Year by year the mass of
                    legislation grows larger, and as long as the basis of a system is judiciary law,
                    it is impossible that the new statutes can be completely integrated therewith.
                    The prevailing mode of framing Acts of Parliament, and especially the practice
                    of legislating by reference to previous Acts, likewise produce much uncertainty
                    and disorder.</p>
                <p>Whether any attempt will ever be made to supersede this vast and unarranged mass
                    by a complete code seems very doubtful. Writers on codification have for the
                    most part insisted that the work should be undertaken as a whole, and that the
                    parts should have relation to some general scheme of the law which should be
                    settled first. The practical difficulties in the way of an undertaking so
                    stupendous as the codification <hi rend="italic">uno caetu</hi> of the whole
                    mass of the law hardly require to be stated. The probability is that attempts
                    will be made from time to time to cast the leading portions of the law into the
                    form of a code. Some years ago it was believed that the proper preliminary to a
                    code would be a digest of the law, and a commission was appointed in 1866, under
                    which draughtsmen were set to work to prepare specimen digests of three selected
                    portions of law. The attempt was abandoned in 1872, the commissioners being of
                    opinion that it could not be properly proceeded with in detail, and they
                    recommended that a general digest should be undertaken.</p>
                <p>In discussions on codification two difficulties are insisted on by its opponents,
                    which have some practical interest— (1) What is to be done in those cases for
                    which the code has not provided 1 and (2) How is new law to be incorporated with
                    the code 1 The objection that a code will hamper the opinions of the court,
                    destroy the flexibility and elasticity of the common law, &lt;fcc., disappears
                    when it is stated in the form of a proposition, that law codified will cover a
                    smaller number of cases, or will be less easily adapted to new cases, than law
                    uncodified. The <hi rend="italic">Code Napoleon</hi> orders the judges, under a
                    penalty, to give a decision on all cases, whether contemplated or not by the
                    code, and refer them generally to the following sources :—(1 ) Equité naturelle,
                    loi naturelle; (2) Roman law; (3) ancient customs; (4) usages, examples,
                    decisions, jurisprudence; (5) droit commun; (6) principes généraux, maximes,
                    doctrine, science, The Prussian code, on the other hand, requires the judges to
                    report new cases to the head of the judicial department, and they are decided by
                    the legislative commission. No provision was made in either case for
                    incorporating the new law with the code, an omission which Austin justly
                    considers fatal to the usefulness of codification. It is absurd to suppose that
                    any code can remain long without requiring substantial arbitration. Cases will
                    arise when its meaning must be extended and modified by judges, and every year
                    will produce its quota of new legislation by the state. The courts should be
                    left to interpret a code as they now interpret statutes, and provision should be
                    made for the continual revision of the code, so that the new law created by
                    judges or directly by the state may from time to time be worked into the code.

                    those who have had some experience of its working. The first of the Indian codes
                    was the Penal Code drawn up by Macaulay, and presented to the Governor-general
                    in 1837. It did not become law, however, till 1860. It has been highly praised,
                    and its merit is the more remarkable as Macaulay had only a slight professional
                    acquaintance with the law before he went to India. A code of Civil Procedure
                    became law in 1759, and was followed by a code of Penal Procedure in 1861. The
                    substantial law was then undertaken which published its first instalment in
                    1865. The use of illustrations is a peculiar feature of the Indian code. <hi
