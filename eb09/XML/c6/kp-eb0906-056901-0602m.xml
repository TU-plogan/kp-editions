                <p><label type="entry">CRETE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Candia</hi></label>, one of
                    the largest islands in the Mediterranean, situated between 34° 50' and 35° 40'
                    N. lat., and between 23° 30' and 26° 20' E. long. It is thus the most southerly
                    portion of Europe. By its position south of the AEgean Sea or Archipelago,
                    extending to the north-west to within 60 miles of Cape Malea in the
                    Peloponnesus, while its north-east angle is distant only about 110 miles from
                    Cape Krio in Asia Minor (a great part of which interval is filled up by the
                    large islands of Carpathus and Rhodes), it forms the natural limit between the
                    Archipelago and the Mediterranean, as well as one of the chief lines of natural
                    connection between the southern shores of Europe and Asia. The island is of a
                    very elongated form, being not less than 160 miles in length, while its breadth
                    does not anywhere exceed thirty-five miles, and is in some places narrowed to
                    only ten or twelve miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mountains.—By</hi> far the greater part of the surface of the
                    island is occupied by ranges of mountains, some of which attain to a very
                    considerable height. Nearly in the centre of the island rises the lofty group,
                    or rather mass, of Mount Ida, now called Psiloriti (a corruption of <hi
                    rend="italic">υψηλopεLτlov,</hi> “the high mountain ”), which is not less than
                    8060 feet in height, forming a nearly isolated mass, separated by tracts of
                    comparatively low elevation from the mountain ranges to the east and west of it.
                    In the western portion of the island is found the range of the White Mountains
                    (called by the natives Madara Vouna), the central group of which is nearly if
                    not quite as elevated as Mount Ida, rising to a height of at least 8000 feet,
                    and of considerably greater extent, sending down spurs to the west and
                    north-west, which fill up almost the whole of that portion of the island, while
                    the main mass abuts directly upon the south coast for a space of twenty-five to
                    thirty miles, and is then continued by a ridge of inferior elevation, but still
                    ranging from 5000 to 6000 feet in height, till it sinks into the plain of the
                    Messara nearly due south of Mount Ida, from which it is separated only by the
                    valley of Sulia. The eastern half of the island is less mountainous, and none of
                    the summits attain so great an elevation; but the central group of the Lasethe
                    Mountains rises to the height of 7100 feet, and its summits, like those of Mount
                    Ida and the White Mountains, are covered with snow throughout the greater part
                    of the year. The range of Mount Kophino, which separates the plain of the
                    Messara from the south coast, rises abruptly from the sea to a height of 3750
                    feet, while the subordinate ranges, that fill up the extreme eastern portion of
                    the island, nowhere attain to the elevation of 4000 feet. The isolated peak of
                    Mount Luktas, nearly due south of the city of Candia, though not exceeding 2700
                    feet in height, has attained great celebrity from its being reputed in ancient
                    times to contain the burialplace of Zeus, which continued to be regarded with
                    veneration by the Cretans till after the time of Constantine.</p>
                <p>The intervals between these mountain groups are filled up for the most part by
                    undulating tracts, consisting of hills of Tertiary formation and comparatively
                    low elevation, but still rising occasionally to a height of from 2000 to 3000
                    feet. Such a tract is that which extends across the island from the
                    neighbourhood of Candia to the plain of Messara in the south; and a similar one,
                    though of less extent, between Hierapytna on the south and the Gulf of Mirabella
                    on the north, forms a kind of isthmus not more than seven miles across by which
                    the easternmost portion of Crete is united with the rest of the island. Very few
                    plains of any considerable extent occur. Much the largest of these is that
                    called the plain of Messara, in the south of the island, which extends inland
                    from the sea at the foot of Mount Ida, between the slopes of that mountain and
                    the range of Mount Kophino, which, as already stated, separates it from the sea.
                    It is about thirty-five miles in length, with a breadth of from six to ten
                    miles. The plain which adjoins the city of Canea is of great fertility but of
                    small extent, not exceeding seven or eight miles in width.</p>
                <p>One leading characteristic of the mountain regions of Crete is the occurrence of
                    depressed valleys or basins at a considerable height above the sea, forming
                    crater-like hollows without any outlet for their waters, and containing plains
                    of considerable extent, which afford admirable pasturage in spring and early
                    summer. The most remarkable of these upland basins (which appear to answer
                    precisely to the Yaïlahs of the Lycian Taurus) are that called Nida, on the
                    flanks of Mount Ida, at an elevation of between 5000 and 6000 feet; the more
                    extensive one called Omalo, in the White Mountains, at a height of about 4000
                    feet; and one in the Lasethe Mountains about 3000 feet above the sea, which is
                    the most extensive of the three, and incloses a beautiful plain, containing no
                    less than fifteen villages, with a population of between 3000 and 4000
                    souls.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.</hi> —From its peculiar conformation it naturally
                    results that Crete contains no rivers of any importance. The most considerable
                    stream is that called the Ieropotamo (the ancient Electra), which flows through
                    the plain of the Messara and falls into the sea on the south coast. The
                    Mylopotamo (the ancient Oaxes), which traverses the fertile district north of
                    Mount Ida, is the most important of those on the north coast; while the
                    Platania, a small stream which falls into the sea a few miles west of Canea,
                    deserves notice chiefly as being mentioned by Homer under the name of
                    Iardanus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coast-line.—</hi> The coasts of Crete, in consequence of its
                    mountainous character, present a very broken and varied outline. In the west
                    especially they form a number of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0603-0570"/> rugged and lofty promontories, of which the
                    north-west extremity is the headland now called Cape Bπsa, the ancient Corycus,
                    and the south-west angle is formed by Cape Krió, the Kriu Metopon of ancient
                    geographers. East of Cape Busa the lofty mountain headland of Cape Spada
                    projects more than twelve miles from the general coast-line; and again, beyond
                    Canea, the mountainous peninsula called Λkrotiri bounds the Bay of Sudha, which
                    constitutes a naturally sheltered harbour of sufficient size to afford
                    protection to all the fleets of Europe. The north coast is again deeply
                    indented, in the eastern portion of the island, by the Gulf of Mirabella, beyond
                    which the coast runs out far to the north-east, ending in the narrow and rocky
                    promontory of Cape Sidaro, the Sammonium of the ancients. The south coast is
                    less broken and irregular, and contains few good harbours,—the mountains in many
                    parts rising almost like a wall directly from the sea. There is, however, one
                    small but well-sheltered bay, about five miles east of Cape Littinos, still
                    called Kaloi Limenes, or “the Fair Havens,” under which name it is mentioned in
                    the voyage of St Paul.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Islands.—</hi> The islands which are found around the coasts of
                    Crete are for the most part mere rocks, unworthy notice. The largest is that of
                    Gavdo, the ancient Clauda, which is also mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles,
                    and (probably on that account) became in the Middle Ages the see of a bishop,
                    though it is only about five miles long by three in breadth, and contains at the
                    present day only about seventy families. The small island of Dia, now called
                    Standia, which lies about eight miles north of the city of Candia, has a good
                    port, and in consequence bore an important part during the memorable siege of
                    that city. The isolated rock of Grabusa, off the north-west angle of the island,
                    has obtained celebrity from its having been converted by the Venetians into a
                    fortress, long reputed impregnable, which did not fall into the hands of the
                    Turks until long after the capture of Candia. For the same reason it became a
                    stronghold of the Greeks during the war of independence, and at that period
                    afforded shelter to a considerable population.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetation.</hi> —Though so large a part of Crete is occupied
                    by mountains, the rest of the island is of great fertility, and there can be no
                    doubt that, under a better system of government, it would become one of the
                    richest and most productive islands in the Mediterranean. The forests which once
                    covered the mountains have indeed for the most part disappeared, but the cypress
                    still grows wild in the higher regions, while the lower hills are covered with
                    olive woods. Oranges and lemons also abound, and are of excellent quality, so as
                    to furnish almost the whole supply of continental Greece and Constantinople.
                    Chestnut woods, as in Greece itself, are local and exceptional; the same is the
                    case with the valonia oak; while in some districts the carob tree is so abundant
                    as to form an important article of consumption. Pears, apples, quinces,
                    mulberries, and other fruit-trees flourish in abundance, as well as vines,
                    though the Cretan wines no longer enjoy the reputation which they possessed in
                    the time of the Venetians. Tobacco and cotton succeed well in the plains and low
                    grounds, though not at present cultivated to any great extent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Animals.—</hi> Of the wild animals of Crete, the only one that
                    deserves special notice is the wild goat, which is still found in considerable
                    numbers on the higher summits of Mount Ida and the White Mountains. It is the
                    same species <hi rend="italic">(Capra aegagrus)</hi> which is found in the
                    Caucasus and Mount Taurus, and is distinct from the ibex or bouquetin of the
                    Alps. Crete enjoys the same immunity which is possessed by severaI other large
                    islands from the presence of serpents of all kinds,—a privilege ascribed by
                    popular belief to the intercession of Titus, the companion of St Paul, who
                    according to tradition was the first bishop of the island, and became in
                    consequence its patron saint, previous to its conquest by the Venetians. Wolves
                    also are not found in the island, though so common in Greece and Asia Minor.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The earliest history of Crete, like that of most
                    parts of continental Greece, is to so"great an extent mixed up with mythology
                    and fable as to render it impossible to arrive at any clear conclusions
                    concerning it. The Cretans themselves claimed for their island to be the
                    birthplace of Zeus, as well as the parent of al†the other divinities usually
                    worshipped in Greece as the Olympian deities. But passing from this region of
                    pur.e mythology to the semi-mythic or heroic age, we find almost all the early
                    legends and traditions of the island grouped around the name of Minos, one of
                    those personages of the earliest Greek history of whom it is impossible to say
                    whether any element of truth underlies the mass of mythical and poetical fable
                    by which it has been surrounded. According to the received tradition, Minos was
                    a king of Cnossus in Crete, who was a son of Zeus, and enjoyed through life the
                    privilege of habitual intercourse with his divine father. It was from this
                    source that he derived the wisdom which enabled him to give to the Cretans the
                    excellent system of laws and governments that earned for him the reputation of
                    being the greatest legislator of antiquity. At the same time he was reported to
                    have been the first monarch who established a naval power, and acquired what was
                    termed by the Greeks the <hi rend="italic">Thalassolcraty,</hi> or dominion of
                    the sea.</p>
                <p>Whatever truth there may have been in this last tradition (which was received as
                    an undoubted fact both by Thucydides and by Aristotle), it is certain that when
                    we first hear of the Cretans, in the Homeric poems, they appear as a seafaring
                    race, and apparently the only Greek people who at that early period attempted to
                    compete with the Phoenicians as bold and adventurous navigators. The position of
                    their island was moreover such as to give them great natural facilities for the
                    command of the AEgean and the surrounding islands, as well as for communication
                    with Phoenicia and Egypt.</p>
                <p>Even at the earliest period when we have any information concerning it, the
                    population of Crete was of a very mixed character, and we are told in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (xix. 175) that besides the Eteocretes, who, as their
                    name imports, must have been the original inhabitants, the island contained
                    Achaeans, Pelasgiaus, Dorians, and Cydonians. Subsequently the Dorian element
                    became greatly strengthened by fresh immigrations from the Peloponnesus, and
                    during the historical period all the principal cities of the island were either
                    Dorian colonies, or had adopted the Dorian dialect and institutions. It is
                    certain that at a very early period the Cretan cities were celebrated for their
                    laws and system of government,, the origin of which was of course attributed to
                    Minos, but which had much in common with those of the other Dorian states, as
                    well as with those of Lycurgus at Sparta, which were, indeed, according to one
                    tradition, copied in great measure from those already existing in Crete.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> Among the features common to
                    the two were the <hi rend="italic">syssitia,</hi> or public tables, at which all
                    the citizens dined in common. Indeed, the Cretan system, like, that of Sparta,
                    appears to have aimed at training up the young, and controlling them, as well as
                    the citizens of more mature age, in all their habits and relations of life. Tlìe
                    supreme governing authority was vested in magistrates called ∙ Cosmi, answering
                    in some measure to the Spartan Ephori, but there was nothing corresponding to
                    the two kings at Sparta. These Cretan institutions were much' extolled by some
                    writers of antiquity, but receive only qualified praise from the judicious
                    criticisms of Aristotle <hi rend="italic">(Polit,</hi> ii. 10).</p></note></p>
                <p>It is certain that whatever merits the Cretan laws may have possessed for the

                <p>ferent cities, they had the one glaring defect, that they made no provision for
                    any federal bond or union among them, or for the government of the island as a
                    whole. It was owing to the want of this that the Cretans scarcely figure in
                    Greek history as a people, though the island, as observed by Aristotle, would
                    seem from its natural position calculated to exercise a preponderating influence
                    over Greek affairs. Thus they took no part either in the Persian or the
                    Peloponnesian war, or in any of the subsequent civil contests in which so many
                    of the cities and islands of Greece were engaged. At the same they were so far
                    from enjoying tranquillity on this account that the few notices we find of them
                    in history always represent them as engaged in local wars among one another; and
                    Polybius tells us that the history of Crete was one continued series of civil
                    wars, which were carried on with a bitterness of animosity exceeding all that
                    was known in the rest of Greece.</p>
                <p>In these domestic contests the three cities that generally took the lead, and
                    claimed to exercise a kind of <hi rend="italic">hegemony</hi> or supremacy over
                    the whole island, were Cnossus, Gortyna, and Cydonia. But besides these three,
                    there were many other independent cities, which, though they gene-rιlly followed
                    the lead of one or other of these more powerful rivals, enjoyed complete
                    autonomy, and were able to shift at will from the alliance of one to the other.
                    Among the most important of these were—Lyttus or Lyctus, in the interior,
                    south-east of Cnossus; Rhaucus, between Cnossus and Gortyna; Phaestus, in the
                    plain of Messara, between Gortyna and the sea; Polyrrhenia, near the north-west
                    angle of the island; Aptera, a few miles inland from the Bay of Sudha;
                    Eleutherna and Axus, on the northern slopes of Mount Ida; and Lappa, between the
                    White Mountains and the sea. Phalasarna on the west coast, and Chersonesus on
                    the north, seem to have been dependencies, and served as the ports of
                    Polyrrhenia and Lyttus. Elyrus stood at the foot of the White Mountains, just
                    above the south coast. In the eastern portion of the island were Praesus in the
                    interior, and Itanus on the coast, facing the east, while Hierapytnã on the
                    south coast was the only place of importance on the side facing Africa, and on
                    this account rose under the Romans to be one of the principal cities of the
                    island.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> But besides
                    these there were many small towns, which still enjoyed or claimed the privileges
                    of autonomy. In the earliest times, indeed, Crete was said to have contained a
                    hundred cities, and though this was doubtless a mere poetical exaggeration, the
                    existing remains show that the whole island was studded with numerous fortified
                    strongholds, each of which may at times have asserted its independence. Such
                    petty fortresses were well suited to a people of the predatory habits which
                    distinguished the Cretans in all ages, notwithstanding the boasted excellence of
                    their government. Throughout the flourishing period of Greece, indeed, the
                    Cretans were principally known as furnishing mercenary troops, who were
                    distinguished for their skill in the use of t he bow, so that a force of Cretan
                    archers became almost a necessary addition to every Greek army.</p></note></p>
                <p>Though it was continually torn by civil dissensions, the island maintained its
                    independence of the various Macedonian monarchs by whom it was surrounded; but
                    having incurred the enmity of Rome, first by an alliance with the great
                    Mithridates, and afterwards by taking active part with their neighbours, the
                    pirates of Cilicia, the Cretans were at length attacked by the Roman arms, and,
                    after a resistance protracted for more than three years, were finally subdued by
                    Q. Metellus, who earned by this success the surname of Creticus (67 B.C.). The
                    island was now reduced to a Roman province: but by a very singular arrangement
                    was united for administrative purposes with the district of Cyrenaica or the
                    Pentapolis, on the opposite coast of Africa, a disposition which continued
                    unchanged till the time of Constantine. Thenceforth Crete constituted a separate
                    province under a governor of consular rank, and continued to form part of the
                    Byzantine empire till the 9th century, when it fell into the hands of the
                    Saracens (823). It then became a formidable nest of pirates, but defied all the
                    efforts of the Byzantine sovereigns to recover it till the year 960, when it was
                    reconquered by Nicephorus Phocas. In the partition of the Greek empire after the
                    capture of Constantinople by the Latins in 1204, Crete fell to tìie lot of
                    Boniface, marquis of Montferrat, but was sold by him to the Venetians, and thus
                    passed under the dominion of that great republic, to which it continued subject
                    for more than four centuries.</p>
                <p>Under the Venetian Government Candia, a fortress originally built by the
                    Saracens, and called by them “Khandax,” became the seat of government, and not
                    only rose to be the capital and chief city of the island, but actually gave name
                    to it, so that it was calledin the official language of Venice “the island of
                    Candia,” a designation which from thence passed into modern maps, where it
                    retained its position down to our own days. The ancient name of Krete or Kriti
                    was, however, always retained in use among the Greeks, and is gradually resuming
                    its place in the usage of literary Europe. The government of Crete by the
                    Venetian aristocracy was, like that of their other dependencies, very arbitrary
                    and oppressive, and numerous insurrections were the consequence. But with all
                    its defects their administration did much to promote the material prosperity of
                    the country, and to encourage commerce and industry; and it is probable that the
                    island enjoyed during this period a more prosperous condition than it has done
                    at any subsequent time. Their Venetian masters at least secured to the islanders
                    external tranquillity, and it is singular that the Turks were content to leave
                    them in undisturbed possession of this opulent and important island for nearly
                    two centuries after the fall of Constantinople. It was not till 1645 that the
                    Turks made any serious attempt to effect its conquest; but in that year they
                    landed with an army of 50,000 men, and speedily reduced the important city of
                    Canea. Retimo fell the following year, and in 1648 they laid siege to the
                    capital city of Candia. This was the longest siege on record, having been
                    protracted for more than twenty years; but in 1667 it was pressed with renewed
                    vigour by the Turks under the grand vizier Achmet Kiuprili, and the city was at
                    length compelled to surrender (September 1669). Its fall was followed by the
                    submission of the whole island. (See Daru, <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Venise,</hi> chap, xxxiii.)</p>
                <p>From this time the island continued subject to the Ottoman rule without
                    interruption till the outbreak of the Greek revolution. After the conquest a
                    large part of the inhabitants embraced Mahometanism, and thus secured to
                    themselves the chief share in the administration of the island. But far from
                    this having a favourable effect upon the condition of the population, the result
                    was just the contrary, and according to the testimony of an intelligent
                    traveller, Crete was the worst governed province of the Turkish empire. The
                    regular authorities sent from Constantinople were wholly unable to control the
                    excesses of the janissaries, who exercised withoüt restraint every kind of
                    violence and oppression. Hence, when in 1821 the revolution broke out in
                    continental Greece, the Cretans, headed by the Sfakiot mountaineers, at once
                    raised the standard of insurrection, and carried on hostilities with such
                    success that they soon made themselves masters of the whole of the open country,
                    and drove the Turks and Mahometan population to take refuge in the fortified
                    cities. These, however, defied all the efforts of the insurgents; and the
                    contest was prolonged without any decisive result, until in 1830 the allied
                    powers (France, England, and Russia) who had intervened in the contest between
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n605/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0605-0572"/> Greece and Turkey, transferred the island of
                    Crete to the government of Mehemet Ali, viceroy of Egypt. This change of masters
                    brought some relief to the unfortunate Cretans, who at least exchanged the
                    licence of local misrule for the oppression of an organized despotism; and the
                    government of Mustafa Pasha, the ruler of the island for a considerable period,
                    was more enlightened and intelligent than that of most Turkish governors.</p>
                <p>In 1840 Crete was again taken from Mehemet Ali, and replaced under the dominion
                    of the Turks, as it has continued ever since. Great improvement has undoubtedly
                    taken place in the administration, and the island is said to be now the best
                    governed and the most lightly taxed of all the provinces of the Turkish empire.
                    But the strong desire of the Cretans for freedom and union with the Greek
                    monarchy has given rise to two successive revolts; the first of which in 1859
                    was speedily repressed; but the second, in 1866, lasted for a considerable
                    period, and required great exertions on the part of the Porte to put it down. It
                    was followed by the concession of additional privileges to the Christian
                    inhabitants, and a kind of constitutional government, which has placed the
                    island in quite an exceptional position among Turkish provinces.</p>
                <p>In all these insurrections, as well as in those against the Venetians in former
                    days, a leading part has been borne by the people known as Sfakiots, a race of
                    hardy mountaineers inhabiting the highlands and up]aιid plains of the White
                    Mountains, and who, from the rugged and inaccessible nature of their country,
                    have always enjoyed a condition of semi-independence, while their active and
                    warlike habits have rendered them formidable neighbours to the inhabitants of
                    the plains. There is, however, no ground for supposing them to be in any respect
                    a distinct race from the other population of the island; they appear to be, on
                    the contrary, the lineal representatives of the ancient Cretans, who have
                    preserved comparatively unimpaired the character and manners of their
                    forefathers. A curious proof of this is found in their still wearing high boots,
                    a fashion noticed by ancient writers as characteristic of the Cretans, and which
                    was then, as now, wholly unknown to the Greeks of the mainland. It is mentioned
                    also by Venetian writers, that as late as the 17th century the Sfakiots retained
                    that skill in the use of the bow for which the Cretans were so celebrated in
                    antiquity, and were with difficulty induced to lay it aside for the more
                    civilized firearms of their rulers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The inhabitants of Crete under the Venetians
                    were estimated at about 250,000 souls. After the Turkish conquest the population
                    was for a time greatly reduced, but afterwards gradually rose, till it was
                    supposed again to have attained to about 260,000 at the time of the outbreak of
                    the Greek revolution in 1821, of whom about half were Mahometans. The ravages of
                    the war from 1821 to 1830, and the emigration that followed, produced a great
                    diminution, and the population of the island was estimated by Mr Pashley in 1836
                    at only about 130,000. Since then it has again materially increased; it was
                    calculated by Captain Spratt in 1865 as amounting to 210,000, and this nearly
                    agrees with the latest official estimate which gives 200,000 inhabitants in all,
                    of whom less than 40,000 are Mahometans. It must be observed that very few of
                    these are Turks,—the Mussulman population being almost entirely of native Cretan
                    origin. Hence the Greek language is the only one spoken throughout the island,
                    even in the towns and among the Mahometans.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Towns.—</hi> The only considerable towns in Crete are Candia,
                    so long the capital of the island; Canea, which has succeeded to that dignity
                    since the renewal of the Turkish dominion in 1840; and Retimo, or Rhithymno,
                    also on the north coast, a small fortified town, with a good port and about
                    10,000 inhabitants. Ierapetra, on the south coast, on the site of the ancient
                    Hierapytna, though reckoned the fourth city of the island and the capital of the
                    eastern district, is a very poor place, with not more than about 2000
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Crete has of late years been carefully examined and explored. The older
                    descriptions of the island by Tournefort, Pococke, Olivier, and other travellers
                    may now be considered as obsolete, and superseded by the more recent works of
                    Pashley <hi rend="italic">(Travels in Crete,</hi> 2 vols. 8vo, London, 1837),
                    and Captain Spratt <hi rend="italic">(Travels and Researches in Crete,</hi> 2
                    vols. 8vo. London, 1865), which between them contain a full description of the
                    whole island. At the same time its geography has been placed on a satisfactory
                    basis by the admirable survey executed, under the orders of the British
                    admiralty, by Captain Graves and Captain (now Admiral) Spratt. A curious and
                    interesting addition to its archaeology has been also made by the publication of
                    a description of the island, drawn up under the Venetians (about 1538), and
                    preserved in manuscript in the Library of St Mark, whence it has been published
                    by Mr Falkener in the <hi rend="italic">Museum of Classical Antiquities,</hi>
                    vol. ii. pp. 263-303. From this treatise we learn how many architectural remains
                    of the ancient cities were still visible in the 16th century, which have long
                    since disappeared. All that can be gathered from ancient authors concerning the
                    mythology and early history of the island is brought together by Meursius <hi
                    rend="italic">(Creta,</hi><hi rend="italic">kc.,</hi> in the 3d vol. of his
                    works) and Hoeck <hi rend="italic">(Kreta,</hi> 3 vols. 8vo, Göttingen,
                    1823-29), but the latter work was published before the recent researches which
                    have thrown so much light on the topography and antiquities of the island. (E.
