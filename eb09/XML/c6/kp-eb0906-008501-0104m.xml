                    (1804-1865), was born at a farmhouse called Dunford, near Midhurst, in Sussex,
                    on the 3d of June 1804. The family had been resident in that neighbourhood for
                    many generations, occupied partly in trade and partly in agriculture. Formerly
                    there had been in the town of Midhurst a small manufacture of hosiery with which
                    the Cobdens were connected, though all trace of it had disappeared before the
                    birth of Richard. His grandfather was a maltster in that town, an energetic and
                    prosperous man, almost always the bailiff or chief magistrate, and taking rather
                    a notable part in county matters. But his father, forsaking that trade, took to
                    farming at an unpropitious time. He was amiable and kind-hearted, and greatly
                    liked by his neighbours, but not a man of business habits, and he did not
                    succeed in his farming enterprise. He died when his son Richard was a child, and
                    the care of the family devolved upon the mother, who was a woman of strong sense
                    and of great energy of character, and who, after her husband’s death, left
                    Dunford and returned to Midhurst.</p>
                <p>The educational advantages of Richard Cobden were not very ample. There was a
                    grammar school at Midhurst, which at one time had enjoyed considerable
                    reputation, but which had fallen into decay. It was there that he had to pick up
                    such rudiments of knowledge as formed his first equipment in life, but from his
                    earliest years he was indefatigable in the work of self-cultivation. When
                    fifteen or sixteen years of age he went to London to the warehouse of Messrs
                    Partridge and Price, in East Cheap, one of the partners being his uncle. His
                    relative noting the lad’s passionate addiction to study, solemnly warned him
                    against indulging such a taste, as likely to prove a fatal obstacle to his
                    success in commercial life, Happily the admonition was unheeded, for while
                    unweariedly diligent in business, as his rapid after success abundantly proved,
                    he was in his intervals of leisure a most assiduous student. During his
                    residence in London he found access to the London Institution, and made ample
                    use of its large and well-selected library.</p>
                <p>When he was about twenty years of age he became a commercial traveller, and
                    throwing into that, as he ever did into whatever his hand found to do, all the
                    thoroughness and vigour of his nature, he soon became eminently successful in
                    his calling. But never content to sink into the mere trader, he sought to
                    introduce among those he met on the “road” a higher tone of conversation than
                    usually marks the commercial room, and there were many of his associates who,
                    when he had attained eminence, recalled the discussions on political economy and
                    kindred topics with which he was wont to enliven and elevate the travellers’
                    table. In 1830 Cobden learnt that Messrs Fort, calico printers at Sabden, near
                    Clitheroe, were about to retire from business, and he, with two other young men,
                    Messrs Sheriff and Gillet, who were engaged in the same commercial house as
                    himself, determined to make an effort to acquire the succession. They had,
                    however, very little capital among them. But it may be taken as an illustration
                    of the instinctive confidence which Cobden through life inspired in those with
                    whom he came into contact, that Messrs Fort consented to leave to these untried
                    young men a large portion of their capital in the business. Nor was their
                    confidence misplaced. The new firm had soon three establishments,—one at Sabden,
                    where the printing works were, one in London, and one in Manchester for the sale
                    of their goods. This last was under the direct management of Cobden, who, in
                    1830 or 1831, settled in the city with which his name became afterwards so
                    closely associated. The success of this enterprize was decisive and rapid, and
                    the “Cobden prints” soon became known through the country as of rare value both
                    for excellence of material and beauty of design. There can be no doubt that if
                    Cobden had been satisfied to devote all his energies to commercial life he might
                    soon have attained to great opulence, for it is understood that his share in the
                    profits of the business he had established amounted to from £8000 to £10,000 a
                    year. But he had other tastes, which impelled him irresistibly to pursue those
                    studies which, as Lord Bacon says, “serve for delight, for ornament, and for
                    ability.” Mr Prentice, the historian of the Anti-Corn-Law League, who was then
                    editor of the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Times,</hi> describes how, in the
                    year 1835, he received for publication in his paper a series of admirably
                    written letters, under the signature of “Libra,” discussing commercial and
                    economical questions with rare ability. After some time he discovered that the
                    author of these letters was Cobden, whose name was until then quite unknown to
                    him.</p>
                <p>In 1835 he published his first pamphlet, entitled <hi rend="italic">England,
                    Ireland, and America, by a Manchester Manufacturer.</hi> It attracted great
                    attention, and ran rapidly through several editions. It was marked by a breadth
                    and boldness of views on political and social questions which betokened an
                    original mind. In this production Cobden advocated the same principles of peace,
                    non-intervention, retrenchment, and free trade to which he continued faithful to
                    the last day of his life. Immediately after the publication of this pamphlet, he
                    paid a visit to the United States, landing in New York on the 7th June 1835. He
                    devoted about three months to this tour, passing rapidly through the seaboard
                    States and the adjacent portion of Canada, and collecting as he went large
                    stores of information respecting the condition, resources, and prospects of the
                    great Western Republic. Soon after his return to England he began to prepare
                    another work for the press, which appeared towards the end of 1836, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Russia.</hi> It was mainly designed to combat a wild
                    outbreak of Russophobia which, under the inspiration of Mr David Urquhart, was
                    at that time taking possession of the public mind. But it contained also a bold
                    indictment of the whole system of foreign policy then in vogue, founded on ideas
                    as to the balance of power and the necessity of large armaments for the
                    protection of commerce. While this pamphlet was in the press, delicate health
                    obliged him to leave England, and for several months, at the end.of 1836 and the
                    beginning of 1837, he travelled in Spain, Turkey, and Egypt. During his visit to
                    Egypt he had an interview with the redoubtable ruler of that country, Mehemet
                    Ali, of whose character as a reforming monarch <pb break="no"

                    impression. He returned to England in April 1837. From that time Cobden became a
                    conspicuous figure in Manchester, taking a leading part in the local politics of
                    the town and district. Largely owing to his exertions, the Manchester Athenaeum
                    was established, at the opening of which he was chosen to deliver the inaugural
                    address. He became a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and soon infused new
                    life into that body. He threw himself with great energy into the agitation which
                    led to the incorporation of the city, and was elected one of its first aldermen.
                    He began also to take a warm interest in the cause of popular education. Some of
                    his first attempts in public speaking were at meetings which he convened at
                    Manchester, Salford, Bolton, Rochdale, and other adjacent towns, to advocate the
                    establishment of British schools. It was while on a mission for this purpose to
                    Rochdale that he first formed the acquaintance of Mr John Bright, who afterwards
                    became his distinguished coadjutor iu the free trade agitation. Nor was it long
                    before his fitness for parliamentary life was recognized by his friends. In
                    1837, the death of William IV. and the accession of Queen Victoria led to a
                    general election. Cobden was candidate for Stockport, but was defeated, though
                    not by a large majority.</p>
                <p>In 1838 an Anti-Corn-Law Association was formed at Manchester, which, on his
                    suggestion, w as afterwards changed into a national association, under the title
                    of the Anti-Corn-Law League. This is not the place to recount the history of
                    that famous association, of which from first to last Cobden w as the presiding
                    genius and the animating soul. During the seven years between the formation of
                    the league and its final triumph, he devoted himself wholly to the work of
                    teaching his countrymen sound economical doctrines, for the agitation which he
                    and his associates conducted with such signal ability and success was
                    preeminently an educational agitation. His labours were as various as they were
                    incessant,—now guiding the councils of the League, now addressing crowded and
                    enthusiastic meetings of his supporters in London or the large towns of England
                    and Scotland, now invading the agricultural districts, and challenging the
                    landlords to meet him in the presence of their own farmers, to discuss the
                    question in dispute, and now encountering the Chartists led on by Feargus
                    O’Connor, wſho had deluded a portion of the w orking classes into fanatical
                    opposition to free frade. But whatever was the character of his audience he
                    never failed, by the clearness of his statements, the force of his reasoning,
                    and the felicity of his illustrations, to carry conviction to the minds of his
                    hearers.</p>
                <p>In 1841, Sir Robert Peel having defeated the Melbourne ministry in Parliament,
                    there was a general election, when Cobden was returned for Stockport. His
                    opponents had confidently predicted that he would fail utterly in the House of
                    Commons. He did not wait long, after his admission into that assembly, in
                    bringing their predictions to the test. Parliament met on the 19th August. On
                    the 24th, in course of the debate on the Address, Cobden delivered his first
                    speech. “It was remarked,” says Miss Martineau, in her <hi rend="italic">History
                    of the Peace,</hi> “that he was not treated in the House with the courtesy
                    usually accorded to a new member, and it was perceived that he did not need such
                    observance.” With perfect self-possession, which was not disturbed by the jeers
                    that greeted some of his statements, and with the utmost simplicity, directness,
                    and force, he presented the argument against the cornlaws in such a form as
                    startled his audience, and also irritated some of them, for it was a style of
                    eloquence very unlike the conventional style which prevailed in Parliament.</p>
                <p>From that day he became an acknowledged power in the House, and though addressing
                    a most unfriendly audience, he compelled attention by his thorough mastery of
                    his subject, and by the courageous boldness with which he charged the ranks of
                    his adversaries. He soon came to be recognized as one of the foremost debaters
                    on those economical and commercial questions which at that time so much occupied
                    the attention of Parliament; and the most prejudiced and bitter of his opponents
                    were fain to acknowledge that they had to deal with a man whom the most
                    practised and powerful orators of their party found it hard to cope with, and to
                    whose eloquence, indeed, the great statesman in whom they put their trust was
                    obliged ultimately to surrender. On the 17 th of February 1843 an extraordinary
                    scene took place in the House of Commons. Cobden had spoken with great fervour
                    of the deplorable suffering and distress which at that time prevailed in the
                    country, for which, he added, he held Sir Robert Peel, as the head of the
                    Government, responsible. This remark, when it was spoken, passed unnoticed,
                    being indeed nothing more than one of the commonplaces of party warfare. But a
                    few weeks before, Mr Drummond, who was Sir Robert Peel’s private secretary, had
                    been shot dead in the street by a lunatic. In consequence of this, and the
                    manifold anxieties of the time with which he was harassed, the mind of the great
                    statesman was no doubt in a moody and morbid condition, and when he arose to
                    speak later in the evening, he referred in excited and agitated tones to the
                    remark, as an incitement to violence against his person. Sir Robert Peel’s
                    party, catching at this hint, threw themselves into a frantic state of
                    excitement, and when Cobden attempted to explain that he meant official, not
                    personal responsibility, they drowned his voice with clamorous and insulting
                    shouts. But Peel lived to make ample and honourable amend for this unfortunate
                    ebullition, for not only did he “fully and unequivocally withdraw the imputation
                    which was thrown out in the heat of debate under an erroneous impression,” but
                    when the great free trade battle had been won, he took the wreath of victory
                    from his ow n brow, and placed it on that of his old opponent, in the following
                    graceful words :—“The name which ought to be, and will be associated with the
                    success of these measures, is not mine, or that of the noble Lord (Russell), but
                    the name of one who, acting I believe from pure and disinterested motives, has,
                    with untiring energy, made appeals to our reason, and has enforced those appeals
                    with an eloquence the more to be admired because it was unaffected and
                    unadorned; the name which ought to be chiefly associated with the success of
                    these measures is the name of Richard Cobden.” Cobden had, indeed, with
                    unexampled devotion, sacrificed his business, his domestic comforts, and for a
                    time his health to the public interests. His friends therefore felt, at the
                    close of that long campaign, that the nation owed him some substantial token of
                    gratitude and admiration for those sacrifices. No sooner was the idea of such a
                    tribute started than liberal contributions came from all quarters, which enabled
                    his friends to present him w ith a sum of £80,000. Had he been inspired with
                    personal ambition, he might have entered upon the race of political advancement
                    with the prospect of attaining the highest official prizes. Lord John Russell,
                    who, soon after the repeal of the corn laws, succeeded Sir Robert Peel as first
                    minister, invited Cobden to join his Government. But he preferred keeping
                    himself at liberty to serve his countrymen unshackled by official ties, and
                    declined the invitation. He withdrew for a time from England. His first
                    intention was to seek complete seclusion in Egypt or Italy, to recover health
                    and strength after his long and exhausting labours. But his fame had gone forth
                    throughout Europe, and intimations reached him from many quarters that his voice
                    would be listened to everywhere with favour, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n106/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0106-0087"/> in advocacy of the doctrines to the triumph of
                    which he had so much contributed at home. Writing to a friend in July 1846, he
                    says,—“I am going to tell you of a fresh project that has been brewing in my
                    brain. I have given up all idea of burying myself in Egypt or Italy. I am going
                    on an agitating tour through the continent of Europe.” Then, referring to
                    messages he had received from influential persons in France, Prussia, Austria,
                    Russia, and Spain to the effect mentioned above, he adds:—“Well, I will, with
                    God’s assistance, during the next twelve months, visit all the large states of
                    Europe, see their potentates or statesmen, and endeavour to enforce those truths
                    which have been irresistible at home. Why should I rust in inactivity? If the
                    public spirit of my countrymen affords me the means of travelling as their
                    missionary, I will be the first ambassador from the people of this country to
                    the nations of the Continent. I am impelled to this by an instinctive emotion
                    such as has never deceived me. I feel that I could succeed in making out a
                    stronger case for the prohibitive nations of Europe to compel them to adopt a
                    freer system than I had here to overturn our protection policy.” This programme
                    he fulfilled. He visited in succession France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and
                    Russia. He was received everywhere with marks of distinction and honour. In many
                    of the principal capitals he was invited to publicbanquets, which afforded him
                    an opportunity of propagating those principles of which he was regarded as the
                    apostle. But beside these public demonstrations he sought and found access in
                    private to many of the leading statesmen, in the various countries he visited,
                    with a view to indoctrinate them with the same principles. During his absence
                    there was a general election, and he was returned for Stockport and for the West
                    Riding of Yorkshire. He chose to sit for the latter.</p>
                <p>When Cobden returned from the Continent he addressed himself to what seemed to
                    him the logical complement of free trade, namely, the promotion of peace and the
                    reduction of naval and military armaments. His abhorrence of war amounted to a
                    passion. Throughout his long labours in behalf of unrestricted commerce he never
                    lost sight of this, as being the most precious result of the work in which he
                    was engaged,—its tendency to diminish the hazards of war and to bring the
                    nations of the world into closer and more lasting relations of peace and
                    friendship with each other. He was not deterred by the fear of ridicule or the
                    reproach of Utopianism from associating himself openly, and with all the ardour
                    of his nature, with the peace party in England. In 1849 he brought forward a
                    proposal in Parliament in favour of international arbitration, and in 1851 a
                    motion for mutual reduction of armaments. He was not successful in either case,
                    nor did he expect to be. In pursuance of the same object, he identified himself
                    with a series of remarkable peace congresses—international assemblies designed
                    to unite the intelligence and philanthropy of the nations of Christendom in a
                    league against war—which from 1848 to 1851 were held' successively in Brussels,
                    Paris, Frankfort, London, Manchester, and Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>On the establishment of the French empire in 1851-2 a violent panic took·
                    possession of the public mind. Without the shadow of producible evidence the
                    leaders of opinion in the press promulgated the wildest alarms as to the
                    intentions of Louis Napoleon, who was represented as contemplating a sudden and
                    piratical descent upon the English coast without pretext or provocation. Shocked
                    by this pitiful display of national folly, Cobden did not hesitate to throw
                    himself into the breach and withstand the madness of the hour. By a series of
                    powerful speeches in and out of Parliament, and by the publication of his
                    masterly pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">1793</hi><hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">1853,</hi> he sought to calm the passions of his countrymen. By
                    this course he sacrificed the great popularity he had won as the champion of
                    free trade, and became for a time the best abused man in England. Immediately
                    afterwards, owing to the quarrel about the Holy Places which arose in the east
                    of Europe, public opinion suddenly veered round, and all the suspicion and
                    hatred which had been directed against the emperor of the French were diverted
                    from him to the emperor of Russia. Louis Napoleon was taken into favour as our
                    faithful ally, and in a whirlwind of popular excitement the nation was swept
                    into the Crimean war. Cobden, who had travelled in Turkey, and had studied the
                    condition of that country with great care for many years, utterly discredited
                    the outcry about maintaining the independence and integrity of the Ottoman
                    empire which was the battle-cry of the day. He denied that it was possible to
                    maintain them, and no less strenuously denied that it was desirable even if it
                    were possible. He believed that the jealousy of Russian aggrandizement and the
                    dread of Russian power to which our countrymen delivered themselves at that time
                    were absurd exaggerations. He maintained that the future of European Turkey was
                    in the hands of the Christian population, and that it would have been our wisdom
                    to ally ourselves with them rather than with the doomed and decaying Mahometan
                    power. “You must address yourselves,” he said in the House of Commons, “as men
                    of sense and men of energy, to the question—what are you to do with the
                    Christian population? for Mahometanism cannot be maintained, and I should be
                    sorry to see this country fighting for the maintenance of Mahometanism . . . . .
                    You may keep Turkey on the map of Europe, you may call the country by the name
                    of Turkey if you like, but do not think you can keep up the Mahometan rule in
                    the country.” The reader may be left to judge how far his sagacity and
                    statesmanship have been vindicated by the event. But for the time the torrent of
                    popular sentiment in favour of war was irresistible; and Messrs Cobden and
                    Bright, who with admirable courage and eloquence withstood what they deemed the
                    delusion of the hour, were overwhelmed with obloquy.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of 1857 tidings from China reached England of a rupture between
                    the British plenipotentiary in that country and the governor of the Canton
                    provinces in reference to a small vessel orlorcha called the “Arrow,” which had
                    resulted in the English admiral destroying the river forts, burning 23 ships
                    belonging to the Chinese navy, and bombarding the city of Canton. After a
                    careful investigation of the official documents, Cobden became convinced that
                    those were utterly unrighteous proceedings. He brought forward a motion in
                    Parliament to this effect, which led to a long and memorable debate, lasting
                    over four nights, in which he was supported by Mr Sydney Herbert, Sir James
                    Graham, Mr Gladstone, Lord John Russell, and Mr Disraeli, and which ended in the
                    defeat of Lord Palmerston by a majority of sixteen. But this triumph cost him
                    his seat in Parliament. On the dissolution which followed Lord Palmerston’s
                    defeat, Cobden became candidate for Huddersfield, but the voters of that town
                    gave the preference to his opponent, who had supported the Russian war and
                    approved of the proceedings at Canton. Cobden was thus relegated to private
                    life, and retiring to his country house at Dunford, he spent his time in perfect
                    contentment in cultivating his land and feeding his pigs.</p>
                <p>He took advantage of this season of leisure to pay another visit to the United
                    States. During his absence the general election of 1859 occurred, when he was
                    returned unopposed for Rochdale. Lord Palmerston was again prime minister, and
                    having discovered that the advanced liberal party was not so easily “crushed” as
                    he had apprehended, he made overtures of reconciliation, and invited <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0107-0088"/> Cobden and Milner Gibson to become members of his
                    government. In a frank, cordial letter which was delivered to Cobden on his
                    landing in Liverpool, Lord Palmerston offered him the Presidency of the Board of
                    Trade, with a seat in the Cabinet. Many of his friends urgently pressed him to
                    accept; but without a moment’s hesitation. he determined to decline the proposed
                    honour. On his arrival in London he called on Lord Palmerston, and with the
                    utmost frankness told him that he had opposed and denounced him so frequently in
                    public, and that he still differed so widely from his views, especially on
                    questions of foreign policy, that he could not, without doing violence to his
                    own sense of duty and consistency, serve under him as minister. Lord Palmerston
                    tried good-humouredly to combat his objections, but without success.</p>
                <p>But though he declined to share the responsibility of Lord Palmerston’s
                    administration, he was willing to act as its representative in promoting freer
                    commercial intercourse between England aud France. But the negotiations for this
                    purpose originated with himself in conjunction with Mr Bright and Μ. Michel
                    Chevalier. Towards the close of 1859 he called upon Lord Palmerston, Lord John
                    Russell, and Mr Gladstone, and signified his iutention to visit France and get
                    into communication with the emperor and his ministers, with a view to promote
                    this object. These statesmen expressed in general terms their approval of his
                    purpose, but he went entirely on his own account, clothed at first with no
                    official authority. His name, however, carried an authority of its own. On his
                    arrival in Paris he had a long audience with Napoleon, in which he urged many
                    arguments in favour of removing those obstacles which prevented the two
                    countries from being brought into closer dependence or. one another, and he
                    succeeded in making a considerable impression on his mind in favour of free
                    trade. He then addressed himself to the French ministers, and had much earnest
                    conversation, especially with M. Fould, Ministre d’État, and Μ. Rouher, minister
                    of commerce, both of whom, and especially the latter, he found well inclined to
                    the economical and commercial principles which he advocated. After a good deal
                    of time spent in these preliminary and unofficial negotiations, the question of
                    a treaty of commerce between the two countries having entered into the arena of
                    diplomacy, Cobden was requested by the British Government to act as their
                    plenipotentiary in the matter in conjunction with Lord Cowley, their ambassador
                    in France. But it proved a very long and laborious undertaking. He had to
                    contend with the bitter hostility of the French protectionists, which occasioned
                    a good deal of vacillation on the part of the emperor and his ministers. There
                    were also delays, hesitations, and cavils at home, which were inore
                    inexplicable. He was, moreover, assailed with great violence by a powerful
                    section of the English press, while the large number of minute details with
                    which he had to deal in connection with, proposed changes in the French tariff,
                    involved a tax on his patience and industry which would have daunted a less
                    resolute man. But there was one source of embarrassment greater than all the
                    rest. One strong motive which had impelled him to engage in this enterprise was
                    his anxious desire to establish more friendly relations between England and
                    France, and to dispel those feelings of mutual jealousy and alarm which were so
                    frequently breaking forth and jeopardizing peace between the two countries. This
                    was the most powerful argument with which he had plied the emperor and the
                    members of the French Government, and which he had found most efficacious with
                    them. But unhappily, while he was in the very thick of the negotations, Lord
                    Palmerston brought forward in the House of Commons a measure for fortifying the
                    naval arsenals of England, which he introduced in a warlike speech pointedly
                    directed against France, as the source of danger of invasion and attack, against
                    which it was necessary to guard. This produced irritation and resentment in
                    Paris, and but for the influence which Cobden had acquired, and the perfect
                    trust reposed in his sincerity, the negotiations would probably have been
                    altogether wrecked. At last, however, after nearly twelve months’ incessant
                    labour, the work was completed in November 1860. “Rare,” said Mr Gladstone, “is
                    the privilege of any man who, having fourteen years ago rendered to his country
                    one signal service, now again, within the same brief span of life, decorated
                    neither by land nor title, bearing no mark to distinguish him from the people he
                    loves, has been permitted to perform another great and memorable service to his
                    sovereign and his country.”</p>
                <p>On the conclusion of this work honours were offered to Cobden by the Governments
                    of both the countries which he had so greatly benefited. Lord Palmerston offered
                    him a baronetcy and a seat in the Privy Council, and the emperor of the French
                    would gladly have conferred upon him some distinguished mark of his favour. But
                    with characteristic disinterestedness and modesty he declined all such
                    honours.</p>
                <p>It has already been remarked that Cobden’s efforts in furtherance of free trade
                    were always subordinated to the highest moral purposes—the promotion of peace on
                    earth and good-will among men. This was his desire and hope as respects the
                    Commercial Treaty with France. He was therefore deeply disappointed and
                    distressed to find the old feeling of distrust towards our neighbours still
                    actively fomented by the press and some of the leading politicians of the
                    country. He therefore, in 1862, published his pamphlet entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Three Panics,</hi> the object of which was to trace the
                    history and expose the folly of those periodical visitations of alarm, as
                    respects the designs of our neighbours with which this country had been
                    afflicted for the preceding fifteen or sixteen years.</p>
                <p>There was one other conspicuous service which Cobden rendered, or tried to
                    render, to his country before his death. When the great civil war threatened to
                    break out in the United States, it was matter to him of profound affliction. But
                    after the conflict became inevitable his sympathies were wholly with the North,
                    because the South was fighting for slavery. His great anxiety, however, was that
                    the British nation should not be committed to any unworthy course during the
                    progress of that struggle. And when our relations with America were becoming
                    critical and menacing in consequence of the depredations committed on American
                    commerce by vessels issuing from British ports, he brought the question before
                    the House of Commons in a series of speeches of rare clearness and force, in
                    which he pointed out the perilous responsibilities we were incurring by
                    connivance or neglect in regard to those vessels. He was first attacked with
                    great animosity both in and out of Parliament for taking this line, but after
                    results amply vindicated his political sagacity and patriotism.</p>
                <p>For several years Cobden had been suffering severely at intervals from bronchial
                    irritation and a difficulty of breathing. Owing to this he had spent the winter
                    of 1860 in Algeria, and every subsequent winter he had to be very careful and
                    confine himself to the house, especially in damp and foggy weather. In November
                    1864 he went down to Rochdale and delivered a speech to his constituents—the
                    last he ever delivered. That effort was followed by great physical prostration,
                    and he determined not to quit his retirement at Midhurst until spring had fairly
                    set in. But in the month of March there were discussions in the House of Commons
                    on the alleged necessity of constructing large defensive works in Canada. He was
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n108/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0108-0089"/> deeply impressed with the folly of such a
                    project, and he was seized with a strong desire to go up to London and deliver
                    his sentiments on the subject. But on the 21st of March, the day on which he
                    left home a bitter easterly wind blew, and struck him in the throat and chest.
                    He recovered a little for a few days after his arrival in London; but on the
                    29th there was a relapse, and on the 2d of April 1865, he expired peacefully at
                    his apartments in Suffolk Street.</p>
                <p>On the following day there was a remarkable scene in the House of Commons. When
                    the clerk read the orders of the day Lord Palmerston rose, and in impressive and
                    solemn tones declared “it was not possible for the House to proceed to business
                    without every member recalling to his mind the great loss which the House and
                    country had sustained by the event which took place yesterday morning.” He then
                    paid a generous tribute to the virtues, the abilities, and services of Cobden,
                    and he was followed by Mr Disraeli, who with great force and felicity of
                    language delineated the character of the deceased statesman, who, he said, “was
                    an ornament to the House of Commons and an honour to England.” Mr Bright also
                    attempted to address the House, but after a sentence or two delivered in a
                    tremulous voice, he was overpowered with emotion, and declared he must leave to
                    a calmer moment what he had to say on the life and character of the manliest and
                    gentlest spirit that ever quitted or tenanted a human form.</p>
                <p>In the French Corps Législatif, also, the vice-president, Μ. Forçade la Roquette,
                    referred to his death, and warm expressions of esteem were repeated and
                    applauded on every side. “The death of Richard Cobden,” said Μ. la Roquette, “is
                    not alone a misfortune for England, but a cause of mourning for France and
                    humanity.” Μ. Drouyn de Lhuys, the French minister of foreign affairs, made his
                    death the subject of a special despatch, desiring the French ambassador to
                    express to the Government “the mournful sympathy and truly national regret which
                    the death, as lamented as premature, of Richard Cobden had excited on that side
                    of the Channel. “He is above all,” he added, “in our eyes the representative of
                    those sentiments and those cosmopolitan principles before which national
                    frontiers and rivalries disappear; whilst essentially of his country, he was
                    still more of his time; he knew what mutual relations could accomplish in our
                    day for the prosperity of peoples. Cobden, if I may be permitted to say so, was
                    an international man.”</p>
                <p>He was buried at West Lavington Church, on the 7th of April, by the side of his
                    only son, whose death, eight or nine years before, had nearly broken his
                    father’s heart. His grave was surrounded by a large crowd of mourners, among
