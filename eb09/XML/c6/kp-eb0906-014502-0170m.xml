                    school; and when only eleven years of age he was put on board the “Shannon,”
                    then under the command of Captain (afterwards Admiral) Brathwaite, a relative of
                    his own, to whose care and attention he was in a great measure indebted for that
                    nautical knowledge which shone forth so conspicuously in his subsequent career.
                    After serving under Captain Brathwaite for some years, and also under Admiral
                    Roddam, he went in 1774 to Boston with Admiral Graves, who in the year following
                    presented him with a lieutenancy. In 1779 he was made commander of the “Badger,”
                    and shortly afterwards post-captain of the “Hinchinbroke,” a small frigate. In
                    the spring of 1780 that vessel, under the command of Nelson, was employed upon
                    an expedition to the Spanish Main, where it was proposed to pass into the
                    Pacific by navigating boats along the River San Juan and the Lakes Nicaragua and
                    Leon. <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> Γhe attempt failed, and most of those
                    engaged in it became victims to the deadly influence of the climate. Nelson was
                    promoted to a larger vessel, and Collingwood succeeded him in the command. It is
                    a fact worthy of record that the latter succeeded the former very frequently
                    from the time when they first became acquainted, until the star of Nelson set at
                    Trafalgar—giving place to that of Collingwood, less brilliant certainly, but not
                    less steady in its lustre.</p>
                <p>After commanding in another small frigate, Collingwood was promoted to the
                    “Sampson” of sixty-four guns; and in 1783 he was appointed to the “Mediator,”
                    destined for the West Indies, where, with Nelson, who had a command on that
                    station, he remained till the end of 1786. With Nelson he warmly co-operated in
                    carrying into executiof the provisions of the navigation laws, which had been
                    infringed by the United States, whose ships, notwithstanding the separation of
                    the countries, continued to trade to the West Indies, although that privilege
                    was by law exclusively confined to British vessels. In 1786 Collingwood returned
                    to England, where, with the exception of a voyage to the West Indies, he
                    remained until 1793, in which year he was appointed captain of the “Prince,” the
                    flag-ship of Rear-Admiral Bowyer. About two years previous to this event he had
                    married Miss Sarah Roddam—a fortunate alliance, which continued to be a solace
                    to him amidst the privations to which the life of a seaman must ever be
                    subject.</p>
                <p>As captain of the “Barfleur,” Collingwood was present at the celebrated naval
                    engagement which was fought on the 1st of June 1794; and on that occasion he
                    displayed equal judgment and courage. On board the “Excellent” he shared in the
                    victory of the 14th of February 1797, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n171/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0171-0146"/> when Sir John Jarvis humbled the Spanish fleet
                    off Cape St Vincent. His conduct in this engagement was the theme of universal
                    admiration throughout the fleet, and greatly advanced his fame as a naval
                    officer. After blockading Cadiz for some time, he returned for a few weeks to
                    Portsmouth to repair. In the beginning of 1799 Collingwood was raised to the
                    rank of vice-admiral, and hoisting his flag in the “Triumph,” he joined the
                    Channel Fleet, with which he proceeded to the Mediterranean, where the principal
                    naval forces of France and Spain were assembled. Collingwood continued actively
                    employed in watching the enemy, until the peace of Amiens restored him once more
                    to the bosom of his family.</p>
                <p>The domestic repose, however, which he so highly relished, was cut short by the
                    recommencement of hostilities with France, and in the spring of 1803 he quitted
                    the home to which he was never again to return. The duty upon which he was
                    employed was that of watching the French fleet off Brest, and in the discharge
                    of it he displayed the most unwearied vigilance. Nearly two years were spent in
                    this employment; but Napoleon had at length matured his plans and equipped his
                    armament, and the grand struggle which was to decide the fate of Europe and the
                    dominion of the sea was close at hand. The enemy’s fleet [having sailed from
                    Toulon, Admiral Collingwood was appointed to the command of a squadron, with
                    orders to pursue them. The combined fleets of France and Spain, after spreading
                    terror throughout the West Indies, returned to Cadiz. On their way thither they
                    bore down upon Admiral Collingwood, who had only three vessels with him; but he
                    succeeded in eluding the pursuit, although chased by sixteen ships of the line.
                    Ere one half of the enemy had entered the harbour he drew up before it and
                    resumed the blockade, at the same time employing an ingenious artifice to
                    conceal the inferiority of his force. But the combined fleet was at last
                    compelled to quit Cadiz; and the battle of Trafalgar immediately followed. The
                    brilliant conduct of Admiral Collingwood upon this occasion has been much and
                    justly applauded. The French admiral drew up his fleet in the form of a
                    crescent, and in a double line, every alternate ship being about a cable’s
                    length to windward of her second, both ahead and astern. The British fleet bore
                    down upon this formidable and skilfully arranged armament in two separate lines,
                    the one led by Nelson in the “Victory,” and the other by Collingwood in the
                    “Royal Sovereign.” The latter vessel was the swifter sailer, and having shot
                    considerably ahead of the rest of the fleet, was the first engaged. “See,” said
                    Nelson, pointing to the “Royal Sovereign” as she penetrated the centre of the
                    enemy’s line, “see how that noble fellow Collingwood carries his ship into
                    action !” Probably it was at the same instant that Collingwood, as if in
                    response to the observation of his great commander, remarked to his captain,
                    “What would Nelson give to be here <hi rend="italic">ì”</hi> The consummate
                    valour and skill evinced by Collingwood had a powerful moral influence upon both
                    fleets. It was with the Spanish admiral’s ship that the “Royal Sovereign”
                    closed; and with such rapidity and precision did she pour in her broadsides upon
                    the “Santa Anna,” that the latter was on the eve of striking in the midst of
                    thirty-three sail of the line, and almost before another British ship had fired
                    a gun. Several other vessels, however, seeing the imminent peril of the Spanish
                    flag-ship, came to her assistance, and hemmed in the “Royal Sovereign” on all
                    sides; but the latter, after suffering severely, was relieved by the arrival of
                    the rest of the British squadron; and not long afterwards the “Santa Anna”
                    struck her colours. The result of the battle of Trafalgar, and the expense at
                    which it was purchased, are well known. On the death of Nelson, Collingwood
                    assumed the supreme command; and by his skill and judgment greatly contributed
                    to the preservation of the British ships, as well as of those which were
                    captured from the enemy. He was raised to the peerage, as Baron Collingwood of
                    Coldburne and Heathpool, and received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament,
                    with a pension of £2000 per annum.</p>
                <p>From this period until the death of Lord Collingwood no great naval action was
                    fought; but he was much occupied in important political transactions, in which
                    he displayed remarkable tact and judgment. Being appointed to.the command of the
                    Mediterranean fleet, he continued to cruise about, keeping a watchful eye upon
                    the movements of the enemy. His health, however, which had begun to decline
                    previously to the action of Trafalgar in 1805, seemed entirely to give way, and
                    he repeatedly requested Government to be relieved of his command, that he might
                    return home; but he was urgently requested to remain, on the ground that his
                    country could not dispense with his services. This conduct has been regarded as
                    harsh; but the good sense and political sagacity which he displayed afford some
                    palliation of the conduct of the Government; and the high estimation in which he
                    was held is proved by the circumstance that among the many able admirals, equal
                    in rank and duration of service, none stood so prominently forward as to command
                    the confidence of ministers and of the country to the same extent as he did.
                    After many fruitless attempts to induce the enemy to put to sea, as well as to
                    fall in with them when they had done so (which circumstance materially
                    contributed to hasten his death), he expired on board the “Ville de Paris,” then
                    lying off Port Mahon, on the 7th of March 1810.</p>
                <p>Lord Collingwood’s merits as a naval officer were in every respect of the first
                    order. In original genius and romantic daring he was inferior to Nelson, who
                    indeed had no equal in an age fertile in great commanders. In seamanship, in
                    general talent, and in reasoning upon the probability of events from a number of
                    conflicting and ambiguous statements, Collingwood was equal to the hero of the
                    Nile; indeed, many who were familiar with both give him the palm of superiority.
                    His political penetration was remarkable; and so high was the opinion generally
                    entertained of his judgment, that he was consulted in all quarters, and on all
                    occasions, upon questions of general policy, of regulation, and even of trade.
                    He was distinguished for benevolence and generosity; his acts of charity were
                    frequent and bountiful, and the petition of real distress was never rejected by
                    him. He was an enemy to impressment and to flogging; and so kind was he to his
                    crew, that he obtained amongst them the honourable name of father. Between
                    Nelson and Collingwood a close intimacy subsisted, from their first acquaintance
                    in early life till the fall of the former at Trafalgar; and they lie side by
                    side in the cathedral of St Paul’s. The selections from the public and private
                    correspondence of Lord Collingwood, published in 2 vols., 8vo, in 1828, contain
                    some of the best specimens of letter-writing in our language. See also <hi
