                    most remarkable are Brühl, Kreuzlingen, Paradies, and Petershausen. The last of
                    these, which has grown up round a free imperial abbey, is situated on the other
                    side of the river, and communicates with the city by means of a long covered
                    bridge raised on stone piers. A large number of the buildings of Constance are
                    of mediaeval origin, and several are of high interest both to the historian and
                    antiquary. Most remarkable are the minster, originally founded in 1048, but
                    dating in its present form mainly from the beginning of the 16th century; St
                    Stephen’s Church, belonging to the 14th; the old Dominican convent on the island
                    of Genf (now a cotton-printing factory); the <hi rend="italic">Kaufhaus,</hi> or
                    public mart, in the hall of which sat the famous council of 1414-1418; and the
                    old chancery or town-hall, erected in 1503. Besides the various administrative
                    offices of the circle the town further possesses a gymnasium, a ]yceum, various
                    collections of antiquities, a public collection of books and pictures in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Wessenberg Haus,</hi> and a valuable series of archives. Since the
                    introduction of steam-boat and railway communication the commercial prosperity
                    of the city has greatly increased. It now contains cotton-factori es,
                    linen-factories, carpet-looms, and breweries, maintains a considerable activity
                    in printing and publishing, and has a vigorous and varied local trade.
                    Population in 1864, 8516; in 1872, 10,061.</p>
                <p>Constance probably dates from the 3d or 4th century; but it first began to be of
                    importance in the 6th, when it became the seat of the bishop who had previously
                    been settled at Windisclι or Vindonissa in Aargau. It afterwards obtained the
                    rank of an imperial city, and rose to be one of the largest and most flourishing
                    municipalities in Germany. From 1414 to 1418 it was the seat of the great
                    ecclesiastical council which, under the presidency of the emperor Sigismund, and
                    consisting of 26 princes, 140 counts, more than 20 cardinals, 20 archbishops, 91
                    bishops, 600 prelates and doctors, and about 4000 priests, constituted itself
                    the highest authority in the church, condemned to death the reformers Huss
                    andJerome of Prague, expelled the three rival popes John XX1II., Gregory XII.,
                    and Benedict XIII., and elected Martin V. as the legitimate successor of St
                    Peter. Constance joined the Smalkaldic League and refused to accept the
                    “Interim.” It was accordingly deprived of its imperial privileges, and in 1549
                    was presented by the emperor to his brother, the Archduke Ferdinand, in whose
                    territory it remained till 1805, when it was acquired by Baden. The bishopric,
                    which was secularized in the latter year, had become the largest in all Germany,
                    stretching over a great part of Wurtemberg, Baden, and Switzerland, and
                    containing 350 conventual establishments and 1760 parsonages.</p>
