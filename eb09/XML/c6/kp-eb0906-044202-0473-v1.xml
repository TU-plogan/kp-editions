                    and mediaeval works, but magnificent specimens of the so-called Cyclopean
                    architecture. The cathedral, a building of the 15 th century, but restored by
                    Galilei in the 18th, contains a number of paintings by Luca Signorelli and
                    Pietro Berettini, who were both natives of the town; the tomb of John Baptist
                    Tommasi, the last grand-master of the Order of Malta; and a large sarcophagus,
                    adorned with bas-reliefs of the Lapithae and Centaurs, in which, according to
                    the fanciful hypothesis of the local antiquaries, were the remains of the Consul
                    Flaminius, who perished in the battle of Lake Thrasymene against the
                    Carthaginian invader. Among the other churches, which are almost all in
                    possession of paintings of interest to connoisseurs, the most important is Santa
                    Margherita, a fine building of the 13th century by Nicola and Giovanni Pisano,
                    which occupies the top of the hill and is embosomed in cypress trees. The <hi

                    candelabrum of sixteen lights, ranked among the finest specimens of Etruscan
                    art. In the same building is preserved the Bonbucci Library, which contains a
                    fine IMS. of Dante and a curious unpublished work called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Notti Coritane,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Nights of Cortona.</hi> Outside
                    of the town is an Etruscan tomb of some architectural interest, known as the
                    Grotto of Pythagoras. The population of the commune is upwards of 26,000; that
                    of the city is only 3973.</p>
                <p>The origin of Cortona, or Corythus, as it is called by Virgil, is lost in remote
                    antiquity; and little light is thrown on the question by the statement of
                    Dionysius that it was founded by the Umbrians, and passed from them to the
                    Pelasgians. It was certainly one of the most powerful of the twelve Etrurian
                    cities, and continued to maintain its position under the Romans; but probably
                    from the fact that its supposed impregnability led the successive conquerors of
                    Italy to pass it by, its name is rarely found in the ancient classics, and we
                    are even ignorant of the date when it first fell into the hands of the Romans.
                    It was colonized about the end of the 2d century n.c., but as the colony was
                    never reneλved it is not mentioned in the lists of Pliny or Ptolemy. It was one
                    of the first bishoprics of the Christian church; and after the barbarian
                    invasions, it reappears in the Middle Ages as a place of importance. Held for
                    about a century by the Casale family, it was transmitted by them to King
                    Ladislas of Naples, who, in his turn, in 1412 bestowed it on the
                    Florentines.</p>
