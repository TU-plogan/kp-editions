                    alien blood. They probably derive their name, which in Russian appears as <hi
                    rend="italic">Kazak,</hi> from a word synonymous in Tartar with a freebooter and
                    in Turkish with a light-armed soldier. Ethnographically and historically they
                    are divided into two principal sections, the Cossacks of Little Russia, or of
                    the Dnieper, and the Cossacks of Great Russia, or of the Don.</p>
                <p>The former or Malo-Russian branch seems to have grown up in the 13th and 14th
                    centuries, and probably owed its existence to the confusion caused by the Tartar
                    invasion. Bands of hardy refugees from the surrounding regions, mainly with
                    Russian blood in their veins, gathered together for mutual defence in the
                    islands of the Dnieper, where the natural character of the situation of itself
                    afforded them considerable protection. Their numbers were rapidly increased, and
                    before long they formed a strong and active community. In the 16th century they
                    were enrolled among the vassals of Poland, but were permitted to retain a number
                    of privileges which put them on a level with tho Polish nobility. Their
                    constitution was consolidated, their territory extended, and their valour
                    utilized by the able policy of King Stephen Bathori. Meanwhile the more ardent
                    adventurers amongst them were united into a strict military confederation, not
                    unlike in many respects to those orders of knights which in similar
                    circumstances sprung up in Western Europe for the defence of Christendom. They
                    established their <hi rend="italic">setcha,</hi> or fortified camp, on an island
                    in the Dnieper, to the south of the <hi rend="italic">Porogi,</hi> or cataracts,
                    and from this circumstance acquired the name of Zaporogians, or Dwellers beyond
                    the Cataracts. The members were bound by a vow of celibacy; but as every one was
                    welcome to join the association who was willing to submit to its rules, so every
                    one was free to depart as soon as he found it irksome to obey. Freedom and
                    independence were of the first necessity to the Cossacks; their constitution was
                    purely democratic; their <hi rend="italic">hetmans</hi> or leaders were chosen
                    by popular election, and held their office only for one year. This independent
                    spirit was abundantly displayed in their policy; they lent their services now to
                    the king of Poland, now to Russia, now to the Sultan, and now, it might be, even
                    to the Tartar Khan himself. In 1571, when their leader was put to death by
                    Bathori for having invaded Moldavia on his own authority, thousands of his
                    followers left the country, and went to join their brethren on the Don; and in
                    the following century, the main body which had remained behind, after carrying
                    on a successful war against Poland under the astute Khmelnicky, put themselves
                    under the protection of Russia, whose right to the whole country of the
                    Cossacks, with the exception of a small portion to the west of the Dnieper, was
                    formally recognized by the peace of Radzine in 1681. In 1708 the famous Ivan
                    Stevanovitch Mazeppa, who had succeeded in raising himself to the office of
                    hetman, joined the standard of Charles XII. of Sweden; and this revolt brought
                    down on the Cossacks the vengeance of Peter tho Great, who ultimately deprived
                    them of all their privileges and abolished their military organization. The
                    Zaporrgians, who left the country after the capture of their seteka, were
                    recalled by the Empress Anne; but they proved so <pb break="no"

                    of the country that they had again to be expelled. They retired for the most
                    part to the Crimea, and on the incorporation of that district with the Russian
                    empire they were deported to Kuban to defend the frontiers against the Caucasian
                    tribes. A small band which had migrated to the Balkan, was recalled in 1828 by
                    the Emperor Nicholas, and sent to form a sort of coast-guard on the Sea of
                    Azoff. The character of the Zaporogian fraternity which was thus destroyed has
                    been the object of very divergent judgments,—some writers seeing in it little
                    more than an organized band of ruffian adventurers, while others raise its
                    members to the dignity of patriots and martyrs who fought and died in defence of
                    national and religious liberty. The last view is well presented by Kulish, one
                    of the most recent of the historians of Little Russia, and it receives no small
                    support from the popular songs in which their virtues and valour are still
                    commemorated among the people of the Ukraine.</p>
                <p>The Cossacks of the Don have all along had more direct connection with the empire
                    than their brethren of the Dnieper; and their insurrections, though numerous,
                    have had less of the character of genuine revolt. About seven years after the
                    foundations of their capital Cherkask had been fixed in the marshes of the Don,
                    Ivan IV., irritated at their conduct, despatched against them his general
                    Murashkine. At the approach of the formidable invader the Cossacks dispersed;
                    one band under Yermak pushed eastwards, and effected the conquest of Siberia;
                    another company established themselves in the Ural Mountains and expelled the
                    Tartars from Jaik (Uralsk); while a third probably found a refuge in the
                    Caucasus, where their descendants are still known as the Grebenski, or Mountain
                    Cossacks. In 1637 the portion still left on the Don expelled the Turks from the
                    town of Azoff; and they managed to keep possession of it till 1642 without aid
                    from the Russian Government. Exasperated by the execution of some of their
                    number, and by an attempt to introduce alterations in their religion, they were
                    easily excited to rebellion by the freebooter Stenka (or Stephen) Razine; but
                    after it had risen to a formidable height, the insurrection was suppressed, and
                    its leader executed at Moscow in 1671. In the following century another
                    adventurer found in the discontent of the Cossacks a formidable means of
                    supporting his pretensions; but the success of Pugacheff was as temporary as
                    that of Razine, whom the local superstition imagined to have come to life in his
                    person. The result to the Cossacks was a serious diminution of their privileges,
                    and an extension of Russian control.</p>
                <p>Gradually brought under a more rigid military discipline, this restless and
                    warlike race has furnished the empire with one of the most valuable elements in
                    its national army; and their services in the protection of the frontiers from
                    the Caucasus to China are almost incalculable. They form a first-rate irregular
                    cavalry, and render excellent service as scouts and skirmishers; but their
                    steadiness can hardly be trusted in an important engagement. So great is their
                    superstition, that in the midst of a conflict they have been known to give chase
                    to a hare in order to avert the omen by its destruction, and they still retain a
                    large measure of the freebooter’s fondness for plunder.</p>
                <p>According to their present distribution the Cossacks are distinguished as
                    Cossacks of the Don, of the Azoff, of the Danube, of the Black Sea, of the
                    Caucasus, of the Ural, of Orenburg, of Siberia, of the Chinese frontiers, and of
                    Astrakhan. In their organization they retain the communistic habits of earlier
                    times. The territory is the common property of the stanitza or township; the hay
                    can only be cut after public notice by the Ataman; and no fish can be captured
                    except at prescribed periods, when the whole community join in the
                    enterprize.</p>
                <p>Among the privileges still retained by the Cossacks the most important are
                    freedom from taxes, and the right of distilling, brewing, hunting, and
                    fishing.</p>
