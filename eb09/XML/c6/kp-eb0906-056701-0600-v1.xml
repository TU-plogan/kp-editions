                    the Rivers Oglio and Adda, north of the Po, which separates it from Parma and
                    Piacenza. It is conterminous along the Oglio on the north-east with Mantua and
                    Brescia, and with Bergamo on the north; the Adda separates it from Milan on the
                    west. It is about fifty miles in extreme length from north-west to south-east,
                    and fifteen miles in width, containing 632 square miles, and (in 1871) 300,595
                    inhabitants. The surface is level, and the soil very fertile, producing abundant
                    crops of wheat, rice, maize, and flax. Horses and black cattle are numerous, and
                    silk is an extensive production, but the sheep are few. There are no important
                    manufactures carried on except the spinning of silk.</p>

                    Brescia, Bergamo, Pavia, and Milan, and eastward with Mantua. It is well built,
                    of an oval shape, about six miles in circumference, and surrounded by walls
                    flanked with towers and wet ditches. It possesses many good buildings,
                    principally churches, richly adorned with frescoes and paintings by native
                    artists. The cathedral is an ancient structure, begun in 1107 and completedin
                    1606, thus including very various styles of architecture. The interior is
                    composed of a nave, with two aisles, divided by eight immense pillars, and is
                    gorgeously coloured and gilded. Near the cathedral is the great tower, the <hi
