                    breaks up at Bellaggio into two branches which run respectively south-east and
                    south-west. The lake is thus divided into three basins, of which the south
                    western is known more particularly as the Lago di Como, and the southeastern as
                    the Lago di Lecco. The northern part of the original basin has been silted up by
                    the debris brought down from the valleys of San Giacomo and Bregaglia by the
                    River Mera; and not only∣has the Adda, which enters from the east, filled up the
                    branch that in all probability once extended up the Valtelline as far as
                    Morbegno <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> but it has also, by its delta, or cone of
                    ejection, cut off from the main body of the lake the part now known as the Lago
                    di Mezzola. Of the real form of the bed of the lake there was hardly any
                    knowledge till 1865, when a survey was undertaken by Signor Gentilli and MM.
                    Casella and Bernasconi. The results obtained were published by Gentilli in the
                    second volume of the Memoirs of the <hi rend="italic">Società Italiana di
                    Scieme</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturali,</hi> and by his coadjutors in a separate
                    pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Cenni</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Orograβci</hi><hi rend="italic">sul Lago di Como.</hi> It appears that the
                    greatest depth is 1341 feet, which was registered in a section of the Lago di
                    Como from Torrigia to Como. From the northern extremity of the lake the basin
                    gradually grows deeper as we advance southwards, till it shallows towards the
                    promontory of Bellaggio; in the south-western branch it grows rapidly deeper
                    again, while in the south-eastern it shallows to 390 or 290 feet. This
                    difference of the two branches is easily explained by the fact that the Lago di
                    Como is a closed basin except at its junction with the main body of the lake,
                    and throughout a coast line of upwards of forty miles receives only two
                    unimportant torrents, while the Lago di Lecco is in the direct course of the
                    Adda, which makes its exit by the southern extremity. The total length of the
                    lake, from Como to its northern ext emity, is about thirty miles, and its
                    greatest width, between Menaggio and Varenna, about two miles and a half. The
                    shores of the lake are studded with ancient castles, flourishing hamlets, and
                    the villas of wealthy proprietors. On the eastern side the principal places are
                    Colico-piano, Dervio, Bellano, Varenna, Mandello, and Lecco; and along the
                    western Gravedona, Dongo, Menaggio, Cadenabbia, Argegno, Moltrasio, and
                    Cernobbio. Bellaggio, as already mentioned, is situated at the promontory where
                    the lake bifurcates southwards. The Villa Vigorni, near Menaggio, formerly the
                    property of Mylius of Frankfort, contains sculptures of Thorwaldsen, Marchesi,
                    and Argenti; the Villa Giulia, near Bellaggio, belongs to the king of the
                    Belgians; the Villa Carlotta or Sommariva, near Cadenabbia, took its name from
                    Charlotte of Prussia, wife of the duke of Saxe-Meiningen; the Villa d’Este, near
                    Cernobbio, was at one time the residence of Queen Caroline of England. The Villa
                    Raimondi or Odescalchi, is the largest of all.</p>
