                    (1750—1817), Master of the Rolls in Ireland, and one of the most brilliant wits
                    and orators of his day, was born on the 24th July 1750, at Newmarket, Cork,
                    where his father, a descendant of one of Cromwell’s soldiers, was seneschal to
                    the manor-court. Pleased with his bright boyish vivacity and wit, the rector of
                    his native place, the Rev. Nathaniel Boyse, first gave him lessons and then sent
                    him to school at Middleton. At the age of nineteen he became a sizar of Trinity
                    College, Dublin; and in 1773, having taken his M.A. degree, he entered the
                    Middle Temple. During his residence in London he gave some little attention to
                    the study of law, but gained far more by his assiduous attendance at the
                    students’ debating societies. In 1774 he married a lady who brought him a small
                    dowry; but the marriage proved most unhappy, not without fault on the part of
                    Curran, and Mrs Curran finally eloped from her husband.</p>
                <p>In 1775 Curran was called to the Irish bar, where he very soon obtained a
                    practice. On his first rising in court, excessive nervousness prevented him from
                    even reading distinctly the few words of a legal form, and when requested by the
                    judge to read more clearly he became so agitated as to be totally unable to
                    proceed. But, his feelings once roused, all nervousness disappeared. His
                    effective and witty attack upon a judge who had sneered at his poverty, the
                    success with which he prosecuted a nobleman for a disgraceful assault upon a
                    priest, the duel which he fought with one of the witnesses for this nobleman,
                    and other similar exploits, gained him such a reputation that he was soon the
                    most popular advocate in Ireland.</p>
                <p>In 1783 Curran was appointed king’s counsel; andin the same year he was presented
                    to a seat in the Irish House of Commons. His conduct in connection with this
                    affair displays his conduct in a most honourable light; finding that he differed
                    radically in politics from the gentleman from whom he had received his seat, he
                    offered to buy another to replace that which he occupied. In his parliamentary
                    career Curran was throughout sincere and consistent. He spoke vigorously in
                    behalf of Catholic emancipation, and strenuously attacked the ministerial
                    bribery which prevailed. His declamations against the Government party led him
                    into two duels—the first with Fitzgibbon, then attorney-general, afterwards Lord
                    Clare; the second with the secretary of state, Major Hobart, afterwards Lord
                    Buckingham. The Union caused him the bitterest disappointment; he even talked of
                    leaving Ireland, either for America or for England.</p>
                <p>Curran’s fame rests most of all upon his speeches in behalf of the accused in the
                    state trials that were so numerous between 1794 and 1803; and among them may be
                    mentioned those in defence of Hamilton Rowan, the Rev. William Jackson, the
                    brothers Shears, Finnerty, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Tone, and Kirwan. Another of
                    his most famous and characteristic speeches is that against the marquis of
                    Headfort, who had eloped with the wife of a clergyman named Massey. On the
                    arrest of Emmett, who had formed an attachment to his daughter, Curran was
                    himself under suspicion; but, on examination before the Privy Council, nothing
                    was brought forward to implicate him in the intended rebellion.</p>
                <p>In 1806, on the death of Pitt and the formation of the Fox ministry, Curran
                    received the post of Master of the Rolls, with a seat in the Privy Council, much
                    to his disappointment, for he had desired a position of greater political
                    influence. For eight years, however, he performed the distasteful duties of this
                    office. He then retired on a pension of £3000; and the three remaining years of
                    his life were spent in London, where he became one of the most brilliant members
                    of the brilliant society which included Sheridan, Erskine, Thomas Moore, and
                    William Godwin. He died at his house in Bromptón on the 14th October 1817.</p>

                <p>Curran’s legal erudition was never profound; and though he was capable of the
                    most ingenious pleading, his appeal was always to the emotions of his audience.
                    His best speeches are one fiery torrent of invective, pathos, national feeling,
                    and wit. His diction was lofty and sonorous. To his personal presence he owed
                    nothing; foi he was short, slim, and boyish-looking, and his voice was thin and
                    shrill.</p>
