                    (1710-1790), an eminent physician and medical teacher, was born at Hamilton,
                    Lanarkshire, on 15th April 1710. His father, who was a writer by profession, was
                    factor to the duke of Hamilton, and was owner of a small estate in the parish of
                    Bothwell. William received his early education at the grammar school of
                    Hamilton, and he appears to have subsequently attended some classes at the
                    university of Glasgow. He commenced his medical career as apprentice to Mr John
                    Paisley, surgeon in Glasgow, who was a man of learning and possessed a valuable
                    medical library, and under whom Cullen prosecuted his studies with great ardour.
                    After completing his apprenticeship at Glasgow Cullen became surgeon to a
                    merchant vessel trading between London and the West Indies. On his return to
                    Scotland in 1732 he settled as a practitioner in the parish of Shotts,
                    Lanarkshire, where he resided for about two years. He thereafter proceeded to
                    Edinburgh to pursue his studies at the university, which was then rapidly rising
                    into fame as a medical school. Here he spent two winter sessions, and was one of
                    the founders of what is now known as the Royal Medical Society, a students’
                    association which meets weekly for the discussion of subjects of medical and
                    scientific interest. Leaving Edinburgh in 1736, Cullen commenced practice in
                    Hamilton, where he rapidly acquired a high reputation, and was employed by many
                    of the families of distinction in the locality, including that of the duke of
                    Hamilton. About this time he became acquainted with the celebrated Dr William
                    Hunter, who resided with him as his pupil for nearly three years. Hunter was
                    about to enter into partnership with Cullen, when, an opening occuring, he
                    removed to London to engage in those anatomical and obstetric pursuits with
                    which his name will ever stand associated. Cullen took the degree of M.D. at the
                    university of Glasgow in 1740; and, resolving to confine his attention to the
                    practice of physic, took into partnership Thomas Hamilton, surgeon, who
                    undertook the surgical part of the work. While at Hamilton Cullen was twice
                    elected a magistrate of the town, and in this capacity he displayed great
                    ability, and was of great service to the community. In 1741 he married Miss
                    Johnston, daughter of a clergyman in the neighbouιhood, a lady of beauty and
                    accomplishment, by whom he had a large family. He continued to practise in
                    Hamilton till 1744, when he was induced to settle in Glasgow. During his
                    residence at Hamilton, besides the arduous duties of medical practice, Cullen
                    found time to devote to the study of the natural sciences, and especially of
                    chemistry, for which he seems to have had special predilections. On coming to
                    Glasgow he appears to have begun to lecture in connection with the university,
                    the medical school of w hich was as yet imperfectly organized. Besides the
                    subjects of theory and practice of medicine, Cullen lectured systematically on
                    botany, materia medica, and chemistry. His great abilities, enthusiasm, and
                    power of conveying instruction on the most difficult subjects made him a
                    successful and highly popular teacher, and his classes increased largely in
                    numbers. At the same time he diligently pursued the practice of his profession.
                    Chemistry was the subject which at this time seems to have engaged the greatest
                    share of Cullen’s attention, and there can be <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0728-0695"/> no doubt that to him was due the credit of
                    placing that science on a more philosophical basis than it had hitherto
                    occupied, while at the same time he laboured to render it specially subservient
                    to agriculture and other useful arts. He was himself a diligent investigator and
                    experimenter, and he did much to encourage original research among his pupils,
                    one of whom was Dr Joseph Black, who became the most celebrated chemist of his
                    time. In 1751, a vacancy having occurred in the professorship of medicine,
                    Cullen, through the influence of the duke of Argyll, was appointed by the king
                    to the chair, but he still continued to lecture on chemistry. In 1756 he was
                    elected by the town council of Edinburgh joint professor of chemistry in the
                    university of that city, along with Dr Plummer, on whose death in the following
                    year the sole appointment was conferred on Cullen. This chair he held for ten
                    years—his classes always increasing in numbers. He also practised his profession
                    as a physician with eminent success. About this time he delivered, along with
                    some of his colleagues, lectures on clinical medicine in the Royal Infirmary,
                    which he continued to do till near the close of his career. This was a work for
                    which Cullen’s experience, habits of observation, and scientific training
                    peculiarly fitted him, and in which his popularity as a teacher, no less than
                    his power as a practical physician, became more than ever conspicuous. During
                    the winter session of 1760-61 the professor of materia medica, Dr Alston, died,
                    and the students presented a petition to Cullen to undertake the work of
                    finishing the course of lectures on that subject,—a request with which he
                    readily complied. He delivered an entirely new course of lectures, in which the
                    subject was treated in such a masterly and scientific as well as interesting and
                    practical manner as to gain the high commendations of his students and of the
                    medical profession generally, by whom copies of his pupils’ notes were in great
                    request. An incorrect edition of the lectures was tea years afterwards published
                    in London without Dr Callen’s knowledge, and widely circulated throughout
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>On the death of Dr Whytt, the professor of the institutes of medicine, in 1766,
                    the patrons offered the chair to Dr Cullen, who accepted it, resigning that of
                    chemistry, in which he was succeeded by Dr Black, who was then professor of
                    chemistry in Glasgow. In the same year Dr John Gregory was appointed professor
                    of practice of physic on the death of Dr Rutherford. For this chair Cullen was
                    likewise a candidate, and a strong effort was made to induce the patrons to
                    confer the appointment on him, but without success. In 1769 an arrangement was,
                    however, entered into between Drs Gregory and Cullen, by which they agreed to
                    deliver alternate courses on the theory aud practice of physic. This arrangement
                    proved eminently satisfactory in the hands of these two distinguished men, but
                    it was brought to a close by tho sudden and premature death of Gregory in 1773.
                    Cullen was then appointed sole professor of the practice of physic, and he
                    continued in this office till a few months before his death, which took place on
                    5th February 1790.</p>
                <p>Cullen’s fame rests on his great power and influence as a teacher, and on his
                    important contributions to theoretical and practical medicine.</p>
                <p>As a lecturer Cullen appears to have stood unrivalled in his day. His clearness
                    of statement and power of imparting interest to the most abstruse topics were
                    the conspicuous features of his teaching, and in his various capacities as a
                    scientific lecturer, a physiologist, and a practical physician, he was ever
                    surrounded with large and increasing classes of intelligent pupils, to whom his
                    eminently suggestive mode of instruction was specially attractive. The grasp and
                    vigour of his mind were shown in the facility with which he mastered the many
                    different branches of medical knowledge which he taught; while his scientific
                    spirit equally appears in his refusal to accept what he describes as the “false
                    facts” so prevalent in his day, and by the zeal with which he pursued original
                    observation and experimental research both as a chemist and as a physician, with
                    the view of arriving at truth. Cullen has been frequently represented as a
                    purely speculative physician; but this view is far from just. It is to be borne
                    in mind that in his time medicine was to a large extent mixed up with
                    metaphysical speculation, that its ascertained facts were few, and that the
                    science of physiology was then in its infancy. If, therefore, in opposing what
                    he held to be false theories he was led to advance new views and speculations of
                    his own, still no one who attentively reads the works of this great physician
                    and teacher can fail to perceive that his constant aim was in the direction of
                    disengaging his science from the hypothetical mazes in which it was involved,
                    and placing it upon the solid basis of fact.</p>
                <p>Previous to the days of Cullen, and during his early life, the medical philosophy
                    or medical doctrines of Boerhaave were universally taught in the schools.
                    Boerhaave attempted to combine into one system the vital philosophy of
                    Hippocrates (the vis medicatrix naturae), the chemico-humoral principle of
                    Paracelsus, the mechanical doctrines of Bellini, and a few of the other
                    doctrines taught by former medical philosophers. He attributed, however, more to
                    the chemical and mechanical forces than to the powers of life, and of course
                    embraced a large portion of the doctrine of the humoral pathologists. Cullen,
                    seeing that many of the facts then known were irreconcilable with Boerhaave’s
                    doctrines, became their warm opponent, especially taking offence at those
                    doctrines which attributed almost every disease to a vitiation of the fluids of
                    the body. Indeed, he might almost be said to have adopted as his motto the
                    celebrated aphorism of Hoffmann, “Universa pathologia longe rectius atque
                    facilius <hi rend="italic">ex vitio motuum microcosmicorum in solidis,</hi> quam
                    ex variis affectionibus vitiosorum humorum, deduci atque explicari possit,
                    adeoque omnis generis nervosi affectionibus sint referendae.” Living at the time
                    he did, when the doctrines of the humoral pathologists were carried to an
                    extreme extent, and witnessing the ravages which disease made on the solid
                    structures of the body, it was not surprising that he should oppose a doctrine
                    which appeared to him to lead to a false practice and to fatal results, and
                    adopt one which attributed more to the agency of the solids, and very little to
                    that of the fluids of the body. The Cullenian system was certainly an immense
                    improvement on those which preceded it, and has served as a valuable
                    stepping-stone for the rational doctrines which now prevail, more especially
                    those which relate to the influence of the nervous system alike in healthy and
                    morbid action. He was obliged to introduce the doctrine of a spasm in the
                    extreme vessels in order to account, on his theory, for many of the phenomena of
                    disease; still we cannot refuse to Ihn the honour ot having been an able and
                    successful improver in medical science. His classification of diseases was
                    remarkable for its simplicity and clearness. He divided diseases into four great
                    classes—1st, Pyrexiae, or febrile disease, as typhus fever; 2d, Neuroses, or
                    nervous diseases, as epilepsy; 3d, Cachexiae, or diseases resulting from bad
                    habit of body, as scurvy; and 4th, Locales, or local diseases, as cancer. His
                    nosological arrangement has served to a considerable extent as the groundwork of
                    modern nosologies, and was a great improvement, both in simplicity and
                    clearness, on the involved productions of his predecessors.</p>
