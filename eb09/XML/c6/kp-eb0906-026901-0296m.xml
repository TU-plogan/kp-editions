                <p><label type="entry">CONGRESS</label>, in diplomacy, a term applied to an
                    assemblage of sovereigns or ambassadors of the highest rank, convoked for the
                    purpose of concluding a general peace, or of treating the general political
                    interests of Europe. In this latter sense a modern congress may be regarded as a
                    representative council of states or nations, by which differences may be
                    adjusted, and the rules of international law determined and enforced. The
                    greatest progress yet made in the relations of sovereign states is, that
                    disputes, which in former times would have led to immediate war, may now be
                    resolved, in many instances, by the common deliberations of the European powers.
                    The term <hi rend="smallcaps">Congress,</hi> however, is only strictly
                    applicable to meetings of this nature on the most important occasions, and when
                    all the powers are represented. The term <hi rend="smallcaps">Conference</hi> is
                    used to describe diplomatic meetings <hi rend="subscript"> fc</hi> of ministers
                    of the first or second rank, called together for a special purpose, either to
                    modify existing treaties by consent, or to suggest means of dealing with a
                    critical state of affairs. Meetings of this kind have become in modern times
                    very frequent, and are the recognized mode of dealing with the questions arising
                    between sovereign states, and sometimes even between states and their subjects.
                    The proceedings of these conferences are recorded in protocols, agreed to and
                    signed by the plenipotentiaries. These documents have not always the form of
                    treaties or conventions, but they establish the principles on which the powers
                    agree to act, and the rules by which they are bound in honour and good faith.
                    The number of Congresses which have been held in the last two centuries is not
                    very large, and we shall proceed briefly to pass them in review. Conferences
                    have occurred so frequently that it would be impossible to describe them in
                    detail. The most important examples are, perhaps, the Conference of Petersburg
                    in 1825, which led to the independence of Greece; the Conference of London in
                    1831, which separated the kingdom of Belgium from Holland; the Conference of
                    Paris on the affairs of Crete; the Conference of 1871 for the modification of
                    the Treaty of Paris of 1856; and the abortive Conference of Constantinople in
                    1877, when the six powers vainly endeavoured to obtain from the Porte guarantees
                    for the better government of its Christian subjects. These two forms of
                    diplomatic council differ more, however, in form and degree than in kind. Their
                    object is the same, namely, to determine and enforce the mutual obligations of
                    states; and they may therefore be treated under one head.</p>
                <p>The first time we have been able to trace the use of the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Congress</hi> in its modern sense, is in 1636, when the Pope attempted to open
                    negotiations for peace at Cologne, under his own mediation; but the attempt
                    failed, and the Thirty Years’ War continued for twelve years more to devastate
                    the world. At length, however, it was agreed by the preliminaries of Hamburg,
                    signed on the 25th December 1641, that a Congress should be held at Munster and
                    at Osnaburgh, in Westphalia, meeting simultaneously in both those towns; the
                    French mediating minister, representing the Catholic party, being at Munster,
                    and the Swedish minister, representing the Protestants, at Osnaburgh. The
                    opening of the Congress was fixed for the 11th July 1643; but the proceedings
                    were delayed by numerous formalities, by questions of rank and precedence, by
                    questions of neutrality and safe-conduct, and by the death of Richelieu and
                    Louis XIII. The negotiations began in earnest in June 1645. Never before had so
                    august an assembly met in Europe for the termination of a sanguinary war, for
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n297/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0297-0270"/> establishment of peace between two hostile
                    creeds, and for the regulation of territorial questions by common agreement. The
                    Empire was represented by Count Maximilian von Trautmansdorf; France by Count
                    d’Avaux; Sweden by John Oxenstiern, a son of the great chancellor; the Pope by
                    Cardinal Chigi, afterwards himself Pope Alexander VII.; Spain by Count
                    Peñaranda, and by two of her subjects from Franche Comté, not to mention lesser
                    names. England had no representative at the Congress of Westphalia. The
                    questions in dispute and the result of these long deliberations (which were not
                    terminated until the 24th October 1648 by the signature of the two great
                    treaties of Munster and Osnaburgh) were worthy of the statesmen engaged in them
                    and of the time spent in the negotiations; for the Congress of Westphalia laid
                    the foundations of modern Europe, and its leading principles subsisted not only
                    into the present century, but down to the war of 1870-71. It terminated the long
                    contest between France and Austria. It established the equal rights of the
                    Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinistic churches in Germany. It rendered 350 German
                    princes almost independent of the Empire, and it planted the germ of the future
                    greatness of Prussia. This form of the German body remained unaltered till the
                    French Revolution. But it also gave to France and Sweden a right, as mediating
                    powers at Munster, to interfere in the affairs of Germany—∙ a right which
                    supported the aggressive policy of Louis XIV., and caused, in the event,
                    innumerable quarrels. The diplomatic communications at Munster all passed
                    through the mediators, and were generally framed in Latin. The discussions were
                    also carried on in that language. A separate peace between the Dutch and the
                    Spaniards was also signed at Munster in 1648, as represented in Terburg’s
                    celebrated picture, now in the National Gallery, but this was not an act of the
                    Congress.</p>
                <p>The term Congress was applied to the diplomatic meetings which negotiated the
                    Peace of Nimeguen in 1678 and the Peace of Ryswick (so called from a castle near
                    the Hague) in 1697. A contemporary French author, De Rouille, remarked that
                    these meetings ought to be termed assemblies, not congresses, since the latter
                    word was coarse and inappropriate. The term has since entirely lost its improper
                    meaning, derived from an obsolete form of ecclesiastical procedure, and the
                    diplomatic signification has triumphed. At Nimeguen England appeared for the
                    first time at a Continental Congress, from the interest she took in the fate of
                    Holland, and was worthily represented by Sir William Temple; France by Colbert
                    de Croissy, D’Estrades, and D’Avaux; Spain by Don Pedro Ronquillo, governor of
                    the Low Countries; and Holland by the count of Nassau and Beverning. Separate
                    treaties were signed between the various parties. The Congress of Ryswick was of
                    still greater importance to England, for it terminated the war in which we had
                    long been engaged with France, and extorted from Louis XIV. the recognition of
                    the right of William and Mary to the British crown. The peace was of short
                    duration, for the War of Succession broke out in 1701; the grand alliance was
                    formed between England, Holland, and Austria; France was defeated; peace was
                    nearly restored in 1709 at the conferences of Gertruydenberg, which were
                    privately carried on between the marquis de Torcy and the Grand Pensionary, but
                    not finally concluded till 1712, when a Congress of all the belligerent powers
                    (except the king of Spain) assembled at Utrecht. France was represented by the
                    marshal d’Huxelles, England by the bishop of Bristol (it was the last time an
                    English bishop acted in a civil and diplomatic capacity), the emperor by Count
                    Sinzendorf. The decisive negotiation for peace was, however, carried on secretly
                    and separately between London and Versailles, and whilst the Congress was
                    occupied with formalities, Bolingbroke came to an agreement with France, which
                    broke up the alliance and compelled the other powers to terminate the war. The
                    other Congresses of the 18th century are those of Soissons in 1727, remarkable
                    for the fact that Cardinal Fleury, then prime minister of Louis XV., attended it
                    in person, and of Aix la-Chapelle in 1748, which terminated a general war. By
                    each of these Congresses the treaties of Westphalia, Nimeguen, Ryswick, and
                    Utrecht were renewed and confirmed; so that their labours formed a continuous
                    series and identical body of international legislation. No Con gress was held at
                    the termination either of the Seven Years’ War in 1763 or of the American war in
                    1783, but the style of a Congress was assumed by the German plenipotentiaries
                    who met at Teschen in 1779 to end the war of the Bavarian succession. It hardly
                    deserved the name.</p>
                <p>The French Revolution and the wars of the Empire swept away the entire political
                    fabric of continental Europe and the treaties on which it was based. No attempt
                    was made during that period to convoke a Congress for the purpose of a general
                    pacification and territorial settlement; for the Congress of Rastadt, which met
                    in December 1797 and sat till April 1799, was designed mainly to re-establish
                    amicable relations between France and the German empire, and was not attended by
                    the representatives of England, Russia, or Spain. These negotiations proved
                    abortive; war was renewed; the Congress was broken up; and the ministers of the
                    French Directory—Bonnier and Roberjot—were massacred by a party of Austrian
                    Szeklers as they quitted the town. The Austrian Government never entirely
                    cleared itself of complicity in this crime against the rights and usages of
                    nations; and the event aggravated the hostility existing between France and
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>Upon the fall of Napoleon, it was agreed by the 32d Article of the Peace of
                    Paris, signed on the 30th May 1814 between France and the allied powers, that
                    “within two months all the powers which had been engaged in the war on either
                    side should send plenipotentiaries to Vienna to settle, at a general Congress,
                    the arrangements required to complete the provisions of the Treaty of Peace.”
                    The Congress of Vienna, which met, with some allowance for delays, early in
                    November of the same year, was by far the most splendid and important assembly
                    ever convoked to discuss and determine the affairs of Europe. The emperor of
                    Russia, the king of Prussia, the kings of Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurtemberg, were
                    present in person in the Austrian capital at the court of the Emperor Francis.
                    Prince Metternich presided over the Congress. Prince Talleyrand represented
                    France. Great Britain sent the secretary of state for foreign affairs—Lord
                    Castlereagh, — besides the duke of Wellington, Lord Clancarty, and Lord
                    Cathcart. Mr Stratford Canning, now the sole survivor of that illustrious
                    assembly, took part in the discussion of the affairs of Switzerland, where he
                    was then minister. Prussia was represented by Prince Hardenberg and Baron
                    Humboldt. A hundred sovereigns and ministers were collected in Vienna, all
                    animated by a general desire for peace and a lively sense of their own
                    interests. Chevalier Gentz, who was named protocolist to the Congress, and who
                    in fact drafted the treaties which were ultimately signed by all the powers, has
                    left us a curious account of the secret proceedings of this prodigious assembly.
                    Strange to say, the Congress itself, that is to say, the representatives of all
                    these principalities and powers, <hi rend="italic">never met</hi> in council;
                    nor did any formal exchange of their respective credentials take place. The
                    business was entirely transacted by committees of the five great powers—Austria,
                    England, France, Prussia, and Russia; to whom, for certain purposes, the
                    ministers of Spain, Sweden, and Portugal were added. Even with this <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n298/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0298-0271"/> arrangement the progress of the negotiations was
                    extremely slow. For three months nothing was done. It was said, “Le Congrès
                    danse, mais ne marche pas.” Serious differences arose; the pretensions of Russia
                    and Prussia, acting in concert, seemed even to threaten a renewal of war; and a
                    secret treaty was concluded on the 3d December between England, France, and
                    Austria, in view of that contingency. The return of Napoleon from Elba in March
                    1815 roused the Congress from its lethargy and terminated its disputes, by the
                    necessity for common action; and at length the great treaties of Vienna were
                    signed on the <hi rend="italic">7</hi> th June 1815—eleven days before the
                    battle of Waterloo—by the plenipotentiaries of the eight powers. It is
                    acknowledged by the draftsman of these treaties that, after all, this work was
                    somewhat hastily and imperfectly done. Yet upon the whole, that Congress
                    succeeded in restoring peace to Europe, which was not seriously disturbed for
                    forty years; and it laid the foundation of a system of public law, which was
                    long held sacred, as the common basis of the rights of every member of the
                    European family. At the present time, after the changes which have taken place
                    in Poland, in Italy, in Germany, in Denmark, and in France, it can hardly be
                    said that any fragments of the work of the Congress of Vienna retain their
                    authority, or that any similar general compact has taken its place.</p>
                <p>The intimate relations which had sprung up during the war gave rise to a mystical
                    union of the northern sovereigns, projected .and prepared by the emperor of
                    Russia, under the name of the Holy Alliance; and the intention of the authors of
                    that agreement was that the powers should meet and act together in the event of
                    fresh disturbances occurring in Europe. The practical result of this policy was
                    seen in 1823 when another Congress met at Verona, not for the purpose of
                    restoring peace, but in order to crush the signs of freedom and independence
                    then beginning to display themselves in Europe. In Spain the nation demanded a
                    constitution—she was invaded by France; in Naples a popular movement took
                    place—Naples was occupied by Austrian troops, and the king fled to Laybach; in
                    Germany, the people were irritated by the breach of all the liberal promises
                    made during the war. The Congress of Verona was the source and centre of the
                    most violent reactionary policy; and although the duke of Wellington attended it
                    on behalf of England, it was chiefly to protest against its system of despotic
                    intervention in the affairs of other states. Μ. de Chateaubriand has left an
                    account of this, the darkest hour of the politics of Europe, in which he took an
                    active and inglorious part. On this occasion, however, England renewed her
                    protest against the slave trade, and obtained a declaration of the Powers
                    condemning it.</p>
                <p>The last Congress held in Europe was that of 1856, which met in Paris to
                    terminate the Crimean war. Austria and Prussia, though not actual belligerents,
                    were admitted to take part in the deliberations and general acts of the
                    Congress, and for the first time in history the ambassadors of the Ottoman Porte
                    appeared at a European Congress, and were formally received into the concert of
                    the great powers. Count Walewski presided over this Congress, as minister of
                    foreign affairs of France; Lord Clarendon, British secretary of state, and Lord
                    Cowley were the representatives of England. In this Congress it was remarkable
                    that France, eager for peace and anxious to court the good-will of Russia, sided
                    with her recent adversary, and that the concessions obtained by the victorious
                    allies were due mainly to the firmness of the British plenipotentiaries. After
                    the conclusion of the negotiations for peace, the question of the maritime
                    rights of belligerents and neutrals was formally brought before the Congress, as
                    a body representing all the great powers of Europe; and a declaration was
                    signed. which has been discussed more fully in another place. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Declaration of Paris.)</hi> But this is an important example of
                    the authority which may be fitly assumed and exercised by a Congress, to
                    determine controverted questions of public law by a species of declaratory
                    enactment.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1863, the Emperor Napoleon formally proposed to the other great
                    Powers that a Congress should assemble in Paris for the purpose of settling
                    various ques tions, which appeared to threaten the future peace of Europe. To
                    this proposal the Continental states assented; but England gave a positive
                    refusal, on the ground, stated by Lord Russell, that such measures of
                    prospective legislation were more likely to embroil the several Powers than to
                    establish peace. The project was therefore abandoned; but the wars which ensued
                    in Denmark, in Austria, and in France, within the next seven years, justified
