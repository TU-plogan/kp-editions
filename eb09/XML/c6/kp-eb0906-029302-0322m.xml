                <p><label type="entry">CONSPIRACY</label>, in English law, is an agreement between
                    two or more persons to do certain wrongful acts, which may not, however, be
                    punishable when committed by a single person, not acting in concert with others.
                    The following are enumerated in text-books as the things, an agreement to do
                    which, made between several persons, constitutes the offence of conspiracy :—(1)
                    Falsely to charge another with a crime punishable by law, either from a
                    malicious or vindictive motive or feeling towards the party, or for the purpose
                    of extorting money from him; (2) wrongfully to injure or prejudice a third
                    person or any body of men in any other manner; (3) to commit any offence
                    punishable by law; (4) to do any act with intent to pervert the course of
                    justice; (5) to effect a legal purpose with a corrupt intent or by improper
                    means; to which are added (6) conspiracies or combinations among workmen to
                    raise wages.</p>
                <p>The division is not a perfect one, but a few examples under each of the heads
                    will indicate the nature of the offence in English law. First, a conspiracy to
                    charge a man falsely with any felony or misdemeanor is criminal; but an
                    agreement to prosecute a man who is guilty, or against whom there are reasonable
                    grounds for suspicion, is not. Under the second head the text-books give a great
                    variety of examples,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> mock auctions, where sham
                    bidders cause the goods to go off at prices grossly above their worth; a
                    conspiracy to raise the price of goods by spreading false rumours; a conspiracy
                    by persons to cause themselves tc be reputed men of property, in order to
                    deceive tradesmen: a conspiracy to cause by threats, contrivances, or othei
                    sinister means a pauper of one parish to marry a pauper oi another in order to
                    charge one of the parishes with th&lt; maintenance of both. These examples show
                    how wide the law stretches its conception of criminal agreement. Th&lt; third
                    head requires no explanation. A conspiracy t( murder is expressly made
                    punishable by penal servitud&lt; and imprisonment (24 and 25 Vict. c. 100). A
                    curiom example of conspiracy under the fourth head is the case ii which several
                    persons were convicted of conspiracy t&lt; procure another to rob one of them,
                    so that by convictin; the robber they might obtain the reward given in sue!
                    cases. The combination to effect a lawful purpose wit] corrupt intent or by
                    improper means is exemplified b; agreements to procure seduction, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The most important question in the law of conspiracy apart from the statute law
                    affecting labourers, is how fa things which may be lawfully done by individuals
                    caι become criminal when done by individuals acting in concert and some light
                    may be thrown on it by a short statemen of the history of the law. In the early
                    period of the lax down to the 17th century, conspiracy was defined by th
                    Ordinance of Conspirators of the 33 Edward I. :—“Con spirators be they that do
                    confedr or bind themselves b; oath, covenant, or other alliance, that every of
                    them shal aid the other falsely and maliciously to indite, or cause t&lt;
                    indite, or falsely to move or maintain pleas, and also sucl as cause children
                    within age to appeal men of felony whereby they are imprisoned and sore grieved,
                    and such a! retain men in the country with liveries or fees to maintair their
                    malicious enterprizes, and this extendeth as well t( the takers as to the
                    givers.” The offence aimed at here is conspiracy to indict or to maintain suits
                    falsely; and ii was held that a conspiracy under the Act was not complete,
                    unless some suit had been maintained or some person had been falsely indicted
                    and acquitted. A doctrine, however, grew up that the agreement was in itself
                    criminal, although the conspiracy was not actually completed (Poulterer’s case,
                    1611). This developed into the rule that any agreement to commit a crime might
                    be prosecuted as a conspiracy. A still further development of this doctrine is
                    that a combination might be criminal, although the object apart from combination
                    would not be criminal. The cases bearing on this question will be found arranged
                    under the following <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">Law of Criminal Conspiracies and Agreements,</hi> by It S. Wright
                    (London, 1873) :—Combinations against Government; combinations to defeat or
                    pervert justice; combinations against public morals or decency; combination to
                    defraud; combination to injure otherwise than by fraud; trade combinations. “It
                    is conceived,” says the author, “that on a review of all the decisions, there is
                    a great preponderance of authority in favour of the proposition that, <hi
                    rend="italic">as a ride,</hi> an agreement or combination is not criminal unless
                    it be for acts or omissions (whether as ends or means) which would be criminal
                    apart from agreement.” A dictum of Lord Denman’s is often quoted as supplying a
                    definition of conspiracy. It is, he says, either a combination to procure an
                    unlawful object, or to procure a lawful object by unlawful means; but the exact
                    meaning to be given to the word “lawful” in this antithesis has nowhere been
                    precisely stated. A thing may be unlawful in the sense that the law will not aid
                    it, although it may not expressly punish it. The extreme limit of the doctrine
                    is reached in the suggestion that a combination to hiss an actor at a theatre is
                    a punishable conspiracy.</p>
                <p>The application of this wide conception of conspiracy to trade disputes caused
                    great dissatisfaction among workmen. By the Master and Servant Act, 1867, breach
                    of contract of service might be made the subject of complaint before a
                    magistrate, who was empowered to impose a fine when he thought it necessary.
                    Trades unions were relieved from the stigma of illegality—which had hitherto
                    attached to them by reason of their being combinations “in restraint of
                    trade”—by the Trades Unions Act, 1871. In the same year the Criminal Law
                    Amendment Act (34 and 35 Viet, c. 32) specified certain acts which, if done
                    with, a view to coercing either master or workman, were to be punishable with
                    imprisonment. But in the meantime, the mere combination of workmen not to work
                    with a particular person was held by the judges to amount to a conspiracy at
                    common law (so held by Mr Baron Pollock at Leeds assizes in 1874). And the case
                    of the London gas stokers, who were in 1872 convicted of a conspiracy to break
                    their contract of service, directed attention to the question of punishing
                    breach of contract as a crime. The following extract from Mr Justice Brett’s
                    charge to the jury will show the view taken by the judge: “If you think there
                    was an agreement between the defendants to interfere with the masters by
                    molesting them so as to control their will, and if you think that molestation
                    was such as would be likely in the minds of men of ordinary nerve to deter them
                    from carrying on their business according to their own will, then that is an
                    illegal conspiracy.” Again “was there a combination to hinder the company from
                    carrying on and exercising their business by means of the men simultaneously
                    breaking their contracts of service! Breach of contract is an illegal, nay more,
                    it is a criminal act, and if they combined to interfere with their employers by
                    breaking their contracts this would be using unlawful means.” So in 1867, in the
                    case of Druett, it had been laid down that if any set of men agreed among
                    themselves to coerce the liberty of mind and thought of another by compulsion
                    and restraint, they would be guilty of a criminal offence. These judicial
                    opinions led to much agitation, which ended in the legislation of 1875. In that
                    year was passed the Act for amending the law relating to conspiracy and to the
                    protection of property, and for other purposes, 38 and 39 Vict. c. 86. This Act
                    was intended to regulate the criminal, as the Employers and Workmen Act of the
                    same year (c. 90) was intended to regulate the civil questions arising out of
                    the contract for service. The corresponding Acts of 1867 and 1871 are repealed.
                    The 38 and 39 Vict. c. 86 enacts (§ 3) that “an agreement or combination by two
                    or more persons to do, or procure to be done, any act in contemplation o’r
                    furtherance of a trade dispute between employers and workmen shall not be
                    indictable as a conspiracy, if such act committed by one person would not be
                    punishable as a crime. When a person is convicted of any such agreement or
                    combination to do an act which is punishable only on summary conviction, and is
                    sentenced to imprisonment, the imprisonment shall not exceed three months, or
                    such longer period, if any, as may have been prescribed by the statute for the
                    punishment of the said act when committed bý one person.” The effect of the two
                    Acts of 1875 is that breach of contract between master and workmen is to be
                    dealt with as a civil and not as a criminal case, with two exceptions. A person
                    employed on the supply of gas and water, breaking his contract with his
                    employer, and knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the
                    consequence of his doing so, either alone or in combination with others, will be
                    to deprive the inhabitants of the place wholly or to a great extent of their
                    supply of gas or water, shall be liable on conviction to a penalty not exceeding
                    £20, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months. And generally any
                    person wilfully and maliciously breaking a contract of service or hiring,
                    knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the probable consequences of
                    his so doing cither alone or in combination with others will be to endanger
                    human life or cause serious bodily injury, or to expose valuable property
                    whether real or personal to destruction or serious injury, shall be liable to
                    the same penalty. By section 7 every person who, with a view to compel any other
                    person to abstain from doing or to do any act which such other person has a
                    legal right to do or abstain from doing, wrongfully and without legal authority,
                    (1) uses violence to or intimidates such other person, or his wife and children,
                    or injures his property; or (2) persistently follows such other person about
                    from place to place; or (3) hides any tools, clothes, or other property owned or
                    used by such other person, or deprives him of or hinders him in the use thereof;
                    or (4) watches or besets the house or other place where such other person
                    resides, or works, or carries on business, or happens to be, or the approach to
                    such house or place; or (5) follows such other person with two or more other
                    persons, in a disorderly manner, in or through any street or road, shall be
                    liable to the before mentioned penalties. Of course a combination to do any of
                    these acts would be punishable as a conspiracy, as mentioned in section 3
                    above.</p>
                <p>Seamen are expressly exempted from the operation of this Act. The exceptions as
                    to contracts of service for the supply of gas and water, &amp;c., were supported
                    by the circumstances of the London gas stokers’ case above mentioned.</p>
                <p>Conspiracy at common law is a misdemeanour, and the punishment is fine or
                    imprisonment, or both, to which may be added hard labour in the case of any
                    conspiracy to cheat and defraud, or to extort money or goods, or falsely to
                    accuse of any crime, and to obstruct, pervert, prevent, or defeat the cause of
                    justice. Conspiracy to murder, whether the victim be a subject of the Queen or
                    resident in her dominions or not, is by 24 and 25 Vict. c. 100 punishable by
                    penal servitude. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. r.)</hi></p>
