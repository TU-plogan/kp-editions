                <p>The Cormorant (P. <hi rend="italic">carbo)</hi> frequents almost all tne seacoast
                    of Europe, and breeds in societies at various stations, most generally on steep
                    cliffs, but occasionally on rocky islands as well as on trees. The nest consists
                    of a large mass of sea-weed, and, with the ground immediately surrounding it,
                    generally looks as though bespattered with whitewash, from the excrement of the
                    bird, which lives entirely on fish. The eggs, from four to six in number, are
                    small, and have a thick, soft, calcareous shell, bluish-white when first laid,
                    but soon becoming discoloured. The young are hatched blind, and covered with an
                    inky-black skin. They remain for some time in the squab-condition, and are then
                    highly esteemed for food by the northern islanders, their flesh being said to
                    taste as well as a roasted hare’s. Their first plumage is of a sombre
                    brownish-black above, and more or less white beneath. They take two or three
                    years to assume the fully adult dress, wſhich is deep black, glossed above with
                    bronze, and varied in the breedingseason with white on the cheeks and flanks,
                    besides being adorned by filamentary feathers on the head, and further set off
                    by a bright yellow gape. The old Cormorant looks as big as a Goose, but is
                    really much smaller; its flesh is quite uneatable.</p>
                <p>Taken when young from the nest, this bird is easily tamed and can be trained to
                    fish for its keeper, as was of old time commonly done in England, where the
                    Master of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Some authors, following Caius, derive
                    the word from <hi rend="italic">corvus vorans</hi> and spell it Corvorant, but
                    doubtless wrongly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> So spelt since the days of Gesner; but possibly

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0437-0408"/> the Cormorants was one of the officers of the
                    royal household. Now-a-days the practice is nearly disused, though a few
                    gentlemen still follow it for their diversion. When taken out to furnish sport,
                    a strap is fastened round the bird’s neck so as, without impeding its breath, to
                    hinder it from swallowing its captures. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Arrived
                    at the waterside, it is cast off. It at once dives and darts along the bottom as
                    swiftly as an arrow in quest of its prey, rapidly scanning every hole or pool. A
                    fish is generally seized within a few seconds of its being sighted, and as each
                    is taken the bird rises to the surface with its capture in its bill. It does not
                    take much longer to dispose of the prize in the dilatable skin of its throat so
                    far as the strap will allow, and the pursuit is recommenced until the bird’s
                    gular pouch, capacious as it is, will hold no more. It then returns to its
                    keeper, who has been anxiously watching and encouraging its movements, and a
                    little manipulation of its neck effects the delivery of the booty. It may then
                    be let loose again, or, if considered to have done its work, it is fed and
                    restored to its perch. The activity the bird displays under water is almost
                    incredible to those who have not seen its performances, and in a shallow river
                    scarcely a fish escapes its keen eyes and sudden turns, except by taking refuge
                    under a stone or root, or in the mud that may be stirred up during the
                    operation, and so avoiding observation. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi></p>
                <p>Nearly allied to the Cormorant, and having much the same habits is the Shag, or
                    Green Cormorant of some writers <hi rend="italic">(P. graculus).</hi> Tlιe Shag
                    (which name in many parts of the world is used in a generic sense) is, however,
                    about one-fourth smaller in linear dimensions, is much more glossy in plumage,
                    and its nuptial embellishment is a nodding plume instead of the white patches of
                    the Cormorant. The easiest diagnostic on examination will be found to be the
                    number of tail-feathers, which in the former are fourteen and in the Shag
                    twelve. The latter, too, is more marine in the localities it frequents, scarcely
                    ever entering fresh or in deed inland waters.</p>
                <p>In the south of Europe a still smaller species <hi rend="italic">(F.
                    pygmaeus)</hi> is found. This is almost entirely a fresh-water bird, and is not
                    uncommon on the lower Danube. Other species, to the number perhaps of thirty or
                    more, have been discriminated from other parts of the world, but all have a
                    great general similarity to one another. New Zealand and the west coast of
                    Northern America are particularly rich in birds of this genus, and the species
                    found there are the most beautifully decorated of any. All, however, are
                    remarkable for their curiously-formed feet, the four toes of each being
                    connected by a web, for their long stiff tails, and for the absence, in the
                    adult, of any exterior nostrils. When gorged, or when the state of the tide
                    precludes fishing, they are fond of sitting on an elevated perch, often with
                    extended wings, and in this attitude they will remain motionless for a
                    considerable time, as though hanging themselves out to dry, but hardly, as the
                    fishermen report, sleeping the while. It was perhaps this peculiarity that
                    struck the observation of Milton, and prompted his well-known similitude of
                    Satan to a Cormorant <hi rend="italic">(Farad. Lost,</hi> iv. 191); but when not
                    thus behaving they themselves provoke the more homely comparison of a row of
                    black bottles. Their voracity is proverbial. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.
