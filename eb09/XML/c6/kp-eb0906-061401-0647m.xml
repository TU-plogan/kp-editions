                    Germ. <hi rend="italic">Kreutzschnabf),</hi> the name given to a genus of birds,
                    belonging to the family <hi rend="italic">Fringillidce,</hi> or Finches, from
                    the unique peculiarity they possess among the whole class of having the horny
                    sheaths of the bill crossing one another obliquely,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> As an accidental malformation, however, the
                    peculiarity has been many times observed in other groups of birds, and
                    especially in the Crows <hi rend="italic">(Corvidae).</hi> Such cases may be
                    well compared to the monstrosity often seen in Rabbits and other members of the
                    Order <hi rend="italic">Givres,</hi> wherein the incisor teeth grow to
                    inordinate length.</p></note> whence the appellation <hi rend="italic"
                    >Loxia</hi> (Äo£óç, <hi rend="italic">obliquus),</hi> conferred by Gesner on the
                    group and continued by Linnaeus. At first sight this singular structure appears
                    so like a deformity that writers have not been wanting to account it such,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> The special animosity of De
                    Buffon on this point may perhaps be explained by the existence of a mediaeval
                    legend (of which, however, be it said, he takes no notice), best known to
                    English readers byÄ1ι Longfellow’s pretty version of Mosen’s poem, to the effect
                    that the bird acquired its peculiar conformation of bill and coloration of
                    plumage in recognition of the pity it bestowed on the suffering Saviour at tho
                    crucifixion·.</p></note> ignorant of its being a piece of mechanism most
                    beautifully adapted to the habits of the bird, enabling it to extract with the
                    greatest ease, from fir-cones or fleshy fruits, the seeds which form its usual
                    and almost invariable food. Its mode of using this unique instrument seems to
                    have been first described by Townson <hi rend="italic">(Tracts on Nat.
                    Hist.,</hi> p. 116, London: 1799), but only partially, and it was Yarrell who,
                    in 1829 <hi rend="italic">(Zool.</hi><hi rend="italic">Journ.,</hi> iv. ρp.
                    457-465, pl. xiv. figs, l--7), explained fully the means whereby the jaws and
                    the muscles which direct their movements become so effective in riving asunder
                    cones or apples, while at the proper moment the scoop-like tongue is
                    instantaneously thrust out and withdrawn, conveying the hitherto protected seed
                    to the bird’s mouth. Without going into details it may be observed that in the
                    Crossbills the articulation of the mandible to the quadrate-bone is such as to
                    allow of a very considerable amount of lateral play, and, by a particular
                    arrangement of the muscles which move the former, it comes to pass that so soon
                    as the bird opens its mouth the point of the mandible is brought immediately
                    opposite to that of the maxilla (which itself is movable vertically), instead of
                    crossing or overlapping it—the usual position when the mouth is closed. The two
                    points thus meeting, the bill is inserted between the scales or into the pome,
                    but on opening the mouth still more widely, the lateral motion of the mandible
                    is once more brought to bear with great force to wrench aside the portion of the
                    fruit attacked, and then the action of the tongue completes the operation, which
                    is so rapidly performed as to defy scrutiny, except on very close inspection.
                    Fortunately the birds soon become tame in confinement, and a little patience
                    will enable an attentive observer to satisfy himself as to the process, the
                    result of which at first seems almost as unaccountable as that of a clever
                    conjuring trick.</p>
                <p>The Common Crossbill of the Palaearctic Region <hi rend="italic">(Loxia
                    curvirostra)</hi> is about the size of a Skylark, but more stoutly built. The
                    young (which on leaving the nest have not the tips of the bill crossed) are of a
                    dull olive colour with indistinct dark stripes on the lower parts, and the
                    quills oi the wings and tail dusky. After the first moult the difference between
                    the sexes is shown by the hens inclining tc yellowish-green, while the cocks
                    become diversified by orange-yellow and red, their plumage finally deepening
                    into a rich crimson-red, varied in places by a flame-colour. Their glowing hues
                    are, however, speedily lost by examples which may be kept in confinement, and
                    are replaced by a dull ofange, or in some cases by a bright golden-yellow, and
                    specimens have, though rarely, occurred in a wild state exhibiting the same
                    tints. The cause of these changes is at present obscure, if not unknown, and it
                    must be admitted that their sequence has been disputed by some excellent
                    authorities, but the balance of evidence is certainly in favour of the above
                    statement. Depending mainly for <pb break="no"

                    Crossbills are irregular beyond those of most birds, and they would seem to rove
                    in any direction and at any season in quest of their staple sustenance. But the
                    pips of apples are also a favourite dainty, and it stands recorded by the old
                    chronicler Matthew Paris <hi rend="italic">(Hist.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Λngl.</hi> MS. fol. 252), that in 1251 the orchards of England were ravaged by
                    birds, “pomorum grana, &amp; non aliud de eisdem pomis comedentes,” which, from
                    his description, “Habebant autem partes rostri cancellatas, per quas poma quasi
                    forcipi vel cultello dividebant,” could be none other but Crossbills. Notice of
                    a like visitation in 1593 was published by Wats <hi rend="italic">(Vit.</hi> 2
                    <hi rend="italic">Oſfar.</hi> &amp;c., 1640, p. 262), but of late it has become
                    evident that not a year passes without Crossbills being observed in some part or
                    other of England, while in certain localities in Scotland they seem to breed
                    annually. The nest is rather rudely constructed, and the eggs, generally four in
                    number, resemble those of the Greenfinch, but are larger in size. This species
                    ranges throughout the continent of Europe,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> Dr Malmgren found a small flock on Bear Island (lat. 74⅜

                    Mediterranean and in the fir-woods of the Atlas. In Asia it would seem to extend
                    to Kamtschatka and Japan, keeping mainly to the forest-tracts.</p>
                <p>Three other forms of the genus also inhabit the Old World—two of them so closely
                    resembling the common bird that their specific validity has been often
                    questioned. The first of these, of large stature, the Parrot-Crossbill <hi
                    rend="italic">(L. pityopsittacus),</hi> comes occasionally to Great Britain,
                    presumably from Scandinavia, where it is known to breed. The second (2λ <hi
                    rend="italic">himalayana),</hi> which is a good deal smaller, is only known from
                    the Himalaya Mountains. The third, the Two-barred Crossbill <hi rend="italic"
                    >(L. taenioptera),</hi> is very distinct, and its proper home seems to be the
                    most northern forests of the Russian empire, but it has occasionally occurred in
                    Western Europe and even in England.</p>
                <p>The New World has two birds of the genus. The first <hi rend="italic">(L.
                    ameriaeanſ),</hi> representing our common species, but with a smaller bill, and
                    the males easily recognizable by their more scarlet plumage, ranges from the
                    northern limit of coniferous trees to the highlands of Mexico, or even further.
                    The other <hi rend="italic">(L. leucoptera)</hi> is the equivalent of the
                    Two-barred Crossbill, but smaller. It has twice occurred in England. <hi
