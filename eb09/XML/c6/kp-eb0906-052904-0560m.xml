                    religious and political movement belongs to the history of Scotland. There were
                    several successive Covenants, similar in spirit and expression, the most
                    important historically being the National Covenant of 1638 and the Solemn League
                    and Covenant of 1643. These were both based upon earlier documents. In 1581 the
                    General Assembly of Scotland adopted a confession of faith, or national
                    covenant, drawn up by John Craig, condemning Episcopal government, under the
                    name of hierarchy. This covenant was signed by James I. and enjoined on all his
                    subjects. It was again subscribedin 1590 and 1596. The subscription was renewed
                    in 1638, and the subscribers engaged by oath to maintain religion in the same
                    state in which it existed in 1580, and to reject all innovations introduced
                    since that time. This oath annexed to the confession of faith of 1581 received
                    the name of the National Covenant. The additional matter was prepared by
                    Johnston of Warriston and Alexander Henderson, and was intended to suit the
                    document to the special circumstances of the time. It was adopted and signed by
                    a large gathering in Greyfriars’ Churchyard, Edinburgh, on the 28th February,
                    and copies were sent next day throughout the country for additional signatures.
                    The Solemn League and Covenant was established in the year 1643, and formed a
                    bond between Scotland, England, and Ireland for the united preservation of the
                    Reformed religion in the Church of Scotland, the reformation of religion in
                    England and Ireland “according to the Word of God and the example of the best
                    Reformed churches,” and the extirpation of Popery and Prelacy. It was sworn and
                    subscribed by many in both nations, approved by the Parliament and. Assembly at
                    Westminster, and ratified by the General Assembly of Scotland in 1645. King
                    Charles I. disapproved of it when he surrendered himself to the Scottish army in
                    1646; but in 1650 Charles II. by a solemn oath declared his approbation both of
                    this and of the National Covenant; and in August the same year he made a further
                    declaration at Dunfermline to the same purpose, which was renewed on the
                    occasion of his coronation at Scone in 1651. In the same year also the covenant
                    was ratified by Parliament, and subscription to it required from every
                    member,—it being declared that without such subscription the constitution of the
                    Parliament was null and void. It was afterwards renounced by Charles, and
                    declared illegal by 13 and 14 Car. II. c. 4 (1662).</p>
                <p>The two Covenants are usually published along with the Westminster Confession of
                    Faith, though they are not now included among the authoritative symbols of any
                    Presbyterian church. See λl <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Crie <hi
