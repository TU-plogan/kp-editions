                    well-known result of the application of the historical method to laws and
                    institutions, that it has reversed many of our leading conceptions of the
                    natural or original forms of property. That the primitive form of property in
                    land was not severalty but commonalty, that land was held not by individuals but
                    by communities, and that individual ownership was slowly evolved out of common
                    ownership, are propositions as nearly as possible the opposite of our <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> ideas on the subject. The existence of rights of
                    common is one of the traces of the ancient system still remaining in our law,
                    but its real significance w as for a long time obscured by the feudal theories
                    on which the law of real property is based.</p>
                <p>There seems to be good reason to believe that among the English, as among other
                    Teutonic nations, the system of land-holding by village communities prevailed.
                    For an account of that system reference may be made to Sir H. Maine’s lectures,
                    or to the short essay by Professor Nasse, a translation of which has been
                    published by the Cobden Club <hi rend="italic">(On the Agricultural Community of
                    the Middle Ages).</hi> It may be sufficient to state here the bare outlines of
                    the system. The “mark,” or territory occupied by the community, <pb break="no"

                    township, where were the houses held by heads of families in severalty; (2) The
                    arable land, divided into several plots, but subject to regulations as to common
                    cultivation—the most usual of which is the three-field system; the land was to
                    be fallow every third year, and the whole community had rights of pasturage on
                    the fallow portion, and on the stubble of the fields under crop at certain
                    portions of the year between harvest and seed-time; (3) The meadowland, which in
                    like manner was common for a period after the hay harvest, and was afterwards
                    fenced off in separate allotments for the new crop; (4) The common or waste
                    land, not appropriated for cultivation, and over which the community had rights
                    of pasturage, wood-cutting, &lt;fcc. After the Conquest we find the mark
                    superseded by the manor, and although it has long been the fashion to find the
                    absolute beginning of the latter system in the Conquest, there seems to be good
                    reason to believe that its leading elements—the ideas of lordship and tenure—had
                    been developed among the Anglo-Saxons themselves (see Digby’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction to the History of the Law of Real Property).</hi> At all events,
                    the manorial system became defined and fixed under the Norman lawyers, and
                    remains still the legal basis of property in land. All land is regarded as being
                    held of the king, and the king’s tenants might have tenants of their own. The
                    practice of sub-infeudation, as it was called, was stopped by the statute <hi
                    rend="italic">Quia</hi><hi rend="italic">Emptores,</hi> 1290, which enacted
                    that, when a lord alienated a portion of his land, the alienee, instead of being
                    tenant of the alienor, should take his place as tenant to the lord next above
                    him. Since this statute, therefore, no new manors could be created. All lands
                    were supposed tobe traceable originally to a grant from the king. Out of the
                    lands so granted to him, the lord would grant certain portions to free tenants
                    on certain rents and services, and these are the freeholders of the manor. His
                    own portion would be cultivated by <hi rend="italic">villains,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">serfs,</hi> attached to the soil, and these ultimately developed
                    into the important class of copyholders. There remains the uncultivated and
                    unappropriated land, over which the freeholders had certain rights of common
                    supposed to be incident to their original grant. Within the manor were certain
                    courts (Court Leet, Court Baron, Customary Court), the most important of which
                    is the Court Baron, or assembly of the freeholders, partly judicial and partly
                    administrative. It is regarded by the common law as the inseparable concomitant
                    of a manor, so that if there be no Court Baron there is no manor. The historical
                    investigations to which we have referred point to the identity of the Court
                    Baron with the assembly of the village community. The lord’s waste in like
                    manner represents the common waste of the community not appropriated in
                    severalty, and used by all in common for pasturage, &amp;c. The legal theory,
                    however, supposes that the whole organization is created by grant; the lord is
                    the owner of the soil, and the rights of tenants are merely such as he has
                    granted to them out of consideration for rents and services reserved. Whatever
                    has not been so granted belongs as a matter of course to the lord. The rights of
                    common come to be regarded as of the nature of servitudes— <hi rend="italic"
                    >-jura in</hi><hi rend="italic">alieno</hi><hi rend="italic">solo—</hi>
                    exceptional privileges granted over land by its real owner to his tenants.</p>
                <p>Rights of common enjoyed by the freeholders of the manor as incident to their
                    tenure are said to be <hi rend="italic">appendant,</hi> or attached to their
                    holdings. Rights of common not coeval with the original grant, or enjoyed by
                    strangers in respect of land not belonging to the manor at all, are said to be
                    <hi rend="italic">appurtenant.</hi> Rights claimed irrespectively of land
                    altogether are called rights of common <hi rend="italic">in gross.</hi> Similar
                    rights in copyholders depend on the <hi rend="italic">custom</hi> of the
                    manor.</p>
                <p>The most important right of common is <hi rend="italic">Common of Pasture,</hi>
                    which if <hi rend="italic">appendant</hi> can only be claimed for beasts useful
                    for tillage—such as horses, oxen, and sheep,—and in respect of arable land only
                    (for manure); if <hi rend="italic">appurtenant,</hi> it may extend to swine,
                    goats, and geese, &lt;kc., and is not confined to arable land; if <hi
                    rend="italic">in gross,</hi> it is subject to no restriction as to the species
                    of beasts. The claim must be for some number limited and defined, and where no
                    number is fixed, it is restricted to beasts <hi rend="italic">levant</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">couchant</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a phrase which,
                    according to judicial interpretation, means such cattle as the winter eatage of
                    the tenement, together with the hay, &amp;c., obtained from it in summer, could
                    support. Some lands are subject to this common of pasture during certain
                    portions of the year only— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the case of
                    lammas-lands from the 1st of August, for eight months after which they are held
                    in severalty. This arrangement may be compared with what is said of the village
                    community above. Such lands are said to be <hi rend="italic">commonable.</hi><hi

                <p>In some manors there is a right of digging and taking coals, minerals, &amp;c.
                    Subject to these rights, everything belongs to the Jord of the manor, and a
                    custom to exclude him from all manner of profit would be held void as being
                    unreasonable.</p>
                <p>In our earliest legislation on the subject of commons, the rights of the commoner
                    appear to have a firmer footing than the theory which derives them from the
                    grant of the lord would lead us to expect. The Statute of ’½erton (1235) gives
                    relief to the lords whose <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> ∏orts to improve their
                    wastes have been frustrated by commoners bringing an assize of novel disseisin
                    for their pasture, and the lord in such cases was to be held blameless if
                    sufficient pasture, with ingress and egress, had been provided. It only applied,
                    as we learn from the criticism of Bracton, to <hi rend="italic">common
                    appendant,</hi> and to cases where the right is expressly limited in number or
                    kind. The Statute of Westminster the second (1285) extended it to rights <hi
                    rend="italic">appurtenant.</hi> Under these statutes inclosures can be made on
                    the following conditions only :—</p>
                <p>1. It must be proved that sufficient pasturage has been left for the
                    commoners.</p>
                <p>2. If there is common of pasture in gross, inclosure cannot be made.</p>
                <p>3. The statutes do not authorize inclosures which would infringe upon any other
                    common rights, as turbary, piscary, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>4. They do not affect copyholders. . '</p>
                <p>(See <hi rend="italic">Six Essays on the Preservation of Commons).</hi></p>
                <p>It will be observed that, in relation to the rights described, the lord and the
                    commoners are the only parties recognized by the law. The public in general have
                    no rights. It has been alleged, indeed, that the immemorial use of open space»
                    near large towns by the inhabitants for exercise and recreation raises the
                    presumption of a dedication—a question we need not discuss here. It is chiefly,
                    however, in connection with the needs of the public, especially of the
                    inhabitants of large towns, that the law of commons is still a subject of some
                    practical importance. Until quite recently the inclosure of commons was regarded
                    as a matter affecting the lord alone, or at most the lord and the commoners. Of
                    late, the interest of the public at large in preserving the commons uninclosed
                    has been strenuously asserted, and as we shall see has been recognized in
                    legislation.</p>
                <p>At common law, in spite of the predominance given to the rights of the lord,
                    there was no means of converting the common or any portion of it into the
                    severalty of the lord, unless to a comparatively small extent, under the
                    Statutes of Merton and Westminster the second. The in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n237/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0237-0210"/> crease of population and the growing need for
                    food-producing land made it the interest of the lord, and it may be considered
                    of the public also, that much of the common ground should be brought under
                    cultivation. Down to the year 1800 this was effected by private Inclosure Acts,
                    of which there were as many as 1600 or 1700. The provisions which it had been
                    customary to insert in these special Acts were in 1801, after the manner of
                    which we have so many examples, consolidated in Sir John Sinclair’s Inclosure
                    Act, 41 Geo. III. c. 109. At this time the inclosure and cultivation of common
                    lands were looked forward to as a means of increasing the national wealth. It is
                    not till 1836 that we find any recognition of the desirability, on public
                    grounds, of preventing inclosures under certain circumstances, viz., in the 6
                    and 7 Will. IV. c. 115, for facilitating the inclosure of open and arable fields
                    (which applied to what have been called commonable lands and not to manorial
                    wastes). The 55th section forbids inclosures within ten miles of London, or
                    within corresponding distances of smaller towns. Subject to the provisions of
                    these Acts about 2000 private Inclosure Acts had been passed, when in 1845 came
                    the General Inclosure Act, 8 and 9 Vict. c. 148. Its object is stated to be to
                    facilitate the inclosure and improvement of commons and other lands, now subject
                    to rights of property, which obstruct cultivation and the productive employment
                    of labour, &amp;c. Commissioners are to be appointed who shall judge of the
                    expedience of ail inclosure and superintend its execution. All common lands are
                    brought within the scope of the Act, but manorial wastes are not to be inclosed
                    without the previous sanction of Parliament, which was also made necessary for
                    inclosures within fifteen miles of L?î?don, or within two miles of any city of
                    10,000 inhabitants, or vΓii⅛ two and a half miles of any city of 20,000
                    inhabitants, and sô on. (A later Act, 15 and 16 Vict. c. 79, made the consent of
                    parliament necessary in all cases under this Act.) Village greens are not to be
                    inclosed, and by § 30 the commissioners are authorized to require, as one of the
                    conditions of the inclosure, the appropriation of an allotment for the exercise
                    and recreation of the neighbourhood on the following scale :—In a parish of
                    10,000 inhabitants not more than 10 acres; between 5000 and 10,000 inhabitants
                    not more than 8 acres; between 2000 and 5000 not more than 5 acres; and under
                    2000 not more than 4. Allotments might also be made for the labouring poor.
                    Under this Act inclosures proceed ed apace, and the commissioners have been
                    accused of unduly favouring inclosure, and neglecting the powers with which they
                    were intrusted for the protection of the public. Alluding to this feeliug the
                    Home Secretary (Mr Cross), in proposing the Bill which afterwards became the Act
                    of 1876, stated that of 414,000 acres which had been inclosed under the Act less
                    than 4000 had been dedicated to purposes of recreation aud exercise, and he
                    admitted that, whereas inclosures had formerly been treated as a private estate
                    improvement to which the owner was entitled, a great change of opinion had taken
                    place as to the rights of the public. This feeling found expression in the
                    Metropolitan Commons Act, 1866, which absolutely prohibits all further incíosure
                    of metropolitan commons, and facilitates schemes for the management and
                    improvement of such commons for the benefit of the public, due compensation
                    being made for beneficial interests affected thereby. This, it will be observed,
                    is a complete change of attitude. Whereas the lord was formerly treated as the
                    real owner, and allowed to buy off partial interests, the public is now placed
                    in that position, and the lord becomes an encumbrancer, to be bought off like
                    any other.</p>
                <p>The revival of public interest in commons led to resistance being offered in
                    courts of law to the unauthorized inclosure of commons by lords of the man∏r.
                    One of the most important of these cases is that of Warrick <hi rend="italic"
                    >v.</hi> Queen’s College, Oxford (6 <hi rend="italic">Chancery Appeals,</hi>
                    716), in which the plaintiff, as a freeholder of the manor of Plumstead,
                    obtained a decree against the defendants, who had inclosed a portion of the
                    common of the manor. The judgment of the Lord Chancellor (Hatherley) on that
                    occasion contains a statement of the view now taken by the courts of claims to
                    rights of common. In the Commissioners of Sewers <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Glasse, the Corporation of London defeated attempted inclosures in Epping
                    Forest.</p>
                <p>In 1869, a committee of the House of Commons presented a report on metropolitan
                    commons, and many of their recommendations have been embodied in the Inclosure
                    Act 1876, of which the following are the chief provisions. The preamble of the
                    Commons Act 1876 states that, under the Inclosure Acts 1845 to 1868, the
                    commissioners are empowered to authorize, by provisional orders subject to
                    assent of Parliament, the inclosure of commons, provided the inclosure is made
                    on such terms as may be necessary for the protection of public interests, and
                    provided they are of opinion that such inclosure is expedient, having regard to
                    the benefit of the neighbourhood; and that it is desirable that circumstances
                    bearing on the expediency of the proposed inclosure should be more fully brought
                    under the notice of the commissioners, and that inclosure of commons in
                    severalty should not be made unless the commissioners are satisfied that it
                    would be of benefit to the neighbourhood as well as to private interests, and
                    that further effect ought to be given to the provisions relating to allotments
                    for purposes of exercise and recreation. The commissioners may entertain
                    applications either for (1) the regulation or (2) the inclosùre of a common. The
                    regulation incltidgs the adjustment of rights and the improvement of a common;
                    and the latter comprises (1) draining, manuring, and levelling the common, (2)
                    planting trees, or otherwise beautifying it, (3) making bye-laws, (4) general
                    management, and (5) appointment of conservators. In case of “inclosure,” as well
                    as “regulation,” the commissioners may insert provisions for the benefit of the
                    neighbourhood, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the securing free access to
                    particular points of view, preserving trees or historical objects, reserving
                    playing-grounds, making roads, àc. In the case of suburban commons <hi
                    rend="italic">(iae.,</hi> situated within six miles of any town) the sanitary
                    authority shall be represented. The commissioners are directed to require
                    evidence as to the benefit of the neighbourhood, and, in the case of inclosure,
                    information as to the advantages of inclosure as compared with regulation. Rules
                    are provided for inspecting the common, holding meetings, &amp;c. The
                    provisional order shall contain all the statutory provisions for the benefit of
                    the neighbourhood that are applicable to the case, and, where the common to be
                    inclosed is waste land of a manor, a description of the allotments for
                    recreation ground. Compensation must be provided for private interests affected
                    by the order. Two-thirds of the persons whose interests are affected must assent
                    to the order, and in the case of a manorial waste the lord must consent, or his
                    representative in interest, before the commissioners can certify the expediency
                    of the order. When the freemen of a town have interests in the common, the
                    consent of two-thirds of them must be obtained. The Inclosure Acts are amended
                    by certain sections relating to field-gardens and recreation-grounds.
                    Encroachments on or inclosure of village-greens are to be deemed a public
                    nuisance. Illegal inclosures on commons settled under this Act are within the
                    jurisdiction of the county court. Persons intending to inclose a common
                    otherwise than under this Act must give three months’ notice of their intention
                    by advertisement. The section of the Inclosure Act 1845 which fixes a limit to
                    allotments for recreation-grounds is repealed. The Act does not apply to
                    metropolitan commons. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. k.)</hi><pb break="no"
