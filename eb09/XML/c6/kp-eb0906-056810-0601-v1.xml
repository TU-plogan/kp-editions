                <p><label type="entry">CRESWICK, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, an
                    English landscape painter (1811-1869), was born at Sheffield, and educated at
                    Hazelwood, near Birmingham. At Birmingham he first began to paint. His earliest
                    appearance as an exhibitor was in 1827, at the Society υf British Artists in
                    London; in the ensuing year he sent to the Royal Academy the two pictures named
                    Llyn Gwynant, Morning, and Carnarvon Castle. About the same time he settled in
                    London; and in 1836 he took a house in Bayswater. He soon attracted some
                    attention as a landscape-painter, and had a career of uniform and encouraging,
                    though not signal success. In 1842 he was elected an associate, and in 1850 a
                    full member of the Royal Academy, which, for several years before his death,
                    numbered hardly any other full members representating this branch of art. In his
                    early practice he set an example, then too much needed, of diligent study of
                    nature out of doors, painting on the spot all the substantial part of several of
                    his pictures. English and Welsh streams may be said to have formed his favourite
                    subjects, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n602/mode/1up"

                    under its cheerful, calm, and pleasurable aspects, in open daylight. This he
                    rendered with elegant and equable skill, colour rather grey in tint, especially
                    in his later years, and more than average technical accomplishment; his works
                    have little to excite, but would, in most conditions of public taste, retain
                    their power to attract. Creswick was industrious and extremely prolific; he
                    produced, besides a steady outpouring of paintings, numerous illustrations for
                    books. He was personally genial,—a dark, bulky man, somewhat heavy and graceless
                    in aspect in his later years. He died at his house in Bayswater, Linden Grove,
                    December 28, 1869, after a few years of declining health. Among his principal
                    works may be named England, 1847; Home by the Sands, and a Squally Day, 1848;
                    Passing Showers, 1849; the Wind on Shore, a First Glimpse of the Sea, and Old
                    Trees, 1850; a Mountain Lake, Moonrise, 1852; Changeable Weather, 1865; also the
                    London Road, a Hundred Years ago; the Weald of Kent; the Valley Mill (a Cornish
                    subject); a Shady Glen; the Windings of a River; the Shade of the Beech Trees;
                    the Course of the Greta; the Wharfe; Glendalough, and other Irish subjects, 1836
                    to 1840; the Forest Farm. Mr Frith for figures, and Mr Ansdell for animals,
                    occasionally worked iij collaboration with Creswick.</p>
