                    narrow strait of Bonifacio), between 41° 20' and 43° N. lat., and 8° 30' and 9°
                    30' E. long. Population, 258,507. It lies within 51 miles west of the coast of
                    Tuscany, 98 miles south of Genoa, and 106 miles south-east of the French coast
                    at Nice. Tho extreme length of the island is 116 miles, and its breadth 52
                    miles; and it has an area of 3376 squire miles—about one-third of the extent of
                    Sardinia. The greater part of the surface of Corsica is occupied by a central
                    range of lofty and rugged mountains, diverging in all directions, the highest
                    peaks being Monts Cinto (8889 feet), Rotondo (8609), Pagliorba (8284), Padro
                    (7846), and d’Oro (7841). On the west and south of the island the spurs of this
                    range either terminate abruptly on the shore or run out to a great distance into
                    the sea, forming bays and gulfs, some of which afford excellent harbours. The
                    prevailing rocks are of granite, gneiss, and mica slate, with occasional beds of
                    syenite, porphyry, and serpentine. Minerals are not worked to any great extent,
                    although lead is found in some quantity at Luri, antimony at Ersa, and copper at
                    Bastia, Ponte Leecia, &amp;c. On the eastern side of the island, between Bastia
                    and Porto Vecchio, there intervenes between the mountains and the sea a
                    considerable tract of low country, where there are plantations of olive trees,
                    almond and fig trees, and vineyards. The oil produced is, however, not of the
                    best quality, and much of the wine is exported to France in a raw state for the
                    manufacture of liqueurs. Corsica is well watered with rivers, which, though
                    short in their course, bring down large volumes of water from the mountains. The
                    longest is the Golo (the Tavola of the Romans), which enters the sea on the east
                    coast through the large salt-water lake of Biguglia; further south on the same
                    side of the island are the Tavignano and the Rezzanese; while on the east side
                    is the Taravo. The other streams are all comparatively small. From the rugged
                    and indented outline of the coast there arc an unusual number of bays and
                    harbours. Of the former the most important on the western side of the island are
                    Porto, Sagone, Aiaccio, and Propriano; of the latter, St Florent, Ile Rousse,
                    Calvi, and Ajaccio. On the eastern side, which is much less rugged and broken,
                    the only harbours worth mentioning are Bastia and Porto Vecchio (the Portus
                    Syracusanus <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the ancients), and the only gulf that of
                    Santa Manza. At the extreme south are the harbour and town of Bonifacio, giving
                    name to the strait which separates Corsica fron ’ Sardinia.</p>
                <p>Of the internal resources of the island the most important consist of those vast
                    forests that cover the summits of the hills, and which furnished timber for tho
                    navies of antiquity. Partly, however, from the indolence of the inhabitants, and
                    partly from the difficulties of land carriage, this source of wealth is
                    comparatively neglected. The mountain pastures are made available for the
                    rearing of cattle, horses, asses, and mules. Sheep of a peculiar black breed,
                    called <hi rend="italic">mufflons,</hi> inhabit the more inaccessible parts of
                    the mountains, and goats and pigs abound in the island. The uncultivated
                    districts are generally overgrown with a thick tangled underwood, consisting of
                    arbutus, myrtle, thorn, laurel, broom, and other shrubs, and called by the
                    natives <hi rend="italic">maquis,</hi> which, however, is easily cleared off by
                    burning. Throughout the island the growth of the cereal crops is generally
                    abandoned for the easier cultivation of the olive and vine. Chestnuts constitute
                    an important artie’e of food, but wheat, maize, and barley are <pb break="no"

                    agriculture is caused principally by the minute subdivision of the land, a
                    system which perpetuates the social evils of hereditary feuds and jealousies, by
                    which Corsica has long been distracted. A large proportion of the exports of the
                    island consists of honey and wax, which are procured from the forests. The
                    former of these has a somewhat bitter flavour, from the yew and box trees on
                    which the bees feed. Beyond the making of oil, wine, soap, bricks, and coarse
                    glass, the Corsicans are entirely destitute of manufacturing industry, and their
                    commerce consists for the most part of the spontaneous produce of the island.
                    The fisheries of tunny, pilchard, and anchovy are extensively prosecuted for the
                    supply of the Italian markets; but comparatively few of the native Corsicans are
                    engaged in this department of industry. The Government have constructed 700
                    miles of excellent roads <hi rend="italic">(Routes N ationales),</hi> round the
                    entire island, and crossing it at various points, by which regular communication
                    is maintained by means of diligences. Corsica, which forms a department of
                    France, is divided into five arrondissements, subdivided and peopled as follows

                <p>Of this number 130,406 were males and 128,101 females; and compared w ith the
                    census of 1851, the total population has increased by 22,256 souls, or nearly 9
                    per cent, in twenty-one years.</p>
                <p>The principal towns are Ajaccio (pop. 16,545), the capital and the seat of the
                    bishop of the island (who is under the archbishop of Aix), the prefect, and the
                    com mander of the forces; Bastia (pop. 17,850), Corte (5430), and Sartene
                    (4166). Education is very backward among the islanders, about 40 per cent, being
                    returned as unable to read or write. There are, however, several colleges, such
                    as the lyceum of Bastia, the College Fesch of Ajaccio, the College de Calvi, and
                    the Ecole Paoli de Corte. The people are sober in their habits, but not
                    enterprizing and without much knowledge of sanitary laws. Their proneness to
                    agrarian outrages has brought upon them an evil repute, but thanks to the
                    strenuous efforts of the French Government this spirit of lawlessness has been
                    greatly curbed. A great part of the agricultural labour is performed by
                    labourers from Tuscany and Lucca, who periodically visit the island for that
                    purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> It is not known who the
                    original inhabitants of Corsica were. The Phocaeans of Ionia were the first
                    civilized people that established settlements in Corsica. About the year 560 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> they landed for the first time on the island, and
                    founded the city of Aleria, which after a short occupation they were compelled
                    to abandon. After an interval of a few years they again returned, rebuilt
                    Aleria, which they fortified, and endeavoured to maintain their ground against
                    the natives. After a struggle of some years they were again compelled to leave
                    the island. The next foreign occupants of Corsica were the Tuscans, who founded
                    the city of Nicaea, but they in their turn were compelled to give way before the
                    growing maritime power of the Carthaginians, whose jurisdiction in the island
                    was unquestioned till the beginning of the first Punic war. On that occasion the
                    Romans sent out a fleet, drove the Carthaginians from the island, and exacted at
                    least a nominal homage from the native population. They did not, however, fully
                    establish their power here till about thirty years later, and even then
                    rebellions and revolts were of constant occurrence. The first step made towards
                    the real subjugation of the island was the establishment of the two colonies on
                    its eastern coast—that of Aleria by Sulla, and that of Mariana by Marius. In the
                    time of the emperors, the island had fallen into disrepute among the Romans, by
                    whom it was used chiefly as a place of banishment for political offenders. One
                    of the most distinguished of these sufferers was the younger Seneca, who spent
                    in exile here the eight years ending 49 À <hi rend="smallcaps">d.</hi></p>
                <p>On the downfall of the Roman empire in the West, Corsica passed into the hands of
                    the Vandals. These barbarians were driven out by Belisarius, but after the death
                    of that illustrious general, 565 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d,</hi> the resistless
                    hordes of Attila once more gained possession of the island. Since that period it
                    has successively owned the dominion of the Goths, the Saracens, the Pisans, and
                    the Genoese. The impress of the last is to be found in the style of the church
                    architecture and notably in the <hi rend="italic">patois</hi> of the people;
                    while the armorial crest of the island, a Moor’s head, is ascribable to the
                    Saracen occupation. Corsica was ceded by the Genoese to the French in 1768; and
                    for a few years after the French Revolution of 1793 it was placed under the
                    protection of Great Britain. Since 1814 it has been in undisturbed possession of
                    the French. Corsica is famous as the birthplace of Pascal Paoli and of Napoleon
                    Bonaparte.</p>
