                    priest at Norwich in 1514. On the promulgation of the Reformed opinions at
                    Cambridge, Coverdale was amongst the first to abandon his allegiance to the
                    Church of Rome; and probably finding it unsafe to remain in England, he went
                    abroad, and according to Foxe assisted Tyndale in translating the Bible. There
                    seems, however, to be some reason to doubt Foxe’s statement, which is entirely
                    unsupported by corroborative evidence. Coverdale remained in total obscurity
                    until 1535, when he published his own translation, with a dedication to Henry
                    VIII., who had now come to an irreparable breach with the Pope. This was the
                    earliest translation of the whole Bible in the English language, and the Psalms
                    in it are those which are now usedin the Book of Common Prayer. Although it is
                    not an immediate version of the original (the title bearing that it is “truly
                    translated out of Douche and Latyn ”), it has many merits. Much of the
                    rhythmical flow and finely-balanced cadence of the authorized version may be
                    traced back to Coverdale. With the sanction of the king, Coverdale went to Paris
                    in 1538 to superintend the publication of a new edition; but a decree of the
                    Inquisition broke up the printing-establishment, and consigned the sheets
                    already finished to the flames. A few copies, however, having been sold as
                    waste-paper, were preserved; and these, with the presses which were transported
                    to England, were used in printing <hi rend="italic">Cranmer</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the Great Bible,</hi> under the
                    superintendence of Coverdale, which was published in 1539. After 1540 Coverdale
                    seems to have again resided for some time abroad. He returned to England after
                    the death of Henry (1547), and was appointed almoner to the queen dowager,
                    Catherine Parr. In 1551 Coverdale was appointed to the see of Exeter; aud in
                    consideration of his poverty the customary payment of first-fruits was remitted
                    to him. On the accession of Mary he was thrown into prison, and released only on
                    condition of leaving his native country. He received the grace of exile instead
                    of execution through the urgent intercession of the king of Denmark, whose
                    chaplain Mac Alpine was his brother-in-law. On the invitation of the latter, he
                    repaired for a time to the court of Denmark, but afterwards retired to Geneva,
                    where he was associated with other English exiles in executing the Geneva
                    translation. On his return to England, after the death of Mary, he was not
                    reinstated in his bishopric; and in 1563 he declined the see of Llandaff. He
                    held for some time the rectory of St Magnus, London Bridge, but resigned it in
                    1566. The rest of his life was spent in translating from the works of the
                    Continental Reformers, and in the publication of tracts for the spread of the
                    Reformation. The date of Coverdale’s death is uncertain, but he was buried in
                    the chancel of the church of St Bartholomew, February 19, 1569. The third
                    centenary of the publication of Coverdale’s Bibl® was held, October 4, 1835,
                    when a medal was struck to commemorate the occasion. Coverdale’s remains now lie
                    in the church of St Magnus, to which they were removed when St Bartholomew’s
                    Church was taken down in 1840.</p>
