                    rend="italic">affidavit,</hi> that a contempt has been committed, they make a
                    rule calling on the suspected person to show cause why an <hi rend="italic"
                    >attachment</hi> should not issue against him, or in flagrant cases the
                    attachment issues in the first instance. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Attachment.)</hi> The process of attachment merely brings the accused into
                    court; he is then required to answer on oath interrogatories administered to
                    him, so that the court may be better informed of the circumstances of the
                    contempt. If he can clear himself on oath he is discharged; if he confesses the
                    court will punish him by fine or imprisonment, or both, at its discretion. Both
                    in courts of common law and courts of equity many acts are punished as contempts
                    which are properly civil injuries, and the process of contempt enforced against
                    them is, as Blackstone points out, to be looked upon rather as a civil execution
                    for the benefit of the injured party than as a criminal process for a contempt
                    of the authority of the court. Among the offences enumerated in the text books
                    as the most usual instances of contempt are the following :—(1) Disobedience of
                    inferior judges and magistrates; (2) Wrongdoing by sheriffs, bailiffs, jailers,
                    and other officers in executing tho process of the law; (3) Malpractice of
                    attorneys and solicitors; (4) Misbehaviour of jurymen in collateral matters
                    relating to the discharge of their duties; (5) Misbehaviour of witnesses; (6)
                    Disobedience of parties in a cause to an order of the court, non-payment of
                    costs, non-observance of awards; (7) Those committed by other persons. Among
                    those general contempts some, says Blackstone, “may arise in the face of the
                    court, as by rude and contumelious behaviour, by obstinacy, perverseness, or
                    prevarication, by breach of the peace, or any wilful disturbance whatever; and
                    others in the absence of the party, as by disobeying or treating with disrespect
                    the king’s writ or the rules and process of the court, by perverting such writ
                    or process to the purposes of private malice, &amp;c., by speaking or writing
                    contemptuously of the court or judges acting in their judicial capacity, by
                    printing false accounts (or even true ones without proper permission) of causes
                    depending in judgment,” &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The practice of the courts in punishing the last class of contempts is of great
                    importance in these days, inasmuch as it involves the question of the liberty of
                    the press. It will be seen from the following statement that tho judges have
                    assumed very extensive and arbitrary powers of interfering with the free
                    discussion by the public of the proceedings in courts of justice.</p>
                <p>A judgment prepared by Lord Chief-justice Wilmot in the case of an application
                    for an attachment against J. Almon in 1765, for publishing a pamphlet libelling
                    the Queen’s Bench, is, although it never was delivered in court, constantly
                    referred to as authoritative by later judges and writers. The chief-justice said
                    that the offence of libelling judges in their judicial capacity is the most
                    proper case for an attachment, for the “arraignment of the justice of the judges
                    is arraigning the king’s justice; it is an impeachment of his wisdom and
                    goodness in the choice of his judges; and excites in the minds of the people a
                    general dissatisfaction with, all judicial determinations, and indisposes their
                    minds to obey them. To be impartial, and <hi rend="italic">to be universally
                    thought so,</hi> are both absolutely necessary for the giving justice that free,
                    open, and uninterrupted current which it has for many ages found all over this
                    kingdom, and which so eminently distinguishes and exalts it above all nations
                    upon the earth.” Again “the constitution has provided very apt and proper
                    remedies for correcting and rectifying the involuntary mistakes of judges, and
                    for punishing and removing them for any perversion of justice. But if their
                    authority is to be trampled on by pamphleteers and news-writers, and the people
                    are to be told that the power given to the judges for their protection is
                    prostituted to their destruction, the court may retain its power some little
                    time, but I am sure it will eventually lose all its authority.” In several cases
                    the judges have declared that while their administration of justice may be
                    discussed fairly and <hi rend="italic">bona fide,</hi> it is not open to a
                    journalist to impute corruption. A recent writer (Shortt, <hi rend="italic">Law
                    relating to Works of Literature)</hi> states the law to be that the temperate
                    and respectful discussion of judicial determination is not prohibited, but mere
                    invective and abuse, and still more the imputation of false, corrupt, and
                    dishonest motives is punishable. In an information granted in 1788 against the
                    corporation of Yarmouth for having entered upon their books an order “stating
                    that the assembly were sensible that Mr W. (against whom an action had been
                    brought for malicious prosecution, and a verdict for £3000 returned, which the
                    court refused to disturb) was actuated by motives of public justice, of
                    preserving the rights of the corporation to their admiralty jurisdiction, and of
                    supporting the honour and credit of the chief magistrate,” Mr Justice Buller
                    said, “The judge and jury who tried the case, confirmed by the Court of Common
                    Pleas, have said that instead of his having been actuated by motives of public
                    justice, or by any motives which should influence the actions of an honest man,
                    he had been actuated by malice. These opinions are not reconcilable; if the one
                    be right the other must be wrong. It is therefore a direct insinuation that the
                    court had judged wrong in all they have done in this case, and is therefore
                    clearly a libel on the administration of justice.” Many of the doctrines
                    expressed in tìie above extracts go beyond the practice, if not the strict law
                    of later times. The tendency has been to restrict the process of contempt to
                    cases in which judges are insulted or defied in the discharge of their duties,
                    or in which matters relating to a pending cause are publicly discussed. Bribes
                    or menaces offered to the judges have been punished as contempts. In a recent
                    case a judge of assize having ordered the court to be cleared on account of some
                    disturbance, the high sheriff issued a placard protesting against “this unlawful
                    proceeding,” “and prohibiting his officers from aiding and abetting any attempt
                    to bar out the public <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n348/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0348-0319"/> from free access to the court.” The lord
                    chief-justice of England, sitting in the other court, summoned the sheriff
                    before him and fined him £500 for the contempt, and £500 more for persisting in
                    addressing the grand jury in court, after he had been ordered to desist.</p>
                <p>The difference between pending and decided cases has been frequently recognized
                    by the courts. What would be a fair comment in a decided case may tend to
                    influence the mind of the judge or the jury in a case waiting to be heard, and
                    will accordingly be punished as a contempt. This is distinctly laid down in the
                    case of Tichborne <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Mostyn, where the publisher of a
                    newspaper was held to have committed a contempt by printing in his paper
                    extracts from affidavits in a pending suit, with comments upon them. In the case
                    of the Queen <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Castro, it was held that after a true
                    bill has been found, and the indictment removed into the Court of Queen’s Bench,
                    and a day fixed for trial, the case is pending; and it is a contempt of court to
                    address public meetings, alleging that the defendant is not guilty, that there
                    is a conspiracy against the defendant, and that he cannot have a fair trial; and
                    the court will order the parties to answer for their contempt, and fine or
                    imprison them at discretion. In another case the publication of a winding-up
                    petition, containing charges of fraud, before the hearing of the petition was
                    held to be a contempt of court. The courts may, if they choose, prohibit any
                    publication of their proceedings while the litigation is pending. It is now the
                    invariable rule of the English press to refrain from expressing an opinion on
                    matters relating to any pending suit. On the other hand, the discussion of
                    decided cases shares in the licence now allowed tò the expression of opinion on
                    all public affairs in England.</p>
                <p>The Scotch and colonial courts exercise the same power of committing for contempt
                    as the English. It has been held in a case arising under the County Court Act,
                    that inferior courts of record have only power over contempts committed <hi
                    rend="italic">in facie curiae.</hi> The county court judge has no power of
                    proceeding against a person for a contempt committed out of court.</p>
                <p>The proper punishment of contempt is by fine or imprisonment at the discretion of
                    the court. In a recent case it was held that no person can be punished for
                    contempt, unless the specific offence charged against him is distinctly stated,
                    and an opportunity given him of answering it. When a barrister had been
                    suspended from practice by the supreme court of Nova Scotia for addressing a
                    letter to the chief justice which was a contempt of court, the Privy Council on
                    appeal discharged the order, as substituting a penalty and mode of punishment
                    which was not the appropriate and fitting punishment for the offence. The letter
                    was written by the defendant in his individual capacity of suitor, and had no
                    connection with his professional status or character.</p>
                <p>Blackstone notices the exceptional character of the punishment provided for this
                    offence. “It cannot have escaped the attention of the reader,” he says, “that
                    this method of making the defendant answer upon oath to a criminal charge is not
                    agreeable to the genius of the common law in any other instance.” There can be
                    no doubt that the discretionary power of judges to punish summarily by fine or
                    imprisonment offences committed against their own dignity is liable to abuse,
                    and careful as English judges are in enforcing it, a trial and conviction in the
                    ordinary manner would probably be more satisfactory. The offence is by no means
                    clearly defined, but it will be generally agreed that it is desirable to prevent
                    and punish insulting expressions and disorderly conduct in courts of justice, as
                    well as any such publications as may really tend to prejudice a pending cause. A
                    judge may safely be intrusted with the power of keeping order in his court, but
                    contempts committed elsewhere should be proceeded against like other
                    offences.</p>
                <p>A similar power of punishing for contempt is exercised by the two Houses of
                    Parliament. The question was discussed in the case of Burdett <hi rend="italic"
                    >v.</hi> Abbott, where Lord Ellenborough said, “Can the High Court of
                    Parliament, or either of the two Houses of which it consists, be deemed not to
                    possess intrinsically that authority of punishing summarily for contempts which
                    is acknowledged to belong, and is duly exercised as belonging, to every superior
                    court of law of less dignity doubtless than itself I” It was at one time held
                    that the “privilege of committing for contempt is inherent in every deliberative
                    body invested with authority by the constitution;” and that accordingly it
                    extended to colonial assemblies. This opinion has been overruled by subsequent
                    decisions. Baron Parke, in the case of Kielley <hi rend="italic">υ.</hi> Carson,
                    says that the power of punishment for contempt attaches to bodies having
                    judicial functions, and is an incident of those functions, except only in the
                    case of the House of Commons, whose authority in this respect rests upon ancient
                    usage. The Legislative Assembly of Victoria is entitled by enactment to the
                    privileges, immunities, and powers held, and enjoyed, and exercised by the
                    English House of Commons. Where a legislative assembly has the power of
                    committing for contempt, the punishment lasts only till the end of the current
                    session. “Though the party should deserve the severest censure,” says Lord
                    Denman, “yet his offence being committed the day before a prorogation, if the
                    House ordered his imprisonment but for a week, every court in Westminster Hall,
                    and every judge in all the courts would be bound to discharge him by <hi
                    rend="italic">habeas corpus.”</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Privilege. (e.
