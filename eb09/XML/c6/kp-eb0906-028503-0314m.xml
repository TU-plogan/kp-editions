                    between 41’ and 42° 3' N. lat., and 71° 55' and 73° 50' W. long.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Description.—</hi> It is bounded N. by Massachusetts
                    about 88 miles; E. by Rhode Island, 45 miles; S. by Long Island Sound, 100
                    miles; W. by New York about 68 miles (in a direct line). The S.W. corner
                    projects along the Sound under New York for about 13 miles. The area is 4750
                    square miles, or one-tenth of that of New York. The State lies on the S. slope
                    of the hilly regions of New England, with a general surface much diversified;
                    there is, however, no land above 1000 feet in elevation. Besides the
                    Connecticut, two other large rivers flow from the N. into the Sound—the
                    Housatonic and the Thames. The Connecticut is the largest river in New England,
                    rising cn the N. border of New Hampshire, 1600 feet above the sea, flowing
                    S.S.W., separating Vermont and New Hampshire, crossing the W. part of
                    Massachusetts, and central part of Connecticut, flowing S.S.E. below Middletown,
                    and falling into the Sound at Saybrook. Its length is more than 400 miles, with
                    a width in Connecticut varying from 500 to 1000 feet. It is navigable to
                    Middletown (30 miles) for vessels drawing 10 feet, and to Hartford (50 miles)
                    for those drawing 8 feet. Its principal tributary in Connecticut is the Tunxis,
                    or Farmington, which flows S.E. from the slopes of the Green Mountains in
                    Massachusetts, then abruptly N., and, breaking through the trap range, S.E.
                    again to the Connecticut River at Windsor, instead of taking its seemingly
                    natural course to New Haven, whither a part of its waters were formerly carried
                    by the Farmington Canal. The E, part of the State is drained by the Thames,
                    which is formed by the Yantic and Shetucket,—the Quinnebang joining the latter
                    about two miles above. It is navigable to Norwich for the Sound steamers and
                    West India trading vessels. In the W. part of the State is the Housatonic, with
                    its main branch—the Naugatuck—which joins it at Derby. To this place it is
                    navigable for small vessels. Besides these large streams there are very many
                    smaller ones, affording, in their rapid descent from the hills, an immense,
                    amount of water power. Geologically the State <pb break="no"

                    Sandstone and postTertiary terraces of the Connecticut River valley. There are
                    several well-defined ranges of hi] Is. Of these the Housatonic Hills are the
                    most westerly, and extend along that river to the coast. The Green Mountain
                    range, running S. from Vermont, terminates near New Haven. The Blue Hills of
                    Southington—the highest in the State—are a part of the Mount Tom range of
                    Massachusetts, and lie between the Green Mountain range and the Connecticut
                    River. On the E. side of the river is a fourth range which the river crosses at
                    Chatham. While the hills run N. and S., it is noticeable that the three main
                    rivers bend (and on about the same parallel) to the S.E. The ridges and dikes of
                    trap are exceedingly numerous through the centre of fhe State, having been
                    forced up through the red sandstone which is found underlying and on the borders
                    of the trap. These ridges have abrupt columnar W. fronts and gentle E. slopes.
                    The mineral wealth of the State is considerable. Copper is found in the Simsbury
                    mines at Granby, and at Bristol; but these mines have lost their former
                    importance since the working of the abundant and purer ores of Lake Superior.
                    Iron ore is found in great quantities in Salisbury, Kent, Sharon, Cornwall, and
                    Canaan, and has been worked for 125 years. Limestone and marble of the very best
                    quality are found at Canaan, Washington, and Milford. At Portland and Cromwell,
                    on both sides of the Connecticut River, are the well-known immense quarries of
                    freestone largely in demand for building. The excellent slate flagging from
                    Bolton and Haddam is abundant in supply, and in great demand. Granite, gneiss,
                    hydraulic lime, tiling slate, clay (fire, potters’, and porcelain), and sulphate
                    of barytes are found in great quantities. There were twenty extensive quarries
                    and mines in the State in 1870. There are over 100 miles of deeply indented
                    coast on the Sound (which measures 140 miles by 24 miles), affording excellent
                    harbours. The chief of these are Stonington, New London, Saybrook, New Haven,
                    Bridgeport, and Fairfield. The harbour at New London is one of the best in the
                    country, capacious, and never frozen over. The climate of the State, while very
                    changeable, is very healthful,—the mortality being below the average of the
                    other States. There is scarcely any spring season, but summer opens abruptly
                    about May 3, and the cold weather begins in November. The winters, with their
                    keen N.W. winds, are severe, but the serenity of the sky and dryness of the air
                    make some compensation. The mean temperature for the year is 48° Fahr.
                    Consumption is the most fatal disease, causing 16 per cent, of all the deaths.
                    The vegetation is rich and varied. The most abundant trees are chestnut, walnut,
                    birch, oak, elm, maple, beech, and ash. The forests have been recklessly cut
                    away, and only patches of woodland remain; but the people are waking up to the
                    importance of tree-planting. As for zoology, songbirds of all sorts are
                    plentiful, and the grouse and woodcock are increasing under the game laws, after
                    having been nearly killed out. The Sound abounds in the best qualities of fish
                    and shell-fish, while the freshwater varieties of the former are found in great
                    quantities in the rivers and ponds. Aside from these there are few animals of
                    importance save the domestio ones.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population. Divisions.—</hi> The State is divided into 8
                    counties :—Hartford, New Haven, New London, Fairfield (all incorporated in
                    1666), Windham (1726), Litchfield, (1751), Middlesex, and Tolland (1785). New
                    London, Middlesex, New Haven, and Fairfield occupy the lower half of the State,
                    bordering on the Sound; the others occupy the other half, adjoining
                    Massachusetts. The number of towns in 1876 was 167; and there were ten cities
                    :—Hartford, the capital (population in 1870, 37,180), New Haven (50,840),
                    Bridgeport (18,969), Norwich (16,653), Waterbury (10,826), Middletown (6923),
                    Meriden (10,521), New London (9576), New Britain (9480), and South Norwalk.
                    There were also 17 boroughs largely engaged in industry, of which the chief are
                    Birmingham, Danbury, Danielsonville, Fairfield, Stamford, Stonington,
                    Willimantic, and Winsted. The population of the State in 1679 was 12,535; in
                    1774 it had risen to 197,856; and from 1790 it was as follows (the last column

                <p>In 1870 there were about 7000 more females than males. About one-fifth of the
                    population were foreign born, chiefly Irish, German, English, French, Canadian,
                    and Scotch. It is the third State in the density of its population (11345 to the
                    square mile), Massachusetts (186) and Rhode Island (208) exceeding it, while New
                    York follows next (87). In 1875 the births were 14,328 (141 illegitimate);
                    marriages, 4385 (below the average for the last 11 years); deaths, 9833 (25 per
                    cent, from diseases of the respiratory organs); divorces, 476 (one for every 9 ’
                    21 marriages solemnized; the average for 12 years is 455). The laws regarding

                    years of age in 1870 (425,896), there were engaged in all occupations, 193,421;
                    chiefly classed as—in agriculture, 43,653; in professional and personal service,
                    38,704; in trade, 24,720; and in manufactures, 86,344. There is very little soil
                    that can be called good, except in the river valleys, and agriculture is as
                    backward as in other parts of New England. The hills through the State furnish
                    excellent pasturage and cheap fuel. The chief cultivated fruits are apples,
                    pears, grapes, and the numerous kinds of berries. The principal crops are hay,
                    oats, rye, corn, potatoes, and tobacco; and in the Connecticut River valley
                    (extending, in this State, 30 miles N. of Middletown, and 20 miles wide) farming
                    is very productive. The tobacco raised in the valley is said to be superior to
                    any other. In the uplands dairy products and cattle raising are the chief
                    resources of the farmer. There were in 1870, 25,508 farms, having 1,646,752
                    acres of improved land, and 717,664 acres unimproved, of which 577,333 were
                    woodland. The value of these farms was $124,241,382. Though the number of farms
                    has increased since 1850 and 1860, yet the acreage devoted to them has
                    decreased, as has also the cultivated farm land in proportion to the
                    uncultivated. The farms are passing into the hands of the Irish and Germans, who
                    do their own work and live with few comforts. Pisciculture is receiving much
                    attention, commissioners having been appointed in 1866, who have well stocked
                    the ponds and rivers. Black-bass, trout, and shad have been very successfully
                    cultivated, and it is hoped as much can be done with salmon. Notwithstanding the
                    extensive sea coast and fine harbours, the foreign commerce is not heavy,—the
                    coast trade and fisheries being more important. There are in the State five
                    custom districts, of which the ports of entry are Fairfield, Middletown, New
                    Haven, New London, and Stonington. The imports from foreign countries and
                    domestic exports for the year ending June 30, 1875, were as follows :—</p>

                <p>The chief articles of export were grain, fire-arms, provisions, and manufactures
                    of wood. Of the total number of enrolled, registered, and licensed vessels
                    (820), 718 were sailing vessels, with a tonnage of 53,329, and 78 were steam
                    vessels, with a tonnage of 26,550. The fisheries are carried on from New London
                    and Stonington. In 1875, there were 173 vessels engaged in the cod and mackerel
                    fisheries, with a tonnage of 3756; and in the whale fishery 14, with a tonnage
                    of 2050—a great reduction on the decade from 1850 to 1860. Engaged in coastwise
                    trade and fisheries, there entered 2257 vessels and cleared 1678. In foreign
                    trade there entered 161 and cleared 102. In 1870, 1001 persons were engaged in
                    fisheries, and the annual product was $769,799. Ship-building is a considerable
                    industry. In 1875, 34 vessels were built of 5915 tons. The great industry of the
                    State is in manufactures. These are exceedingly numerous and very productive,
                    and most of them such as require ingenuity and intelligence on the part of the
                    workmen. The chief industries and some of their statistics in 1870 were :— .</p>

                <p>It ranks first among the States in the production of clocks, Indian - rubber
                    goods, and hardware, and (small as it is) eighth in the total value of all
                    manufactured products. It must be remembered, however, in connection with the
                    above statistics, that the ninth United States census of 1870 is very inaccurate
                    in relation to manufactures, the superintendent estimating that only about
                    one-quarter of the capital invested is reported, and that there are other great
                    errors in the way of under-estimate. In 1875 Connecticut had 1 mile of railway
                    to 5 ’ 16 square miles of territory, and to 585 inhabitants. (Massachusetts had
                    1 mile to 4'29 square miles and 909 inhabitants; England 1 mile to 5 ’ 02 square
                    miles and 1954 inhabitants. ) There were 23 railroad companies, with 1184 miles
                    of single track. The cost of these was $75,831,210; receipts for the year,
                    $12,020,194 (50 per cent, from passengers); net earnings, $2,816,004, being 3’71
                    per cent, on the cost of the roads. Nineroads, costing nearly 8 millions, have
                    no net income. The capital stock of all the companies was $59,282,784 (paid in),
                    and debt, $17,077,739. The amount paid in dividends (only eight companies make
                    any) was 4 ∙3 per cent, on the entire capital of all the roads, but 9'24 on the
                    capital of the dividend-paying ones. There is an elaborate system of State
                    inspection of the roads and their accounts. There is a State tax of 1 per cent,
                    on the market value of stock and bonds after deducting cash on hand. The
                    principal lines are those running N. and S., connecting the shore with the
                    valleys of the interior, and forming highways between the important cities of
                    JNew England and New York city. Connected with these are important steamboat
                    lines (passenger and freight) from Stonington, New London, and New Haven to New
                    York. The waggon roadways all over the State are kept in very fair condition,
                    except in the poorer hill towns. There are about 13,000 miles of them, costing
                    annually about $650,000. The banking interest of the State is commensurate with
                    its large business, and shows a steadily increasing prosperity. At January 1,
                    1876, there were 79 national banks in the State, with a capital of $25,687,820;
                    4 State banks, with a capital of $1,450,000, and assets $3,917,953; 12 trust
                    companies, with a capital of $2,450,000, and assets $6,183,643. These all do a
                    heavy discounting and lending business with their capital and deposits, and pay
                    dividends of 8 to 12 per cent, on their stock. The savings banks numbered 87,
                    with a deposit of $76,489,310, and 208,030 depositors. The average income
                    (during 1875) was 6’62 per cent., nearly all of which is paid to depositors,
                    there being no capital stock. The management is very strictly controlled by law,
                    and about three-quarters of the assets are lent on real estate in the State. The
                    whole number of fire and marine insurance companies doing business in the State
                    in 1875 was 130, of which 32 were Connecticut companies. The assets of these
                    last were $17,345,790? of which over 16 millions were held by 10 companies
                    (mostly in Hartford). The premiums received by all the companies were
                    $1,949,867, and the corresponding losses $1,248,989; total risks written in the
                    State, $165,660,801. The premiums received by the Connecticut companies from
                    their entire business were $9,195,617, and corresponding losses $5,203,416. The
                    life and accident companies doing, business numbered 27, of which 11 were
                    Connecticut companies; the assets of the last were $98,964,945. There were 2740
                    life policies issued in Connecticut in 1875, insuring $5,066,438. The life
                    premiums paid amounted tn $1,927,663. The policies in force in the State
                    numbered 25,359, insuring $51,063,720. The Connecticut companies (all of
                    Hartford) issued 26,104 policies, insuring $48,822,881 in 1875 (a large
                    reduction on previous years), and paid losses of $6,463,473. The State debt in
                    1860 was only $50,000, which was borrowed from the school fund. From July 1,
                    1861, to October 1, 1865, five issues of bonds were made, amounting to
                    $10,000,000, drawing 6 per cent, interest. This debt has been steadily reduced,
                    and on April 1, 1876, was $5,014,500, or deducting cash in the treasury, only
                    $4,302,775. The revenue of the State for the year ending March 31, 1876, was
                    $2,H7,719. This amount was chiefly derived from the tax of 1 mill on the grand
                    list of the towns ($437,473), from savings banks ($462,664), mutual insurance
                    companies ($398,266), and railroads ($302,758). In 1860 the assessed value of
                    all property in the State was $341,256,976, and the true value $444,274,114. In
                    1870 the assessed value of real estate was $204,H0,500, and of personal estate
                    $221,322,728; total, $425,433,228. The true value was $774,631,524. In 1860 the
                    total taxation, not national, was $1,015,039; in 1870, $6,064,843. The total
                    indebtedness of towns and cities in the State on June 1, 1874, was $13,995,090,
                    more than one-third of which was incurred in aid of railroads.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Social Statistics.—</hi> A large number of public and
                    charitable institutions are maintained wholly or in part by the State, and for
                    them it spent $135,463 during the year ending March 31, 1876. Among them are the
                    following. The American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, at Hartford, was
                    incorporated in 1816, being the oldest institution of the kind in the United
                    States. In all, 2056 persons have received instruction, with an average
                    attendance in 1875 of 218. The funds of the institution amount to $338,925. The
                    annual State grant is $11,000. The charge per pupil is $175 a year. There is no
                    asylum for the blind, but an annual grant of $6000 is made for the care of the
                    indigent blind at the Perkins Institute at Boston. There is a general hospital
                    at New Haven chartered in 1827, with a training school for nurses attached;
                    funds, $20,000; annual grant, $2000; patients in 1875, 436. The Hartford
                    Hospital was opened August 1,1860; funds, $153,500, but considerably in debt;
                    annual grant, $2000; patients in 1875, 707. The Connecticut Hospital for the
                    Insane, at Middletown, was opened in 1868; cost, $640,043; it accommodates 450
                    with attendants and physicians, and is always crowded. To April 1, 1876,1272 had
                    been admitted. One-half the board of paupers is paid by the State. Revenue in
                    1875, $124,305, of which the State paid $62,004. The Retreat for the Insane at
                    Hartford was opened in 1824, and has treated 5786 patients. Though receiving
                    large State and private aid, it is intended for patients who can pay for
                    comfortable accommodation. It had in 1875 about 159 inmates. The Reform School
                    at West Meriden was opened in 1854; cost $115,000, with a farm of 195 acres. The
                    expense to the State in 1875 was $30,368. Boys from ten to sixteen years old may
                    be sent to it for crime, by the several courts, for not less than 9 months, and
                    during minority. The inmates are required to labour 6⅜ hours a day, and attend
                    school 4⅜ hours. The Industrial School for Girls at Middletown was opened in
                    1870. Its property has cost $122,363, mostly given by individuals. The expense
                    to the State in 1875 was $16,223, and the inmates numbered 53. Girls from eight
                    to sixteen may be committed to it for vagrancy, and are taught housekeeping,
                    sewing, box-making, and farm and garden work. The School for Imbeciles at
                    Lakeville cost $10,000, appropriated by the legislature. In 1875 its income was
                    $14,165, with an average of 95 inmates. The State prison at Wethersfield,
                    erected <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n317/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0317-0288"/> in 1827, is inadequate to the needs of the State,
                    having, in March 1876, 40 more prisoners than cells, viz., 252 prisoners. Its
                    income in 1875 was $25,539, and payments $28,414,—the deficit being due to the
                    recent decrease in the demand for convict labour. The punishments are solitary
                    confinement, fetters, and shackles. The warder may deduct five days from the
                    term of imprisonment for good behaviour. Schools were begun in New Haven in
                    1640. The provision and regulation of schools rested with the towns till 1712;
                    with towns and parishes together till 1798; with parishes alone till 1856, when
                    the towns were restored to their original place in the system. Though school
                    districts existed in 1725, and were legalized in 1766, they were not fully
                    endowed corporate bodies till 1839. Schools have been maintained in three
                    ways,—by taxes, by tuition fees or rate bills, and by the income of invested
                    funds. Taxes were a source of income from the beginning to 1821, and were
                    restored in 1854. Rate bills were not discontinued till 1868. Local school funds
                    were begun towards the close of the 17th century, and increased by sales of land
                    in 1733, and by excise on liquors, tea, &amp;c., authorized by Acts of May 1766
                    and October 1774. The State school fund was begun in 1795, it being the money
                    procured by the sale of lands granted by Charles II. in 1662, and described as
                    “from Narrogancett Bay on the east to the South Sea on the west.” This was, in
                    fact, a strip of land 70 miles wide, and running one-eighth of the circumference
                    of the globe. Subsequently, this being found to interfere with other colonial
                    grants, all this territory was given up, save portions in New York and Ohio. The
                    land was sold for $1,200,000; the fund, however, has increased, and at September
                    1, 1874, was $2,044,266; the dividend per child has varied from $1, 50 to $1 per
                    year, decreasing with the increase of population; the fund is almost wholly
                    invested in real estate mortgages at 7 per cent. Another fund, the entire income
                    of which since 1855 has been devoted to schools, is the Town Deposit Fund. The
                    24th Congress of 1835-6 voted to deposit the surplus revenue of the Union, then
                    on hand, with the different States in proportion to their national
                    representation. Connecticut received $764,670, which was divided among the towns
                    according to their population in 1830; the present income from this is about
                    $46,000 a year. (While Connecticut has preserved this fund almost intact, in
                    other States it has been squandered or lost. ) At present, aside from the income
                    z&gt;f these funds, the maintenance of the schools is provided for by these
                    taxes :—the town tax, which must be sufficient to maintain 30 weeks of school in
                    the larger, and 24 in the smaller districts; the district tax to provide for
                    buildings and repairs, or any deficit; and the State appropriation of $1, 50 per
                    child per year. In 1865 a State Board of Education was established, whose
                    secretary is Superintendent of Public Instruction. The following are statistics
                    for the year ending August 31, 1875:—Districts, 1506; public schools, 1650;
                    children from four to sixteen (on January 1, 1875), 134,976, of whom 95 per
                    cent, attended school. Average length of school, 176 days. Teachers: males, 721;
                    females, 1910. Average pay per month: males, $70; females, $39. Income of public
                    schools from all sources, $1,592,858. Provision for higher education is made by
                    various private and endowed schools, but is by no means complete. The State
                    Normal School at New Britain was opened in 1850; the annual State grant is
                    $12,000, and it graduates about 100 pupils a year. In 1870 there were in the
                    State 29 academies and seminaries, with 127 instructors, 1602 pupils, and 8000
                    volumes in their libraries. There are three colleges. Yale College
                    (Congregational), in New Haven, was established in 1701 by the ten foremost
                    ministers of the colony; in 1876 it had 90 instructors, nearly 1100 students in
                    all departments, and 101,000 volumes in the libraries; its productive funds were
                    about $1,500,000, and its property $5,000,000. Besides its classical course, it
                    has faculties and schools of theology, law, medicine, fine arts, together with
                    the very prosperous Sheffield Scientific School, and several post-graduate
                    courses of study. Trinity (formerly Washington) College, at Hartford, was
                    founded in 1823 by Episcopalians; its property is about $1,000,000, a
                    considerable portion of which is in productive funds; it has about 20
                    instructors, 90 students, and 16,000 volumes in its library. Wesleyan University
                    (Methodist) at Middletown was founded in 1831; property in 1875, $400,000;
                    income, $47,000; instructors, 15; students, 190; library, 27,000 volumes; women
                    were admitted in 1872. There is a theological institute (Congregational) at
                    Hartford, and the Berkeley Divinity School (Episcopal) is at Middletown. In 1870
                    the State had 64 public libraries, with 285,937 volumes; these receive State
                    aid. There are several valuable private libraries relating to American subjects
                    at Hartford. The newspapers and periodicals numbered 71, circulating 203,725,
                    and issuing annually 17,454,740 copies. There were 827 religious organizations,
                    having 902 edifices, with 338,735 sittings, and property worth $13,428,109. The
                    Congregationalist is by far the most numerous and wealthy denomination, followed
                    by Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists, and Roman Catholics. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> Connecticut is
                    represented in the National Congress by two senators and four representatives,
                    and has now six votes in the Presidential electoral college. The State
                    constitution provides distinct executive, legislative, and judicial powers. The
                    chief officer, or governor, must be over thirty years of age. A majority vote in
                    each house of the legislature carries a bill over his veto. His salary is $2000.
                    The legislature, or General Assembly, consists of a senate and house of
                    representatives, and meets annually on the Wednesday after the first Monday in
                    January, The senate consists of not less than 21, or more than 24, members from
                    districts determined by the General Assembly according to population. The
                    representatives are two from each town incorporated before 1785 or having over
                    5000 inhabitants, and one from every other. The senators now number 18, the
                    representatives 244. Each legislator is paid $300 a year. There is much special
                    and excessive legislation. All elections are by ballot. Representatives are
                    elected annually, and the general State officers and senators biennially, on the
                    Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Any male citizen of the United
                    States, aged twenty-one, who shall have resided in the State one year, and in
                    the town where he offers to vote, six months, and who can read any article of
                    the constitution, is entitled to vote. The pardoning power is vested in the
                    Assembly. The judicial power is vested in the following courts :—A supreme court
                    of errors, consisting of a chief and four associates; a superior court,
                    consisting of six judges, together with the five of the court of errors. These
                    are all chosen for eight years by the Assembly, but are disqualified on
                    attaining the age of seventy. They may be removed by impeachment, or by the
                    governor on a two-thirds address of each house. Their salary is $4000 each.
                    There are also five courts of common pleas, presided over by a single judge,
                    chosen for four years by the Assembly, with a salary of $2500. There are
                    inferior courts in certain cities and boroughs, with judges chosen biennially by
                    the Assembly. Numerous justices of the peace are elected biennially by the
                    people of the towns where they live. Probate courts are held in each district,
                    of which there are 113; the judges are elected biennially by the people. A
                    somewhat faulty revision of the General Statutes of the State was made in 1875.
                    A peculiarity of the State is that, when cities are formed, they still remain
                    (frequently) parts of towns, and have a double government. The State militia
                    embraced, in 1875, 2636 men, though those liable to serve (viz., between the
                    ages of eighteen and forty-five) numbered 62,103. The governor is
                    commander-in-chief, and under him are a brigadier-general and staff and field
                    officers. The brigade comprises four regiments of infantry (one from each
                    congressional district) and one section of light artillery. Two regiments go
                    into encampment for a week, and the other two have a full parade each year. The
                    arms of the State are—three vines in fruit—2 and 1, all proper—with the motto,
                    “Qui transtulit sustinet.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The Dutch first explored the country in 1620,
                    but made no settlement till 1633. Then they settled at Hartford, buying of the
                    Pequot Indians, but selling soon after to the English. James I. granted the
                    first English patent to all New England, in 1620, to Lord Say-and-Seal and
                    others. In 1634-36 permanent settlements were made at Hartford, Wethersfield,
                    and Windsor by companies from Massachusetts under a patent from tho Plymouth
                    colony, covering the present State and also portions of Rhode Island,
                    Massachusetts, Long Island, and an undefined territory to the west. In 1637
                    these towns organized an independent government, declared war against the
                    Pequots, and, under Captain J. Mason, nearly destroyed the tribes. In 1638 New
                    Haven and vicinity was settled by an English company under Rev. J. Davenport and
                    Governor Eaton. This colony was united to Connecticut in 1662, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0318-0289"/> as was Saybrook in 1614. In 1639 Connecticut,
                    chiefly through the influence of the Rev. J. Hooker of Hartford, adopted a
                    constitution. This was “the first one written out, as a complete form of civil
                    order, in the New World, and embodies -all the essential features of the
                    constitutions of the American States, and of the Republic itself, as they exist
                    at the present day. It is the free representative plan which characterizes the
                    country.” In this constitution, and during the administration of it (till 1661),
                    the only authority recognized was the “supreme power of the commonwealth,” and
                    the people were practically independent. When Charles II. camo to the throne, J.
                    Winthrop, jun., succeeded, in 1662, in obtaining a most liberal charter, which
                    constituted Connecticut so completely a selfgoverned colony that no changes were
                    needed in the instrument when she became one of the American States. Nor was it
                    altered till 1818. From 1685 to 1687 James II. made strenuous efforts to take
                    away all the New England charters; and in the latter year, Sir E. Andross, the
                    royally appointed governor, came to Hartford while the Assembly was sitting, and
                    demanded the charter. It was, however, concealed in the famous charter oak; and,
                    at the dethronement of James II. in 1689 (after a year and a half of oppressive
                    rule by Andross), the colonial Government resumed its functions as if nothing
                    had happened. From the union of the colonies, Hartford was the seat of
                    Government till 1701, from which date it shared the honour with New Haven until
                    1874, when it became the sole capital. The code, commonly called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Blue Laws of Connecticut,</hi> is now generally considered to have
                    been a forgery by the Rev. Samuel Peters. The early statutes were not peculiarly
                    severe or intolerant, and no case of execution for witchcraft is known. During
                    the French and Indian wars Connecticut supplied her full quota of soldiers; and,
                    during the revolt of the colonies, she furnished more men in proportion to her
                    population, and more aid in proportion to her wealth, than any other colony. A
                    few days before the Declaration of Independence she instructed her delegates to
                    propose such a measure. The efficient and wise governor at the time, whom
                    Washington used to call Brother Jonathan (Trumbull), has bequeathed his nickname
                    to the country. Connecticut ratified the U.S. Constitution, January 9, 1788,
                    being the fifth colony to do so. She took an active part in the war of 1812,
                    though it cost the ruin of her West India and coasting trade. The present
                    constitution was adopted in 1818, doing away with slavery, and being otherwise
                    remarkable for its liberality and wisdom. It has been considerably amended to
                    meet the needs of increased and differently distributed population, and of
                    industrial progress. Under Governor Buckingham the State took a very prominent
                    part in the civil war of 1861-65. She furnished 54,882 men, mostly for three
                    years; and the war expenses, not only of the State and towns, but of private
                    individuals, were enormous. The administration of the government since has been
                    unusually honest and cautious, owing to the even balance of the political
                    parties who alternate in its conduct. There is no just and complete history of
                    the State, but its records from 1636 are preserved, and furnish the best source
                    of information. The general histories of Bancroft and Palfrey, and the special
                    ones of Trumbull, Hollister, and Barber, present the history very fairly down to
                    the present century. There is a bulky history of <hi rend="italic">Connecticut
                    during the War of</hi> 1861-65, by Crofut and Morris. In Hartford is an
                    enterprising Historical Society with some published collections. The Reports of
                    the Board of Education are valuable in this connection. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps"
