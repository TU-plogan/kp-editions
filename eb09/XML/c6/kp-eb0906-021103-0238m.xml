                <p><label type="entry">COMMUNISM</label> is the name that has been given to the
                    schemes of social innovation which have for their starting-point the attempted
                    overthrow of the institution of private property. It is not to be wondered at
                    that so stupendous an undertaking should have failed, except in a very few
                    instances, in its immediate object. The principle of private property has been
                    called by one who was by no means a blind worshipper of the social condition
                    which has been built upon it, “that primary and fundamental institution on
                    which, unless in some exceptional and very limited cases, the economical
                    arrangements of society have always rested.’’ To attack this primary and
                    fundamental institu tion indicates a mind so bold as well as so imaginative that
                    it might well be the-ught that the assaults upon it would be few and far
                    between, limited to a single country or to a single age, or at least to a class
                    of individuals rendered desperate by having nothing to lose by a general social
                    revolution. The opinion that a communist is a man who has no property to lose
                    and who therefore advocates a general redistribution of wealth is very
                    wide-spread and popular. It is embodied in the well-known lines of the corn-law
                    rhymer :—.</p>
                <p>“What is a Communist? One who hath yearnings For equal division of unequal
                    earnings.</p>
                <p>Idler or bungler, or both, he is willing To fork out his penny and pocket your
                    shilling.”</p>
                <p>The facts connected with the history of communism show that the movements against
                    the institution of private property have taken place in nearly every country,
                    and in almost every age. They have originated with men of such divergent
                    intellectual rank as Plato and Robert Owen, as widely sundered in respect of
                    time, country, and social surroundings as tho Essenes, Sir Thomas More, Saint
                    Simon, and Father Rapp. The mere mention of these names goes some way towards
                    the refutation of the popular conception of a communist as a needy adventurer
                    seeking a means to possess himself of the property of others. There may have
                    been some so-called communists attracted to the movement by the hope of being
                    enabled to live on the labour and industry of their neighbours; but such men
                    have never originated any socialistic movement, and their motives have generally
                    been quickly detected by the genuine communists, who have not infrequently
                    adopted very vigorous means to expel such black sheep from their flock. Among
                    the modern leaders of communistic movements who have actually reduced to
                    practice the theoretical schemes of <hi rend="italic">The Republic</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Utopia</hi> have been men who have devoted great wealth and rare
                    organizing faculties to the carrying out of their plans for the reconstruction
                    of society. It has been estimated that Robert Owen, during the course of his
                    long life, devoted no less a sum than £60,000 from his own private fortune to
                    the promotion of communistic schemes; what he sacrificed indirectly to his views
                    on social reform cannot be easily estimated. His faculty for the successful
                    conduct of business was so remarkable that at the early age of twenty-six,
                    without a shilling of capital of his own, he was appointed manager of the mills
                    of the Chorlton Company with a salary of £1000 a year, besides one-ninth of the
                    profits realized by the company. There can be no doubt that Owen had the
                    personal qualities which would have enabled him to amass a colossal fortune if
                    his ambition had lain in that direction. The immense pecuniary and personal
                    sacrifices which he made to the cause of communism show that he at least was
                    animated by motives the direct opposite of the selfishness and sloth generally
                    attributed to the advocates of that system. Another leading communist, Saint
                    Simon, was the representative of one of the most ancient families of the French
                    nobility. A career in the army was open to him in which he might easily have
                    satisfied the usual ambition of the class to which he belonged. As a young man
                    he served with distinction through five campaigns.</p>
                <p>Many other instances might be given of the disinterestedness of the leaders of
                    communistic schemes. Among American associations one of the most successful as
                    to the number and material prosperity of its members is the society known as the
                    Perfectionists of Oneida and Wallingford. Their founder, John Humphrey Noyes, is
                    the son of a banker, and a man fitted by education and natural gifts to have
                    succeeded in any of the ordinary careers of professional or commercial activity.
                    Whether we look at communism as depicted in the pages of Plato’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Republic</hi> and Sir Thomas More’s <hi rend="italic">Utopia,</hi>
                    or in the practical efforts made to realize these philosophical speculations by
                    such men as Owen and Noyes, we find no justification for the assumption that the
                    movement is one for enabling “idlers and bunglers” to live on the industry and
                    talents of their more energetic and skilful neighbours.</p>
                <p>As we are here saying what communism is not, rather than endeavouring to define
                    what it is, this is perhaps the right place to state that communism, meaning
                    thereby community of goods and the abolition of private property, has no
                    connection with the doings of the <hi rend="italic">Commune of</hi> Paris which
                    was overthrown in May 1871. The French word <hi rend="italic">Commune</hi> is a
                    household word in France for “Township” or “Corporation.” Every town and village
                    in France has its <hi rend="italic">Commune</hi> or municipality. In nearly
                    every town and village there is corporate property called <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Biens</hi><hi rend="italic">Communaux,</hi> and this property is vested in the
                    corporation or <hi rend="italic">Commune.</hi> The similarity, however, of the
                    French word for corporation to ours for expressing the doctrine of community of
                    goods, has led to a great amount of misconception and confusion, even among
                    writers who are generally careful and well informed. The revolution of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Commune</hi> was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n239/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0239-0212"/> entirely political; it propounded no new economic
                    theories. It arose from a joint effort of many sections of extreme politicians
                    who were agreed in nothing but in demanding the establishment of (1) a
                    democratic republic, and (2) the communal (or corporate) independence of Paris.
                    Only about seven out of the seventy members of the Communal Government were
                    communists in the economic sense, and these seven were among the most thoughtful
                    and least violent of the party to which they belonged. They never had an
                    opportunity of giving any official sanction to their communistic views, and they
                    were gradually thrust on one side by their more violent and unscrupulous
                    comrades. This is therefore not the place to attempt anything like an account of
                    the brief reign of the <hi rend="italic">Commune,</hi> which indeed belongs to
                    the history of Paris. It is sufficient to state that its doings were not even
                    tinged with communism in the economic sense of the word.</p>
                <p>Communistic schemes have found advocates in almost every age and in many
                    different countries. The foremost men both of thought and action have from time
                    to time been attracted by them. They have been so various in scope, and the
                    amount of detail with which they are described by their authors is so
                    considerable, that it is difficult to get at the underlying principle which is
                    common to them all. It must be remembered that the philosophic communism of
                    Plato and More has been adapted to the wants of actual daily life by rough
                    German peasants and Lancashire operatives; and though of course the actual has
                    differed a good deal from the ideal commune, yet their resemblance is, under the
                    circumstances, very much more striking than their divergence. The one thing that
                    is shared by all communists, whether speculative or practical, is deep
                    dissatisfaction with the economic conditions by which they are surrounded. In
                    Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> the dissatisfaction is not limited to
                    merely economic conditions. In his examination of the body politic there is
                    hardly any part which he can pronounce to be healthy. He would alter the life of
                    the citizens of his state from the very moment of birth. Children are to be
                    taken away from their parents and nurtured under the supervision of the state.
                    The old nursery tales, “the blasphemous nonsense with which mothers fool the
                    manhood out of their children,” are to be suppressed. Dramatic and imitative
                    poetry are not to be allowed. Education, marriage, the number of births, the
                    occupations of the citizens are to be controlled by the guardians or heads of
                    the state. The most perfect equality of conditions and careers is to be
                    preserved; the women are to have similar training with the men, no careers and
                    no ambition are to be forbidden to them; the inequalities and rivalries between
                    rich and poor are to cease, because all will be provided for by the state. Other
                    cities are divided against themselves, “Any ordinary city, however small, is in
                    fact two cities, one the city of the poor, the other of the rich, at war with
                    one another” <hi rend="italic">[Republic,</hi> bk. iv. p. 249, Jowett’s
                    translation). But this ideal state is to be a perfect unit; although the
                    citizens are divided into classes according to their capacity and ability, there
                    is none of the exclusiveness of birth, and no inequality is to break the accord
                    which binds all the citizens, both male and female, together into one harmonious
                    whole. The marvellous comprehensiveness of the scheme for the government of this
                    ideal state makes it belong as much to the modern as to the ancient world. Many
                    of the social problems to which Plato draws attention are yet unsolved, and some
                    are in process of solution in the direction indicated by him. He is not appalled
                    by the immensity of the task which he has sketched out for himself and his
                    followers. He admits that there are difficulties to be overcome, but he says in
                    a sort of parenthesis, “Nothing great is easy.” He refuses to be satisfied with
                    half measures and patchwork reforms.</p>
                <p>“Enough, my friend! but what is enough while anything remains wanting ?” These
                    sentences indicate the spirit in which philosophical as distinguished from
                    practical communists from the time of Plato till to-day have undertaken to
                    reconstruct human society.</p>
                <p>Sir Thomas More’s <hi rend="italic">Utopia</hi> has very many of the
                    characteristics of <hi rend="italic">The Republic.</hi> There is in it the same
                    wonderful power of shaking off the prejudices of the place and time in which it
                    was written. The government of Utopia is described as founded on popular
                    election; community of goods prevailed, the magistrates distributed the
                    instruments of production among the inhabitants, and the wealth resulting from
                    their industry was shared by all. The use of money and all outward ostentation
                    of wealth were forbidden. All meals were taken in common, and they were rendered
                    attractive by the accompaniment of sweet strains of music, while the air was
                    filled by the scent of the most delicate perfumes. More’s ideal state differs in
                    one important respect from Plato’s. There was no community of wives in Utopia.
                    The sacredness of the family relation and fidelity to the marriage contract were
                    recognized by More as indispensable to the wellbeing of modern society. Plato,
                    notwithstanding all the extraordinary originality with which he advocated the
                    emancipation of women, was not able to free himself from the theory and practice
                    of regarding the wife as part and parcel of the property of her husband. The
                    fact, therefore, that he advocated community of property led him also to
                    advocate community of wives. He speaks of “the <hi rend="italic">possession and
                    use</hi> of women and children,” and proceeds to show how this possession and
                    use must be regulated in his ideal state. Monogamy was to him mere exclusive
                    possession on the part of one man of a piece of property which ought to be for
                    the benefit of the public. The circumstance that he could not think of wives
                    other wise than as the property of their husbands only makes it the more
                    remarkable that he claimed for women absolute equality of training and careers.
                    The circumstance that communists have so frequently wrecked their projects by
                    attacking marriage and advocating promiscuous intercourse between the sexes may
                    probably be traced to the notion which regards a wife as being a mere item among
                    the goods and chattels of her husband. It is not difficult to find evidence of
                    the survival of this ancient habit of mind. “I will be master of what is mine
                    own,” says Petruchio. “She is my goods, my chattels.”</p>
                <p>The Perfectionists of Oneida, a well-known communistic society in the United
                    States which has put into practice community of wives, or, as they call it,
                    complex marriage, justify their extraordinary social system by affirming that
                    there is “no intrinsic difference between property in persons and property in
                    things; and that the same spirit which abolished exclusiveness in regard to
                    money would abolish, if circumstances allowed full scope to it, exclusiveness in
                    regard to women and children” (Nordhoff ’ s <hi rend="italic">Communistic
                    Societies of the United States,</hi> pp. 271-2). It is this notion of a wife as
                    property that is responsible for the wild opinions communists have often held in
                    favour of a community of wives and the break-up of family relations. If they
                    could shake off this notion and take hold of the conception of marriage as a
                    contract, there is no reason why their views on the community of property should
                    lead them to think that this contract should not include mutual fidelity and
                    remain in force during the life of the contracting parties. It was probably not
                    this conception of the marriage relation so much as the influence of
                    Christianity which led More to discountenance community of wives in Utopia. It
                    is strange that the same influence did not make him include' the absence of
                    slavery as one of the characteristics of his' ideal state. On the contrary,
                    however, we find in Utopia <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n240/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0240-0213"/> the anomaly of slavery existing side by side with
                    institutions which otherwise embody the most absolute personal, political, and
                    religious freedom. The presence of slaves in Utopia is made use of to get rid of
                    one of the practical difficulties of communism, viz., the performance of
                    disagreeable work. In a society where one man is as good as another, and the
                    means of subsistence are guaranteed to all alike, it is easy to imagine that it
                    would be difficult to ensure the performance of the more laborious, dangerous,
                    and offensive kinds of labour. In Utopia, therefore, we are expressly told that
                    “all the uneasy and sordid services” are performed by slaves. The institution of
                    slavery was also made supplementary to the criminal system of Utopia, as the
                    slaves were for the most part men who had been con victed of crime; slavery for
                    life was made a substitute for capital punishment.</p>
                <p>In many respects, however, More’s views on the labour question were vastly in
                    advance of his own time, and indeed of ours. He repeats the indignant protest of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> that existing society is a warfare between
                    rich and poor. “The rich,” he says, “devise every means by which they may in the
                    first place secure to themselves what they have amassed by wrong, and then take
                    to their own use and profit, at the lowest possible price, the work and labour
                    of the poor. And so soon as the rich decide on adopting these devices in the
                    name of the public, then they become law.” One might imagine these words had
                    been quoted from the programme of the International Society, so completely is
                    their tone in sympathy w ith the hardships of the poor in all ages. More shared
                    to the full the keen sympathy with the hopeless misery of the poor which has
                    been the strong motive power of nearly all speculative communism. The life of
                    the poor as he saw it was so wretched that he said, “Even a beast’s life seems
                    enviable !” Besides community of goods and equality of conditions, More
                    advocated other means of ameliorating the condition of the people. Although the
                    hours of labour were limited to six a day there was no scarcity, for in Utopia
                    every one worked; there was no idle class, no idle individual even. The
                    importance of this from an economic point of view is insisted on by More in a
                    passage remarkable for the importance which he attaches to the industrial
                    condition of women. “And this you will easily apprehend,” he says, “if you

                    generally do little, who are the half of mankind.” Translated into modern
                    language his proposals comprise universal compulsory education, a reduction of
                    the hours of labour to six a day, the most modern principles of sanitary reform,
                    a complete revision of criminal legislation, and the most absolute religious
                    toleration. The romantic form which Sir Thomas More gave to his dream of a new
                    social order found many imitators. The <hi rend="italic">Utopia</hi> may be

                <p>It is remarkable that all communists have made a great point of the importance of
                    universal education. All ideal communes have been provided by their authors with
                    a perfect machinery for securing the education of every child. One of the first
                    things done in every attempt to carry communistic theories into practice, has
                    been to establish a good school and guarantee education to every child. The
                    first impulse to national education in the present century probably sprang from
                    the very marked success of Robert Owen’s schools in connection with the cotton
                    mills at New Lanark. At a time (1806) when popular education was in the lowest
                    possible condition, Owen, as manager and part owner of the New Lanark Mills,
                    proposed to his partners to spend £5000 upon new schools. They not unnaturally
                    objected to an expenditure at that time quite unprecedented; whereupon Owen
                    bought his partners out for £84,000, and took his own course upon the
                    educational system he had brought forward. It is to be observed that communists
                    have seldom or never relied on their peculiar system alone for the regeneration
                    of society. Community of goods has indeed been their central idea, but they have
                    almost invariably supported it by other projects of less questionable utility.
                    Compulsory education, free trade, and law reform, the various movements
                    connected with the improvement of the condition of women, have found their
                    earliest advocates among theoretical and practical communists. The communists
                    denounce the evils of the present state of society; the hopeless poverty of the
                    poor, side by side with the self-regarding luxury of the rich, seems to them to
                    cry aloud to Heaven for the creation of a new social organization. They proclaim
                    the necessity of sweeping away the institution of private property, and insist
                    that this great revolution, accompanied by universal education, free trade, a
                    perfect administration of justice, and a due limitation of the numbers of the
                    community, would put an end to half the self-made distresses of humanity. Has it
                    never occurred to them that a similarly happy result might be attained if all
                    these subsidiary reforms were carried out, leaving the principles of private
                    property and competition to their old predominance in the economic world <hi
                    rend="italic">ì If</hi> the principles of communism and of private property are
                    to be fairly compared, the comparison must not be between communism as it might
                    be and private property as it is. Communism to be successful requires to be
                    accompanied by important reforms, towards which existing society founded on
                    private property is gradually finding its way. The power which society, as at
                    present constituted, has shown of adapting itself to altered circumstances, and
                    of assimilating by slow degrees the more valuable concomitants of the most
                    revolutionary theories, is strong proof that it does not deserve to be dealt
                    with in the summary manner advocated by the communists.</p>
                <p>We find in many socialistic writings of thirty or forty years ago the assumption
                    expressed or implied that, in society as it is, the most valuable and essential
                    reforms are impracticable. Μ. Louis Blanc, for instance, in his book called <hi
                    rend="italic">L</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Organisation du Travail,</hi> first
                    published in 1839, says that in the existing order of society the spread of
                    education among the masses would be dangerous,—would, in fact, be impossible.
                    This, if true, would be the strongest possible indictment against the existing
                    order of society. But how have events falsified the assumptions made in the
                    following passage î “On a vu pourquoi, dans le système actuel, l’éducation des
                    enfants du peuple était impossible Beaucoup d’esprits sérieux pensent qu’il
                    serait dangereux aujourd’hui de répandre l’instruction dans les rangs du peuple,
                    et ils ont raison. Mais comment ne s’aperçoivent-ils pas que ce danger de
                    l’éducation est une preuve accablante de l’absurdité de notre ordre social <hi
                    rend="italic">Ì</hi> Dans cet ordre social, tout est faux: le travail n’y est
                    pas en honneur; les professions les plus utiles y sout dédaignées; un laboureur
                    y est tout au plus un objet de compassion, et on n’a pas assez de couronnes pour
                    une danseuse. Voilà, voilà pourquoi l’éducation du peuple est un danger!” (p.
                    100). Hence, he concludes, a social revolution ought to be attempted; a new
                    system of society ought to be introduced; the old system of society is, he says,
                    so “full of iniquities” that it cannot co-exist with a diffusion of education
                    among the people. Even at the time when these words were written there was much
                    to show that they were not true. Since they were written the spread of education
                    has been most general in those countries in which the old social order, founded
                    on private property and competition, is unshaken.</p>

                <p>Germany, Scotland, and America have an educated people, and they are
                    distinguished among other countries for possessing a peaceful, law-abiding, and
                    order-loving population. So far from education being a danger to the institution
                    of private property, nearly every one has been convinced by events that it is
                    much more seriously threatened by ignorance and the helpless desperation
                    ignorance brings; and the old order of society has recognized the necessity of
                    protecting itself by the diffusion of education.</p>

                    furnishes another example of the mistake communists often make in thinking it is
                    necessary to turn the world upside down in order to bring about some desirable
                    economic change. Μ. Louis Blanc is describing the organization necessary for the
                    establishment of his “ateliers nationaux," which became so famous nine years
                    later when the eloquent author of <hi rend="italic">L'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Organisation du Travail</hi> was a member of the Government of 1848. He is
                    speaking of the place occupied by the credit and banking system in the existing
                    economical order of society. “Que doit être le crédit? Un moyen de fournir des
                    instruments de travail au travailleur. Aujourd’hui, nous l’avons montré
                    ailleurs” (in an article in the <hi rend="italic">Revue de Progrès</hi> called
                    “Question des Banques ”) “le crédit est tout autre chose. Les banques ne prêtent
                    qu’au riche. Voulussent-elles prêter au pauvre, elles ne le pourraient pas sans
                    courir aux abîmes. Les banques constitutées au point de vue individuel ne
                    sauraient donc jamais être, quoi qu’on fasse, qu’im procédé admirablement
                    imaginé pour rendre les riches plus riches et les puissants plus puissants.
                    Toujours le monopole sous les dehors de la liberté, toujours la tyrannie sous
                    les apparences du progrès! <hi rend="italic">L'Organisation</hi> proposée” (that
                    of the national workshops) “couperait court à tant d’iniquités. Cette portion de
                    bénéfices, spécialement et invariablement consacrée à l’agrandissement de
                    l’atelier social par le recrutement des travailleurs, voilà le crédit.
                    Maintenant, qu’avez vous besoin des banques <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>?
                    Supprimez-les” (pp. 97-8). This passage is a striking instance of the way in
                    which communistic writers are inclined to treat social and economic problems. Μ.
                    Louis Blanc observed that the banking system at the time in which he wrote was
                    in some respects defective. From the nature of their business and the security
                    they were obliged from motives of self-preservation to demand, the banks lent
                    only to those who were able to give them that security, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> to the rich. Even this statement requires some modification unless
                    in the expression “the rich” is included every struggling farmer or tradesman
                    who is helped over a time of pecuniary difficulty by the credit afforded to him
                    by his banker. The fact remains, however, that the banks did not give credit to
                    the labouring classes. Credit, urges Μ. Louis Blanc, which ought to be a means
                    of furnishing the instruments of production to the labourer, is in reality no
                    such thing. What is the remedy which he suggests for this deficiency in the
                    credit system? An entire reorganization of the industrial world, in which every
                    labourer will be supplied by the state with the tools and raw materials which
                    his work requires. If this proposed reorganization were adopted theιe would no
                    longer be any scarcity of credit, and as for banks, he cries triumphantly, they
                    would no longer be necessary, let them be put down.</p>
                <p>It is not Μ. Louis Blanc only who observed that the ordinary banking system
                    cannot, from want of security, afford to make advances to the labouring classes.
                    Herr Schulze-Delitzsch noted the same fact, but the remedy which he suggested,
                    and which has been carried out with such great success in Germany, is very
                    different from the heroic treatment recommended in the passage we have quoted
                    from Μ. Blanc. The Schulze-Delitzsch credit banks which began tobe established
                    in Germany in the year 1851 are associations of artizans formed for the purpose
                    of enabling the members to obtain by means of credit the capital necessary to
                    production. These associations are entirely self-supporting; they have
                    supplanted nothing, they have up-rooted nothing. Their success, so far from
                    weakening the ordinary banking system, has strengthened it by supplying one of
                    its deficiencies. The individual workman cannot obtain an advance of capital
                    upon credit because he cannot give adequate security that it will be repaid. But
                    the credit banks are associations of workmen who are jointly and severally
                    responsible for the repayment of loans made to any one of their number. A member
                    of one of these associations can through its means obtain a loan on favourable
                    terms, because the principle of the unlimited liability of each of the members
                    for the repayment of a loan made to any one of them affords the means of
                    offering to the lender most ample and sufficient security. The fact that the
                    principle of unlimited liability is strictly maintained is really the essential
                    characteristic of the security which the association is able to give to those
                    who advance capital to it. If this principle were relaxed it is more than
                    doubtful whether the security offered by the association would be sufficiently
                    good to ensure advances of capital being made to its members on remunerative
                    terms. The unlimited liability of each for the debts of all necessitates great
                    caution before a new member can be elected into one of these associations. The
                    circumstances and previous career of candidates for membership are most
                    carefully inquired into. They must give satisfactory evidence as to their
                    previous character and industry, and they are required to give substantial proof
                    that they are in a position to share the pecuniary responsibilities of the
                    association by becoming shareholders in it. Care, however, is taken to elect no
                    one who is not a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> workman. The capital required
                    for making loans is partly obtained from the subscriptions of members, but the
                    principal part of it is obtained in the open market, where the association,
                    being able to offer good security, can obtain money on reasonable terms.</p>
                <p>The success of these associations has been most striking, ln 1865 there were 961
                    credit banks in existence in Germany. Of these 498 sent in a report of their
                    financial condition to the central bureau, and their accounts showed that they
                    then possessed nearly 170,000 members, and that the money annually advanced was
                    equal to £10,000,000 sterling. As ten years have passed since the time when
                    these repoi ts were sent in, and the prosperity of the associations has during
                    the interval been uninterrupted, there is every reason to believe that the
                    number of members and the amount of the loans would at the present time show a
                    very considerable increase. The very remarkable success of the credit banks is
                    an instance of what great things can be done by self-help and without initiating
                    any attack on the existing order of economic life. It is one of the least
                    pleasing aspects of communism that communists not only do not attempt themselves
                    to bring about by similar means an amelioration in the economic condition of
                    society but they have often gone out of their way to pour contempt and ridicule
                    on such reforms as that introduced by Herr Schulze-Delitzsch. The establishment
                    of the credit banks was looked on with great disfavour by the German communists.
                    Their leader, Ferdinand Lassalle, published a book, said to be the most
                    important of his economic writings, in which he bitterly attacked the credit
                    banks and the co operative system generally <hi rend="italic">(Herr</hi><hi

                    principles of private property and competition; and it was these principles
                    which he had set himself to destroy. The good achieved by an amelioration of the
                    condition of the people did not appear to him to outweigh the evils which <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n242/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0242-0215"/> he believed to be associated with every
                    circumstance that favoured the accumulation of capital in private hands.
                    Cooperation, he urges, is only improved capitalism, and the very improvement by
                    making it more formidable seemed only to make it more hateful to him.</p>
                <p>In the same spirit of bitter hostility to all means of improving the existing
                    condition of society without changing the basis on which it rests, communists
                    have often shown great contempt for political liberalism. The changes proposed
                    and carried out by political liberals are condemned by the communists as a mere
                    patching up of an essentially worthless fabric which must be got rid of before
                    anything better can be substituted in its place. At the time when the agitation
                    for the Reform Bill carried in 1832 was uppermost in the minds of all English
                    politicians, Robert Owen took an opportunity of proclaiming in public his belief
                    in the utter futility of all political reform. The German communists, or
                    socialists as they are often called, have, generally speaking, been very
                    emphatic in expressing themselves in a similar strain. The following passage,
                    taken from the writings of Karl Marx, a member of the International Society, is
                    scarcely an exaggeration of the views of the German school of communism on the
                    value and results of political liberalism :—</p>
                <p>“Although the liberals have not carried out their principles in any land as yet
                    completely, still the attempts which have been made are sufficient to prove the
                    uselessness of their efforts. They endeavoured to free labour, but only
                    succeeded in subjecting it more completely under the yoke of capital; they aimed
                    at setting at liberty all labour powers, and only riveted the chains of misery
                    which held them bound; they wanted to release the bondman from the clod, and
                    deprived him of the soil on which he stood by buying up the land; they yearned
                    fora happy condition of society, and only created superfluity on one hand and
                    dire want on the other; they desired to secure for merit its own honourable
                    reward, and only made it the slave of wealth; they wanted to abolish all
                    monopolies, and placed in their stead the monster monopoly, capital; they wanted
                    to do away with all wars between nation and nation, and kindled the flames of
                    civil war; they tried to get rid of the state, and yet have multiplied its
                    burdens; they wanted to make education the common property of all, and made it
                    the privilege of the rich; they aimed at the greatest moral improvement of
                    society, and have only left it in a state of rotten immorality; they wanted, to
                    say all in a word, unbounded liberty, and have produced the meanest servitude;
                    they wanted the reverse of all which they actually obtained, and have thus given
                    a proof that liberalism in all its ramifications is nothing but a perfect
                    Utopia.”</p>
                <p>The condition of England is often pointed at triumphantly by communists of other
                    countries as a complete condemnation of the principles of private property,
                    capitalism, and competition. Lassalle, Marx, Louis Blanc, and others quote
                    passages from bluebooks, speeches of English statesmen, and writings of our
                    public men in which the condition of the English poor is painted in the darkest
                    colours. In England, they say, for the last half century you have had liberalism
                    in the ascendant; you have had free trade, you have had an energetic and
                    industrious people; the amount of capital eager for employment is practically
                    unlimited; competition has had in nearly every branch of trade the most
                    unrestricted development. In England, if anywhere, we may surely look for the
                    nearest approach to perfection of which the present economic condition of
                    society is capable. Then they proceed to quote passages from parliamentary
                    speeches and official reports, and from English writers on political economy,
                    all bearing witness to the terrible poverty and squalor in which a large
                    proportion of the labouring class in this country spend their lives. Μ. Louis
                    Blanc, in the book already referred to, quoted from Lord Lytton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">England and the English</hi> a passage showing that the amount and
                    quality of nutriment consumed by the inmates of our jails and workhouses were at
                    that time far in excess of what could be obtained by the wages of the frugal and
                    industrious working-man. Marx cites the following passage from Dr Hunter’s
                    report to the Privy Council (1862-3) on the domiciliary condition of the
                    agricultural labourer :—“The means of existence of the hind are fixed at the
                    veιy lowest possible scale. What he gets in wages and domicile is not at all
                    commensurate with the profit produced by his work. His means of subsistence are
                    always treated as a fixed quantity; as for any further reduction of his income
                    he may say <hi rend="italic">nihil</hi><hi rend="italic">habeo,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nihil euro.</hi> He is not afraid of the future; he has reached
                    zero, a point from which dates the farmer’s calculation. Come what may he takes
                    no interest in either fortune or misfortune.”</p>
                <p>Whatever may be the value of the remedy - which communism suggests for so
                    melancholy a condition as that here described, it is surely useful that the
                    attention of people who have “much goods laid up for many years” should be
                    forcibly arrested, and that they should be made to consider why it is that in
                    the richest country in the world the condition of a large proportion of the
                    labouring classes is so bad that it can hardly be made worse. But at present
                    there is a general conviction that the remedy proposed by communists is one
                    which it would be overwhelmingly difficult to apply, and it is also believed
                    that even if it were applied it would be of doubtful efficacy. Some of the most
                    obvious difficulties associated with the practical adoption of communism have
                    been already adverted to. The social, political, and industrial edifice which is
                    the outcome of centuries of effort and sacrifice would be destroyed by the
                    adoption of communism; it would be necessary to reconstruct society from its
                    very foundations; and society, like a constitution, is one of those things which
                    cannot be made—it must grow. Then also the efficacy of communism as a remedy for
                    the miserable condition of the poor is, to say the least, doubtful. To what
                    cause may be assigned most of the pauperism, misery, and squalor which hang like
                    a cloud over the lives of so many of the labouring classes? What w as the
                    principal agency which brought about calamities like the Irish and the Orissa
                    famines <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> There can be but one answer to these
                    questions,—the pressure of population on the means of subsistence. Many
                    communistic writers have passionately denied this, and have denounced with all
                    the fervour of emotional natures the doctrine laid down by Malthus that
                    population tends to increase faster than subsistence is capable of being
                    increased. No one, however, has attempted to throw doubt on the main fact on
                    which the Malthusian doctrine rests, that everywhere, except in very new
                    countries with a large extent of unoccupied fertile land, checks on population
                    are in active operation. These checks must exist everywhere where population
                    does not increase at its greatest possible speed. Under favourable conditions
                    population sometimes has doubled itself in 20 years. Professor Cairnes has
                    stated that in Ireland the population more than doubled itself in the 38 years
                    between 1767 and 1805. At the rate of increase <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the ten
                    years ending 1870, the population of England would double itself in 63 years,
                    that of France in 265 years. In France and England, therefore, checks on
                    population are, in a varying degree, in active operation; and the same may be
                    said of all old countries. It is important, however, to inquire into the nature
                    of the checks on population in actual operation. They may be divided into two
                    classes, the first carrying with it nothing but misery and degradation, the
                    second implying a high degree of self <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n243/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0243-0216"/> restraint, independence, and foresight. In the
                    first class may be placed war, pestilence, famine, and all the diseases incident
                    to insufficient food and overcrowding. In the second class may be placed
                    prudential restraints on marriage and on the number of births to each marriage,
                    and emigration. Every circumstance which weakens the efficiency of the checks on
                    population comprised in the second class necessarily adds to the force of the
                    checks which we have placed in the first class. In other words, any circumstance
                    which relaxes the force of the prudential checks on population tends to produce
                    the miseries of famine, scarcity, and “starvation diseases.” What would be the
                    effect of communism on the population question î Would it strengthen or weaken
                    the motives which promote a prudential limitation of numbers? Nearly all
                    communists, whether theoretical or practical, have faced in one way or another
                    the population question. The solutions they have offered differ widely. Let us
                    first see what the greatest of theoretical communists have had to say on the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>Plato seems to have thought the matter an easy one, ⅛nd says that the guardians
                    of his state must control the number of births. In Utopia the age at which men
                    and women were allowed to marry was fixed by the state, and all irregularities
                    in defiance of this rule were to be severely punished. The population was also
                    to be kept within certain limits by means of migration, emigration, or
                    colonization. But the theoretical communists of modern times have hardly found
                    words strong enough to express their detestation of the principle that any
                    limitation is desirable to the possible number of births. The writings of
                    Malthus are spoken of as “an outrage on household life.” His language, it is
                    said, “brutalized the purest feelings of domesticity.” Μ. Louis Blanc inveighs
                    against the doctrines of political economists, and protests that they are
                    blaspheming God when they say that the pros perity of the poor would be promoted
                    by a limitation of the population. Why are you not logical <hi rend="italic"
                    >ì</hi> he cries. If you were you would recommend that the children of the poor
                    should be put to death! And in another place he speaks of “cette économie
                    politique sans entrailles dont Ricardo a si complaisament posé les prémisses, et
                    dont Malthus a tiré avec tant de sang-froid l’horrible conclusion. Cette
                    économie politique portait en elle même un vice qui devait la rendre fatale à
                    l’Angleterre et au monde” <hi rend="italic">(L’Organisation du Travail,</hi> p.
                    71). Practical communists have not, however, met the population question in the
                    spirit indicated by these quotations. Several of the most successful
                    realizations of communistic life have maintained the strictest celibacy among
                    their members. The Essenes, who practised community of goods before the
                    Christian era, were a sect composed entirely of men, who lived in seclusion from
                    the world and were in many important respects the prototypes of Christian
                    hermits or monks.</p>
                <p>Two of the most important communistic societies of the United States have also
                    made celibacy an essential feature of their system. The “Economites” and “the
                    Shakers,” the societies to which reference is made, have existed since 1805 and
                    1792 respectively. They are strictly celibate, their numbers being recruited by
                    converts from the outside world and to a slight extent by the adoption of pauper
                    children and orphans from neighbouring towns. Other communistic societies
                    maintain the authority of the heads of the society to limit the number of
                    marriages. The Spartan Government, which in many important respects was
                    communistic, exercised the most absolute control over the increase of
                    population. Among the Moravians marriage is not permitted to take place without
                    the consent of the heads of the society, who furnish the newly married couples
                    with a suitable marriage portion.</p>
                <p>The Separatists, an American community of German origin, established in 1817,
                    favour celibacy although they do not enforce it. No marriage can take place
                    without the consent of the trustees of the society; and they further discourage
                    marriage by entering among the articles of their religion a declaration of their
                    belief that celibacy is more in accordance with the divine will than marriage.
                    The Amana community also, a German society in the United States, which dates its
                    origin from early in the last century, discourages marriage among its members.
                    No man is allowed to marry before he is twenty-four years of age. Mr Nordhoff
                    relates that the reason for this rule was explained to him by one of the elders
                    of the Amana Society in these words,—“They” (the young men) “have few cares in
                    life, and would marry too early for their own good—food and lodging being
                    secured them—if there were not a rule upon the subject.” The religious tone of
                    the community is also set against marriage. “In the Amana Church there are three
                    classes, orders, or grades, the highest consisting of those members who have
                    manifested in their lives the greatest spirituality and piety. Now if the
                    newly-married couple should have belonged for years to this highest class, their
                    wedding would put them down into the lowest, or the <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> children’s order,’ for a year or two until they had won their slow way
                    back by deepening piety” (Nordhoff’s <hi rend="italic">Communistic Societies of
                    the United States,</hi> pp. 36-7). Even the Perfectionists, whose extraordinary
                    system of “complex marriage” has been already referred to, take many precautions
                    against a superabundant population. The number of births is controlled by the
                    heads of the society. The founder of the community writes as follows: “Previous
                    to about two and a half years ago, we refrained from the usual rate of
                    child-bearing, for several reasons—financial and otherwise.” Even when the
                    number of births was increased it was stated that they were purposely kept
                    within such limits that “judicious moral and spiritual care, with the advantage
                    of a liberal education,” could be guaranteed to every child (Nordhoff, p. 276).
                    The practical answer made by communists to the population question, even in so
                    wealthy a country as America, in which unoccupied fertile land can be easily and
                    cheaply obtained, is that a strict limitation of numbers is absolutely essential
                    to their social and industrial well-being. As a matter of fact the population of
                    nearly all the American communistic societies has not increased at all, but has
                    greatly declined during the last fifty years. The number of Shakers, for
                    instance, in 1823 was 3800; their number in 1874 was 2415. The Icarians, the
                    only American community which makes marriage compulsory, have declined in tw
                    enty-five years from 1500 to 65.</p>
                <p>It would, however, be rash to conclude from these facts that the general adoption
                    of communism would tend to strengthen the prudential checks on population. We
                    have seen that modern communists, when freed from the trammels of actual
                    experience of the daily working of the system they advocate, have vigorously
                    denounced the theory and practice of Malthusianism. The American communities
                    have declined in numbers partly in consequence of the adoption in two of them of
                    celibacy as a religious principle. It is also impossible to avoid the conclusion
                    that their numbers have fallen off partly in consequence of the unattractive
                    conditions of communistic life. The young members of these societies not
                    unfrequently leave them when they arrive at manhood and womanhood. The routine
                    and absence of spontaneity of a communistic life is a weight to young and active
                    minds that is not counterbalanced by security from want, or what has been called
                    a bread-and-butter prosperity. The numbers of marriages and of births have been
                    controlled in other of these societies in virtue of the absolute despotism which
                    is vested in their <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n244/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0244-0217"/> chiefs; individual liberty is entirely suspended;
                    the smallest minutiae of the daily life of their members is regulated from
                    headquarters. A government which decides at what hour its subjects shall go to
                    bed at night and rise in the morning; which prescribes the colour, shape, and
                    material of the dresses worn, the time of meals, the quality of the food
                    consumed, the daily task apportioned to each member; which enforces a rule that
                    each of its subjects shall leave every morning a notice stating at what exact
                    spot he or she will be found during each hour of the day; a government which can
                    do all these things will find no great difficulty in controlling the number of
                    marriages and births. Mr Nordhoff states that “the fundamental principle of
                    communal life is the subordination of the individual’s will to the general
                    interest or the general will; practically this takes the shape of unquestioning
                    obedience by the members towards the elders or chiefs of their society.” If,
                    however, communism were adopted throughout a whole nation, the minute despotism
                    which now distinguishes the government of existing communistic societies, and
                    which furnishes them w ith an effectual control over the growth of population,
                    would cease to be possible; or if, indeed, it should ever become possible it
                    would be through the careful suppression of individual liberty, and through the
                    strenuous encouragement of everything which tended to destroy self-reliance on
                    the part of the people and to build up the absolute power of the state. A people
                    who purchased material prosperity at the price of their liberty would strike a
                    bad bargain, especially when it is remembered that the limitation of the number
                    of marriages and births which is enforced by the central authority in a
                    communistic society can be effected by voluntary self-control in a society based
                    on private property and competition. The difference, therefore, so far as the
                    population question is concerned, between communism and private property is
                    whether the necessary restraint upon the possible number of births shall proceed
                    from the direct intervention of the state, or whether it shall proceed from the
                    combined motives of self-interest, self-control, and parental obligation on the
                    part of the people themselves. It should be remembered that what communism
                    professes to be able to do is to ensure to every member of a communistic society
                    an ample supply of the necessaries and conveniences of life. If the population
                    question is pressing now when the workhouse and parochial relief are the only
                    refuge of those who cannot maintain themselves, would it not become much more
                    pressing if a man could obtain freely, and without fulfilling any disagreeable
                    conditions, food, house, and clothing for himself, and as many children as he
                    chose to bring into existence? It is this consideration which has forced upon
                    the government of communistic societies the control of the marriages and births
                    of their members. Even where the principles of communism are adopted in so very
                    materially modified a form as they are in our poor law system, legislative
                    control over population has been enforced. The regulation which separates man
                    and wife in the workhouse is a practical recognition of the principle that,
                    where the State guarantees a maintenance, it must, in self-protection, exercise
                    control over the numbers of those dependent on it for support. Self-help brings
                    with it self-control; state-help makes state-control indispensable. In the
                    present economic condition of society the solution of the population question is
                    not to be found in placing in the hands of the state, as communism has done,
                    absolute control over domestic life. The solution of the problem must be sought
                    in education, in an improved standard of comfort and a determination on the part
                    of the people not to sink below it, and in a reform of the most communistic
                    portion of our poor law system,—the lavish distribution of out-door relief.</p>
                <p>There are some charges made against communism which may be brought with at least
                    equal force against the economic and industrial arrangements which now prevail.
                    One of these is that communism does not avail itself sufficiently of the motive
                    of self-interest in order to obtain from each labourer the best and most
                    conscientious work of which he is capable. If, it is urged, the result of a
                    man’s industry belongs not to himself solely but to the whole community of which
                    he is a member, he will not throw the same energy and zeal into his work as he
                    will if everything which he produces belongs solely to himself. There can be no
                    doubt of the truth of this statement; self-interest is a force on which
                    industrial machinery chiefly relies for motive power. But it is remarkable that
                    the prevailing system of working for fixed weekly wages checks the play of
                    self-interest in the workman much more completely than it is checked in a
                    communistic society by the fact that the results of the labour of each are
                    shared by all. A workman who is in receipt of fixed weekly wages has no motive
                    to reach any higher standard of excellence c expedition in his work than such as
                    will prevent him from being discharged for bad ⅛ work or laziness. It is a
                    complaint constantly heard among employers of labour that the only ambition of
                    the men seems to be to see how little work they can do for their wages. The
                    actual existence of this feeling among workmen is proved by many of the rules of
                    trades’ unions,—such as that which limits the number of bricks which a hod man
                    is allowed to carry, and which in one case forbade the use of wheel barrows in
                    taking bricks from one spot to another. Mr Thornton’s book <hi rend="italic">On
                    Labour</hi> gives several examples of the rules adopted by trades’ unions to
                    check the tendency which is sometimes found in a workman to exert himself to do
                    his best and thus show his superiority over his fellows. “ ‘Not besting one’s
                    mates ’ has by several unions been made the subject of special enactment The
                    Manchester Bricklayers’</p>
                <p>Association has a rule providing that ‘any man found running or working beyond a
                    regular speed shall be fined 2s. 6d. for the first offence, 5s. for the second,
                    10s. for the third, and if still persisting shall be dealt with as the committee
                    think proper.’” It was urged by the trade unionists in the textile manufactures
                    of Lancashire and Yorkshire as a serious argument for placing impediments in the
                    way of the employment of women in these industries that they were apt to take a
                    pride and pleasure in the excellence and rapidity of their work, and that their
                    vanity was such that a word of praise or encouragement from the overlooker would
                    cause them to redouble their exertions (Report of Dr Bridges and Mr Holmes on
                    the condition of women and children employed in Textile Industries, 1873).</p>
                <p>These examples are more than sufficient evidence that the present industrial
                    system does not bring into play the motive force of direct self-interest in
                    stimulating the exertions of the labourers. In this respect communism would seem
                    at first sight to compare favourably with mere wages-receiving industry; for in
                    a communistic society every man and woman has some direct share, however small,
                    in the results of his or her labour If more is produced, there will be more to
                    receive; and instead of a trades’ union, every member of which is pledged, under
                    penalties, to work slowly and to watch that his fellow-workmen do the same,
                    communism gives to each labourer a direct interest not only in working well
                    himself, but in watching to see that honest and steady work is done by his
                    neighbours. As a matter of fact, the American communistic societies have found
                    no difficulty in enforcing the habit of careful and regular industry on their
                    members. The American communists do not as a rule work hard; for they find that
                    they can provide for all the wants of the community without excessive<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n245/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0245-0218"/> or exhausting toil. But there are no idle
                    members, and every member works well and steadily while he is working. That the
                    quality of their work is good is proved by the fact that their commercial
                    reputation stands very high. The garden seeds, the production of which is the
                    staple trade among the Shakers, have been celebrated for their excellence for
                    more than seventy years all over the United States. “The Oneida Perfectionists
                    established the reputation of their silk twist in the market by giving accurate
                    weight and sound material; the woollen stuffs of Amana command a constant
                    market, because they are well and honestly made; and in general I have found
                    that the communists have a reputation for honesty and fair dealing among their
                    neighbours, wherever their products are bought and sold” (Nordhoff).</p>
                <p>It must, however, be remembered that a few small communities, such as those which
                    exist in America, afford no fair test of what would be the effect of a general
                    adoption of communism on industrial activity and efficiency. The communists in
                    the United States only number about 5000, including children; and though there
                    are eight different societies, these are divided into 72 separate communities,
                    the Shakers alone having 58. On an average, therefore, each community consists
                    of less than 70 persons. The elaborate despotism of communistic government,
                    together with the minute surveillance which the small size of these communities
                    renders possible, makes it easy for the leaders of these societies to exact from
                    each member his quota of toil; idleness would be at once detected and would not
                    be suffered to exist, as the power of expelling an idle member would be resorted
                    to if the voice of public opinion were not sufficient to induce him to mend his
                    ways. Similar means of detecting and preventing idleness would be completely
                    absent if communism were generally adopted. There would, of course, in this case
                    be no power of expelling an idle member, and the difficulty of detecting and
                    proving to the central authorities a disposition on the part of any of the
                    members to avoid a fair share of work would increas3 <hi rend="italic">pari
                    passu</hi> with the size of the community. The motive of self-interest in
                    promoting good work is much more powerful in a small communistic society than in
                    a large one. A man can appreciate the value of his own industry much more
                    clearly if the resulting product is shared between 60 or 70 persons, every one
                    of whom is well known to him, than he can if it is thrown into the common stock
                    of 20,000 people. The weakening of the motives of selfinterest which is inherent
                    in communism is reduced to a minimum in small communities, but it would act with
                    fatal results to industrial activity if there should ever be an attempt to make
                    communism universal. For, much· as the present system falls short of making the
                    most of the great engine of self-interest among those who merely work for wages,
                    there is no such failure among the other industrial classes. Capitalists,
                    landowners, inventors, Cornish tributers, and members of co-operative productive
                    societies and copartnerships are all brought under the stimulating influence of
                    self-interest, and thus devote themselves to industrial projects with a zeal
                    completely and necessarily unknown among those who work for wages or those who
                    are members ef communistic societies. It is the special feature of co-operation
                    that it brings the motive of self·· interest into activity among manual
                    labourers. Without attempting, as communism does, to overthrow all existing
                    economic institutions, it takes these as they are, and men and women as they
                    are, and suggests a means by which the labourer, no less than the capitalist,
                    can be stimulated by direct self-interest to throw some energy and enthusiasm
                    into his work.</p>
                <p>We referred above to the melancholy picture drawn by Karl Marx, Louis Blanc and
                    others of the condition of the English poor. Since they wrote, co-operation has
                    in some parts of England done much to brighten the social and industrial
                    condition of the working classes. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of l8th
                    August 1875 gives an account of the cooperative manufactures in the town of
                    Oldham. In this one town there are 80 joint-stock co-operative mills; in the
                    county of Lancashire there are 150. The bulk of the shareholders are artizans,
                    who labour in the mills, and who therefore have a direct and immediate interest
                    in the results of their industry. Cotton-spinning and weaving are the principal
                    businesses carried on in these mills. The principle of self-interest has had the
                    effect Of producing, not mete activity on the part of the labourer, but
                    thoroughly sound and honest work. We are told by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Times</hi> that these mills possess a high reputation for probity of
                    manufacture. They are worked partly with capital subscribed by the shareholders,
                    in £5 or £10 shares, and partly with borrowed capital which bears a fixed rate
                    of interest. Many of the mills pay a dividend of 10 per cent, on their share
                    capital; the ledgers and account-books of each society are open to all the
                    shareholders, who also exercise the power of electing in open meeting the
                    managers and officers of the association. The shareholders frequently invest
                    money on loan to the societies of which they are members, so that the interests
                    of the lenders and of the shareholders are identified in the most absolute
                    manner possible. The most important of these associations is perhaps the
                    Industrial Co-operative Society of Oldham founded in the year 1850-1. From very
                    small beginnings it has gradually extended its operations until in the year 1874
                    it divided a dividend of £40,000 among its shareholders in four quarterly
                    instalments of £10,000 each. The total turnover of this society is £250,000 a
                    year. It forms, as it were, a kind of bank to the other co-operative societies.
                    At Christmas 1874 it had out on loan to these associations a number of sums
                    varying from £11,732 downwards, making a total of £45,437. The Sun Mill Company,
                    another of the Oldham co-operative associations, has a share capital of
                    £100,000. It is stated in a parliamentary return published in 1874 that there
                    are in England and Wales 790 co-operative societies, with 340,930 members, a
                    share capital of £3,334,104, and a loan capital of £431,808. Their net profits
                    for the year 1873 were £958,721, of which £861,964 was distributed as dividends
                    among the members ot the society, and £18,555 was paid away as interest to
                    nonmembers. There can be no doubt that co-operation was to a great extent
                    originated in England by communists. It is an outcome of the communistic
                    movement, for it was in the first instance mainly promoted by social reformers
                    who had proved by many failures the futility of communism as an engine of social
                    regeneration. Notwithstanding it, <hi rend="superscript"> c,</hi> origin, there
                    is, however, no movement more distinctly non-communistic than co-operation. It
                    strengthens the principles of capital and private property by making every
                    co-operator a capitalist, and thus personally interesting him in the maintenance
                    of the present economic condition of society.</p>
                <p>When the really great results of co-operation in this country are compared with
                    the very limited success of nearly a century of communism in America, the
                    conclusion is inevitable that co-operation is much more effectual than communism
                    in producing a radical improvement in the condition and status of labour, that
                    it is easier to graft upon existing institutions, and that its working is
                    unaccompanied by the despotism, the crushing of individuality, and the
                    discouragement of self-help, which are the admitted dangers and drawbacks of
                    communism. The state banks and national workshops of Μ. Louis Blanc’s economic
                    dreams were realized in 1848-50 in a manner that must have caused the severest
                    disappointment to their philanthropic author; failure and discredit were their
                    only practical results. The <pb break="no"

                    their head, have left nothing tangible which can be said to have advanced their
                    cause. The Schulze-Delitzsch credit banks, which they assailed as an improved
                    form of capitalism, have done and are doing more for labour in Germany than the
                    whole Social Democratic party has ever done.</p>
                <p>In France the names of Saint Simon, Fourier, Bazard, and Enfantin suggest chiefly
                    a series of tragic failures. In England Owen’s name recalls the brief existence
                    of Harmony Hall and Orbiston, the establishment of the Labour Exchange and the
                    issue of Labour Notes, and a number of other schemes which raised great hopes
                    and expectations that were doomed to a speedy disappointment. In America the
                    success of communism, such as it is, is hardly more encouraging than its failure
                    in Europe. The measure of material prosperity achieved is not very considerable,
                    bearing in mind the length of time most of the societies have existed and the
                    ease and cheapness with which unoccupied land can be obtained in the United
                    States. Mr Nordhoff estimates the capitalized wealth of the 72 American communes
                    at twelve millions of dollars, or about £2,400,000 sterling. They own between
                    150,000 and 180,000 acres of land, or on an average about 36 acres a head—a
                    comparatively small holding for America. The 72 communes are spread over 13
                    States; they possess some of the most fertile land in the world; one of the
                    Shaker villages owns a magnificent estate of 4500 acres lying in the famous
                    Miami bottom, a soil much of which is so fertile that after sixty years of
                    cropping it will still yield from 60 to 70 bushels of corn to the acre without
                    manuring. The material condition of the inhabitants of the communistic villages
                    compares favourably, no doubt, with that of the German peasants by whom the
                    majority of American communes were originally started; but the monotony, the
                    personal submission, the impossibility of privacy or temporary seclusion, the
                    absence of anything like intellectual activity in these societies, would render
                    the life well-nigh unbearable to people who had been previously accustomed to a
                    higher standard of happiness than that at present within the reach of the
                    ordinary day-labourer. Many communistic experiments in America have been
                    unsuccessful. Mr J. H. Noyes, in his book on “American Socialisms,” gives a
                    short history of no fewer than fortyseven of these failures. Comparing the
                    history of those societies which have died a natural death with that of those
                    which still continue to exist, it is found that the successful societies had no
                    advantage either in the wealth of their members or the intellectual ability of
                    their leaders. Most of the successful societies began poor; most of the
                    unsuccessful societies began with what were believed to be sufficient means to
                    achieve success. Many of the unsuccessful societies were founded by high-minded,
                    highly-cultivated men and women, and their members were distinguished for their
                    education and intellectual attainments. From these facts and with ample means
                    through personal experience for forming a correct opinion, Mr Nordhoff draws the
                    . conclusion that in a communistic experiment success depends upon a feeling
                    among all the members “of the unbearableness of the circumstances” in which
                    their lives were originally cast. They must have suffered from wrong and
                    oppression, as well as from want, before communism can appear as a welcome
                    change in their manner of life. Hence the poorer and more narrow and miserable
                    the condition of the people who start a communistic experiment the more likely
                    is it under judicious leaders to succeed. People are easily satisfied when
                    almost any change in their lives must be for the better. It would he most
                    undesirable to detract from the achievement of the American communes in raising
                    the poorest and most miserable peasants to a degree of material prosperity,
                    which compares with that of the well-to-do small farmer in England or America.
                    This is no small feat; and they have also proved the possibility of putting
                    communism into a practical form, at any rate on a small scale, and under
                    exceptionally favourable economic conditions. But it is impossible to doubt that
                    their principal value to the world has been in illustrating the limitations and
                    drawbacks of the system. As long as communism remained an unexplored region
                    given over to the dreamers of dreams and the seers of visions, it was impossible
                    to prove that it did not possess all the marvellous perfection they fondly
                    attributed to it. The American societies offer a life which is confessedly
                    attractive only to those whose original circumstances are exceptionally
                    unfortunate; to these communism can give, together with a congenial religious
                    atmosphere, material prosperity of a humble type, accompanied by the sacrifice
                    of individuality, liberty, privacy, and intellectual development. It can hardly
                    be denied that these experiments prove that, even were communism on a large,
                    scale practically possible, it could never satisfy the aspirations of those who
                    look for a time when increased material prosperity among the wording-classes
                    shall be accompanied by a corresponding increase of intellectual activity,
                    political responsibility, and personal independence. The old form of society
                    would seem to be more favourable than communism to the growth of these
                    qualities; and it is probable that the American experiments may help to
                    establish the conviction among economic revolutionists that more can be
                    accomplished by grafting new institutions, such as co-operation, on the old
                    plant of private property than can be achieved by rooting it up altogether, and
                    planting the seedling of communism in its stead.</p>
