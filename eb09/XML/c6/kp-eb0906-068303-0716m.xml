                    (1785-1861), a distinguished English engineer, was born at Dilham in Norfolk,
                    where his father was a miller. He received his early education at the village
                    school, and subsequently profited greatly by the access he had to a clergyman’s
                    library. While still very young he worked in his father’s mill, and served an
                    apprenticeship of four years (1800-1804) as a joiner and cabinetmaker at
                    Stalham. After working for a short time with his father, he became associated
                    with an agricultural machine-maker, named Cook, who resided at Swanton. He now
                    showed gr at talent in making accurate and highly finished patterns for the iron
                    castings of horse threshing-machines and other implements. He turned his
                    attention to windmills, which were, at that time, encumbered with sails so large
                    that they proved ex eedingly difficult to manage during a storm. His
                    investigations led him to the invention of self-regulating windmill sails, which
                    were patented in 1807, and are now universally used. In 1812 he entered the
                    important works of Messrs Ransome of Ipswich, of which he soon became chief
                    engineer. He improved the port and gasworks of Ipswich, and ultimately became a
                    partner of the Messrs Ransome, and remained with them till 1826, when his
                    increasing interest in great engineering undertakings led to his removal to
                    London. Meanwhile, the subject of the employment of criminals had been much in
                    his thoughts; and the result was his invention of the treadmill, which he meant
                    to be used for grinding corn, pumping water, &amp;c., and did not contemplate as
                    an instrument of punishment. Shortly after 1818 all the principal jails in the
                    kingdom introduced the invention. In 1822 an account of the treadmill, “invented
                    by Mr William Cubitt of Ipswich,” was issued by the Society for the Promotion of
                    Prison Discipline. Mr Cubitt had been very busy, while in Ipswich, having issued
                    reports in 1814, 1820, and 1822 on the Norwich navigation. In 1822 he first
                    became intimate with Telford. After his removal to London he was almost
                    constantly engaged in important<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0717-0684"/> engineering works, and was often requested to
                    give his opinion and evidence on the improvement of canals, harbours, ports, and
                    rivers, the making of railways, and designs for bridges. His face was well known
                    in the committee rooms at Westminster. Among his works may be mentioned the
                    Oxford canal, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, the improvement of
                    the River Severn, the Bate docks at Cardiff, the Black Sluice drainage and its
                    outfall sluice at Boston harbour, the Middlesborough docks and coal drops in the
                    Tees, and the South-Eastern Railway, of which he was chief engineer. His advice
                    was often asked about proposed alterations on the Thames, Tees, Tyne, Ouse,
                    Weaver, Nene, Witham, and Welland; and he submitted important reports on these
                    rivers. He was a member of commission for the improvement of the Shannon, in
                    which capacity he did good service. On the Croydon Railway he applied the
                    atmospheric system of traction; and on the Great Northern Railway, constructed
                    by his son Mr Joseph Cubitt, he effected many valuable improvements. On the
                    Continent, too, his opinion was much valued. The Hanoverian Government consulted
                    him about the harbour and docks at Harburg; the water-works of the city of
                    Berlin were constructed under his immediate superintendence; his report on the
                    proposed Paris and Lyons railway had much weight in determining what offer was
                    to be accepted; and he was consulting engineer for the line of railway from
                    Boulogne to Amiens. Among his later works we may mention two large floating
                    landing stages at Liverpool, and the bridge for carrying the London turnpike
                    across the Medway at Rochester.</p>
                <p>In 1850 he was consulted by Sir Robert Peel in regard to a building in Hyde Park
                    for the International Exhibition. His name is identified with the <hi
                    rend="italic">original</hi> plan; and he gave such high satisfaction that Her
                    Majesty was graciously pleased to confer the honour of knighthood on him in
                    1852. Ultimately Sir Joseph Paxton’s plan was adopted, with the approval of Mr
                    Cubitt. Public recognition, sometimes withheld in the case of literary men, is
                    generally ample in the case of those who devote themselves to practical
                    usefulness. Cibitt accordingly was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society in 1830;
                    he was also a fellow of the Royal Irish Academy, a member of the Society of
                    Arts, and of the Institution of Civil Engineers, of which he became successively
                    a member of council in 1831, vice-president in 1836, and president in 1850 and
                    1851. In 1858, after a singularly arduous and successful career, he retired from
                    public business; but he never ceased to take an interest in engineering work
                    till his death, which took place on the 13th October 1861, at his house on
                    Clapham Common, London.</p>
