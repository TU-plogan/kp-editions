                    of his history except what can be gathered from one of his works which has come
                    down to us, a book which is in itself a mere bank of mud, but is remarkable on
                    account of certain geographical fossils of considerable interest which are found
                    imbedded in it. The first part of the work, embracing books i.-v., can be shown
                    to have been written soon after 535; to these seven more books appear to have
                    been gradually added by the author. He was a monk when he wrote, but in earlier
                    days apparently had been a merchant, and in that capacity had sailed on the Red
                    Sea and the Indian Ocean, visiting Abyssinia and Socotra (Ai0ιoτrια and ý <hi

                    Ceylon. The book, which was written at Alexandria, is called by the writer

                    the Whole World,</hi> and the great object of it is to denounce the false and
                    heathen doctrine of the rotundity of the earth, and to show that the tabernacle
                    in the wilderness is the pattern or model of the universe. Thus the earth is a
                    rectangular plane twice as long as it is broad. The heavens come down to the
                    earth on all four sides like the walls of a room. From the north wall to the
                    south wall, at an undefined level, a semi-circular waggon vault is turned, and
                    at the same level stretches the “firmament” (στ∈ptωp,α) like a flat ceiling. All
                    below the firmament is this world; the story above is heaven, or the world to
                    come. In fact, one of the huge receptacles in which female travellers of our own
                    day carry their dresses forms a perfect model of the universe of Cosmas. Midway
                    in the rectangular surface below lies the inhabited earth, encompassed by Ocean.
                    Beyond Ocean, bordering the edge, is the unvisited transoceanic land on which,
                    in the far east, lies Terrestrial Paradise. Here, too, on a barren and thorny
                    soil, without the walls of Paradise, dwelt man from the fall to the deluge. The
                    ark floated the survivors across the great ocean belt to this better land which
                    we inhabit. The earth rises gradually from south to north and west, culminating
                    in a great conical mountain behind which the sun sets. Repeatedly the writer
                    overflows with indignation against those who reject these views of his, “not
                    built on his own opinions and conjectures, but drawn from Holy Scripture, and
                    from the mouth of that divine man and great master, Patricius.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This Patricias is stated by
                    Cosmas to have been afterwards <hi rend="italic">Catholicos</hi> of Persia. This
                    and other circumstances identify Patricius with Mar Abas, who ruled the
                    Nestorian Church from 536 to 552 (see Assemani, <hi rend="italic">Bibl.
                    Orient,</hi> tom. ii. and iii.).</p></note> The wretched people who chop logic,
                    and hold that the earth and heaven are spherical, are mere blasphemers, given up
                    for their sins to the belief of such impudent nonsense as the doctrine of
                    Antipodes, and so forth. Altogether the book is a kind of caricature type of
                    that process of loading Christian truth with a dead weight of false science
                    which has had so many followers and done so much mischief. Similar cosmography
                    was taught by Diodorus of Tarsus, and other Nestorian doctors.</p>

                <p>Among the curious pieces of information very sparsely found amid this stuff are
                    notices of <hi rend="italic">Ethiopia</hi> (Abyssinia) and its traffic for gold
                    with Inner Africa, of <hi rend="italic">Taprobane</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sielediba</hi> (Ceylon), <hi rend="italic">Male</hi> (Malabar), and the
                    products and animals of those regions. But the most interesting geographical
                    circumstance is the fact that Cosmas is not only the first who mentions China by
                    a name on which there can be no controversy, <hi rend="italic">Tzinista,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Persian <hi rend="italic">Chinùtáu,</hi> but also
                    that he had a very correct idea of its position as lying on the extreme eastern
                    coast of Asia, and “compassed by the ocean running round it to the left just as
                    the same ocean encompasses Barbary <hi rend="italic">(fi.e.,</hi> the Somáli
                    country beyond Abyssinia) round to the right.” He knew also that a ship sailing
                    to China, after running east for a long way, and leaving the Clove Country
                    behind, had to turn north at least as far as a ship bound for Chaldaea would
                    have to run up the Persian Gulf, and thus it was intelligible how Tzinista by
                    the overland route lay much nearer Persia than might have been thought from the
                    length of the sea voyage thither.</p>
                <p>The work has been preserved in at least two MSS. One is in the Vatican, a very
                    fine uncial MS. of the 8th century, with figures apparently from drawings by
                    Cosmas himself; the other a parchment MS. of the 10th century, is in the
                    Medicean. This last alone contains the 12tlι book, and of that a leaf is lost.
                    An account of the work is given in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi> of
                    Photius, who speaks contemptuously of the author. Some geographical extracts
                    were first published in Thévenot’s <hi rend="italic">Collection of Travels</hi>
                    (1696). The whole work was edited by Montfaucon in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Collectio</hi><hi rend="italic">nova Patrum</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Script. Graec.,</hi> 1706 (vol. ii), and is republished in <hi

                    >Patrum</hi> of P. Andrea Gallandi (vol. xi., Venice, 1776). It appears from
                    allusions in the book itself that Cosmas also wrote a more detailed <hi
                    rend="italic">Topography of the Earth,</hi> a work on the motions of the stars,
                    and a <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Canticles.</hi> The loss of the first is
                    to be regretted. (H.Y.)</p>
