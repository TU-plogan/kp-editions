                    space is occupied by garden-ground cleared from the ruins of ancient buildings.
                    The streets are for the most part so narrow and crooked that it would be much
                    more descriptive to speak of them as lanes; and, with the exception of those in
                    the Plaza Mayor, the houses are greatly dilapidated. As every building, however,
                    is profusely covered with whitewash, there is little difference on the surface
                    between the oldest and the most modern specimens. The southern suburb
                    communicates with the town by means of a bridge of sixteen arches across the
                    river, exhibiting the usual combination of Roman and Moorish masonry, and
                    dominated at the one end by an elevated statue of the patron saint, St Raphael,
                    whose effigy is to be seen in various other quarters of the city. The most
                    important of the public buildings are the cathedral, the old monastic
                    establishments, the churches, the bishop’s palace, the lyceum, the city hall,
                    the hospitals, and the colleges. The old royal palace (Alcazar) is in
                    ruins,—only one wing being sufficiently entire to serve the purpose of a prison.
                    The cathedral, which throws all the other churches into insignificance, was
                    originally built as a mosque by Abderrahman I. on the site, it is believed, of a
                    Roman temple. The exterior, with the straight lines of its square buttress
                    towers, has a heavy and somewhat ungainly appearance; but the interior is one of
                    the most beautiful specimens of Moorish architecture in Europe. Passing through
                    a grand courtyard about 500 feet in length, shady with palm, and cypress, and
                    orange-trees, and fresh with the full flow of fountains, the visitor enters a
                    magnificent and bewildering labyrinth of pillars. Porphyry and jasper and
                    marbles of many a tint are boldly combined in a matchless mosaic. Part have come
                    from the spoils of Nîmes or Narbonne, part from Seville or Tarragona, some from
                    the older ruins of Carthage, and others as a present to Abderrahman from Leo of
                    Byzantium Of different heights, they have been adjusted to their present
                    standard of 12 feet by being either sunk into the soil or lengthened by the
                    addition of Corinthian capitals Twelve hundred was the number of the columns in
                    the original building; but many have been destroyed, and, according to some
                    accounts, less than 700 remain. They divide the area of the building, which
                    measures 395 feet from east to west by 356 feet from north to south,
                    longitudinally into nineteen and transversely into twenty-nine aisles—each row
                    supporting a tier of open Moorish arches, which in its turn gives the basis for
                    a second tier with its pillars resting on the keystones of the tier beneath. The
                    full height of the ceiling is thus about 35 feet. The Moorish character of the
                    building was unfortunately impaired in the 16th century by the formation in the
                    interior of a <hi rend="italic">crucero</hi> or high altar and choir, in the
                    Roman style, by the addition of numerous chapels along <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n419/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0419-0390"/> the sides of the vast quadrangle, and by the
                    erection of a modern tower in room of the old muezzin. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >crucero</hi> in itself is no disgrace to the architect Hernan Ruiz, but every
                    lover of art must sympathize with the rebuke administered by Charles V. to the
                    cathedral authorities: “You have built here what could have been built as well
                    anywhere else; and you have destroyed what was unique in the world.”
                    Magnificent, indeed, as the cathedral still is, it is almost impossible to
                    realize what the mosque must have been w en the worshippers thronged through its
                    nineteen gateways of bronze, and its 4700 lamps, fed with perfumed oil, shed at
                    once light and fragrance through its brilliant aisles. Of the exquisite
                    elaboration bestowed on the more sacred portions abundant proof is afforded by
                    the small heptagonal chapel of the Mihrab, roofed with a single shelllike block
                    of snow-white marble, and inlaid with Byzantine mosaics of glass and gold.</p>
                <p>Cordova was celebrated in the time of the Moors for its silversmiths, who are
                    said to have come originally from Damascus; and it exported a peculiar kind of
                    leather which took its name from the city, wſhence we have still the word
                    “cordwainer.’’ These industries, however, disappeared with the race that
                    introduced them. In modern times, especially since the opening of the railway to
                    Cadiz and Seville, its industry has developed in various directions, and flax,
                    linen, silk, and woollens are now manufactured. Population, 42,000.</p>
                <p>Corduba, probably of Carthaginian origin, was occupied by Marcus Marcellus in 152
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and shortly afterwards became the first Roman
                    colony in Spain. From the large number of men of noble rank among the colonists,
                    the city obtained the title of <hi rend="italic">Patricia,;</hi> and to this day
                    the Cordovese pride themselves on the purity and antiquity of their descent. The
                    city was the usual residence of the proctor of the province of Baetica, and the
                    seat of one of the four provincial assizes. In the wars between Caesar and the
                    sons of Pompey, Corduba espoused the cause of the latter. After the battle of
                    Munda, it fell into the hands of Caesar, who avenged the obstinacy of its
                    resistance by putting 20,000 of the inhabitants to the sword; but in the time of
                    Strabo it still ranked as the largest city of Spain. Under the Goths Corduba
                    maintained its importance; and in the person of Hosius, its bishop, it furnished
                    a president for the Council of Nice. Under the Moors it was at first an apanage
                    of the caliphate of Damascus, but it soon became the capital of the Moorish
                    dominions in Spain. At the death of Abderrahman, it is said, perhaps with Arabic
                    exaggeration, to have contained within its w ills 200,000 houses, 600 mosques,
                    900 baths, and numerous public libraries; whilst on the bank of the
                    Guadalquiver, under the power of that monarch, there were eight cities, 300
                    towns, and 12,000 populous villages. In the beginning of the 13th century the
                    .Moorish empire became dismembered, and fell ar easy prey to St Ferdinand of
                    Castile in 1236. Since that period Cordova has gradually declined; and in modern
                    times it has never recovered the assault of the French under Dupont in 1808, who
                    stormed and afterwards pillaged the town. In the Roman period Cordova was the
                    birthplace of Lucan and the two Senecas; and in modern times it numbers among
                    its celebrities Avicenna, Averroes, Juan de Mena, Ambrosio Morales, Cespedes the
                    painter, and Luis de Gongora. It also gives its name to the famous captain
                    Gonzalo de Cordova.</p>
