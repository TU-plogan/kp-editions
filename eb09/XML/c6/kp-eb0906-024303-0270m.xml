                    for the making of sewer-pipes; and as a paving for streets and floors. It soon
                    hardens after use, becoming a stony mass little permeated by moisture. In the
                    shape of blocks, sometimes weighing very many tons, it has been found of great
                    value for the formation of harbours and sea-walls in places to which stone could
                    not have been transported. The foundations of the breakwater pier at Douglas,
                    Isle of Man, were made by laying down concrete within frames resting on
                    submarine rock. The quay walls of Stobcross Docks, Glasgow, are supported on
                    triple groups of concrete cylinders, 27∣ feet in length and resting on iron
                    shoes. Each cylinder is formed by sinking in the soil a column of eleven rings
                    of concrete; this, after being cleared of the sand and gravel it contains, is
                    filled with Portland cement concrete. Walls are made of concrete either by
                    allowing it to harden in mass between two faces of boarding, or by making it
                    into blocks and building as with bricks. Concrete was employed by the Romans, by
                    whom the term <hi rend="italic">signinum</hi> was applied to a kind of plaster
                    composed of powdered tiles and mortar; and Smeaton gained the idea of applying
                    it to the construction of river-works from an inspection of the ruins of Corfe
                    Castle in Dorsetshire, a Saxon structure. In the Middle Ages it was much used in
                    the making of fortifications.</p>
                <p>The composition of concrete necessarily depends to some extent upon the nature
                    and qualities of the materials most available for making it. The béton aggloméré
                    of Μ. F. Coignet is composed of about 180 parts of sand, 44 of slaked lime, 33
                    of Portland cement, and 20 of water. A mixture of the cement with the sand and
                    lime is first made, with the addition of small quantities of water; the mass is
                    then incorporated with the requisite amount of water in a cylindrical machine,
                    from the bottom of which it is delivered ready for compression in moulds. This
                    composition can be formed into blocks of any desired bulk; and these, after
                    exposure to the weather for a few weeks, acquire a hardness equal to that of
                    good building stone. A good concrete can be made from 60 parts of coarse
                    pebbles, 25 of rough sand, and 15 of lime. Semple recommends a mixture of 8
                    parts of pebbles, 4 of sharp river sand, and 1 of lime. The proportions given by
                    Treussart are unslaked hydraulic lime 30 parts by measure, trass of Andernach
                    30, sand 30, gravel 20, broken stone or hard limestone 40 parts; and for another
                    concrete, hydraulic lime 33 parts, pozzuolana 45, sand 22, broken stone and
                    gravel 60 parts; the former is used as soon as made, the latter should be
                    exposed about 12 hours after preparation. Burnt clay and poundèd brick may be
                    used in the same proportions as the trass, but are best not employed in
                    sea-water. The quantity of natural or artificial pozzuolanas is increased, and
                    that of the gravel or stone decreased, if rich limes are used (Burnell, <hi
                    rend="italic">Limes, dec).</hi> Excellent concrete is made from Thames or other
                    river ballast mingled with ¾th or ⅜th its bulk of lime; in setting it contracts
                    by about one-fifth of its volume, a cubic yard of the concrete requiring 30
                    cubic feet of ballast and 3J cubic feet of lime. Hydraulic concrete must contain
                    a sufficiency of mortar to aggregate the whole mass of rubbly material, and the
                    lime or cement should be thoroughly slaked before the immersion of the concrete.
                    For the breakwater at Dover Mr Lee employed 16 foot cubes of concrete made in
                    moulds, composed of Portland cement, Portland stone chippings, sand, and
                    shingle. The blocks at the mole, Marseilles, were formed from 5 parts of sand, 2
                    of broken stone, and 3 of Theil lime. The concrete used at the extension of the
                    London docks consisted of 1 part of blue Lias lime to 6 of gravel and sand; and
                    that made by Μ. Vicat for the bridge at Souillac, on the Dordogne, contained,
                    with 26 parts of hydraulic lime, 39 of granitic sand, and 66 of gravel. The
                    composition for the Copenhagen sea-forts was 1 part of Portland cement, 4 of
                    sand, and 16 of fragments of stone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Austin's artificial stone</hi> is a concrete of sand and other
                    materials cemented by lime. <hi rend="italic">Ransomes concrete stone</hi> is
                    made by subjecting a mixture of sodium silicate and clean pit sand, to which
                    between 5 and 10 per cent, of chalk has been added, to the action of a solution
                    of calcium chloride, whereby insoluble calcium silicate and soluble sodium
                    chloride, or common salt, are produced, the former acting as a cementing
                    material for the particles of sand. The stone is made non-absorbent by giving
                    the face of it a wash with sodium silicate, and then a second application of the
                    calcium chloride. (See H. Reid, <hi rend="italic">A Practical Treatise on
                    Concrete,</hi> London, 1869.)</p>
