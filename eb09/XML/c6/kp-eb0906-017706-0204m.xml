                    which it belongs. Here we have only to do with the implement so well known in
                    domestic economy. Comb-making is necessarily a prominent and extensive industry,
                    in which a considerable vaιiety of materials are employed, the most common being
                    the horns and hoofs of cattle, tortoise-shell, ivory, boxwood, vulcanite or
                    hardened Indian-rubber, and to a small extent German silver aud other metals. Of
                    these materials horn is by far the most extensively employed, and the working of
                    that sub·</p>

                <p>stance illustrates all the peculiarities of the craft. The industry is one still
                    extensively prosecuted on a small scale, with all the disadvantages of manual
                    labour and wasteful and tedious processes; but in several large factories very
                    ingenious labour and material-saving machinery is brought into operation, as in
                    the extensive and complete works of Messrs Stewart &amp; Co. of Aberdeen. In
                    Messrs Stewart’s factory the raw material annually consumed averages 3,500,000
                    horns, about 1,000,000 hoofs, nearly 600 lb of tortoise-shell and 20 tons of
                    vulcanite, out of which more than 10,000,000 combs are manufactured. The British
                    supply of horn is very limited, and altogether inadequate to the demand. The
                    sources whence this raw material is drawn are chiefly South America and
                    Australia, whence ox and cow horns are procured, and India, China, and Siam,
                    which supply buffalo horns. When the horn is brought into the factory it is
                    first assorted into sizes, preparatory to being cut up into pieces. From an
                    ordinary horn two cross sections are taken for comb-making, called, first, the
                    head or root cut, and, second, the screw or tip cut. The solid tips remaining
                    are disposed of either for buttonmaking or for being formed into knife and other
                    handles. Other scraps and cuttings are of great value to makers of prussiate of
                    potash and for artificial manure. The sections to be used for combs are taken to
                    the opening department, where they are wetted in water and heated over an open
                    fire till the horny substance becomes quite soft. The head cut is slit
                    longitudinally once, or if it is a large horn it may be slit into two. The screw
                    cut is so termed on account of the peculiar spiral direction in which it is
                    slit, the cut being so directed that the piece when opened out may form an
                    oblong rectangular plate with as little waste of horn as practicable. After
                    slitting, the cuts are opened out between tongs, and inserted between screw
                    plates where they are pressed quite flat. Plates which are intended for staining
                    in imitation of tortoise-shell are at this stage inserted in strong iron frames
                    between heated and oiled iron plates, in which they are submitted for some time
                    to enormous pressure. After this pressure the plates are found to have a
                    translucent appearance and a uniform greenish hue. The pressure, however,
                    operates injuriously on the fibre or grain of the horn, rendering it liable to
                    split. When, therefore, the horn is of good natural colour, it is preferred to
                    finish it in that condition. The prepared plates of horn are laid aside to dry
                    in a room where a high temperature is maintained by steam-pipes. Subsequently
                    they are squared and trimmed on circular saw benches, and assorted into sizes
                    suitable for the various kinds of combs manufactured.</p>
                <p>In the manufacture of ordinary dressing-combs two distinct processes of
                    tooth-cutting are followed. The first method, which is applied to all fine
                    combs, consists in cutting out the teeth by means of circular saws; and this is
                    the only process applicable to the preparation cf small toothed combs and all
                    combs made of ivory and boxwood. Saw-cutting is, moreover, the only process
                    formerly adopted, but instead of a circular saw, the comb-maker used a gauged
                    hand-saw called a <hi rend="italic">stadda</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >steady.</hi> The saws now employed are of small diameter; and, according to the
                    work they have to perform, they are fine-toothed and thin, some of them being
                    constructed to cut from 70 to 80 teeth per lineal inch. The saws are mounted on
                    a spindle which revolves with great rapidity, and the plate or plates of horn to
                    be toothed are clamped up in a holder, which by a cam motion is alternately
                    raised and depressed, bringing the horn each time against the saw, which cuts
                    out one tooth to its full depth. After each cut an automatic arrangement moves
                    the horn forward the breadth of a tooth, the gearing being so mounted that the
                    teeth may be cut fine or coarse at pleasure. The second method of cutting the
                    teeth is known as twinning, from the fact that a pair of combs are cut out of a
                    single plate. The process of twinning consists in so cutting a plate of horn
                    that the whole material is utilized, what is removed to form the teeth of one
                    comb being exactly sufficient for the teeth of a corresponding opposite comb.
                    When the cutting of twinned combs is complete the plate presents the appearance
                    of a pair of combs with their teeth exactly inosculating or dovetailing into
                    each other. The twinning machine, by which this is accomplished, is a complex
                    and beautiful piece of mechanism. The plates of horn to be twinned are softened
                    by heat, and secured in a bed-plate which travels under a pair of cutting
                    chisels, fast or slow, as the teeth are to be cut coarse or fine. The chisels,
                    having cutting edges equal to <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> he length of the
                    teeth to be formed, descend alternately and cut through the plate, but as their
                    cutting edges are at a small angle in relation to each other, the cuts are
                    wedge-formed or tapering, and thus the pointed ends of one comb are taken out of
                    the roots or head of another. With the aid of this apparatus a man and boy can
                    cut more than 2000 combs per day, while an old-fashioned comb-maker working with
                    his hand-saw can only cut from two to three dozen combs daily, and that with
                    almost double the material required in the twinning process.</p>
                <p>After the combs are formed either by circle saw or by twinning, they are next
                    thinned or tapered to their outer edges on grindstones. They then pass to the
                    “grading” department, where by means of special forms of files or rasps, known
                    as grails and topers, the individual teeth are rounded or bevelled, tapered, and
                    smoothed. If the combs are to be finished in their natural colours, they are
                    then smoothed with sand-paper, buffed on leather wheels, and polished on wheels
                    built up of discs of soft calico. If, as is frequently the case, the combs are
                    to be finished as imitation tortoise-shell, they are, in the translucent state
                    before alluded to, treated with dilute nitric acid, which communicates a light
                    yellow’tinge like the ground colour of tortoise-shell. The deep semi-opaque
                    orange spotting is next produced by dropping over the surface spots of a
                    composition containing caustic soda, litharge, and dragon’s blood. After some
                    time this composition is washed off, and the parts to which it was applied are
                    found to be a little swollen up and stained a deep orange tinge. The combs are
                    then polished as above stated.</p>
                <p>The elaborate pierced patterns of ornamental back combs are cut out by small
                    ribbon saws; and the work is generally finished by hand-carving with proper
                    tools. Plainer and less artistic work is done by embossing in heated dies and
                    ordinary pierced work is also produced by cutting dies. Formerly the wide set
                    teeth of back combs were frequently stamped out.</p>
                <p>In order to economize tortoise-shell, and to obtain large and thick combs out of
                    the comparatively small and thin plates in which that substance usually occurs,
                    a process of cementing or soldering is resorted to. The joining of two plates of
                    tortoise-shell is very perfectly accomplished by first carefully scraping and
                    cleaning the surfaces to be united. They are then applied to each other, heated,
                    and strongly pressed between pincers,—this being sufficient to cause a perfect
                    amalgamation of the two surfaces. After cementation tortoise-shell is treated in
                    every respect as a piece of fine white or buffalo horn. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.
