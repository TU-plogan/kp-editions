                    but which may be held to embrace all preparations which have sugar for their
                    basis or principal ingredient. In this way it may be said to include the
                    preservation of fruits by means of sugar, the manufacture of jams and jellies,
                    the art of preparing fruit-syrups and pastes, ices, and sweetened beverages, in
                    addition to the various manufactures in which sugar is the more prominent and
                    principal ingredient. The variety of the preparations thus indicated is
                    unlimited; and we can here but notice the branches of the manufacture of sugar
                    preparations, such as lozenges, comfits, &lt;fcc., which now constitute an
                    extensive industry.</p>

                <p>The appliances for making lozenges on the large scale, and the processes through
                    which the materials pass, are in many respects similar to those used in biscuit
                    baking. The fine loaf sugar is ground to an impalpable powder between a pair of
                    millstones, after which it is mixed with dissolved gum arabic sufficient to form
                    a very stiff dough, and the whole is thoroughly incorporated in a mechanical
                    mixer similar to Vicker’s dough-mixing machine (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Baking.)</hi> The doughy mass is then rendered homogeneous and reduced to a
                    uniform cake by repeatedly passing pieces backward and forward between a pair of
                    heavy metal rollers, the surfaces being kept from adhering by being dusted with
                    starch flour. The cake, when sufficiently spread out, is transferred to a piece
                    of tough web paper, and passed by an intermittent motion under a frame of
                    cutters of the size and form of. the lozenges to be formed. These punch out and
                    take up the lozenges, and when the tube of the cutters is well filled, the whole
                    frame is turned over, and the cut out lozenges emptied into a tray. The scrap
                    passes along on the web, and is again rolled out into cakes with the paste from
                    the mixer. Nothing further is done with the lozenges than allowing them to dry
                    and harden on trays in racks in a heated apartment. Lozenges are coloured and
                    flavoured with a great variety of ingredients, which are added in proper
                    proportions with the dissolved gum. Medicated lozenges of many kinds are in
                    extensive use, the various medicinal ingredients being similarly incorporated
                    with the gum.</p>
                <p>Hard confections, or <hi rend="italic">comfits,</hi> constitute the second
                    leading variety of confectionery. To make these a core or centre of some kind is
                    required, and this may consist either of a seed or fruit, as a coriander or an
                    almond; or it may be a small lozenge, as in the case of pan drops. Around such a
                    core are deposited successive layers of sugar, and there is no limit to the size
                    to which such comfits may be made. The cores are placed in large copper pans or
                    vessels, which are geared to revolve at an inclined angle, so that by their
                    revolution their contents keep constantly in motion, tumbling over each other.
                    The copper pans are revolved by steam or other power, and they are kept hot by a
                    steam jacket or double casing, into which steam is admitted through the centre
                    on which the pans revolve. A pure strained syrup of sugar is prepared, a
                    quantity of which is periodically applied to the contents of the pan as they
                    appear to get dry, and after receiving a certain coating, the comfits in
                    progress of manufacture are removed to dry and harden for some time. The comfits
                    thus receive alternate coatings in the pan and dryings till they attain the size
                    wanted, when they are finished with a coating of thin syrup, which may be
                    coloured if required, and long continued friction in the pan. After hardening in
                    a drying apartment these comfits are ready for use. A great variety of seeds and
                    fruits are used as cores, the principal of which are almonds, caraways,
                    corianders, cloves, cassia, pistachios, and perfumed cherry kernels.</p>
                <p>Many forms of confection are prepared from solutions of sugar, which are boiled
                    up to the point of crystallization. Of these ordinary <hi rend="italic">sugar
                    candy,</hi> or crystallized sugar, may be taken as the type. It is prepared from
                    solutions of either brown or refined sugar, to the latter of which cochineal or
                    some other colouring ingredient is frequently added. These solutions, when
                    boiled to a proper degree, are poured into moulds across which at sufficient
                    intervals are stretched pieces of string. The sugar gradually crystallizes from
                    its solution on the sides of the mould and on the string,—it being in the
                    meantime kept in an apartment heated from 90° to 100° Fahr. When sufficiently
                    deposited, the remaining liquor is drained off, and the crystals removed and
                    dried in a high uniform heat. <hi rend="italic">Fondants,</hi> in the
                    preparation of which the French confectioners excel, are made from solutions
                    boiled to the point of crystallization, properly coloured and flavoured, and
                    cast into moulds made of starch. <hi rend="italic">Sugar drops</hi> are made
                    from fine sugar mixed with a small proportion of water and colouring and
                    flavouring material as desired. The mixture is dissolved by heat without
                    allowing it to boil, and it is then poured in separate drops on a sheet of
                    paper, on which they quickly set and harden.</p>
                <p>What is termed boiled sugar, that is sugar which has been boiled till, on cooling
                    and hardening, it assumes a glassy appearance and fracture, is the basis of
                    another extensive variety of confectionery. Of this class <hi rend="italic"
                    >barley sugar</hi> is the type and simplest example. It merely consists of sugar
                    boiled as above indicated, flavoured with a little oil of lemon, poured on a
                    marble slab, cut into strips, and rolled or twisted into sticks. Boiled sugar is
                    prepared in innumerable fanciful forms by passing it, while still in a viscous
                    condition, through small machines in which pairs of brass rollers, having
                    patterns sunk in their surface,, stamp these patterns in the plastic material.
                    It is also worked up into the form of balls, plaited into coils, and formed into
                    party-coloured stalks, &amp;c. By vigorous and long-continued drawing out of
                    boiled sugar, while it is in a plastic condition, the molecular structure of the
                    material is changed, and from being glassy and transparent it becomes opaque,
                    porous, and granular in appearance. In this way the preparation known as <hi
                    rend="italic">rode</hi> is manufactured. Various preparations of chocolate are
                    largely used as confectionery (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Chocolate).</hi></p>
