                    Cotta publishing-house. At the time of the Reformation the family (originally of
                    noble Italian blood) lived in Eisenach; and we hear of them later as being
                    settled in Dresden. Johann Georg started business at Tübingen in 1640</p>
                <p>His son, <hi rend="smallcaps">Johann Friedrich</hi> (1701-1779), born March 12,
                    1701, devoted himself to theological study, and began his public career as
                    lecturer in Jena University. He then travelled in Germany, France, and Holland,
                    and, after a stay of several years in London, became professor at Tübingen in
                    1733. In 1736 he removed to the chair of theology in the university of
                    Göttingen, which had been instituted as a seat of learning, two years before, by
                    George II. of England, in his capacity as elector of Hanover. In 1739, however,
                    he returned, as extraordinary professor of theology, to his Alma Mater, and,
                    after successively filling the chairs of history, poetry, and oratory, was
                    appointed ordinary professor of theology in 1741. Finally he died, as chancellor
                    of the university, on the 31st of December 1779. His learning was at once wide
                    and accurate; his theological views were orthodox, although he did not believe
                    in strict verbal inspiration. He was a voluminous writer. His chief works are
                    his edition of Johann Gerard’s <hi rend="italic">Loci Theologici,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Kirchen</hi><hi rend="italic">Historie</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The most famous member of the family was <hi rend="smallcaps">Johann</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Friedrich Freiherr</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Cotta</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">von Cottendorf</hi> (1764- 1832), a grandson of the theologian,
                    who was born at Stuttgart April 27, 1764. He attended the gymnasium of his
                    native place, and originally meant to study theology, but became greatly
                    interested in the science of war. In 1782 he entered, as a student of
                    mathematics, in the university of Tübingen, and on the recommendation of
                    Professor Pfleiderer, was elected tutor of Prince Lubomirski in Warsaw. While
                    engaged in tuition, he continued his own studies with great enthusiasm; and, in
                    his zeal for self-culture, he spent a considerable time in Paris, studying
                    French and natural science, and mixing with distinguished literary men. After
                    practising as an advocate in one of the higher courts, Cotta, in compliance with
                    his father’s earnest desire, undertook to conduct the publishing business at
                    Tübingen, which, in the hands of subordinates, had very much declined. He
                    started in December 1787, and laboured incessantly to acquire familiarity with
                    all the details. The house connections rapidly extended; and, in 1793, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung,</hi> of which Schiller was to be editor, was
                    planned. Schiller was compelled to withdraw on account of his health; but his
                    friendship with Cotta deepened every year, and was a great advantage to the poet
                    and his family. Cotta awakened in Schiller so warm an attachment that, as
                    Doering tells us, when a bookseller offered him a higher price than Cotta for
                    the copyright of <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein,</hi> the poet firmly declined
                    it, replying, “Cotta deals steadily with me, and I with him.” In 1795 Schiller
                    and Cotta founded the <hi rend="italic">Horen,</hi> a periodical very important
                    to the student of German literature. The poet intended, by means of this work,
                    to infuse higher ideas into the common lives of men, by giving them a nobler
                    human culture, and“to reunite the divided political world under the banner of
                    truth and beauty.” The <hi rend="italic">Horen</hi> brought Goethe and Schiller
                    into most intimate relations with each other and with Cotta; and Goethe, while
                    regretting that he had already promised <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>
                    to another publisher, contributed the <hi rend="italic">Unterhaltung Deutscher
                    Ausgewanderten,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Roman Elegies,</hi> and a paper on
                    Literary Sansculottism. Fichte sent essays from the first; and the other
                    brilliant German authors of the time were also represented. In 1798 the <hi
                    rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung,</hi> which is still the leading daily paper in
                    Germany, appeared at Tübingen, being edited first by Posselt and then by Huber.
                    It soon wielded a mighty influence, and must prove a valuable storehouse to the
                    historian. In 1798 the editorial office was transferred to Stuttgart, and in
                    1803 to Augsburg. In 1799 Cotta entered on his political career, and was sent to
                    Paris by the Würtemburg states as their representative, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n512/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0512-0481"/> where he made friendships which proved very
                    advantageous for the <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung.</hi> In 1801 he paid
                    another visit to Paris, in a political capacity, when he carefully studied
                    Napoleon’s policy, and treasured up many hints which were useful to him in his
                    literary undertakings. He still, however, devoted most of his attention to his
                    own business, and, for many years, made all the entries into the ledger with his
                    own hand. He relieved the tedium of almost ceaseless toil by pleasant
                    intercourse with literary men. With Schiller, Huber, and Pfeffel he was on terms
                    of the warmest friendship; and he was also intimate with Herder, Schelling,
                    Fichte, Richter, Voss, Hebel, Tieck, Therese Huber, Matthissυn, the brothers
                    Humboldt, Johann Müller, Spittler, and others, whose works he published in whole
                    or in part. In the correspondence of Alexander von Humboldt with Varnhagen von
                    Ense we see the familiar relations in which the former stood to the Cotta
                    family. In 1795 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Politischen Annalen</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Jahrbücher der Baukunde,</hi> and in 1798 the <hi
                    rend="italic">Damenalmanach,</hi> along with some works of less importance. In
                    1807 he issued the <hi rend="italic">Morgenblatt,</hi> to which Schorn’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Kunstblatt</hi> and Menzel’s <hi rend="italic">Literaturblatt</hi>
                    were afterwards added. In 1810 he removed to Stuttgart; and from that time till
                    his death he was loaded with honours. State affairs and an honourable commission
                    from the German booksellers took him to the Vienna Congress; and in 1815 he was
                    deputy-elect at the Wurtemberg Diet. In 1819 he became representative of the
                    nobility; then he succeeded to the offices of member of committee and (1824)
                    vice-president of the Würtemberg second chamber. He was also chosen Prussian
                    privy court counsellor, Bavarian chancellor, and knight of the order of the
                    Würtemberg Crown. Meanwhile such publications as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polytechnische</hi><hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hesperus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Würtember-gischen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Jahrbücher,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Hertha,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ausland,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Inland</hi> issued from the press. In
                    1828-29 appeared the famous correspondence between Schiller and Goethe. Cotta
                    was an unfailing friend of young struggling men of talent. In addition to his
                    high standing as a publisher, he was a man of great practical energy, which
                    flowed into various fields of activity. He was a scientific agriculturist, and
                    promoted many reforms in farming. He was the first Wſtrtemberg landholder who
                    did away with servitude on his estates. In politics he was throughout his life a
                    moderate liberal. In 1824 he set up a steam printing press in Augsburg, and,
                    about the same time, founded a literary institute at Munich. In 1825 he started
                    steamboats, for the first time, on Lake Constance, and introduced them in the
                    following year for the Rhine traffic. In 1828 he was sent to Berlin, on an
                    important commission, by Bavaria and Würtemberg, and was there rewarded with
                    orders of distinction at the hands of the three kings. He died on the 29th of
                    December 1832.</p>
                <p>His son, <hi rend="smallcaps">Freiherr Georg</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cotta</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">von Cottendorf,</hi> who was born in 1796, and
                    died in 1863, succeeded to the management of the business on the death of his
                    father. He was materially assisted by his brother-in-law, Chamberlain Freiherr
                    von Reischach. He greatly extended the connections of the firm; and, in 1865,
                    the house had establishments for different kinds of publications at Stuttgart,
                    Augsburg, Leipsic, and Munich. The business is still in the hands of the Cotta
                    family. (τ. <hi rend="smallcaps">gi.)</hi></p>
