                    a haberdasher at Straiths, near Whitby, but having quarrelled with his master,
                    he went as an apprentice on board a collier belonging to the port, and was soon
                    afterwards appointed mate.</p>
                <p>Early in the year 1755 Cook joined the royal navy. Having distinguished himself,
                    he was, on the recommendation of Sir Hugh Palliser, his commander, appointed
                    master successively of the sloop “Grampus,” of the “Garland,” and the “Mercury,”
                    in the last of which he served in the St Lawrence, and was present at the
                    capture of Quebec. He was employed also in sounding and surveying the river, and
                    he published a chart of the channel from Quebec to the sea. In 1762 he was
                    present at the recapture of Newfoundland; early in the following year he was
                    employed in surveying the coasts of Newfoundland; and in 1764 he was appointed
                    marine surveyor of Newfoundland and Labrador. While in this capacity, Cook
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> an
                    observation of a solar eclipse made at one of the Burgeo Islands, near Cape Ray,
                    which added considerably to his reputation.</p>
                <p>About this time the spirit for geographical discovery, which had gradually
                    declined since the beginning of the 17th century, began to revive; and Cook was
                    appointed to conduct an expedition which was then projected for the purpose of
                    making observations on the impending transit of Venus, and prosecuting
                    geographical researches in the South Pacific Ocean. For this purpose he received
                    a commission as lieutenant, and set sail in the “Endeavour,” a vessel of 370
                    tons, accompanied by several men of science, including Sir Joseph Banks. On the
                    13th April 1769 he reached Otaheite or Tahiti, where he erected an observatory,
                    and succeeded in making the necessary astronomical observations. From Otaheite
                    Cook sailed in quest of the great continent then supposed to exist in the South
                    Pacific, and reached the islands of New Zealand, which had remained a <hi
                    rend="italic">terra incognita</hi> since the time of their first discovery. His
                    attempts to penetrate to the interior, however.</p>

                <p>were thwarted by the continued hostility of the natives; and he had to content
                    himself with a voyage of six months’ duration round the coast, in which he
                    traced the existence of a narrow channel dividing New Zealand into two large
                    islands. From New Zealand he proceeded to Australia (then called New Holland),
                    and on April 28 came in sight of Botany Bay. On account of the hostility of the
                    natives his discoveries here also were confined to the coast, of which he took
                    possession in the name of Great Britain. The prosecution of this voyage was
                    attended with dangers which, on several occasions, threatened the entire loss of
                    the ship and crew. From Australia Cook sailed to New Guinea, and thence to
                    Batavia, where his ship, greatly shattered and disabled, had to put in for
                    repairs.</p>
                <p>Arriving in England, on June 11, 1771, Cook was immediately raised by the king to
                    the rank of captain. Shortly after his return, the existence of a great southern
                    continent began to be matter of renewed speculation, and Cook was again
                    appointed to lead an exploratory expedition. For this purpose he was placed in
                    command of the “Resolution,” a ship of 462 tons burden, and a smaller ship
                    called the “Adventure,” with a complement in all of 193 men. Setting sail from
                    Plymouth, July 13, 1772, he reached Madeira on the 29 th of the same month, and
                    after touching at the Cape of Good Hope, he explored the specified latitudes,
                    but without discovering land. Satisfied that no land existed within the limits
                    of his researches, he abandoned the investigation on the 17th January 1773, and
                    sailed for New Zealand. After wintering among the Society Islands, he set out to
                    make further explorations to the eastward; and afterwards, steering northward,
                    he navigated the southern tropic from Easter Island to the New Hebrides, and
                    discovered the island named by him New Caledonia. After a third attempt he gave
                    up all hope of finding land, and returned to England (July 30, 1774). He was
                    immediately raised to the rank of post-captain, appointed captain of Greenwich
                    Hospital, and soon afterwards unanimously elected a member of the Royal Society,
                    from which he received the Copley gold medal for the best experimental paper
                    which had appeared during the year.</p>
                <p>The attention of Government having been turned to the discovery of a north-west
                    passage in the Arctic regions, Cook volunteered to conduct the expedition, and
                    his offer was gladly accepted. Two ships, the “Resolution” and the “Discovery,”
                    were speedily equipped and placed under his care. Cook’s instructions were to
                    sail first into the Pacific through the chain of the newly discovered islands
                    which he had recently visited, and on reaching New Albion to proceed northward
                    as far as latitude 65° and then to endeavour to find a passage to the Atlantic.
                    Several ships were at the same time fitted out to attempt a passage on the other
                    side from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Setting sail from the Nore, June
                    25, 1776, ha cruised for a considerable time in the South Pacific, discovering
                    several small islands; and in the spring of 1777, judging it too far advanced in
                    the season for attempting the navigation oij the northern seas, he bore away to
                    the Friendly Islands. Here he continued for several months, and only set sail
                    for the north in January 1778. On his passage from the Friendly Islands, he
                    discovered a group which he named the Sandwich Islands, after the earl of
                    Sandwich, who had taken great interest in the expedition. After circumnavigating
                    these, and laying down their position on a chart, Cook reached the coast of
                    America in March 1778; and following the coast-line northward, penetrated into
                    the bay afterwards known as Cook’s Inlet. Disappointed of a passage in this
                    direction, he sailed for Behring’s Straits, where again he found the passage
                    intercepted by an impenetrable wall of ice. Returning to winter at the Sandwich
                    Islands, he discovered Mowee (Maui) and Owhyhee or Hawaii, where he met his
                    tragical death. During the night of the 13th February 1779, one of the
                    “Discovery’s” boats was stolen by the natives; and Cook, in order to recover it,
                    proceeded to put in force his usual expedient of seizing the person of the king
                    until reparation should be made. Having landed on the following day, a scuffle
                    ensued with the natives, which compelled the party of marines who attended him
                    to retreat to their boats. Cook was the last to retire; and as he was nearing
                    the shore he received a blow from behind which felled him to the ground. He rose
                    immediately, and vigorously resisted the crowds that pressed upon him; but as
                    the boats’ crews were able to render him no assistance, he was soon overpowered
                    (l4th February 1779).</p>
                <p>As a navigator, the merits of Captain Cook were of the very highest order. His
                    commanding personal presence, his sagacity, decision, and perseverance enabled
                    him to overcome all difficulties; while his humanity and sympathetic kindness
                    rendered him a favourite with his crews. His valuable researches into the nature
                    and use of antiscorbutic medicines proved of the greatest utility. The account
                    of his first voyage was published under the care of Dr Hawkesworth, but his
                    second was chronicled directly by himself. A narrative of his third voyage was
                    published from his notes, by Lieutenant King. Distinguished honours were paid to
                    his memory both at home and by foreign courts; and a suitable pension was
                    settled upon his widow.</p>
