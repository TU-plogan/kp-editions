                    Santiago de Com-postelh, in 43° 23' N. lat. and 8° 27' W. long. It is of first
                    rank both as a fortress and a port, and is the seat of a superior court and a
                    commercial tribunal. There is an upper and a lower town, the former built on the
                    east side of a small peninsula, and the latter on the isthmus connecting the
                    peninsula with the mainland. The upper town is the more ancient, and is still
                    surrounded by walls and bastions and defended by a citadel; but it has been
                    gradually outgrown by the lower, wſhich, though at first a mere Pescaderia, or
                    fishing-village, is now comparatively well built, and has several broad and
                    handsome streets. There is little remarkable in the public buildings, though
                    they include six churches, of which Santiago dates from the 11 th and the
                    Colegiata from the l3th century, five convents, two hospitals, a palace for the
                    captain-general of Galicia, a theatre, a school of navigation, an arsenal, and
                    barracks. The harbour, though of rather difficult access, is perfectly secure,
                    and it is defended by several forts, of which the most important are San Diego
                    on the east and San Antonio on the west. These fortifications are of little
                    practical importance on the land side, as they are commanded by a hill that
                    overlooks the city. The so-called Tower of Hercules to the north, supposed to
                    have been originally built by the Romans, has been raised in modern times to a
                    height of upwards of 360 feet, and is now crowned with a fine revolving light
                    visible for a distance of twelve miles to sea. English, French, and Belgian
                    steamers call here on their way to South America for mails or emigrants; and
                    upwards of 300 merchant ships, mostly British, enter the port every year. The
                    trade consists mainly in the export of fat cattle—20,000 of which were sent to
                    England in 1873,—eggs, meats, fruits, and sardines; and in the importation of
                    general grocery-goods and manufactured articles. Besides a large Government
                    tobacco-factory, which employs about 3000 women, there are in the city two
                    glass-factories, two cotton-factories, and several steam saw-mills and
                    sardine-curing establishments; and the herring and pilchard fisheries give
                    employment to a number of the inhabitants. According to the census of 1869, the
                    population of the town and suburbs was about 30,000; in 1874 it was estimated at
                    40,000.</p>
                <p>Corunna, possibly at first a Phoenician settlement, is identified with the
                    ancient Ardobrica, a seaport mentioned by Mela in the country of the Artabri,
                    from whom the name of Portus Artabrõrum was given to the bay on which the city
                    is situated. In the Middle Ages, and probably at an earlier period, it was
                    called Caronium, a name which is much more probably the origin of the present
                    designation than the Latin Columna which is sometimes put forward. The harbour
                    has always been of considerable importance, but it is only in comparatively
                    modem times that it has made a figure in history. In 1588 it gave shelter to the
                    Invincible Armada; and in 1598 the town was captured and burned by the English
                    under Drake and Norris. ' In 1747, and again in 1805, the bay was the scene of a
                    naval victory of the English over the French; and in 1809 an action took place
                    in the neighbourhood which has become one of the most celebrated in British
                    military annals. The French under Marshal Soult attempted to prevent the
                    embarkation of the English under Sir John Moore, but were successfully repulsed
                    in spite of their numbers. Moore was mortally wounded in the engagement, and
                    expired shortly after its termination. He was hastily buried on a bastion near
                    the sea; and a monument in the Jardin de San Carlos raised by the British
                    Government commemorates his bravery and intrepidity. In 1820 the town joined the
                    revolutionary movement and declared the constitution, but in 1823 it had to
                    capitulate to Bourck, the French general.</p>
