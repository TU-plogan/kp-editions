                    Achaia, but which appears, especially when viewed from the north, to be
                    detached. From this height the view includes the Geraneian range at the opposite
                    end of the isthmus, and the higher mountains of Northern Greece behind it, while
                    in the foreground lies to the left the Corinthian Gulf stretching westward, and
                    the Saronic Gulf to the east, together with the strip of flat land which divides
                    the one of these from the other. Another narrow plain stretches along the
                    southern shore of the Corinthian Gulf iu the direction of Sicyon, and was
                    proverbial in ancient times for the value of its agricultural produce. The city
                    of Corinth lay not at the foot of the hill on which the citadel stood, but on a
                    ledge or shelf of that hill at a height of about 200 English feet. A lofty
                    wall—according to Strabo, 85 stadia (about ten miles) in length—inclosed both
                    city and citadel, and two walls, each 12 stadia in length, inclosed the road to
                    the harbour of Lechaeum on the Corinthian Gulf; Schoenus and Cenchreae,the two
                    harbours belonging to the city on the Saronic Gulf, lay at a greater
                    distance.</p>
                <p>From its position Corinth enjoyed in prehistoric times two advantages especially
                    important in the infancy of navigation. On the long gulf which stretched from
                    Corinth westwards, called in early times after Crissa, the port of Delphi, and
                    later after Corinth itself, vessels could sail for above J 00 miles without
                    losing sight of land and between fertile shores. And secondly, the natives of
                    Corinth were skilful in dragging vessels of all kinds across from sea to sea,
                    thus saving them the dangers of the perilous voyage round the Peloponnesus. That
                    the Phoenicians did not overlook these advantages we know from the many traces
                    of Phoenician occupation remaining in later times, especially the worship of the
                    Phoenician Athene, Aphrodite Urania (the Sidonian Astarte), and Melicertes (the
                    Tyrian Melkarth).</p>
                <p>The important <hi rend="italic">cultus,</hi> at the isthmus, of Poseidon, the
                    great divinity of the Ionians, proves the earliest Greek inhabitants of Corinth
                    to have been Ionian, but Thucydides states that it was under Aeolian princes.
                    The earliest of these of whom we hear is Sisyphus, according to one legend lover
                    of Medea, according to another grandfather of Bellerophon, the great local hero
                    who tamed the winged horse Pegasus, and slew the monstrous Chimaera. The
                    character of mingled greed and cunning, ascribed to Sisyphus, is doubtless
                    intended to embody the qualities which distinguished the people of the
                    commercial city from their rural neighbours. This was in the age preceding the
                    Trojan War. On the return of the Heraclidae the Dorian invaders, after subduing
                    the rest of Peloponnesus,'attacked Corinth, and having mastered it proceeded
                    against Megara and Athens. Corinth fell into the hands of a descendant of
                    Hercules; named Aletes (the wanderer), and was reconstituted on Dorian
                    principles, but not, it would appear, with the same rigidity as Argos, Sicyon,
                    and other cities, for we find eight tribes instead of the usual three, and it is
                    certain that the aristocracy of the city did not disdain to lead in trade, and
                    resembled rather the nobility of Venice than the pure-blooded warrior-caste of
                    other Dorian cities. The most wealthy family was that of the Bacchiadae, the
                    descendants of Aletes, who furnished first a succession of kings, and afterwards
                    yearly prytaneis who ruled with kingly power. It was about 657 B.σ. that
                    Cypselus, a Bacchiad on his mother’s side, succeeded in overthrowing this
                    oligarchy and, by the aid of the commons, establishing his power at Corinth so
                    firmly that he could even forego the foreign body-guard and the external
                    supports of the Greek tyrant. His son and successor, Periander was sometimes
                    reckoned among the wise men of Greece, and probably did more than any other man
                    to shape the colonial and mercantile policy of the city. Under him Corinth
                    reached the summit of prosperity, but Periander’s family was destroyed by
                    internal dissensions, and his nephew Psammetichus was after a brief reign put
                    down by the Spartans about 584 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>It was in the period between Aletes and Psammetichus that lay the golden days of
                    Corinth. Then were made a series of splendid discoveries and inventions, which
                    increased the trade and multiplied the resources of the city, and enabled it to
                    found the numerous colonies which were the basis at once of its wealth, its
                    power, and its policy. To begin with the loftier arts. Arion graced the court of
                    Periander, and secured for Corinth the honour of the invention of the dithyramb;
                    Eumelus and Eumolpus, both Corinthians, were among the earliest and the most
                    celebrated of the cyclic poets. Corinthian architecture was renowned until the
                    later time when a light and ornate style of building took its origin and its
                    name from the city. Corinthian pottery was early celebrated, and it is said that
                    the art of ornamenting earthenware was improved at Corinth by Butades, Eucheir,
                    and Eugrammus. Even painting was either introduced into Greece, or was much
                    improved, by the Corinthians Aridices, Ecphantus, and Cleanthes. Still it was in
                    the useful rather than the ornamental and imaginative arts that Corinth most
                    excelled. There the trireme was invented, and the machinery for the transport of
                    ships carried to the highest perfection, while Corinthian bronzes, tables,
                    coffers, and objects of luxury were renowned on all shores of the AEgean and
                    Adriatic. One of the most remarkable of these pieces of handiwork was the
                    well-known chest of Cypselus, still preserved at Olympia in the time of
                    Pausanias, made of cedar and inlaid with a multitude of figures in gold and
                    ivory, a miracle of archaic art.</p>

                <p>The wealth and prosperity of the city caused its rulers to plan early a scheme of
                    colonization. Professor Ernst Curtius has given reasons for supposing that at
                    the time of the Lelantian war, of which Thucydides speaks, between Chalcis and
                    Eretria in Eubaea, Corinth was, together with Samos, a firm ally of the former
                    city, and that it was in company with the Chalcidians that the Corinthians made
                    their first attempts at colonization. That these attempts were, through a series
                    of years, made almost constantly in a western rather than an eastern direction
                    was due to the position of Aegina, which island lay right in the track of
                    travellers from Corinth to Asia Minor or the Euxine,—the Aeginetans having
                    maintained a constant hostility to the Corinthians from the earliest times,
                    until their island was finally conquered by the Athenians, wſlio had received
                    for the war a detachment of ships sent from Corinth. It was in the 8th century
                    that the two greatest colonies, Corcyra and Syracuse, were founded. Syracuse
                    remained, even in the time of her greatest prosperity, a grateful and dutiful
                    daughter, but Corcyra very soon after its foundation was engaged in hostilities
                    with the mother-city, and, though reduced to obedience in the time of Periander,
                    finally ousted Corinthian commerce from the northern part of the Adriatic, and
                    maintained undivided supremacy over the cities of Dyrrhachium and Apollonia. But
                    south of the straits of Sybota, which divided the southern point of Corcyra from
                    the mainland, Corinth was supreme. To her the towns of Achaia, Phocis, and
                    Locri, on both sides of the Corinthian Gulf, looked as their head; she ruled all
                    the rich country watered by the Achelous, which region, indeed, became in time
                    almost more Corinthian than the isthmus itself, while all the Dorian cities of
                    Sicily and Southern Italy looked to the navy of Corinth to keep up their
                    connection with the mother country.</p>
                <p>It is said that Corinth adhered in a special manner to the customs of Phoenicia
                    as regards colonies, at any rate the city was in this respect successful beyond
                    the rest of Greece. Expeditions were directed to some promising point on the
                    Illyrian or Acarnanian coast, the approval of the Delphic oracle was secured,
                    and volunteers were invited from all parts of Greece, At the head of the colony
                    was placed some cadet of the Bacchiadae, or another great family, and some of
                    the mercantile nobility accompanied it, retaining in the new home much of the
                    oligarchical predominance which they had enjoyed at home. It was probably the
                    preservation of this aristocratic tinge which made the union closer between
                    colony and mother-city, .so that the Corinthian envoys could boast (Thucydides,
                    i. 38) that Corinth was of all cities the most popular with her colonies; and,
                    with the exception of Corcyra, few of the new settlements gave the mother-city
                    any trouble. Alone among cities Corinth imposed on all her colonies a uniform
                    coinage, the different issues of which are so similar in appearance that it has
                    been doubted if Corinth did not keep in her own hands all minting of silver.</p>
                <p>After Psammetichus had been put down, a timocracy was instituted, with hierarchy
                    of grades. Corinth set an early example in that system of political
                    classification according to revenue which was afterwards adopted in Rome and
                    other cities. At the same time, it is clear that in so commercial a city an
                    organization of this kind would not produce an exclusive land-owning
                    aristocracy.</p>
                <p>It was about the middle of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> that
                    Corinth started upon a more restless and aggressive career. At that time her
                    very existence was threatened by the growing greatness of Athens, which city had
                    gained the mastery of Megara and predominant power among the cities of Achaia.
                    Soon after the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, an Athenian fleet under
                    Tolmides appeared in the Corinthian Gulf, and seizing upon Naupactus, and
                    expelling thence the Locrian colonists whom Corinth had stationed there to
                    defend her interests, established in that city a colony of Messanian fugitives,
                    in order to cut the communications of Corinth close to their base. Hence the
                    bitter and vindictive animosity felt by the Corinthians towards Athens, which
                    caused them, after that city had surrendered to Lysander, to urge upon the
                    Spartans its total destruction. No sooner, however, was the Spartan supremacy
                    undisputed, than a party among the Corinthians, whether seduced by Persian gold,
                    or following notions of supposed expediency, began to cabal with Athens and
                    Argos against the Lacedaemonians, with whom the aristocracy of the city still
                    sided. Hence bitter dissensions and many calamities to the Corinthians, whose
                    city was more than once the battle-field of parties, as well as of the Argive
                    and Lacedaemonian troops. The events of the war hence arising, and called
                    Corinthian, belong to the history of Greece. The city, weakened by sedition,
                    fell easily into the hands of Philip II. of Macedon, whose successor, the fifth
                    Philip, called it, in virtue of its splendid position, one of the three fetters
                    of Greece. As the chief city of the Achaean League during the latter part of its
                    existence, Corinth claimed a share in the 2d century in the latest glories of
                    Greece. There Flamininus proclaimed the liberties of Greece; and as the ally of
                    Rome, Corinth reached a high point of wealth and splendour. But that alliance
                    was broken off, and the result was the total destruction of the city by Mummius
                    in 146 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and the sale of its inhabitants into
                    slavery. The richness of the city at this period in all the accumulated results
                    of Greek science and art was immense, as we know from the statements of
                    Polybius, an eye-witness. The Romans secured a vast spoil of statues, pictures,
                    and furniture, of which a part was purchased by Attalus of Pergamus, a part sent
                    in many ships to Rome, and much also destroyed in mere wantonness.
                    Notwithstanding, the place remained a quarry whence in after ages were dug
                    innumerable treasures of art. The Corinthian territory was given to Sicyon, and
                    the site lay waste until the time of J ulius Caesar. The great dictator settled
                    there a colony of needy Greeks and Roman freedmen, which he called after himself
                    Laus Julia, and made the seat of government of Achaia. Between the new Corinth
                    and the old the. site was the only bond of connection, yet the historic
                    splendours of the place seem to have mastered the minds of the new inhabitants,
                    who before long began to resume all the local <hi rend="italic">cults,</hi> and
                    to claim the past glory of the city as their own. Latin, however, as we know
                    from coins, remained the official language, and the duumviri were usually the
                    freedmen of the emperors or of Roman nobles.</p>
                <p>The new city, from its position, soon acquired a great trade with Ephesus,
                    Thessalonica, and other cities. For this reason it attracted St Paul, who
                    visited it more than once, and spent many months there in converse with Aquila
                    and Priscilla, and in preaching in the synagogue. Hence were written the two
                    Epistles to the Thessalonians, and here was founded a church which claimed for a
                    long period the deepest anxieties of the apostle and after his death of
                    Clement,—the temptations to sensual indulgence and antinomian heresies being
                    here stronger than in most of the Greek cities.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, it is only of this second Corinth that we possess detailed
                    descriptions. It was visited both by Strabo and Pausanias. From the former we
                    learn that the summit of the Acrocorinthus bore a little temple of Aphrodite,
                    and that just below the summit gushed out the fountain Peirene, which once more
                    rose to the surface down in the lower city. Just below this fountain were the
                    remains of a marble building, supposed to have been the remains of the palace of
                    the monarch Sisyphus. From the account of Pausanias (ii. ch. 1-4) we may gain a
                    clear notion of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n428/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0428-0399"/> topography of the city and the isthmus. In the
                    midst of the city was the market-place, commanded by a lofty statue of Pallas
                    made of bronze, and surrounded by many temples, among others those of the
                    Ephesian Artemis and of Fortune, and by statues standing in the open air. Hence
                    three principal roads led in various directions. The first passed westwards
                    towards Sicyon, leading by a temple of Apollo, the Odeum, and the tomb of the
                    children of Medea, Mermerus and Pheres, whom a local legend asserted to have
                    perished at the hands of the Corinthians, after they had brought their poisoned
                    gifts to Glauce. A little further on was the temple of Athene Chalinitis (the
                    bridier), so called because she bridled for Bellerophon the unruly Pegasus; the
                    statue of the goddess was of wood and doubtless ancient, a fact which proves
                    that the sack by Mummius cannot have been so complete as might have ⅛een
                    imagined. Near this temple was a theatre, probably a work of Roman times, and a
                    temple of the Roman Jupiter Capitolinus.</p>
                <p>The second road led north towards the harbour of Lechaeum and the Corinthian
                    Gulf. It first passed Propylaea, surmounted by two gilt quadrigae driven by
                    Phaethon and Helios, and next the grotto where issued afresh the same fountain
                    Peirene which rises near the summit of the Acrocorinthus, and filled a large
                    basin with sweet water, used by tbe inhabitants for drinking, and as a bath in
                    which to dip the vessels of Corinthian bronze while still red-hot, a process
                    which was supposed to make their fineness unapproachable. The water-supply of
                    the city was unrivalled, yet the emperor Hadrian constructed an aqueduct all the
                    way from the Stymphalian Lake, a work, if we may believe Pausanias, of vain
                    ostentation.</p>
                <p>The third road led eastwards, first to the fashionable suburb of the city, a
                    cypress-grove called Craneion. This quarter is well described in Becker’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Charicles.</hi> It abounded with the life which distinguished
                    Corinth from other cities, crowds of travellers, seeking both gain and pleasure,
                    with the lively booths which offered the former, and the crowds of female slaves
                    who ministered to the latter. Here was the tomb of Lais, to whom her
                    fellowcitizens paid almost divine honours, and here, strangely, the monument of
                    the great cynic, Diogenes of Sinope, who had passed his life in the midst of
                    this gay and dissolute company. On the Craneion the road divided into two
                    branches. Of these the more southerly ran to the harbour of Cenchreae, a
                    roadstead fenced on both sides by promontories stretching out to sea, but not
                    much assisted by art; while the more important Lechaeum, on the other side of
                    the isthmus, was almost entirely artificial. The more northerly branch of the
                    road led to the little harbour of Schaenus, and the world-renowned spot where
                    were celebrated every second year the Isthmian Games. These games were held in
                    honour in early times of Melicertes, in later times of Poseidon, and close by
                    were temples of both deities. That of Poseidon was not large; it contained
                    statues of Poseidon, Amphitrite, and Thalassa, and in front was a crowd of
                    statues of the victors in the games. The shrine of Melicertes stood under a
                    pine; it was circular, and contained, as we know from coins, a statue of the
                    divinity reclining on the back of a dolphin. Melicertes (also called Palaemon)
                    had also a subterranean chapel where the most solemn oaths were administered,
                    and it was said that perjurers seldom left the spot unpunished. Close to the
                    temples was the stadium of the games made of white marble, and not far from it
                    the road on which triremes were transported from sea to sea. There were also
                    traces of a canal which, projected by Alexander the Great, resolved on by Julius
                    Caesar, commenced by Nero, was never dug more than a few hundred yards inland
                    from the Corinthian Gulf.</p>
                <p>In the Middle Ages Corinth suffered many disasters. It was sacked by Alarie, and
                    at a later period was most bitterly contended for by the Turks and the
                    Venetians. During the Middle Ages the city occupied the hill of Acrocorinthus
                    itself, not the ledge at its base, but it has now resumed its earlier position.
                    The modern town is small and wretched, and retains few remains of antiquity. The
                    most remarkable among these are seven columns of an exceedingly ancient temple
                    of the Doric order, and some traces of the Roman amphitheatre.</p>

                    city. (P. G.)</p>
