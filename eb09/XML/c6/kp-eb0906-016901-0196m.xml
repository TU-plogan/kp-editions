                <p><label type="entry">COLUMBIA, <hi rend="smallcaps">British</hi></label>, the
                    first of the Canadian provinces organized on the Pacific, was admitted into the
                    Dominion in 1871. Including Vancouver’s Island, it embraces an area of 233,000
                    square miles, of bold sea-coast, lofty mountain ranges, and rugged picturesque
                    river courses, as well as rich fertile valleys. Unlike the great river system to
                    the east of the Rocky Mountains, the rivers of British Columbia make their way
                    by abrupt rapids and falls, in their comparatively brief courses from the Rocky
                    Mountains to the sea.</p>
                <p>British Columbia owes its rise to the status of a province of Canada to the
                    sudden influx of gold-diggers in 1856 and following years. The bed of the Fraser
                    River had been discovered to be a rich auriferous deposit; and all who preferred
                    the lottery-like chances of the diggings to the more laborious but certain
                    fruits of patient industry hastened to this new Eldorado. In a semi-official
                    publication of 1864, it is stated that, in 1860, “Antler, the most important
                    creek, yielded at one time, at the lowest estimate, gold to the value of $10,000
                    per day. On one claim $1,000 worth was taken out of the sluiceboxes as the
                    result of a single day’s work.” But it was not till 1862 that the unsystematic
                    process of mere surface diggings and washings of nomad adventurers was super
                    seded by sinking shafts and carrying on a regulated system of mining under the
                    direction of experienced engineers. Companies were formed; large capital was
                    invested; and an official report of 1870 states the yield of gold for that year
                    from the mines of Cariboo, Silionet, Lilloet, Columbia, Yale, and Lytton at
                    $1,333,745, in addition to the large quantities of the precious metal carried
                    out of the province by private adventurers. It appears from authentic returns
                    that from 1862 to 1871 gold to the value of $16,650,036 was shipped from British
                    Columbia by the banks, and so registered and put on record; while the estimated
                    value of that which was carried out of the country by miners themselves during
                    the same period is probably not over-estimated at $6,000,000. Nor is this a mere
                    temporary supply derived from surface washings. Extensive tracts of gold-bearing
                    quartz rocks constitute an important element in the permanent mineral resources
                    of the country. According to the <hi rend="italic">Tables of the Trade and
                    Navigation of the Dominion of Canada,</hi> printed at Ottawa in 1875, the export
                    of gold in dust and bars from the province of British Columbia during the
                    previous year is valued at $1,072,422.</p>
                <p>As explorations and surveys are carried further into the interior the auriferous
                    regions prove to be widely extended, and rich in their promised yield. Gold has
                    been found over an area of not less than 200 miles, and is readily obtained by
                    the simple processes of the adventurous gold-washer, in the beds of the Fraser,
                    the Thompson, the Peace, and 0minica Rivers, or the creeks and tributaries
                    flowing into them. Stickeen River, towards the Alaska frontier, the most recent
                    gold-field, has been successfully worked since 1875, and continues to yield an
                    abundant return. But though the rumour of river-beds of golden sand is the
                    readiest of all stimulants to emigration, a rush of gold-diggers is not the most
                    satisfactory addition to the population of a young colony; nor is wealth thus
                    easily acquired generally turned to good account. The immigrant population
                    included bands of lawless adventurers, Texans, Mexicans, Spaniards, Californian,
                    Australian, American, and Chinese gold-diggers, with a heterogeneous gathering
                    of reckless fortune-hunters from all parts of the world. The necessity for some
                    regularly-organized form of government to control such a population made the
                    organization of the territory beyond the Rocky Mountains into a province of the
                    Dominion all the more welcome to the industrious settlers who were there seeking
                    a permanent home.</p>
                <p>Under the new orderly rule the crowd of gold-seekers was speedily followed by
                    emigrants in pursuit of more settled industry. Agricultural labourers soon found
                    that the golden harvest could be secured to themselves by providing for the
                    miners the fruits of the soil. It is probably no exaggeration to estimate the
                    worth of the gold carried out of the province from 1856 to 1875 as not less than
                    $36,000,000. Much of this might be considered as productive of no direct benefit
                    to the country. Indirectly, however, it has largely contributed to the opening
                    up of the new province, and making its many attractions known. It led to the
                    construction of roads, developed the mining districts, encouraged agricultural
                    and general trade, and stimulated the growth of permanent settlements. In 1841
                    the “Vincennes” ship of the American exploring expedition entered the Straits of
                    De Fuca; and Dr Pickering has preserved a vivid picture of the forbidding aspect
                    of rudest savage life which then met his eye. Contrasting the then strange
                    uncultivated scenes of that wild coast with the familiar centres bf American
                    civilization on the opposite shores of the same continent, he says, “Scarcely
                    two centuries ago our New England shores presented only scenes like that before
                    me: and what is to be the lapse of the third <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ?'’
                    Within less than twenty years thereafter the town of Victoria was rising on
                    Vancouver’s Island, and that of New Westminster on the neighbouring mainland.
                    The printing press was in full operation. The <hi rend="italic">British
                    Colonist,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">New Westminster Times,</hi> and other
                    newspapers were in circulation, where so recently the Indian trail and wigwam
                    were the sole evidence of the presence of man. The produce and manufactures of
                    the province exported during the year ending June 1874 are valued in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Trade and Navigation Returns</hi> for the year at $2,120,624;
                    the customs receipts are being chiefly expended on public works, and the varied
                    resources of the country have been rapidly developed and turned to the best
                    account.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> The mineral products of British Columbia still
                    occupy the foremost place in its exports. They are valued in 1874 at $1,351,145.
                    But it is important for the future progress of the young province on the Pacific
                    that its minerals include coal. Mr Horetsky, in his <hi rend="italic">Canada on
                    the Pacific,</hi> describes the shipping of coal at Vancouver Island for the San
                    Francisco market, where it sells at $12 per ton; and. Mr Grant, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Ocean to Ocean,</hi> reports his visit to Nanaimo, with a
                    population of seven or eight hundred, all depending on the neighbouring Douglas
                    mine. “The manager,” he says, “informed us that they would probably ship 50,000
                    tons this season, and that next year they would be in a position to ship 100,000
                    or more. The coal measures which the few seams now worked represent extend over
                    the whole eastern coast of Vancouver Island.” Fine anthracite coal is also found
                    near the coast, and in vast quantities, of superior quality, on Queen
                    Charlotte’s Island; and about 160 miles in the interior, on the River Nicholas,
                    50,671 tons of coal were exported in 1874 to the United States and Mexico, the
                    value of which was $278,213.</p>
                <p>When the census was taken in 1870, the population of the little capital of
                    Victoria amounted only to 3,270, including 211 Chinese, but exclusive of
                    Indians. Already it exceeds 5,000 souls, of very diverse character and
                    nationality, but with abundant energy, and an assurance of progress. The
                    Government of the Dominion is extending its aid to the young province with a
                    liberal hand. In the fiscal year 1872-3, the total receipts to the Dominion from
                    all sources in British Columbia amounted to $417,409; while the
                    expenditure,—apart from railway surveys,— was $639,037. The same spirit still
                    prevails. Buildings are in progress in Victoria for a post-office, savings bank,
                    Government and Indian department; plans have also been prepared for a custom
                    house and revenue office; and the efficient organization of courts of law and a
                    system of police is being followed up by the erection of a penitentiary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fisheries. —</hi> Attention is now being energetically directed
                    to the treasures of the ocean, the value of which has long been familiar to the
                    native tribes. Mr J. W. Powell, Indian commissioner, in a report to the minister
                    of the interior, dated at Victoria, February 4, 1875, after a general survey of
                    the condition of the Indians of the <pb break="no"

                    efforts to encourage their attention to agriculture, thus proceeds :—</p>
                <p>“Fish is the great staple product of all the coast Indians, and owing to the
                    numerous lakes and rivers with which British Columbia is most bountifully
                    supplied, affords the chief means of subsistence to almost all of the interior
                    tribes. All kinds of fish are found in great abundance in the Northern Pacific
                    waters; but the salmon, of which there are some six varieties, is the most
                    constant and appreciated article of diet. The fish is now forming one of the
                    most important exports of this province. The dog-fish is caught in large
                    quantities for the oil contained in the liver, which not only forms a common
                    article of barter between Indians themselves, but is sold to and exported as one
                    of the chief products of the country by the Whites.</p>
                <p>“The exports of fish, fish-oil, and furs (the two latter being almost solely
                    obtained by Indians) for the fiscal year ended June 1874 were :—</p>

                <p>All this, it has to be borne in remembrance, is the produce of native Indian
                    enterprize, under the stimulus supplied by the White traders. The co-operation
                    indeed extends to other industries besides those of the hunter and the fisher.
                    The fur-bearing animals of the province include the bear, beaver, land and sea
                    otters, fur and hair seals, martens, minks, racoons, fishers, wolverines,
                    wolves, foxes, lynx, ermines, skunks, and pumas. Besides the produce resulting
                    from the hunting and trapping of those furbearing animals, and the fruits of
                    native industry in the fisheries of the rivers and the coasts, the Indian
                    commissioner also notes the collection of cranberries as another productive
                    resource of native industry. The export of cranberries from British Columbia
                    varies according to favourable or less productive seasons. In the year 1874,
                    which was regarded as a poor season, cranberries, gathered by the Indians, were
                    exported to the value of $2011.</p>
                <p>With such results from the unregulated labours of Hide Indian tribes, it is
                    manifest how great must be the resources of the country, not only in the furs
                    which have long been an object of trade, but in the unheeded fisheries of the
                    ocean and rivers. The whale still frequents the coast, and is pursued with
                    success by the Clallums, Macaws, and other coast tribes. Now regular companies
                    are being formed for its capture. In 1871 the “British Columbia Whaling Company”
                    had produced 20,000 gallons of oil; and the results continue on a progressive
                    scale. The dog-fish also, which has long been an object of special favour among
                    the Indians, is now taken in large quantities by the Whites for its oil. In 1870
                    the produce of this fishery alone yielded 50,000 gallons of oil; and the price
                    which it commanded in California has since proved a sufficient stimulus to
                    increased zeal in prosecuting the fisheries. Cod, halibut, haddock, salmon,
                    sturgeon, smelt, and sardines, all abound along the coasts, or in the straits
                    and estuaries, and with the growing population and wealth both in the provinces
                    and in the neighbouring States of the Pacific, the value of this branch of
                    industry must rapidly increase. The riches of the sea must, indeed, in the end,
                    far outrival all the produce of the gold mines, and may yet rival the fisheries
                    of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Even now, with a sparse population, and trade
                    in its infancy, the exports of the fisheries for 1874 are valued at
                    $114,118.</p>
                <p>The province of British Columbia has the same advantage over the neighbouring
                    States of the Pacific, owing to climate ánd favourable geographical position,
                    which the eastern provinces enjoy in comparison with the States on the Atlantic.
                    This is specially manifest in the value of its timber; and this must go on
                    increasing with the wealth of the surrounding States. Already the value of the
                    produce of the forest has amounted in the year 1874 to $260,116; and in its
                    various forms of planks, spars, laths, and shingles, it is being exported not
                    only to the neighbouring States and to South America, but to Australia and
                    China, as well as to Great Britain. The white and yellow pine and the valuable
                    Douglas pine abound. Cedar and hemlock attain to a great size; fine oak and
                    maple are also abundant; and the rivers and the natural harbours afford every
                    facility for a lumber trade for which the countries on both sides of the Pacific
                    will supply as ready a market as the Eastern States and the ports of Europe
                    afford to the lumberers of the provinces of Eastern Canada.</p>
                <p>Already railway enterprize is abundantly stimulated by the development of the
                    resources of this young province; and now the great question of the future is
                    the route of the projected Pacific Railway, and its terminus on the Pacific
                    coast. The disputes between the Provincial Government and that of the Dominion
                    relative to its immediate construction have been the cause of much local
                    irritation. In the summer of 1876, the Earl of Dufferin, as Governor-General of
                    the Dominion, made a tour through British Columbia, and greatly contributed to a
                    more reasonable feeling by his conciliatory mediation. The construction of a
                    railway through the province is attended with more than the usual difficulties.
                    In contrast to flιe vast level ranges of prairie to the east of the Rocky
                    Mountains, its surface is extremely irregular; and the selection of a railway
                    route is controlled by the necessity of finding both a pass through the Rocky
                    Mountains and a suitable access to the seaboard. Yellow Head Pass affords what
                    appears to be the most advantageous route, at an elevation of about 3700 feet
                    above the level of the sea. Immediately to the west of this an irregular’
                    plateau extends t.o within less than 100 miles of the coast, where the Cascade
                    Range is reached. From this the descent to the coast is abrupt; the rivers have
                    furrowed deep channels, or directed their courses into the natural canons of
                    this rugged coast line, and much difficulty has been experienced in selecting an
                    available route. From the mouth of the Columbia River, for 700 miles northward,
                    the coast is indented with numerous inlets which cut deep into the land, and are
                    comparable to the rugged fiords of Norway. Bute Inlet, which was first selected
                    as the terminus of a proposed route through the Homathco Valley, is of this
                    character. It is an exposed sound, walled by lofty cliffs, and with its waters
                    of great depth, so that no suitable roadstead or anchorage is available; The
                    latest surveys (1876) indicate that the line must pass by the Fraser River to
                    New Westminster, where suitable natural harbourage can be found. The chief
                    objection to this route is its vicinity to the frontier, so that it very
                    partially opens up the interior of the country. But Dean Inlet, which has been
                    advocated as a preferable terminus, lies too far to the north. The project of an
                    interoceanic railway through British American territory is, under any
                    circumstances, a bold one; and the way in which it is being pressed onward to
                    practical realization abundantly illustrates the enterprize of this young
                    country, which only requires the increased population which such facilities
                    would supply to develop its inexhaustible resources.</p>
                <p>Altogether, evidence enough has already been disclosed to show the great future
                    which is in store for the Canadian provinces on the Pacific. The next decennial
                    census will embrace British Columbia, and furnish more definite statistics as to
                    its industrial progress and natural resources. A steady influx of emigration of
                    the best quality is its first great need. The present population, apart from the
                    native Indian and half-breed, is of a very miscellaneous character, including
                    British, Canadian, American, French, German, and Chinese settlers, with as yet a
                    large preponderance of the male sex.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Tables of the Trade and Navigation of the Dominion
                    for</hi> 1874, the province of British Columbia not only exceeds in the value of
                    its exports both the provinces of Prince Edward Island and Manitoba, but it
                    exhibits the exceptionably favourable contrast of an excess in value of exports
                    over imports. The total value of all goods imported for the year 1874 amounted
                    to $2,048,336, while the value of its exports during the same period was
                    $2,120,624.</p>
                <p>Under the principles of confederation, the full rights of selfgovernment and
                    representative institutions both in its own local parliament and in that of the
                    Dominion have been accorded to this young province. It has its own
                    lieutenant-governor and Legislative Assembly, and is represented at Ottawa by
                    three senators and six members of the House of Commons in the Dominion
                    Parliament. ( D. W. )</p>
