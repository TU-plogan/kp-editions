                <p>A CONIC section is the curve in which a plane cuts a cone, which is defined in
                    Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> as “a solid figure described by the
                    revolution of a right-angled triangle about one of the sides containing the
                    right angle, which side remains fixed.” Though the properties of conic sections
                    can be investigated from this point of view, we consider it more advantageous to
                    start from the following definition, which is derived from one of the properties
                    which all conic sections possess in common.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> If a point move in such a way in a plane that
                    its distance from a fixed point in the plane always bears a fixed ratio to its
                    distance from a fixed straight line in the plane, the point will trace out a
                    conic section.</p>
                <p>The curve is called an <hi rend="italic">ellipse</hi> if the distance from the
                    fixed point is less than, a <hi rend="italic">parabola</hi> if it is equal to,
                    and a <hi rend="italic">hyperbola</hi> if it is greater than, the distance from
                    the fixed straight line.</p>
                <p>The fixed point is called a <hi rend="italic">focus,</hi> and the fixed straight
                    line a <hi rend="italic">directrix</hi> of the curve.</p>
                <p>The fixed ratio of the distance from the focus to the distance from the directrix
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">eccentricity</hi> of the curve.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the conic sections seems to have originated in the school of
                    Plato. It is probable that the followers of that philosopher were led to the
                    discovery of these curves, and to the investigation of many of their properties,
                    in seeking to resolve the two famous problems of the duplication of the cube and
                    the trisection of an angle, for which the artifices of the ordinary or plane
                    geometry were insufficient. Two solutions of the former problem, by the help of
                    the conic sections, are preserved by Eutocius, and are attributed by him to
                    Menaechmus, the scholar of Eudoxus, who lived a little after the time of
                    Plato.</p>
                <p>The writings of Archimedes that have reached us show that the geometers before
                    his time had advanced a great length in investigating the properties of the
                    conic sections. This author expressly mentions numerous demonstrations of
                    preceding writers, and often refers to properties as known to mathematicians.
                    His own discoveries are worthy of the most profound and inventive genius of
                    antiquity. In the quadrature of the parabola he gave the first and the most
                    remarkable instance that has yet been discovered of the exact equality of a
                    curvilinear to a rectilinear space. He determined the proportion of the elliptic
                    spaces to the circle; and he invented many propositions respecting the
                    mensuration of the solids formed by the revolution of the conic sections about
                    their axes.</p>
                <p>It is chiefly from the writings of Apollonius of Perga that we know how far the
                    ancient mathematicians carried their speculations concerning these curves. (See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Apollonius.)</hi> His work on the conic sections, written
                    in eight books, was held in such high estimation by the ancients as to procure
                    for him the name of the Great Geometer. The first four books of this treatise
                    only have come down to us in the original Greek; in these the author claims no
                    further merit than that of having collected, amplified, and arranged the
                    discoveries of preceding mathematicians. One improvement he introduced deserves
                    particular notice. The geometers who preceded him derived each curve from a <hi
                    rend="italic">right cone,</hi> which they conceived to be cut by a plane
                    perpendicular to its slant side; and Apollonius was the first to show that all
                    the curves are produced from any sort of cone, whether right or oblique,
                    according to the different inclinations of the cutting plane. An Arabic MS.
                    discovered in 1658, and two others brought from the East a few years later,
                    contain the first seven books of the treatise of Apollonius; the eighth book
                    appears to be irrecoverably lost. Dr Halley, who in 1710 put forth a correct
                    edition of the Conics of Apollonius, guided by the account of the different
                    books preserved by Pappus, has given a very able restoration of the eighth book.
                    The last four books of the Conics of Apollonius, containing the higher or more
                    recondite parts of the science, are generally supposed to be the fruit of the
                    author’s own researches, and do much honour to his geometrical skill and
                    invention. Even in our times the whole treatise must be regarded as a very
                    extensive work on the conic sections,—modern mathematicians having made few
                    discoveries of which there are not some traces to be found in the work of
                    Apollonius.</p>
                <p>The geometers who followed Apollonius seem to have contented themselves with
                    commenting on his treatise. It was only about the middle of the 16th century
                    that the study of this branch of mathematical science was revived; since that
                    time no part of mathematics has been more cultivated, or has <hi
                    rend="subscript"> fc</hi> been illustrated by a greater variety of ingenious
                    writings. The applications of the properties of these curves in natural
                    philosophy have, in modern times, given them a degree of importance which they
                    did not formerly possess; and a knowledge of them is now indispensable to any
                    one who seeks to acquaint himself with the remarkable physical discoveries of
                    the present age.</p>
                <p>Apollonius and all the earlier writers on conic sections derived the elementary
                    properties of the curves from the nature of the cone; but in 1665 Dr Wallis, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Sectionibus Conicis,</hi> laid
                    aside the consideration of the cone, deriving the properties of the curves from
                    a description <hi rend="italic">in piano.</hi> In the following treatise, as has
                    been already stated, the properties of the conic sections are deduced from their
                    description in a plane.</p>
                <p>An assemblage of points, all of which satisfy some condition, whether or not they
                    form a continuous curve, is called a <hi rend="italic">locus</hi>; as, for
                    example, we could define a circle as the locus of a point whose distance from a
                    fixed point is constant, or a conic section as the locus of a point whose
                    distance from a fixed point always bears a constant ratio to its distance from a
                    fixed straight line.</p>
                <p>The following is a proposition which is very useful in the discussion of the
                    properties of conic sections.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lemma.</hi> —The locus of a point in a plane whose distances
                    from two fixed points in the plane always bear a constant ratio to one another
                    is a circle.</p>
                <p>Let A, B (fig. 1) be the two fixed points, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> the common
                    ratio, and P any point on the locus.</p>
                <p>Divide BA internally and exter∙ in the given ratio, so that <hi> CA</hi> DA_ _PA
                    CB <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> DB ~ <hi rend="superscript"> m,</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> PB *</p>
                <p>Join PC, PD.</p>
                <p>Then, because PA: PB = CA: CB,</p>
                <p>PC is the internal bisector of the angle APB (Eucl. vi. 3); and because PA: PB =
                    DA: DB ,</p>
                <p>PD is the external bisector of the angle APB (Euch vi. A).</p>
                <p>Therefore the angle CPD is a right angle, and the locus of P a circle described
                    on the line CD as diameter.</p>

                <p>To find where a parabola of given focus and directrix is cut by a straight line
                    parallel to the directrix.</p>
                <p>Let S (fig. 2) be the focus, and XK the directrix. Draw SX perpendicular to KX,
                    and bisect SX in A; draw AZ at right angles to SX, and equal to AS. Join XZ.</p>
                <p>Let QN be any straight line parallel to the directrix, cutting XZ in Q and the
                    axis in N.</p>
                <p>With centre S and radius equal to QN, describe a circle cutting QÑ in P and P';
                    these will be points on the parabola, because</p>
                <p>SP: XN = QN: XN = ZA: AX = 1: 1.</p>
                <p>.∙. SP = XN = distance of P from the directrix.</p>
                <p>It is clear that if the point P exists, the point P' on the opposite side of the
                    axis also exists, and therefore the parabola is symmetrical with respect to the
                    axis.</p>
                <p>Again, the point P will exist, or, in other words, the circle will cut QN, as
                    long as SP or QN is greater than SN, which is always the case as long as QN lies
                    on the same side of AZ as the focus.</p>
                <p>The whole of the curve, therefore, lies to the right of AZ, and branches off to
                    an infinite distance from the directrix.</p>

                <p>To find where a parabola of given focus and directrix is cut by a straight line
                    parallel to the axis.</p>
                <p>Let S (fig. 3) υe the focus, and XK the directrix; draw AY bisecting SX at right
                    angles.</p>
                <p>Let KQ be any line parallel to the axis cutting the directrix <hi

                    angles to SK cutting KQ in P. P will be a point on the curve.</p>
                <p>It is easily shown that the triangles SPY, KP Y are equal in all respects, and
                    that SP = PK.</p>
                <p>Now, the point P will exist, or, in other words, YP will intersect KQ, for all
                    positions of KQ.</p>
                <p>The parabola, therefore, branches off on either side of the axis to an infinite
                    distance, and is cut by a straight line parallel to the axis in one point
                    only.</p>
                <p>It appears from what has gone before that the general shape of the curve is of
                    the form given in fig. 4, which shows the focus, directrix, and axis.</p>
                <p>It can be easily seen that all points within the curve are nearer to the focus
                    than to the directrix, and all points without the curve are nearer to the
                    directrix than to the focus.</p>
                <p>A parabola can be described mechanically in the following planner (see fig. 5)
                    :—</p>

                    sliding on KQ, a pencil at P would, trace a parabola whose focus is S and

                <p>Let PZ (fig. 7) be the tangent at P, meeting the directrix in Z; then, if PM be
                    drawn perpendicular to the directrix, it is easily seen that the two triangles
                    SPZ, MPZ are equal in all respects, and the angle SPZ equal to the angle
                    MPZ.</p>
                <p>If SM be joined, it can be shown that it is bisected at right angles by PZ, and
                    that its middle point is the point Y in Prop. ii.</p>
                <p>The line AY, it will be observed, is the tangent to the parabola at the vertex
                    A.</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that the locus of the foot of the perpendicular from the
                    focus on the tangent at any point is the tangent at the vertex.</p>
                <p>It can also be seen that, if the tangent at P meet the axis in T, then SP= ST.
                    For the angles STP, SPT are each equal to the angle MPT, and therefore (Euch i.
                    6) SP, ST are equal.</p>
                <p>It may further be remarked that, if 0 be any point in the tangent at P, then the

                <p>If PN be drawn perpendicular to the axis to meet it in N, then it will be seen

                <p>TA: AY = AY: AS (Euch vi. 8), and therefore YA <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =

                <p>Because OYS is a semicircle, therefore the <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> angle

                <p>If OP, OP' (fig. 8) be tangents to the parabola at P, P', then the triangles OSP,

                <p>Because the angle OSP=angle 0MP=angle 0M'P'=angle OSP', and the angle OPS = angle
                    0PM= angle SMM ’ =⅛ angle SOM' (Eucl. ιii. 20) = angle SOP' (Prop, vi.);
                    therefore the remaining angles OPS, P'OS are equal, and the triangles OPS, P'OS
                    similar; and therefore (Euch vi. 4)</p>

                    a line through 0 meet MM' in Z, MM' is bisected in Z; and, because MP. Z0V, and
                    M'P' are parallel, therefore PP' is bisected in V.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> IX.</p>
                <p>The angle between two tangents is equal to half the angle subtended at the focus

                <p>It may be shown, by means of this proposition, that the circle which is described

                <p>Then PW = WQ (Prop, viii.) Therefore OR = RP (Euch vi. 2). Similarly we can shew
                    that OR' ≡ R'P'. Therefore</p>
                <p>OR:RP≈OR':R'F, and therefore RR' is parallel to PP' (Euch vi. 2); and also .∙. OQ

                <p>Then angle ORQ = J angle QSP (Prop, ix.) =angle QSR (Prop, yn.), and angle QRS
                    =angle RPS (Prop, vii.) =angle STP (Prop, iv.) = angle QOR (Eucl. i. 29);
                    therefore the two triangles 00E, SQR are similar, and</p>
                <p>OQ:QR≈QR;SQ</p>
                <p>therefore QR <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = SQ. OQ.</p>

                <p>By Prop, xiii., PO . OP'=4SQ. RO and similarly pθ. Op'=4Sq. RO. Therefore</p>

                <p>The area included between any chord of a parabola and the curve is two-thirds of
                    the area of the triangle formed by the chord and the tangents to the curve at
                    its extremities.</p>
                <p>It is easily seen in fig. 10 that the area of the triangle ORR' is one quarter
                    the area of the triangle OPP', and therefore one half the area of the triangle

                <p>Now if we draw tangents where RW, R'w meet the curve, we shall have two pairs of

                    The sum of all the external triangles will be half the sum of all the internal

                <p>The sum of the external triangles is the curvilinear area OPQPi and the sum of

                <p>To find where an ellipse of given focus, directrix, and eccentricity is cut by a
                    straight line parallel to the directrix.</p>
                <p>Let S (fig. 13) be the focus, XK the directrix, and ¢ the eccentricity.</p>
                <p>Draw SX perpendicular to XK, and divide it internally and externally in the ratio
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi>: 1 in the points A, A', so that SA: AX = SA&gt;: A'X =
                    e: 1.</p>
                <p>It is clear that A and A' will both be on the same side of X as S is, because the
                    eccentricity <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is less than 1.</p>
                <p>Draw AZ at right angles to SX and equal to AS; and join XZ.</p>
                <p>Let QN be any straight line parallel to the directrix, cutting XZ in Q and the
                    axis in N. With centre S and radius equal to QN describe a circle cutting QN in
                    P and P'; these will be points on the ellipse; for we have</p>
                <p>SP: XN = QN :XN≈ZA: AX = SA: AX≈e: 1.</p>
                <p>It is clear that if this point P exists, the point P' on the opposite side of the
                    axis also exists, and therefore the ellipse is symmetrical with respect to the
                    axis. Again, the point P will exist, or, in other words, the circle will cut QN
                    as long as SP or QN is greater than SN, which is always the case as long as the
                    angle QSN is greater than half a right angle. Now if SL, A'Z' be drawn at right
                    angles to SX, cutting XZ in L, Z', then (Eucl. vi. 4)</p>
                <p>Z'A': A'X = ZA: AX.</p>
                <p>But SA': A'X = SA: AX</p>
                <p>and SA = Z A</p>
                <p>SA'= Z'A'</p>
                <p>Prom which it is easily seen that the angle Z'SA' is half a right ancte. The
                    whole curve therefore lies between the two lines AZ, A'Z'.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> II.</p>
                <p>To find where an ellipse of given focus, directrix, and eccentricity is cut by a
                    straight line perpendicular to the directrix.</p>
                <p>Let S (fig. 14) be the focus, XK the directrix, and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the
                    eccentricity.</p>
                <p>Draw SX perpendicular to XK, and divide SX in A, A', so that</p>
                <p>SA: AX = SA': A'X=β: 1; and draw AR, A'R' at right angles to SX.</p>
                <p>Let KQ be any line parallel to the axis cutting the directrix in K. Join SK
                    cutting AR, A'R' in R, R', and upon RR' as diameter describe a circle cutting KQ
                    in P, P'; these will be points on the curve.</p>
                <p>For SR: RK = SA: AX = e: 1 = SA': A'X</p>
                <p>≈SR':R'K.</p>
                <p>Therefore by the Lemma in the introduction</p>
                <p>SP: PK = SP': P'K = SR: RK = e: 1.</p>
                <p>Therefore P and P' are points on the ellipse.</p>
                <p>Now, if the point P exists, the point P' also exists, and it is easily seen that
                    the middle point L of PP' lies on a straight line bisecting AA' at right angles.
                    The curve therefore is symmetrical, not only with respect to the axis AA', but
                    also with respect to this line bisecting AA'at right angles. The middle point C
                    of AA' is called the <hi rend="italic">centre</hi> of the curve, from the fact
                    that every straight line through C is bisected at the point.</p>
                <p>It is evident from what has preceded that, if we measure CS'= CS, and CX' = CX,
                    in the opposite direction to CS and CX, and draw X'K' parallel to XK, the
                    ellipse might be described with S' for focus, X'K' for directrix, and
                    eccentricity <hi rend="italic">e.</hi></p>
                <p>The ellipse, therefore, has two foci and two directrices.</p>
                <p>Now, since SP: PK = SP': P'K = e: 1.</p>
                <p>Therefore SP + SP': PK +P'K=β: 1, but PK + P'K = 2KL=2CX.</p>
                <p>.∙. SP + SP'=2e .CX.</p>
                <p>Now, it is easily seen that SP'≈S'P; therefore SP + S'P = 2e. CX; or the sum of
                    the focal distances of any point on the curve is constant.</p>
                <p>Again SA: AX = SA': A'X = e: 1</p>
                <p>therefore SA + SA': AX + A'X=β: 1.</p>
                <p>But AX + A'X = 2CX,</p>
                <p>.∙. SA+SA' = SP + S'P.</p>
                <p>And SA'=S'A, therefore SP+S'P = SA + S'A</p>
                <p>-AA'; or the sum of the focal distances of any point on the ellipse is equal to
                    the <hi rend="italic">major axis.</hi></p>
                <p>The point P will exist, or, in other words, the circle on RR' as diameter will
                    intersect KQ, if OL is less than OR when 0 is the middle point of RR'.</p>
                <p>Now SX: SK = CA: OR,</p>

                <p>When KX has this value the points P, P ’ coincide in CL, say at B or B'.</p>
                <p>It appears therefore that the ellipse lies wholly within a certain rectangle, and
                    that its general shape is of the form given in fig. 15 which shews the centre C,
                    the foci S, S', and directrices XK and X'K'.</p>
                <p>It can easily be shown that the sum of the focal distances of any point λvithin
                    the ellipse is less than, and the sum of any point without greater than, AA',
                    and also that the ratio of the focal distance of any point within the ellipse to

                <p>If the two extremities of a rod slide along two fixed straight lines at right

                <p>Let OM, ON (fig. 27) be the two fixed straight lines, and MPN any position of the
                    rod, and P the tracing point.</p>

                <p>Then it can easily be shown that OR = NP and that RH: PH = OR: PM ≈PN:PM.</p>
                <p>Tne locus of R is a circle whose centre is 0</p>
                <p>and radius PN. And the locus therefore of P is an ellipse whose axes are in OM

                <p>If a circle roll on the inside of a fixed circle of double the radius, any fixed

                    out an ellipse.</p>
                <p>If the point Μ (fig. 28) coincided with A at the beginning of the motion and the

                <p>It is clear therefore that the motion of a point P in MN is exactly the same as

                <p>To find where an hyperbola of given focus, directrix, and eccentricity is cut by
                    a straight line parallel to the directrix.</p>
                <p>Let S (fig. 29) be the focus, XK the directrix, and e the eccentricity.</p>
                <p>Draw SX perpendicular to XR, and divide it internally and externally in the ratio
                    e to 1 in the points A, A', so that</p>
                <p>SA :AX≈SA': A'X=β :l.</p>
                <p>It is clear that A will lie between S and X, and A' without SX on the side remote
                    from S.</p>
                <p>Draw AZ at right angles to SX and equal to AS, and join XZ.</p>
                <p>Let QN be any straight line parallel to the directrix, cutting XZ in Q and the
                    axis in N.</p>
                <p>With centre S and radius equal to QN, describe a circle cutting QN in P and P';
                    these will be points on the hyperbola.</p>
                <p>It is clear that if the point P exists, the point P ’ on the opposite side of the
                    axis also exists, and therefore the hyperbola is symmetrical with respect to the
                    axis.</p>
                <p>Again, the point P will exist, or, in other words, the circle will cut QN as long
                    as SP or QN is greater than SN, which is always the case as long as the angle
                    QSN is greater than half a right angle.</p>
                <p>Now, if SL, A'Z' be drawn at right angles to SX, cutting XZ in L, Z', then (Eucl.
                    vi. 4)</p>
                <p>Z'A': A'X = ZA: AX, but SA': A'X = SA: AX, and SA=ZA,</p>
                <p>.∙. SA'= Z'A', from which it is easily seen that the angle Z'SA' is half a right
                    angle.</p>
                <p>The whole curve therefore lies without the two lines AZ, A'Z'.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> II.</p>
                <p>To find where an hyperbola of given focus, directrix, and eccentricity is cut by
                    a straight line perpendicular to the directrix.</p>
                <p>Let S (fig. 30) be the focus, XK the directrix, and e the eccentricity.</p>
                <p>Draw SX perpendicular to XK, and divide SX in A, A', so that</p>
                <p>SA: AX=SA': A'X = e :l; and draw AR, A'R' at right angles to SX.</p>
                <p>Let KQ be any line parallel to the axis, cutting the direc∙ trix in K. Join SK,
                    cutting AR, A'R' in R, R', and upon RR' as diameter describe a circle cutting KQ
                    in P, P'; these will be points on the curve. Now</p>
                <p>SR :RK = SA:AX=e: 1 = SA': A'X =SR': R'K.</p>
                <p>Therefore by the Lemma in the introduction</p>
                <p>SP: PK = SP': P'K=SR: RK = e: 1.</p>
                <p>Therefore P and P' are points on the hyperbola.</p>
                <p>Now, if the point P exists, the point P ’ also exists, and it is easily seen that
                    the middle point L lies on a straight line bisecting AA' at right angles. The
                    curve, therefore, is symmetrical, not only with respect to the axis AA', but
                    also with respect to the line bisecting AA' at right angles. The middle point C
                    of AA' is called the <hi rend="italic">centre</hi> of the curve, from the fact
                    that every straight line through C is bisected at the point.</p>
                <p>It is evident from what has preceded that if we measure CS'≈ CS and CX'=CX, in
                    the opposite direction to CS and CX, and draw X'K' parallel to XK, the hyperbola
                    might be described with S' for focus, X'K' for directrix, and eccentricity <hi
                    rend="italic">e.</hi></p>
                <p>The hyperbola therefore has two foci and two directrices.</p>
                <p>Now, since</p>
                <p>SP :PK = SP': P'K=e: 1, therefore SP ’- SP: P'K - PK=e: 1, but P'K-PK = 2LK =
                    2CX</p>
                <p>.∙. SP'-SP = 2e . CX.</p>
                <p>Now it is easily seen that SP' = S'P, therefore S'P-SP = 2e . CX, or the
                    difference of the focal distances of any point on the curve is constant.</p>
                <p>Again SA: AX=SA': A'X=e: 1</p>
                <p>.∙. SA'-SA: A'X-AX=e: 1, but SA'-SA=AA'</p>
                <p>and A'X-AX = 2CX∙</p>
                <p>.∙. SP'-SP = SA'- <hi rend="italic">SA=AA',</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi> the
                    difference of the focal distances of any point on the hyperbola is equal to th¢
                    transverse axis.</p>
                <p>The point P will always exist, or in other words, the circle on</p>
                <p>R, R' as diameter will always intersect KQ, because R, R' are on opposite sides
                    of KQ.</p>
                <p>Any straight line therefore parallel to the axis cuts the curve, and the curve
                    must take the form given in fig. 31 which shows the centre C, the foci S, S',
                    and the directrices XK, X'K'.</p>
                <p>It can easily be shown that the difference of the focal distances of any point on
                    the concave side of either of the two branches (which is called within the
                    curve) is greater than AA', and the difference of the focal distances of any
                    point outside the curve is less than AA'; and also that the ratio of the focal
                    distance of any point within the hyperbola to its distance from the
                    corresponding directrix is less, and the ratio for any point without is greater,
                    than the eccentricity.</p>
                <p>If a line BCB' be drawn perpendicular to ACA', and points B, B' taken in it such
                    that CB <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = CB' <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = CS
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- CA <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, then AA' is
                    called the transverse axis, and BB' the conjugate axis of the hyperbola.</p>
                <p>If an hyperbola be described with BB' for transverse axis, and AA' for conjugate
                    axis, then this hyperbola is said to be <hi rend="italic">conjugate</hi> to the
                    first one.</p>
                <p>It is clear that the foci of the conjugate hyperbola will be in BCB' at the same
                    distance from C as S and S'.</p>
                <p>An hyperbola can be described mechanically in the following manner :—</p>
                <p>Suppose a bar SQ (fig. 32) to revolve round its extremity S which is fixed; then
                    if a string of given length, attached to the bar at Q, and also to a fixed point
                    S', be always kept tight by means of a ring P sliding on SQ, a pencil at P would
                    trace a hyperbola whose foci are S, S', and whose transverse axis is equal to
                    the length of the rod minus the length of the string.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> III.</p>
                <p>If a chord PQ intersect in Z the directrix corresponding to the focus S, then SZ
                    will be the external bisector of PSQ if P, Q both lie on the same branch of the
                    hyperbola, and SZ will be the internal bisector of the angle PSQ, if P, Q lie on
                    different branches.</p>
                <p>It can be shewn exactly as in Prop. iii. on the ellipse that PZ:QZ≈SP:PQ, which
                    proves the proposition. .</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Corollary.</hi> —If the point Q moves up to and coincides
                    with P, or in other words, the chord PQ becomes the tangent to the hyperbola at

                <p>As the asymptote may be considered as the tangent to the hyperbola at a point at

                <p>If QPP'Q' (fig. 37) be any chord cutting the asymptotes in Q, Q and the curve in

                <p>Now, if V be the middle point of QQ', then</p>

                    is perpendicular to ELG, and since EFGN is a circle (by last Prop.), and EG its
                    diameter, the square of FL is equal to the rectangle contained by EL and LG
                    (Eucl. iii. 35); but since the angle VHK is equal to VBA or VGE, the angles

                    parallel to the cutting plane falls without the cone, touches it, or falls

                    the surface of the cone in VA, VB, and the plane of the section FKM in LK; then,
                    because the planes OVP, MKF are parallel, KL will be parallel to VN, and will
                    meet VB one side of the cone in K; it will either meet VA the other side in H,

                <p>Let EFGM be a section of the cone parallel to the base, meeting the plane VAB in

                    diameter (Prop. xii. on the hyperbola).</p>
                <p>From the four preceding propositions it appears that the only lines which can be
                    formed by the common section of a plane and a cone are these five :—1. Two
                    straight lines intersecting each other in the vertex of the cone; 2. A circle;
                    3. An ellipse; 4. A parabola; 5. An hyperbola. The first two of these, however,
                    viz., the pair of straight lines and circle, may be referred to the hyperbola
                    and the ellipse; for if the axes ot an hyperbola be supposed to retain a
                    constant ratio to each other, and, at the same time, to diminish continually,
                    till at last the vertices coincide, the hyperbola will evidently become two
                    straight lines intersecting each other in a point; and a circle may be
                    considered as an ellipse, whose axes are equal, or whose foci coincide; so that
                    the only three sections which require to be separately considered are the <hi

                <p>If a circle touch a curve at any point P and pass through, another point Q on the
                    curve, then if Q move up to P the limiting position of the circle, when Q
                    coincides with P, is called the <hi rend="italic">circle of curvature</hi> of
                    the curve at P.</p>
                <p>The centre of this circle is called the <hi rend="italic">centre of
                    curvature</hi> of the curve at the point P.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Proposition</hi> I.</p>
                <p>The common chords of any conic and any intersecting circle are equally inclined
                    to the axis or axes of the conic.</p>
                <p>Let P, Q, R, S be the points of intersection of a conic and a circle.</p>
                <p>Let PR, QS intersect in 0.</p>
                <p>Then because P, Q, R, S lie on a circle</p>
                <p>PO. OR = QO. OS (Euch iii. 35); and because POR, QOS are two chords in a conic,
                    the ratio PO.OR :QO.OS</p>

                    square on the semi-diameter parallel to QS.</p>
                <p>Now parameters of chords in the parabola, and semi-diameters parallel to chords
                    in the ellipse and hyperbola, are equal only when the chords are equally
                    inclined to the axes.</p>

                    commenced, in conjunction with Mr Goldwin Smith, a complete edition of Virgil
                    with a commentary, of which the first volume appeared in 1858, the second in
                    1864, and the third soon after his death. Mr Goldwin Smith was compelled to
                    withdraw from the work at an early stage, and in the last volume his place was
                    taken by Mr Nettleship. In 1863 appeared Conington’s translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Carmen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Seczιlare</hi> of Horace. This was followed in 1866 by the work by which its
                    author is best known to the general public, the translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> of Virgil into the octosyllabic metre of Scott, which
                    deservedly takes almost the highest rank in its own department. The version of
                    Dryden is the work of a stronger artist; but for fidelity of rendering, for
                    happy use of the principle of compensation so as to preserve the general effect
                    of the original, and for beauty as an independent poem, Conington’s version is
                    unrivalled. That the measure chosen does not reproduce the majestic sweep of the
                    Virgilian verse is a fault in the conception and not in the execution of the
                    task, and Conington maintained that his choice had advantages which more than
                    counterbalanced this defect. His last effort in his favourite task of
                    translation was his rendering of the <hi rend="italic">Satires, Epistles,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Art of Poetry</hi> of Horace, which was published in 1869.
                    He died at Boston on the 23d October 1869. His edition of Persius, with a
                    commentary and a spirited prose translation, was published posthumously in 1872.
                    In the same year appeared his <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Writings,</hi>
                    edited by Symonds, with a memoir by Professor H. J. S. Smith.</p>
