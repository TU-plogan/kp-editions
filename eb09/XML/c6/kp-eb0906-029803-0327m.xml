                    generally abandoned. The passage in the panegyrist that speaks of his having

                    innkeeper, according to St Ambrose) whom her husband was compelled to repudiate
                    on attaining the dignity of Caesar in 292.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Geoffrey of Monmouth, that Helena was the daughter of a British king, is α pure
                    invention.</p></note> The part of the empire assigned to Constantius was the
                    extreme West, including Spain, Gaul, and Britain; but Constantine was detained
                    in the East at the court of Diocletian, doubtless as a pledge for his father’s
                    loyalty. He served with such distinction under Diocletian in the campaign in
                    Egypt which closed in 296, and subsequently under Galerius in the war with
                    Persia, that he was appointed a tribune of the first rank. His majestic
                    presence, his personal courage, and his skill in military exercises made him a
                    great favourite with the army, and excited in a corresponding degree the
                    jealousy of the naturally suspicious Galerius, who did not scruple, it is said,
                    to expose him repeatedly to unusual hazards in the hope of getting rid of him.
                    The effect of this was to strengthen in Constantine a constitutional wariness
                    and discretion which were often of advantage to him in after life. In 305
                    Diocletian and Maximian abdicated, and were succeeded in the supreme rank of
                    Augustus by the two Caesars, Constantius and Galerius. Constantine, who had
                    naturally the strongest claim to a Caesarship, was passed over by Galerius, and
                    Constantius could not venture to bestow the office while his son remained at
                    what was virtually a hostile court. It was only after repeated letters from his
                    colleague that Galerius gave a reluctant consent that Constantine should join
                    his father. There was ground for supposing even then that the permission was
                    given only to be cancelled, and Constantine accordingly acted upon it with the
                    utmost promptitude, making the journey across Europe from Nicomedia to Boulogne
                    in an unusually short time. At Boulogne he found his father on the point of
                    setting out for Britain, and accompanied him. The death of Constantius soon
                    after at York (25th July 306) brought Constantine to the first great
                    turning-point in his career. The circumstances were critical: it was necessary
                    to avoid on the one hand losing the favour of the army by undue hesitation, and
                    on the other incurring the active hostility of Galerius by undue self-assertion;
                    and Constantine displayed just that union of determination and prudence that the
                    occasion required. Accepting with well-feigned reluctance the enthusiastic
                    nomination of the army to the vacant throne, he wrote at the same time a
                    carefully worded letter to Galerius, expressing regret that circumstances had
                    not permitted him to delay assuming the purple until the imperial approbation
                    could be signified, and begging to be recognized as Augustus in succession to
                    his father. On the reception of the news <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0328-0299"/> Galerius was greatly incensed,.and threatened to
                    give both the letter and its bearer to the flames; but more prudent counsels
                    prevailed, and he ventured to indulge his resentment only so far as to deny the
                    title of Augustus, which was conferred upon Severus, Constantine being
                    acknowledged as Caesar. The latter acquiesced in this arrangement with apparent
                    contentment, and at once set himself as the recognized inheritor of his father’s
                    power to carry out his father’s wise and vigorous policy. The barbarians of the
                    north sustained repeated defeats, and were permanently held in check by the
                    building of a line of forts on the Rhine; and the internal prosperity of the
                    country was promoted by a confirmation of the tolerant policy adopted by
                    Constantius towards the Christians, the persecuting edict of Galerius being
                    treated as a dead letter.</p>
                <p>The events of the next few years showed clearly the essential instability of the
                    arrangement devised by Diocletian for the partition of the imperial power among
                    Augustuses and Caesars. It was in the very nature of the plan that under it
                    those who were nominally colleagues should be in reality rivals, constantly
                    plotting and counter-plotting for the sole supremacy. Accordingly the history of
                    the empire from the period of the division of the imperial power by Diocletian
                    to that of its reconsolidation under Constantine is mainly a record of the
                    struggle for that supremacy. The narrative is necessarily intricate, and can
                    only be fully given in a general historical article. The state of matters was
                    complicated by a rebellion at Rome against Galerius, which had for its final
                    result the contemporaneous reign of no less than six emperors,—Galerius,
                    Licinius, and Maximin in the East, and Maximian, Maxentius, and Constantine in
                    the West (308). Maxentius was the son of Maximian, and Constantine was his
                    son-in-law, having married his daughter Fausta at Arles in 307, on which
                    occasion he received the title of Augustus; but this family relationship did not
                    prevent a conflict of interests. Maxentius claimed to be the sole rightful
                    sovereign of Italy, and being supported by the praetorian guards compelled his
                    father to quit Rome. Maximian, after a brief residence in Illyricum, from which
                    he was driven by Galerius, took refuge at the court of his son-in-law,
                    Constantine, who received him with the respect due to his rank. For the second
                    time he resigned the purple, and affected to have no longer any desire of power.
                    Very soon after, however, he was tempted, during the absence of Constantine on
                    the Rhine, to reassume the imperial dignity and to enter into a plot with
                    Maxentius for the overthrow of his son-in-law. Constantine, on receiving the
                    news, acted with the necessary promptitude. He appeared at once with his troops
                    before Arles, and compelled Maximian to retreat to Marseilles, whither he
                    followed him. The town might have stood a protracted siege, but it preferred to
                    deliver up the usurper, who avoided the execution of the sentence of death
                    pronounced upon him by committing suicide<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> According to Lactantius <hi rend="italic">(De Mort.
                    Persec.,</hi> c. 29, 30,) Maximian was pardoned for this attempt, and the
                    clemency of Constantine was only exhausted by the discovery of a plot for his
                    assassination in bed, which failed, owing to the conjugal fidelity of Fausta.
                    Gibbon discredits this story.</p></note> (February 310).</p>
                <p>The death of Maximian was the first of a series of events which ended in the
                    establishment of Constantine as the sole emperor of the West. It was seized upon
                    by Maxentius as a pretext for hostile measures, which Constantine, unwilling to
                    engage in war, ignored as long as he safely could. When the time came for
                    action, however, he acted, as was his wont, with decision. Maxentius was
                    preparing to invade Gaul, when Constantine, encouraged by an embassy from Rome,
                    anticipated him by entering Italy at the head of a large and well-disciplined
                    army. He had crossed the Cottian Alps (Mont Cenis), and was in the plains of</p>
                <p>Piedmont before Maxentius knew that he had set out. A series of successes at
                    Susa, Turin, and Verona culminated in the decisive victory of the Miívian
                    Bridge, near Rome (28th October 312), which left the capital open to the
                    invader. In the hurried retreat of the defeated army Maxentius was pressed by
                    the throng over the bridge into the river, and was drowned. The conduct of the
                    conqueror was marked on the whole by wisdom and moderation. The slaughter of the
                    two sons and of the more intimate favourites of the fallen emperor was a measure
                    deemed essential if the fruits of the victory were to be retained, and cannot be
                    imputed to wanton cruelty, especially as Constantine seems to have abstained
                    from the too common practice of an indiscriminate massacre. The final disbanding
                    of the praetorian guards and the destruction of their camp, th 3 imposition of a
                    poll-tax on the senators, and the assumption of the title of Pontifex Maximus
                    were the other chief events of Constantine’s first residence in Rome, which
                    lasted only a few weeks,—a fact in itself significant of the decaying importance
                    of the capital, if not prophetic of the early rise of a Nova Roma.</p>
                <p>It was in the course of the expedition that ended with the victory of the Milvian
                    Bridge that the celebrated incident occurred, which is said to have caused
                    Constantine’s conversion,—the appearance of a flaming cross in the sky at
                    noon-day with the motto ’Ey τovrω <hi rend="italic">viκa</hi> (By this conquer),
                    The story is told by Eusebius, who professes to have had it from the lips of the
                    emperor himself, and also with considerable variation in the details by
                    Lactantius, Nazarius, and Philostorgius. In order to understand the true
                    relation of Constantine to Christianity, however, it is necessary to consider
                    all the incidents bearing upon that relation together, and this, therefore,
                    along with the others. There is the less violence to chronological order in
                    delaying the critical examination of the story, inasmuch as it was first
                    communicated by Constantine to Eusebius several years later, and as the Labarum,
                    or standard of the cross, made in obedience to the heavenly vision was not
                    exhibited to the army, according to Gibbon, till 323. The conversion, whatever
                    its nature and whatever its cause, was followed, indeed, by one more immediate
                    result of a significant kind in the important Edict of Milan (March 313), issued
                    by Constantine and Licinius conjointly, restoring all forfeited civil and
                    religious rights to the Christians, and securing them full and equal toleration
                    throughout the empire.</p>
                <p>By the victory of the Milvian Bridge Constantine became the sole emperor of the
                    West. Very soon after a like change took place in the East. Galerius had died in
                    May 311, and a war ensued between the two surviving emperors in which Maximin
                    was the aggressor and the loser, as Maxentius had been in the West. After a
                    decisive defeat near Heraclea (April 313) he took to flight, and died at Tarsus,
                    probably by his own hand, in August of the same year. Licinius thus attained the
                    same place in the East as Constantine held in the West. The interests of the two
                    who now divided between them the empire of the world had been apparently
                    identified by the marriage of Licinius to Constantine’s sister Constantia, which
                    was celebrated with great pomp at Milan in March 313. But iu little more than a
                    year they were engaged in a war, the origin of which is somewhat obscure, though
                    it probably arose from the treachery of Licinius. After two battles, iu which
                    the Eastern emperor suffered severely, he was fain to sue for peace, which
                    Constantine granted only on condition that Illyricum, Pannonia, and Greece
                    should be transferred to his territory.</p>
                <p>The peace lasted for nine years, a period during which Constantine’s position
                    grew stronger while that of Licinius grew weaker, wise and humane legal reforms
                    and vigorous <pb break="no"

                    marking the policy of the one, and caprice, indolence, and cruelty being the
                    most conspicuous features in the conduct of the other. When the inevitable
                    struggle for the supremacy came, though the army of Licinius was the larger, the
                    issue was scarcely doubtful. The origin of the war which broke out in 323 is,
                    like that of the previous one in 314, not quite clear; but it is probable that
                    Constantine, having determined to make himself the sole master of the world, did
                    not think it necessary to wait for provocation. The campaign was short but
                    decisive. Licinius was totally defeated in a battle fought at Adrianople on the
                    3d July 323. This was followed by the siege of Byzantium, in which Crispus,
                    Constantine’s eldest son, who was in command of the fleet, co-operated with his
                    father by entering the Hellespont and defeating Amandus, the admiral of
                    Licinius, after a two days’ engagement. In a final battle fought at Chrysopolis
                    (now Scutari) Licinius was totally routed, and he fled to Nicomedia. On the
                    intercession of his wife Constantia, the sister of Constantine, the emperor
                    promised to spare his life; but the promise was not kept. In 324 the defeated
                    monarch was put to death by Constantine’s orders at Thessalonica, which had been
                    fixed as the place of his exile. A treasonable conspiracy was alleged against
                    him, but there is no evidence in support of the charge; and possible danger in
                    the future rather than any plot actually discovered seems to have prompted
                    Constantine to a deed which cannot escape the censure of bad faith, if not of
                    wanton cruelty.</p>
                <p>With the war against Licinius the military career of Constantine may be said to
                    have closed. He was now the sole emperor of both East and West. His enlightened
                    policy had made his power throughout the empire so secure that any attempt to
                    usurp it would have been utterly vain. Accordingly the remainder of his reign
                    was passed in undisturbed tranquillity. The period of peace was not inglorious,
                    including among lesser events the convocation of the Council of Nicaea (325) and
                    the foundation of Constantinople (328). But unfortunately it was disgraced by a
                    series of bloody deeds that have left an indelible stain on the emperor’s
                    memory. In 326 Constantine visited Rome to celebrate the twentieth anniversary
                    <hi rend="italic">(vicennalia)</hi> of his accession. During the festivities his
                    eldest son Crispus was accused of treason by Fausta, and banished to Pola, in
                    Istria, where he was put to death. Licinius, the emperor’s nephew, being
                    included in the same charge, likewise fell a victim, and a number of the
                    courtiers also suffered. According to another version of the story Fausta
                    accused her step-son of attempting incestuous intercourse, and Constantine,
                    discovering when it was too late that the accusation was false, caused her to be
                    suffocated in her bath. The whole circumstances of Fausta’s death, however, are
                    involved in uncertainty owing to the contradictions of the different narratives.
                    The bloody tragedy struck horror into the minds of the citizens, and it was amid
                    ominous indications of unpopularity that Constantine quitted Rome for the last
                    time.</p>
                <p>It had probably been for some time clear to his mind that the empire required in
                    its new circumstances a new political centre. A Nova Roma would mark in a
                    visible and concrete form the new departure in imperial policy which it had been
                    the main object of the emperor’s life to initiate. At least two other
                    places—Sardica in Maesia, and Troy—had been thought of ere his choice was fixed
                    upon Byzantium. No happier selection has ever been made. The natural advantages
                    of the site are probably unsurpassed by those of any capital either in the Old
                    or in the New World, and its political importance is evidenced by the frequency
                    with which it has been the key to the situation in European diplomacy. The new
                    capital, the building of which had been commenced in 328, was solemnly
                    inaugurated on the 11th May 330, being dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The fact
                    that the ceremonial was performed exclusively by Christian ecclesiastics, and
                    that no pagan temple was permitted to be erected in the new city, marks in an
                    emphatic way the establishment of Christianity as the state religion.</p>
                <p>The closing years of Constantine’s life were uneventful. One of his last schemes
                    was that for the partition of the empire after his death among his three sons by
                    Fausta,— Constantine, Constantius, and Constans; but it proved even less stable
                    than the analogous scheme of Diocletian. In 337 Sapor II. of Persia asserted by
                    force his claim to the provinces that had been taken from him by Galerius.
                    Constantine was preparing to meet him at the head of an army, when he was taken
                    ill, and after a brief and vain trial of the baths of Helenopolis retired to
                    Nicomedia. Here he died on the 22d May 337. The significance of his baptism on
                    his deathbed by the Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, will be indicated
                    afterwards. His body was taken to Constantinople, and buried according to his
                    own instructions in the Church of the Apostles with imposing ceremony.</p>
                <p>The most interesting and the most disputed subject in connection with the life of
                    Constantine is the nature of his relation to Christianity. The facts bearing
                    upon it are clear enough, and the controversy must therefore be entirely
                    attributed to the manipulation and distortion of partisans. A brief statement of
                    these facts will suffice to show how far his acceptance of Christianity was a
                    matter of personal conviction, and how far, on the other hand, it was a matter
                    of statesmanship. The generous conduct of Constantius towards the Christians
                    betokens a certain measure of sympathy, and the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Xριστιavoφpωv</hi> (Christian-minded) applied to him by Theophanes gives some
                    ground for supposing that the paternal influence may have acted as a sort of <hi
                    rend="italic">praeparatio</hi><hi rend="italic">eυangelica</hi> in the mind of
                    Constantine. But whatever may have been due to this, it did not bring him over
                    to the new faith. His own narrative to Eusebius attributed his conversion to the
                    miraculous appearance of a flaming cross in the sky at noon-day under the
                    circumstances already indicated. The story has met with nearly every degree of
                    acceptance from the unquestioning faith of Eusebius himself to the incredulity
                    of Gibbon, who treats it as a fable, while not denying the sincerity of the
                    conversion. On the supposition that Constantine narrated the incident in good
                    faith, the amount of objective reality that it possesses is a question of
                    altogether secondary importance. There is nothing improbable in the theory that
                    accounts for the appearance of the cross by the not infrequent natural
                    phenomenon of a parhelion. It seems likelier, however, that Constantine gave
                    external reality to what was nothing more than an optical delusion or a dream.
                    Eusebius, it is true, narrates both the appearance at noon-day and a dream on
                    the following night, in which the appearance was interpreted; but the very
                    strength of the impression made on Constantine’s mind may have led him to
                    magnify the incident without conscious misrepresentation. Whatever the nature of
                    the appearance may have been, its effect upon the emperor, to judge from his
                    subsequent conduct, fell far short of a true or thorough conversion; it probably
                    did not amount to more than the creation of a superstitious belief in the symbol
                    of the cross. This is sufficient to account for the edict of toleration and for
                    all his legislation that seems to be based upon sympathy with Christian ideas.
                    On the other hand, the notion of conversion in the sense of a real acceptance of
                    the new religion, and a thorough rejection of the old, is inconsistent with the
                    hesitating attitude in which he stood towards both. Much of this may indeed be
                    due to motives of political expediency, but there is a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0330-0301"/> good deal that cannot be so explained. Paganism
                    mus'; still have been an operative belief with the man who, down almost to the
                    close of his life, retained so many pagan superstitions. He was at best only
                    half heathen, half Christian, who could seek to combine the worship of Christ
                    with the worship of Apollo, having the name of the oue and the figure of the
                    other impressed upon his coins, and ordaining the observance of Sunday under the
                    name <hi rend="italic">Dies Solis</hi> in his celebrated decree of March 321,
                    though such a combination was far from uncommon in the first Christian
                    centuries. Perhaps the most significant illustration of the ambiguity of his
                    religious position is furnished by the fact that in the same year in which he
                    issued the Sun day decree he gave orders that, if lightning struck the imperial
                    palace or any other public building, “the haruspices, according to ancient
                    usage, should be consulted as to what it might signify, and a careful report of
                    the answer should be drawn up for his use.” From the time of the Council of
                    Nicaea there are fewer signs of halting between two opinions, but the interest
                    of the emperor in Christianity was still primarily political and official rather
                    than personal. He summoned the council, presided over its first meeting, and
                    took a prominent part in its proceedings both before and behind the scenes. The
                    year before it met he had, in a noteworthy letter to the Alexandrian bishops,
                    urged such a scheme of comprehension as might include Arians and orthodox in the
                    one church; and on this ground he has been claimed as the earliest of broad
                    churchmen. When the result of its deliberations was the adoption, for the first
                    time in the history of the church, of a written creed, he cordially approved of
                    the proposal, and was thus the earliest to enforce uniformity by means of
                    subscription. The two plans were incompatible, but the conduct of Constantine in
                    supporting first the one and then the other was perfectly consistent. Throughout
                    he acted in the interest of the state. The splitting up of the church into a
                    number of bitterly contending factions would be a constant source of danger to
                    the unity of the empire, while on the other hand the empire might gain fresh
                    strength from the growing power of Christianity if that power were embodied in a
                    campact and united organization. It was by this consideration, probably, that
                    Constantine was guided in dealing with the Arian controversy; there are no
                    traces of any engrossing personal interest on his part in the cardinal question
                    of the <hi rend="italic">homoousìon.</hi> There are not wanting, indeed, several
                    facts that show a real concern in the truths of Christianity as distinct from
                    its social and political influence. Eusebius has recorded one of his sermons,
                    and he seems to have preached frequently in refutation of the errors of paganism
                    and in illustration and defence of the doctrines of the new faith. The same
                    historian speaks of his taking part in the ceremonies of worship, and of his
                    long vigils at the season of Easter. His delaying to receive baptism until he
                    was on his deathbed does not imply that he delayed till then the full acceptance
                    of Christianity, though it has frequently been so interpreted by those who were
                    unaware that the doctrine that all sin committed before baptism was washed away
                    by the simple observance of the rite not unnaturally made such procrastination
                    very common. There is no historical foundation for the assertion of Baronius and
                    other Catholic writers that the emperor received baptism from Pope Sylvester at
                    Rome in 326. Equally baseless is the story of the so-called donation of
                    Constantine, according to which the emperor after his baptism endowed the Pope
                    with temporal dominion. It is to this that Dante alludes in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Inferno;—</hi></p>
                <p>Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was c.^.use, Not thy conversion, but those rich
                    domains That the first wealthy Pope received of thee.</p>
                <p>It has been remarked by Stanley that Constantine was entitled to be called Great
                    in virtue rather of what he did than of what he was. Tested by character,
                    indeed, he stands among the lowest of all those to whom the epithet has in
                    ancient or modern times been applied. Fearlessness, decision, political
                    sagacity, and religious tolerance he possessed from first to last; but the
                    generous clemency of which there are traces in his earlier years cannot have any
                    longer worked effectually in him when he sanctioned the treacherous treatment of
                    Licinius and the atrocities that connected themselves with the murder of
                    Crispus. Tried by achievement, however, he stands among the very first of those
                    who have ever won the title. In fact, there are two grounds at least on which as
                    important a place may be claimed for him as for any sovereign who has reigned
                    during the Christian era. What he did as the founder of the complex political
                    system which exists among all civilized nations down to the present day, and
                    what he did as the first Christian emperor, had results of the most enduring and
                    far reaching kind. It belongs to the historian of the empire to give a detailed
                    account of the elaborate scheme he devised by y <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi>
                    lιich the civil functions of the state were separated from the military, and
                    both from the spiritual,— the very idea of such distinctions having been
                    previously unknown. The empire he by such means revived, though in the East it
                    lasted a thousand years, was never again so strong as it was in his own hands;
                    but the importance of his scheme consisted in this that it gave to empire
                    itself, regarded as a system of government, a new structure and a new power
                    which still survive in the political constitutions of the various nations of
                    Europe. As to Christianity the historically significant fact is not his personal
                    acceptance of it. It is rather that by his policy as a statesman he endowed the
                    new religion for the first time with that instrument of worldly power which has
                    made it—whether for good or for evil or for both is a subject of much
                    discussion—the strongest social and political agent that affects the destinies
                    of the human race.</p>
