                <p><label type="entry">COOLIE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Cooly</hi></label>, a word
                    applied to designate an Asiatic labourer not belonging to the skilled or artizan
                    class. Its derivation is far from certain. Dr Engelbert Kämpfer, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Japan</hi> (London, 1727), describes as “coolies” the
                    dock labourers, or, as they are called in England, “lumpers,” who unloaded the
                    Dutch merchant ships at Nagasaki. At Canton to this day a labourer in any
                    European factory is known as a “coolie;” and though some have thought that the
                    word may be of Chinese origin, as a matter of fact it is through Europeans that
                    the natives of the Celestial Empire first became acquainted with the term. Of
                    late the word is almost exclusively used to designate those natives of India and
                    China who leave their native country under contracts of service to work as
                    field-hands or labourers in foreign plantations and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>The organization, partly official and partly voluntary, by means of which these
                    Eastern labourers are collected, engaged, and conveyed to their respective
                    destinations, has within recent times developed itself into a regular trade. The
                    French, Portuguese, and Spanish nations prosecute this trade to a certain
                    extent, and one or two South American republics also take part in it; but the
                    great bulk of the traffic is now undoubtedly British.</p>
                <p>Coolie emigration is the direct offspring of the discontinuance of slavery. When
                    slave labour was no longer available, the colonists who had used it were placed
                    in an awkward dilemma. White men were physically incapable of field work on
                    tropical plantations, and free negroes could not be induced to engage in it. In
                    these circumstances there were but two alternatives open to the planters. Either
                    they must abandon their estates, or they must import labour from other countries
                    than those which had been drained and devastated by the slave trade. There were
                    many considerations that pointed to India and China as the fields most likely to
                    yield that supply of workers on getting which the very existence of the West
                    Indies depended. Those great Asiatic empires were over-peopled; their rigid
                    forms of civilization, which had rooted them to the soil, were gradually being
                    loosened by the impact of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0363-0334"/> European commerce; and their reluctance to leave
                    their native shores was removed by tempting offers made to them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chinese Coolies.—</hi> The first public recognition of the
                    traffic was in 1844, when the British colony of Guiana made provision for the
                    encouragement of Chinese emigration. About the same time the Peruvian planters,
                    who since their separation from the mother country had restricted slavery within
                    the narrowest limits, also looked to China as being likely to furnish an
                    efficient substitute for the negro bondsman. Agents armed with consular
                    commissions from Peru began to appear in Chinese ports, where they collected and
                    sent away ship-loads of coolies. Each one was bound to serve the Peruvian
                    planter to whom he might be assigned for seven or eight years, at fixed wages,
                    generally about 17s. a month,—food, clothes, and lodging being provided. Cuba,
                    profiting by the example of Peru, also engaged in the traffic. In 1847,
                    therefore, two ships went from Amoy to Havana, one with 350, the other with 629
                    coolies on board. From 1847 to 1856 the trade went on briskly without attracting
                    much notice. Gradually, however, ugly reports as to the treatment the coolies
                    received, both on their voyage to and after their arrival in Peru and Cuba,
                    began to come to Europe and Asia. Still more painful rumours were set afloat
                    regarding the thievish devices used to induce Chinese emigrants to leave their
                    native land. It was said they were kidnapped, or tempted to engage under false
                    pretences. It was declared that the transport ships were badly equipped and
                    overcrowded, and that on their voyages they reproduced all the horrors of the
                    “middle passage” in the old African slave trade. Those who were safely landed in
                    Cuba or Peru were sold by auction in the open market to the highest bidders, who
                    thus purchased them, holding them virtually as slaves for seven years instead of
                    for life. Brutal as was the treatment to which these poor wretches were exposed
                    on the plantations, it was merciful compared with that which fell to the lot of
                    those who, contrary to their agreements, had been sent to labour in the foul
                    guano pits of the Chincha Islands. Here they were forced to toil in gangs, each
                    under an over seer, armed with a cowhide lash 5 feet long and 1∣ inches thick.
                    It was claimed as a merit that up to four o’clock each afternoon this weapon
                    “was not much used.” After that hour, however, the weaker coolies had their
                    flagging energies stimulated by cuts of the whip, and remonstrance and entreaty
                    were “punished by a flogging little short of murder.” This horrible treatment
                    speedily aroused attention; and a memorial was presented to the British
                    Government by shipmasters engaged in the Chincha Islands guano trade. Even the
                    United States skippers declared they “never saw or heard of slavery approaching
                    that of the middle island of the Chinchas in misery.” In 1860 it was calculated
                    that of the 4000 coolies who since the traffic began had been fraudulently
                    consigned to the guano pits of Peru, not one had survived. Some had poisoned
                    themselves with opium; others deliberately contrived that they should be buried
                    alive under falling masses of guano; many jumped off the cliffs and drowned
                    themselves in the sea. When these atrocities came to light in 1854, the British
                    governor of Hong Kong issued a proclamation forbidding British subjects or
                    vessels to engage in the transport of coolies to the Chinchas. Technically this
                    was <hi rend="italic">ultra vires</hi> on his part. But in the following year
                    Parliament confirmed his humane policy by passing the Chinese Passengers Act (18
                    and 19 Vict. c. 104), which put an end to the more abominable phase of the
                    traffic. After that no British ship was allowed to sail on more than a week’s
                    voyage with more than twenty coolies on board, unless her master had complied
                    with certain very stringent regulations.</p>
                <p>The consequence of this was that the business of shipping coolies for Peru was
                    transferred to the Portuguese settlement of Macao. There the Peruvian and Cuban
                    “labour-agents” established dépôts, which they unblush-ingly called
                    “barracoons,” the very term used in the West African slave trade. In these
                    places coolies were “received,” or in plain words, imprisoned and kept under
                    close guard until a sufficient number were collected for export. Some of these
                    were decoyed by fraudulent promises of profitable employment. Others were
                    kidnapped by piratical junks hired to scour the neighbouring coasts. Many were
                    bought from leaders of turbulent native factions, only too glad to sell the
                    prisoners they captured whilst waging their internecine wars. The procurador or
                    registrar-general of Macao went through the form of certifying the contracts;
                    but his inspection was therefore practically useless. After the war of 1856-57
                    this masked slave trade pushed its agencies into Wampoa and Canton, In April
                    1859, however, the whole mercantile community of the latter port rose up in
                    indignation against it, and transmitted such strong representations to the
                    British embassy in China, that steps were taken to mitigate the evil. New
                    regulations were from time to time passed by the Portuguese authorities for the
                    purpose of minimizing the horrors of the Macao trade. They seem, however, to
                    have been systematically evaded, and to have been practically inoperative. In
                    1868 the governor of Macao attempted to put in force humane regulations, but
                    without success, as was proved by the trial of a Chinaman, Kwok-a-Sing, on the
                    29th of March 1871 before Chief-Justice Smale of Hong-Kong.. The prisoner had
                    been an emigrant on board the French ship “Nouvelle Pénélope,” which sailed in
                    October 1871 from Macao with 300 coolies. They mutinied on the voyage, and
                    killed the master and seven of the crew. Kwok-a-Sing was acquitted when tried
                    for being an accessory to this crime. In the course of his trial, however, it
                    was proved that though some of the mutineers were hardened criminals who had
                    shipped as coolies merely for the purpose of raising a mutiny and plundering the
                    ship, upwards of one-third of the emigrants on board had been kidnapped and were
                    feloniously held in bondage. Commenting on this case, the British consul said
                    the benevolent regulations of the Macao Government looked well on paper, but in
                    practice they were capable of being evaded to an extent that made the coolie
                    traffic “simply a slave trade, and a disgrace to any Christian Government that
                    permits its perpetration within its jurisdiction.” At Canton and Hong-Kong the
                    coolie trade was put under various regulations, which in the latter port worked
                    well only when the profits of “head-money” were ruined. In March 1866 the
                    representatives of the Governments of France, England, and China drew up a
                    convention for the regulation of the Canton trade, which had an unfortunate
                    effect. It left head-money, the source of most of the abuses, comparatively
                    untouched. It enacted that every coolie must at the end of a five years’
                    engagement have his return passage-money paid to him. The West Indian colonies
                    at once objected to this. They wanted permanent not temporary settlers. They
                    could not afford to burden the coolie’s expensive contract with return
                    passage-money, so they declined to accept emigrants on these terms. Thus a
                    legalized coolie trade between the West Indies and China was extinguished.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Indian Coolies.—</hi> With reference to the Indian coolie trade
                    it is scarcely possible to say when it began. Before the end of last century
                    Tamil labourers from Southern India were wont to emigrate to the Straits
                    settlements, and they also flocked to Tenasserim from the other side of the Bay
                    of Bengal after the conquest had produced a demand for labour. Ceylon also
                    obtained workers from Southern India, and the extent of the emigration may be
                    estimated by the fact that, taking a period of ten years ending 1869, about
                    65,000 emigrants, of whom 50,000 were adult males, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n364/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0364-0335"/> landed annually in the island, and some 48,000
                    returned each year to their homes. In Penang it is calculated that 25,000 souls
                    out of a population of 150,000 are Indian coolies. It is in domestic and
                    agricultural service that they are employed in the Straits settlements, and more
                    recently large numbers of coolies have been induced to work in the tea-gardens
                    of Assam. On the other hand, in Burmah, they work as dock labourers and porters.
                    In Mauritius, again, the first regularly recorded attempt at organizing coolie
                    emigration from India took place in 1834, when forty coolies were imported.
                    Between 1834 and 1837 about 7000 labourers must have been shipped from Calcutta,
                    and about 100 from Bombay, to Mauritius, but it was not till 1836 that the
                    colonial Government determined to put the trade under official regulations. In
                    1837 an emigration law was passed for Calcutta, but it also applied to all
                    territories of the East India Company, providing that a “permit” must be got
                    from the Government for every shipment of coolies, that all contracts should
                    terminate in five years, that a return passage should be guaranteed, and that
                    the terms of his contract should be carefully explained to each coolie. As
                    regards the emigrant ships they were allowed to carry one coolie for every ton
                    and a half of burthen—a rule now extended to one coolie for every two tons
                    burthen. Then as now the Indian Government watched the deportation of labour
                    from their dominions with jealous and anxious care, and when in 1838 it was
                    found that upwards of 25,000 natives had, up to that year, gone from all parts
                    of India to Mauritius, the Government became a little alarmed at the dimensions
                    the traffic was assuming. Brougham and the old anti-slavery party denounced the
                    trade as a revival of slavery, and the Presidency Government suspended it in
                    order to investigate its alleged abuses. The nature of these may be guessed when
                    it is said that the inquiry condemned the fraudulent methods of recruiting them
                    in vogue, and the brutal treatment coolies often received from ship captains and
                    masters. It was not till 1842 that steps were taken to formally reopen the
                    coolie trade between Mauritius and India. A regulating Act was passed, the most
                    important provisos of which were the appointment of authorized emigration agents
                    at Indian ports, and a prohibition against contracts being signed till the
                    coolie had been forty-eight hours on shore in the colony for which he was bound.
                    At first the term was for one year, and the wages were five rupees a month,
                    food, clothing, and medical attendance being found. Return passages were also
                    guaranteed. In 1844 coolie emigration to the West Indies was sanctioned by the
                    Indian Government. Jamaica, Trinidad, and Demerara were permitted to import
                    coolies under the Mauritius rules, slightly modified,—one of the most important
                    differences being that 12 per cent, of the emigrants to the West Indies were to
                    be women. None of the colonial codes, however, seem to have carried out this
                    modification. In 1847 Ceylon suffered by the political accident of having a
                    separate Government. Her supply of labour was cut off, as the Indian Government
                    prohibited all emigration save to the West Indies and Mauritius. The unfair
                    prohibition was withdrawn, on the Ceylon Government adopting certain protective
                    regulations in favour of the emigrants, and ever since the coolie trade with the
                    island has gone on pretty smoothly. In 1851 the Indian Government agreed to
                    relieve Mauritius of the obligation to provide return passages save for the
                    destitute and the sick. In 1853 Lord Dalhousie’s Government extended the term
                    qualifying the West Indian coolie for return from five to ten years’ service. In
                    1857 the colonial Governments proposed to commute the coolie’s claim for a
                    return passage, by giving him its value in land; but Lord Canning’s Government
                    viewed the suggestion with great jealousy, saying there must be some guarantee
                    that in arranging the commutation the coolie was not swindled. In 1859 voluntary
                    commutation was agreed to by the Indian authorities. Since then many changes
                    have taken place, but, generally speaking, the Indian coolie trade is now
                    regulated by two Acts—those of 1864 and 18υ9, of which the main provisions are
                    as follows :—∙</p>
                <p>Resident colonial emigration agents are appointed for the different ports. They
                    appoint sub-agents or remitting parties, who must bear licences from the
                    Protector of Emigrants at Calcutta. It is their business to beat up the country
                    for coolies when there is a demand for them. The intending emigrants, when
                    collected, must be taken by the agents before the resident magistrate of the
                    district, who registers each one. A copy or certificate of registration is given
                    to each coolie, stating particulars as to age, sex, name, caste, and former
                    occupation. Of these documents duplicatés are transmitted to the colonial
                    emigration agent. When this formality has been complied with, the coolie is then
                    sent on to the dépôt and examined there by the colonial agent and surgeons. If
                    physically unfit for the work for which he is wanted, of course he is summarily
                    rejected. Each coolie ship must undergo rigorous sanitary inspection, and carry
                    a surgeon, who reports on all the deaths and cases of sickness that occur during
                    the passage. The contract'which the coolie signs with the emigration agent binds
                    him to serve not more than for 7 ⅛ hours a day for five years, as an
                    agricultural labourer, on the estate „to which he may be sent by the authorities
                    at the port of debarkation. The wage in money is to be that which from time to
                    time is paid to unindentured labourers in the colony. (In Demerara the Indian
                    coolie earns Is. 2d. a day,—women about Is., and children 6d. each). The coolie
                    also is provided with a house, garden, and medical attendance,—rations and
                    clothing being subject to the special arrangements affecting wages; while at the
                    end of ten years’ service they are entitled to a free return passage to
                    India.</p>
                <p>As to the treatment of the coolie in the colonies when he arrives, of course
                    there is much dispute. Statistics indicate that it cannot have been very
                    considerate. From 1834 to 1872 Demerara, Trinidad, Jamaica, St Vincent, and
                    Grenada imported 161,539 coolies, of whom 16,938 have returned home, and 48,548
                    are dead, leaving 96,053 in those colonies. As far as official rules can protect
                    him a great deal is done by the Government. When he lands he is subjected to an
                    examination by the immigration agent-general and an officer of health. Those not
                    fit for agricultural labour are set aside, and those that are fit are allotted
                    to different plantations in accordance with the demand made for them. Family
                    life is respected, and children under fifteen years of age must not be parted
                    from their parents. After their five years’ indenture is ended, they are at
                    liberty to re-engage on an independent footing, a bounty of about £11 being
                    given to those who re-contract for another term of similar duration. How these
                    apparently equitable provisions work became a matter of dispute in the case of
                    Demerara and Mauritius; and serious complaints were made in 1869 with reference
                    to the former colony by Mr G. W. des Voeux, a stipendiary magistrate, who had
                    spent five years in the country. Commissioners were therefore despatched to
                    inquire into the matter. They suggested certain reforms for the purpose of
                    guarding the indentured labourer against the possibility of ill-treatment, and
                    the powers of the immigration agent-general, or protector of immigrants, were
                    enlarged so as to enable him to inspect estates more regularly, frequently, and
                    efficiently. The medical officers of plantations, too, were made civil servants,
                    and relieved from their dependence on the planters for their salaries. The
                    question of re-engagements was also dealt with by the reforming ordinance of
                    1868 in a provision enacting that the manager of every estate should, at the
                    half-yearly visit of the agentgeneral, produce before him every coolie who had
                    completed his term of service, or would complete it in the course of the next
                    six months. To each coolie in this position a certificate or a provisional
                    certificate of exemption from labour must be handed, and not till then may the
                    manager or any employer negotiate with him for re-indenture.</p>

                <p>The case of Mauritius was more serious. It had. long been suspected that the
                    colony had been indulging in a course of legislation, the tendency of which,
                    says Mr Geoghegan, the under-secretary to the department of agriculture in the
                    Government of India, was “towards reducing the Indian labourer to a more
                    complete state of dependence upon the planter, and towards driving him into
                    indentures, a free labour market being both directly and indirectly
                    discouraged.” In 1871, acting on a petition presented by Μ. Adolph de Plevitz, a
                    resident in the colony, who loudly denounced this injustice, the governor, Sir
                    Arthur Gordon, appointed a police inquiry commission to investigate the matter;
                    and thereafter a royal commission was appointed at the request of the planters,
                    and its report was presented to the Imperial Parliament in 1875. The
                    investigation showed that the treatment experienced by the coolies was extremely
                    unsatisfactory, and that in many respects they were too much in the power of the
                    planters.</p>
                <p>With reference to the treatment of the coolie in foreign colonies it is more
                    difficult to obtain the necessary information. In Cuba the Chinese labourers
                    were subjected to such scandalous ill-usage that the Spanish Government was
                    forced to interfere, especially when it was found the Chinese were beginning to
                    take part with the insurgents. In 1871 a royal decree was issued suspending the
                    importation of coolies to the colony, and giving power to the Government to give
                    return passages to all who had finished their contracts and were not willing to
                    re-engage. The decree, however, has been ignored. It is well known that rather
                    than enter into another contract the Chinaman will leave the island. But then
                    the Cubans desire him to remain so that a permanent labouring class may be
                    created.</p>
                <p>In many of the French colonies Indian labourers are imported, there being a
                    convention between the Governments of France and India which admits of this
                    being done. There, it is feared, the coolie is the victim of abuses and
                    oppression which, happening as they do in foreign dominions, are not easily
                    redressed. In Cayenne there is reason to believe the mortality amongst the
                    coolies who labour in the gold mines is abnormally high; it is said that more
                    than half the Indians imported “cannot be accounted for.” In Réunion,
                    Guadaloupe, and Martinique they are said to be systematically over-worked; and
                    according to Mr Geoghegan there seems to be a disposition in Réunion to prevent
                    their having free access to the British consul when they have occasion to claim
                    his protection. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. wi.)</hi></p>
