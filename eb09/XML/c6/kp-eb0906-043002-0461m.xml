                    Westminster the First it was ordered that none but lawful and discreet knights
                    should be chosen as coroners, and in one instance a person was actually removed
                    from office for insufficiency of estate. Lands to the value of £20 per annum
                    (the qualification for knighthood) were afterwards deemed sufficient to satisfy
                    the requirements as to estate which ought to be insisted on in the case of a
                    coroner. The complaint of Blackstone shows the transition of the office from its
                    original dignified and honorary character to a paid appointment in the public
                    service. “Now, indeed, through the culpable neglect of gentlemen of property,
                    this office has been suffered to fall into disrepute, and get into low and
                    indigent hands; so that, althouglι formerly no coroners would condescend to be
                    paid for serving their country, and they were by the aforesaid Statute of
                    Westminster expressly forbidden to take a reward, under pain of a great
                    forfeiture to the king; yet for many years past they have only desired to be
                    chosen for their perquisites; being allowed fees for their attendance by the
                    statute 3 Henry VII. c. 1, which Sir Edward Coke complains of heavily; though
                    since his time those fees have been much enlarged.” The mercenary character of
                    the office, thus deprecated by Coke and Blackstone, is now firmly established,
                    without, however (it need hardly be said), affording the slightest ground for
                    such reflections as the above. The coroner is in fact a public officer, and like
                    other public officers receives payment for his services. The person appointed is
                    almost invariably a qualified legal or medical practitioner, the duties of the
                    office being supposed to require some acquaintance with the learning of both of
                    these professions. The property qualification appears to be virtually dispensed
                    with, the county being liable for any penalties that may be incurred by the
                    coroner. The appointment is held for life, but is vacated by the holder being
                    made sheriff. He may also be removed by the writ <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">coronatore exonerando,</hi> for sufficient cause assigned, as, for
                    instance, that he is engaged in other business, or incapacitated by old age or
                    sickness, &amp;c. By 23 and 24 Vict. c. 116, the lord chancellor may remove .any
                    coroner for “inability or misbehaviour in his office.” <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0462-0431"/> The coroner is primarily an officer of the
                    county, elected by the freeholders. In certain liberties and franchises, the
                    appointment is made by the Crown, or lords holding a charter from the Crown. By
                    the Municipal Corporations Act, in any borough having a separate
                    quarter-sessions the council may appoint a coroner; in other boroughs the
                    coroner for the county has jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>The remuneration of the county coroner is now regulated by the Act 23 and 24
                    Vict. c. 116 above mentioned. The system of payment by fees, established by an
                    earlier Act of the same reign, is abolished, and payment is to be made by salary
                    calculated on the average amount of the fees, mileage, and allowances usually
                    received by the coroner for a period of five years, and the calculation is to be
                    revised every five years. The home secretary is to decide between the coroner
                    and the justices when they cannot agree. Borough coroners under the Municipal
                    Corporations Act are to be paid by fees.</p>
                <p>The duties of the office are ascertained by the 4 Edward I. st. 2 :—“A coroner of
                    our lord the king ought to inquire of these things, first, when coroners are
                    commanded by the king’s bailiffs or by thè honest men of the county, they shall
                    go to the places where any be slain, or suddenly dead or wounded, or where
                    houses are broken, or where treasure is said to be found, and shall forthwith
                    command four of the next towns, or five, or six, to appear before him in such a
                    place; and when they are come thither, the coroner upon the oath of them shall
                    inquire in this manner, that is, to wit, if it'concerns a man slain, if they
                    know when the person was slain, whether it were in any house, field, bed,
                    tavern, or company, and if any, and who, were there, &lt;tc. It shall also be
                    inquired if the dead person were known, or else a stranger, and where he lay the
                    night before. And if any person is said to be guilty of the murder, the coroner
                    shall go to their house and inquire what goods they have, &amp;c.” Similar
                    directions are given for cases of persons found drowned or suddenly dead, for
                    attachment of criminals in cases of violence, &amp;c. It is the duty of the
                    township to give notice of violent or sudden death to the coroner; and the
                    inquisition is held before him and a jury of not less than twelve persons,
                    constituting a court of record. Their charge is to inquire how the party came by
                    his death. The inquisition must be <hi rend="italic">super visum corporis;</hi>
                    if the body be not recovered, the coroner can only sit in virtue of a special
                    commission. By 6 and 7 Vict. c. 12, it was provided (in remedy of the
                    inconveniences of the common law) that the coroner only within whose
                    jurisdiction the body shall be lying dead, shall hold the inquest, although the
                    cause of death may have happened somewhere out of his jurisdiction. And in the
                    case of any body found dead in the sea, &amp;c., the inquest, in the absence of
                    a deputy coroner for the admiralty, shall be held by the coroner of the place
                    where the body is first brought to land.</p>
                <p>At the inquest the evidence is taken on oath, and the Crown or any party
                    suspected may tender evidence. The medical man attending the deceased, if any,
                    may be ordered to attend, and the coroner may order a <hi rend="italic">post
                    mortem</hi> examination. If the jury are not satisfied they may name any
                    properly-qualified practitioner, who shall be required to attend and give
                    evidence, or make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination. The verdict
                    must be that of twelve at least of the jury. If any person is found guilty of
                    murder or other homicide the coroner shall commit him to prison for trial; he
                    shall also certify the material evidence to the court, and bind over the proper
                    persons to prosecute or to give evidence at the trial. He may in his discretion
                    accept bail for a person found guilty of manslaughter. Since the abolition of
                    public executions, the coroner is required to hold an inquest on the body of any
                    criminal, on whom sentence of death has been carried into effect. The question
                    of reopening the coroner’s inquests after verdict given was discussed in a
                    recent case. The Queen’s Bench, on a suggestion on the part of the Crown that
                    there was a probability of fixing the suspected crime by further inquisition,
                    ordered the verdict to be quashed and a new inquest to be held.</p>
                <p>There has been of late years nmeh discussion on the subject of the coroner’s
                    office, and legislation at no distant timemay be expected. The points on which
                    reform is generally asked for may be briefly indicated. It is desirable that the
                    qualification for the office should be fixed, and that it should be a legal and
                    not a medical qualification. The duties of the office are mainly judicial; such
                    medical information as may be necessary can be had from experts; while of course
                    a knowledge of the technical rules of evidence is essential to the efficient
                    discharge of the coroner’s duties. Again, that the election to a judicial
                    office, wholly unpolitical in character, should be by vote of the freeholders of
                    the county is generally felt to be an anomaly. A county coroner recently
                    declared that the expense of contesting the county amounted, in his own case, to
                    several-thousand pounds. Payment, depending directly or indirectly on fees, also
                    produces unfortunate results. It leads occasionally to disputes between the
                    coroners and the justices, and exposes the former to the suspicion of holding
                    unnecessary inquests for the sake of increasing their income. I n any
                    circumstances the propriety of holding an inquest may be a question of great
                    delicacy, and a slight mistake on either side may subject the officer to
                    unmerited obloquy. In some cases the present state of the law involves the great
                    evil of too much inquiry. Besides the coroner’s inquest there are, in cases of a
                    criminal character, the public examination before a magistrate, and the private
                    examination by the grand jury. But it may also happen that not merely one but
                    two or more inquests may be held in the same matter. In the case of a railway
                    accident or a collision at sea, the victims may die in different jurisdictions,
                    and if there is a suspicion of criminal negligence, the accused party must
                    practically stand his trial several times over. He may even be acquitted by one
                    jury and condemned by another.</p>
                <p>There is no corresponding office in Scotland. (E. R. )</p>
