                    maritime customs and ordinances in the Catalan language, published at Barcelona
                    in the latter part of the 15th century. Its proper title is <hi rend="italic"

                    which was printed at Barcelona in 1494, is without a title-page or frontispiece,
                    but it is described by the above-mentioned title in the epistle dedicatory pre
                    fixed to the table of contents. The only known copy of this edition is preserved
                    in the National Library in Paris. The epistle dedicatory states that the work is
                    an amended version of the <hi rend="italic">Book of the Consulate,</hi> compiled
                    by Francis Celelles with the assistance of numerous shipmasters and merchants
                    well versed in maritime affairs. According to a statement made by Capmany in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Codigo de</hi><hi rend="italic">los</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Costumbras</hi><hi rend="italic">Maritimas</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Barcelona,</hi> published at Madrid in 1791, there was extant to his knowledge
                    in the last century a more ancient edition of the <hi rend="italic">Book of the
                    Consulate,</hi> printed in semi-Gothic characters, which he believed to be of a
                    date prior to 1484. This is the earliest period to which any historical record
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Book of the Consulate</hi> being in print can be traced
                    back. There are, however, two Catalan MSS. preserved in the National Library in
                    Paris, the earliest of which, being MS. Espagnol 124, contains the two first
                    treatises which are printed in the <hi rend="italic">Book of the Consulate</hi>
                    of 1494, and which are the most ancient portion of its contents, written in a
                    hand of the 14th century, on paper of that century. The subsequent parts of this
                    MS. are on paper of the 15th century, but there is no document of a date more
                    recent than 1436. The later of the two MSS., being MS. Espagnol 56, is written
                    throughout on paper of the 15th century, and in a hand of that century, and it
                    purports, from a certificate on the face of the last leaf, to have been executed
                    under the superintendence of Peter Thomas, a notary public, and the scribe of
                    the Consulate of the Sea at Barcelona.</p>
                <p>The edition of 1494, which is justly regarded as the <hi rend="italic">editio
                    princeps</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Book of the Consulate,</hi> contains, in
                    the first place, a code of procedure issued by the kings of Aragon for the
                    guidance of the courts of the consuls of the sea, in the second place, a
                    collection of ancient customs of the sea, and thirdly, a body of ordinances for
                    the government of cruisers of war. A colophon at the end of these ordinances
                    informs the readers that “the book commonly called the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    the Consulate</hi> ends here;” after which there follows a document known by the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">The Acceptations,</hi> which purports to record that
                    the previous chapters and ordinances had been approved by the Roman people in
                    the 11th century, and by various princes and peoples in the 12th and 13th
                    centuries. Capmany was the first person to question the authenticity of this
                    document in his <hi rend="italic">Memorias Historicas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sobre la Marina,</hi><hi rend="italic">&lt;fcc.,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Pardessus and other writers on maritime law have followed up the inquiry in the
                    present century, and have conclusively shown that the document, whatever may
                    have been its origin, has no proper reference to the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    the Consulate,</hi> and is, in fact, of no historical value whatsoever. The
                    paging of the edition of 1494 ceases with this document, at the end of which is
                    the printer’s colophon, reciting that “the work was completed on 14th July 1494,
                    at Barcelona, by Pere Posa, priest and printer.” The remainder of the volume
                    consists of what may be regarded as an appendix to the original <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of the Consulate.</hi> This appendix contains various
                    maritime ordinances of the kings of Aragon and of the councillors of the city of
                    Barcelona, ranging over a period from 1340 to 1484. It is printed apparently in
                    the same type with the preceding part of the volume. The original <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of the Consulate,</hi> coupled with this appendix,
                    constitutes tne work which has obtained general circulation <pb break="no"

                    Castilian, the Italian, and the French languages. The Italian translation,
                    printed at Venice in 1549 by Jean Baptista Pedrezano, was the version which
                    obtained the largest circulation in the north of Europe, and led many jurists to
                    suppose the work to have been of Italian origin. In the next following century
                    the work was translated into Dutch by Westerven, and into German by Engelbrecht,
                    and it is also said to have been translated into Latin. Au excellent translation
