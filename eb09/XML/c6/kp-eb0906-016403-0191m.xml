                    Pauline epistles may be chronologically arranged,—a group which occupies a
                    midway position between the letters sent to Corinth, Galatia, and Rome, in the
                    apostle’s third missionary journey, and the letters known as the Pastoral
                    Epistles. By similarity of language and matter the epistle to the Colossians is
                    intimately connected with that to the Ephesians; and the notices of St Paul’s
                    companions, and of Onesimus and Archippus, which occur in the epistle to
                    Philemon, show that this last epistle was also written, and sent at the same
                    time as the other two. The epistle to the Philippians belongs to the same group,
                    and the most probable view is that it was from Rome that all four were written
                    by Paul, “the prisoner of Jesus Christ” (comp. Philem. 1; Col. iv. 10, 18; Eph.
                    iii. 1, iv. 1, vi. 20; Phil, i. 13, 14, iv. 22). Some critics—among whom may be
                    mentioned Schulz, Böttger, Thiersch, Meyer, and Reuss, whose opinion is strongly
                    advocated by De Pressensé in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire des Trois</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Premiers</hi><hi rend="italic">Siècles</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> contend that at least three of the epistles were written from Caesarea;
                    but the traditional view that all four were written from Rome is supported by
                    most modern writers, and is freest from difficulties. The date of the epistle to
                    the Colossians may be placed about 62 or 63 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    Assuming for the present its genuineness, we may gather from the contents of the
                    epistle itself its occasion and object. Epaphras, who is spoken of in high terms
                    by the apostle, and may with some probability be considered the founder of the
                    church at Colossae (i. 7), has brought tidings to St Paul which make him anxious
                    concerning the Christians in Colossae and its neighbourhood (ii. 1, iv. 13).
                    False teachers are there endeavouring to beguile them with plausible talk (ii.
                    4), and Paul, as a minister of the gospel earnestly labouring in the cause of
                    proclaiming Christ to the nations (i. 24-29), feels his heart called out towards
                    those whose faith is being insidiously assailed, although he is absent from
                    them, and has never personally visited Colossae or Laodicea (ii. 1). He
                    accordingly writes an epistle the polemical purport of which is patent. Paul’s
                    polemic, however, is no mere negative protest. He sets up, as against the “false
                    philosophy” which he so strenuously repudiates (ii. 8), a “theological
                    conception of the person of Christ,” which strikes at the root of all vain
                    speculations concerning the unseen world, and shows that the work of
                    reconciliation effected by Christ is complete, so that in Him Christians are to
                    see the one Mediator through whom God is to be known, approached, served. The
                    latter part of the epistle consists of various practical exhortations, both
                    general and specific; and it closes with several notices of a personal
                    character. Tychicus was the bearer of this letter (iv. 7), as he was also of
                    that known as the epistle to the Ephesians, which by some critics is identified
                    with “the letter from Laodicea’ (iv. 16).</p>
                <p>But are these letters genuine î There is no historical ground for doubting the
                    Pauline authorship, or for the theory which has been advanced that the two
                    epistles are inventions of a later age, or for the supposition that, whilst one
                    of them is genuine, the other is made up of materials derived from that one
                    which was really written by St Paul. The fact that opponents of the genuineness
                    of the letters do not agree as to which was the original is significant.
                    Mayerhoff thinks, indeed, both epistles to be spurious, but considers that the
                    epistle to the Colossians was compiled from that to the Ephesians; while De
                    Wette holds the epistle to the Ephesians to be a “verbose enlargement” of that
                    to the Colossians, and advocates the genuineness of the latter. The opponents of
                    the Pauline authorship rest mainly on three lines of argument, <hi rend="italic"
                    >viz.,</hi> the similarity of the two epistles, the peculiarity of their
                    contents, and peculiarities of style.</p>
                <p>The objection founded on the similarity of the language and matter of the two
                    epistles is one that cannot be substantiated. For whilst there are striking
                    resemblances, there are no less striking differences; and whilst the
                    resemblances can be very naturally accounted for by the contemporaneousness of
                    the letters, the differences are so markedly in accordance with the apparent
                    designs of the separate letters,—that to the Colossians being primarily polemic,
                    and that to the Ephesians being of a mystic and devotional character,—that we
                    may fairly use of each epistle the words applied by Meyer to the epistle to the
                    Colossians,—“The supposed forgery of such an epistle would be far more
                    marvellous and inexplicable than its genuineness.”</p>
                <p>Another objection brought forward is that in these epistles we have sentiments
                    that savour of heresies later than the apostolic age. This objection seems to be
                    based upon very superficial grounds, and to spring from prejudice rather than
                    from research. What definite ground is there for asserting that “Gnostic and
                    Montanist” sentiments are to be found in these epistles? While certain false
                    teachings and tendencies are alluded to, which evidently go beyond the more
                    naked Pharisaic Judaism controverted in the epistle to the Galatians, nothing
                    can be produced to show that the heretical teaching animadverted upon in the
                    epistle to the Colossians, or even in the later epistles of Paul to Timothy and
                    Titus, is <hi rend="italic">Gnosticism</hi> in the sense in which that term is
                    applied to later systematic theosophies and cosmologies, such as those of
                    Basilides and Valentinus. And would it not be natural, as Neander points out, to
                    postulate, even if we had no records to testify to the fact.</p>

                <p>the existence of certain transitional links between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gnosis</hi> of the 2d century and the earlier stages of the apostolic
                    preaching? Such links are found in the <hi rend="italic">incipient</hi>
                    Gnosticism, if so it is to be called, of which we have traces in the epistles of
                    the imprisonment and the subsequent Pastoral Epistles.</p>
                <p>A third objection has been made to the genuineness of the epistle to the
                    Colossians, as well as to the Ephesian epistle, on the ground of the peculiarity
                    of their style and of certain terms used in them, some of which are asserted to
                    be technical terms, as <hi rend="italic">aeon,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pleroma,</hi><hi rend="italic">dec.,</hi> and others are words not elsewhere
                    used in the Pauline writings. The answer to this objection is that the peculiar
                    terms are not used in the sense which they acquired in heretical writings of a
                    later period, and that the unusual words are to be attributed partly to the
                    nature of the subject and partly to the disposition of the writer’s mind at the
                    time. If, indeed, we are to condemn any writing of an author for containing
                    peculiarities not exhibited in other writings of the same author, the questions
                    arise, whence are we to take our standard of judgment, or how are we to know in
                    what cases we should apply so vague a critical canon <hi rend="italic">ì</hi>
                    Bleek say?, sensibly enough, in view of this line of objection, “We do not for a
                    moment deny that the epistle to the Colossians contains much which is peculiar
                    to itself; but its contents, such as they are, do not tell against its coming
                    from the same author as the other epistles of St Paul, for even those which Baur
                    allows to be genuine contain much that is distinctive and peculiar, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Galatians as compared with the Corinthians, and 2
                    Corinthians as compared with 1 Corinthians.” The fact is that in the Tübingen
                    school “subjective criticism” has run to riot. The phenomena to be investigated
                    are interpreted according to a preconceived theory, rather than fairly looked
                    at, examined, and explained. The testimony of the early church to the Colossian
                    and Ephesian letters is unexceptionable. In the case of the epistle to the
                    Colossians, there are indications of its recognition in allusions by Justin
                    Martyr and Theophilus of Antioch; it occurs in the Muratorian canon <hi
                    rend="italic">(fore.</hi> 170 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d);</hi> it is cited by
                    Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and Origen; Eusebius places it
                    among the “acknowledged” books of the apostolical writings; and it occurs in
                    Marcion’s list, as given by Epiphanius. Nor is there anything in the epistle
                    itself that is out of accordance with the circumstances of the apostle Paul, or
                    the condition of the Asiatic churches in the seventh decade of the 1st
                    century.</p>
                <p>We must now briefly notice the character of the teaching against which St Paul
                    directed the controversial portion of the epistle to the Colossians (ii. 4-23).
                    His warnings are against a philosophy which is vain and fallacious; against a
                    system of multiplied religious observances and distinctions of meats; against an
                    arbitrary system of angel-worship; and against certain rigorous rules of
                    asceticism. The basis of this alien teaching was unmistakably Judaic, but the
                    Judäizing effort was of a mystic and ascetic type; and it is not unreasonable to
                    see in the theosophical speculations and ascetic ordinances, indicated in St
                    Paul’s picture of the dangers which beset the Colossian Christians, an admixture
                    of Jewish and Oriental elements. Professor Lightfoot has shown that Oriental
                    notions concerning the evil of matter and the need of rigid abstinence, together
                    with “an esoteric doctrine relating to angelic beings” and a tendency to sun
                    worship, appear in Essenism, which he suggests might be called Gnostic Judaism.
                    The Essene side of Judaism was doubtless represented among the Jews who were
                    settled in, or journeyed to and from, various places in Asia Minor; and all
                    mystic and ascetic ideas would find a congenial soil in Phrygia. The teaching
                    and tendencies alluded to in the epistle to the Colossians, and subsequently in
                    the Pastoral Epistles, form the intermediate link between the “Gnostic Judaism”
                    of the Essenes and teachers allied to them and the “Judaizing Gnosticism” of the
                    2d century.</p>
                <p>The question whether Paul himself planted the church at Colossae is one of minor
                    importance, which has been much discussed by commentators. Lardner argues
                    elaborately in favour of a visit by Paul to Colossae and Laodicea. He bases his
                    view upon a passage cited from Tlιeodoret, in which ch. ii. I is interpreted so
                    as to distinguish between the Colossians and Laodiceans on the one side and the
                    “as many as had not seen Paul’s face” on the other. This view has been
                    controverted in detail by Davidson, but is advocated by Wordsworth. Bleek
                    mentions Schulz, Wiggers, and others as following Theodoret, but he takes the
                    contrary view himself, as do also Alford, Conybeare and Howson, and Lightfoot.
                    The last-named commentator says that Theodoret’s interpretation is “opposed
                    alike to grammatical and logical considerations.”</p>
                <p>Another disputable though not very important point is whether the Ephesian or the
                    Colossian letter was written first. Critics are &lt;Jivided, and it is somewhat
                    difficult to gather from a comparison of the epistles which view is most
                    probable. We are inclined to favour the view that the briefer, more
                    controversial, and in some respects more vigorous letter was written first, and
                    was followed by the fuller and more mystic one. It has been said that this
                    epistle is characterized by a “ruggedness of expression and want of finish that
                    borders on obscurity” (Lightfoot), and it has been suggested that the absence of
                    personal connection on St Paul’s part with the Colossian church might partially
                    account for “the diminished fluency of this letter,” as compared with other and
                    earlier ones. We do not think this explanation a satisfactory one. The
                    “ruggedness” should rather be attributed to the intensity of feeling wherewith
                    the apostle, confined as he was in his far-off place of imprisonment, threw
                    himself into the controversy with the false teachers,—persons whom he must have
                    regarded as among the “grievous wolves,” of whom he had forewarned the elders at
                    Miletus some few years previously (Acts XX. 29, 30), men who should “arise out
                    of the Christian community itself, and speak perverse things to draw men after
                    them.” This explanation is somewhat corroborated by what Alford points out,
                    viz., that the majority of peculiar expressions in the epistle occur in the
                    second chapter. And Professor Lightfoot himself adds— “No epistle of St Paul is
                    more vigorous in conception or more instinct with meaning. It is the very
                    compression of thoughts which creates the difficulty. If there is a want of
                    fluency there is no want of force. Feebleness is the last charge which can be
                    brought against this epistle.”</p>
                <p>The value of this epistle to the church historian, to the Christian theologian,
                    and to any one who wishes fairly to estimate the “philosophic” bearings of
                    Christian dogma is very great. A commentator of the 17th century, H. Suicer,
                    mentioned by Walch in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theologica,</hi> calls the epistle to the Colossians <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Authorities for what has been said, and references to further literature upon the
                    subject, may be found in “Introductions,” such as those by Davidson and Bleek,
                    and in “Prolegomena” of commentators, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Alford,
                    Wordsworth, and Braune in Lange’s <hi rend="italic">Bibehcerk,</hi> a treasury
                    of information made accessible to English readers in Dr Schaff’s edition,
                    published by T. &amp; T. Clark. Frequent reference has been made in the course
                    of this article to the recent very valuable commentary of Professor Lightfoot.
                    In addition to the exegetical notes, he gives us thorough dissertations on “the
                    churches of the Lycus,” the “Colossian heresy,” and “the Essenes.” There is also
                    a digest <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n193/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0193-0166"/> of the principal various readings, containing an
                    ingenious conjecture as to the original reading in chap. ii. 18. Attention is
                    drawn to the fact that the epistles to the Ephesians and the Colossians, alone
                    among the Pauline epistles, are exposed to those “harmonizing tendencies” in
                    transcribers which have had such an influence on the text of the gospels.
                    Professor Lightfoot deals, also, in a most exhaustive manner, with the subject
                    of the apocryphal letter to the Laodiceans (connected with Col. iv. 16), which
                    appears in a considerable number of MSS. of the New Testament, and shows it to
                    be “a cento of Pauline phrases strung together without any definite connection
                    or any clear object.” Paley, in his <hi rend="italic">llorae Paulinae,</hi> has
                    a very satisfactory section on the similarity of the epistles to the Ephesians
                    and the Colossians. On the character of the heretical tendencies in Asia Minor
                    the general reader will find all requisite information in Neander, <hi

                    Notices of Gnosticism in the New Testament. Both Neander and Pressensé draw
                    attention to the arbitrary and unsound theorizing of the Tübingen school in
                    respect to the group to which the epistle to the Colossians belongs, (w. s.
                    s.)</p>
