                    trader. His mother, Barbel Watzelrode, was the daughter of a well-to-do
                    merchant. The education of Nicolaus, whose father died early, was undertaken by
                    his uncle Lukas Watzelrode, subsequently (1489) bishop of Enneland. After a
                    course of instruction at the school in Thorn, he entered the university of
                    Cracow in 1491, and during four years studied mathematical science under Albert
                    Brudzewski, devoting his spare time to painting. At the age of twenty-three he
                    repaired to Bologna, and attended the lectures of Dominico Maria Novarra,
                    professor of astronomy there. He next spent some years at Padua, where, in
                    addition to mathematics and astronomy, he applied himself to medicine, in which,
                    in 1499, he took the degree of doctor. In 1500 he was at Rome, enjoying the
                    friendship of the astronomer Regiomontanus, and fulfilling with distinction the
                    duties of a chair of mathematics. Copernicus had already been for some time a
                    member of the chapter of Frauenburg, at which place he appears to have taken up
                    his abode in 1503. His time was now engaged in clerical work, in giving
                    gratuitous medical aid to the poor, and, though with but a slender stock of
                    instruments, in the prosecution of his favourite studies. The house which he
                    occupied at Allenstein is still to be seen, with the perforations which he made
                    in the walls of his chamber in order to observe the passage of the stars across
                    the meridian; also the remains of an hydraulic machine, similar to that at
                    Marly, which he constructed for the purpose of raising the water of a rivulet
                    for the supply of Frauenburg.</p>
                <p>By his bishop and fellow-canons Copernicus was employed in defending their rights
                    and privileges against the encroachments of the Teutonic knights; and when sent
                    as a deputy to the diet of Grodno, he busied himself in considering the means of
                    improving the corrupt coinage, and wrote a paper on that subject, which was
                    placed among the archives of the diet. Copernicus sought by a comparative study
                    of the various astronomical systems of the ancients to evolve from them a single
                    system, at once simple and consistent. According to the hypothesis of the
                    ancient Egyptians, Mercury and Venus revolved round the sun, which itself, with
                    Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, moved round the earth. Apollonius of Perga chose the
                    sun as the common centre of all the planetary motions, but held that, like the
                    moon, it turned round about the earth. The principal Pythagorean philosophers,
                    on the other hand, regarded the sun as the centre of the universe, about which
                    the earth performed a circuit. Nicetas, Heraclides, and others assigned a
                    central position to the earth, but supposed it to have a motion of rotation
                    round its axis, which produced the phenomena of the rising and setting of the
                    stars, and the alternations of day and night. Philolaus removed the earth from
                    the centre of his system, and conceived it to have not only an axial rotation,
                    but also an independent annual revolution round the sun. From the various
                    ill-founded and unshapely theories of his predecessors Copernicus obtained the
                    material for erecting a solid and imposing structure—the system with which his
                    name is connected. This was expounded in a treatise entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Orbium Coelestium Revolutionibus Libri VI.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> the preparation of which occupied its author from about
                    1507 to 1530. This work Copernicus long delayed bringing before the world, being
                    content to defer for a while the popular outcry against himself, which, as a
                    setter-forth of truths hitherto unknown to science and as an impugner of the
                    rights of time-honoured dogmatism, he must be prepared to endure. At length,
                    however, yielding to the importunities of his friends, he permitted the
                    publication of the book, which he dedicated to Pope Paul III.; in order, as he
                    says, that he might not be accused of seeking to shun the judgment of
                    enlightened men, and that the authority of his Holiness, if he approved of it,
                    might protect him from the baleful tooth of calumny.</p>
                <p>The work was printed at Nuremberg, under the superintendence of Rheticus, one of
                    the disciples of Copernicus. The impression had just been completed, when
                    Copernicus, who had all his life enjoyed perfect health, was attacked with
                    dysentery, followed almost immediately by a paralysis of the right side, with
                    loss of memory, and obscuration of the understanding. For some time he lingered,
                    and on the day of his death, only a few hours before he expired, a copy of his
                    work sent by Rheticus arrived, and was placed in his hands. He touched it, and
                    seemed conscious what it was; but after regarding it for an instant, he relapsed
                    into a state of insensibility, which soon terminated in death. He died on the
                    24th May 1543, at the age of seventy. His tomb, which is not distinguished from
                    that of the other canons of Frauenburg, was in 1581 adorned with a Latin epitaph
                    by the Polish Bishop Cromer. In 1830 a statue of Copernicus, by Thorwaldsen, was
                    placed in the Casimir Palace at Warsaw; and in 1853 another monu ment to him, by
                    Tieck, was erected at Thorn.</p>
                <p>The first formal exposition of the theories of Copernicus in contradistinction to
                    the notions which had hitherto prevailed, was a letter published by Rheticus,
