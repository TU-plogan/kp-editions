                    between man and man, unless when the Court of Chancery assumes jurisdiction; and
                    with local or customary law, as the general law for the whole realm, tolerating
                    variations in certain districts and under certain conditions. It is also
                    sometimes contrasted with civil, or canon, or international law, which are
                    foreign systems recognized in certain special courts only and within limits
                    defined by the common law. As against all these contrasted kinds of law, it may
                    be described broadly as the universal law of the realm, which applies wherever
                    they have not been introduced, and which is supposed to have a principle for
                    every possible case. Occasionally, it would appear to be used in a sense which
                    would exclude the law developed by at all events the more recent decisions of
                    the courts.</p>
                <p>Blackstone divides the civil law of England into <hi rend="italic">lex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">scripta,</hi> or statute law, and <hi rend="italic">lex
                    non</hi><hi rend="italic">scripta,</hi> or common law. The latter, he says,
                    consists of (I) general customs, which are the common law strictly so called,
                    (2) particular customs prevailing in certain districts, and (3) laws used in
                    particular courts. The first is the law by which “proceedings and determinations
                    in the king’s ordinary courts of justice are guided and directed.” That the
                    eldest son alone is heir to his ancestor, that a deed is of no validity unless
                    sealed and delivered, that wills shall be construed more favourably and deeds
                    more strictly, are examples of common law doctrines, “not set down in any
                    written statute or ordinance, but depending on immemorial usage for their
                    support.” The validity of these usages is to be determined by the judges—“the
                    depositaries of the law, the living oracles who must decide in all cases of
                    doubt, and who are bound by an oath to decide according to the law of the land.”
                    Thei r judgments are preserved as records, and “it is an established rule to
                    abide by former precedents where the same points come again in litigation.” The
                    extraordinary deference paid to precedents is the source of the most striking
                    peculiarities of the English common law. .There can be little doubt that it was
                    the rigid adherence of the common law courts to established precedent which
                    caused the rise of an independent tribunal administering justice on more
                    equitable principles—the tribunal of the chancellor, the Court of Chancery. And
                    the common law courts—the Queen’s Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer—have
                    always, as compared with the Court of Chancery, been distinguished for a certain
                    narrowness and technicality of reasoning. At the same time the common law has
                    never been a fixed or rigid system. In the application of old precedents to the
                    changing circumstances of society, and in the development of new principles to
                    meet new cases, the common Jaw courts have displayed an immense amount of
                    subtlety and ingenuity and a great deal of sound sense. The continuity of the
                    system is not less remarkable than its elasticity. Two great defects of form
                    disfigure the English law. The first is the separation of common law and equity.
                    The second is the overwhelming mass of precedents in which the law is embedded.
                    The recent Judicature Act is an attempt to remedy the first by merging the
                    jurisdiction of all the courts in one supreme court, and causing equitable
                    principles to prevail over those of the common law where they differ. The second
                    can only be removed by some well-conceived scheme of the nature of a code or
                    digest (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Code).</hi> The English common law may be
                    described as a pre-eminently national system. Based on Saxon customs, moulded by
                    Norman lawyers, and jealous of foreign systems, it is, as Bacon says, as mixed
                    as our language and as truly national.</p>
