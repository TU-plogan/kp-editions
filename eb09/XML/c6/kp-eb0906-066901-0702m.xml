                    unravelling of the writing is called deciphering. Cryptography having become a
                    distinct art, Bacon classed it (under the name <hi rend="italic">ciphers)</hi>
                    as a part of grammar. Secret modes of communication have been in use from the
                    earliest times. The Lacedemonians, according to Plutarch, had a method which has
                    been called the <hi rend="italic">scytale,</hi> from the staff <hi rend="italic"
                    >(σκvτaλη)</hi> employed in constructing and deciphering the message. When the
                    Spartan ephors wished to forward their orders to their commanders abroad, they
                    wound slantwise a narrow strip of parchment upon the σκυταλy so that the edges
                    met close together, and the message was then added in such a way that the centre
                    of the line of writing was on the edges of the parchment. When unwound the
                    scroll consisted of broken letters; and in that condition it was despatched to
                    its destination, the general to whose hands it came deciphering it by means of a
                    <hi rend="italic">σκvτaλη</hi> exactly corresponding to that used by the ephors.
                    Polybius has enumerated other methods of cryptð-graphy.</p>
                <p>The art was in use also amongst the Romans. Upon the revival of letters methods
                    of secret correspondence were introduced into private business, diplomacy,
                    plots, &lt;fcc.; and as the study of this art has always presented attractions
                    to the ingenious, a curious body of literature has been the result.</p>
                <p>John Trithemius, the abbot of Spanheim, was the first important writer on
                    cryptography. His <hi rend="italic">Poligraphia,</hi> published in 1500, has
                    passed through many editions, and has supplied the basis upon which subsequent
                    writers have worked. It was begun at the desire of the duke of Bavaria; <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n703/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0703-0670"/> but Trithemius did not at first intend to publish
                    it, on the ground that it would be injurious to public interests. The next
                    treatises of importance were those of John Baptist Porta, a Neapolitan
                    mathematician, who wrote <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >furtivis</hi><hi rend="italic">literarum</hi><hi rend="italic">notis,</hi>
                    1563; and of Blaise de Vigenere, whose <hi rend="italic">Traité des
                    chiffres</hi> appeared in Paris, 1587. Lord Verulam proposed an ingenious system
                    of cryptography on the plan of what is called the double cipher; but while thus
                    lending to the art the influence of his great name, he gave an intimation as to
                    the general opinion formed of it and as to the classes of men who used it. For
                    when prosecuting the earl of Somerset in the matter of the poisoning of
                    Overbury, he urged it as an aggravation of the crime that the earl and Overbury
                    “had cyphers and jargons for the king and queen and all the great men,—things
                    seldom used but either by princes and their ambassadors and ministers, or by
                    such as work or practise against or, at least, upon princes.” Other eminent
                    Englishmen were afterwards connected with the art. John Wilkins, subsequently
                    bishop of Chester, published in 1641 an anonymous treatise entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Mercury, or The Secret and Swift Messenger,—</hi> a small but
                    comprehensive work on the subject, and a timely gift to the diplomatists and
                    leaders of the civil war. The deciphering of many of the royalist papers of that
                    period, such as the letters that fell into the hands of the Parliament at the
                    battle of Naseby, has by Henry Stubbe been charged on the celebrated
                    mathematican Dr John Wallis <hi rend="italic">(Athen.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Oxon.,</hi> iii. 1072), whose connection with the subject of cipher-writing is
                    referred to by himself in the Oxford edition of his mathematical works, 1689,
                    page 659; as also by John Davys. Dr Wallis elsewhere states that this art,
                    formerly scarcely known to any but the secretaries of princes, &lt;fcc., had
                    grown very common and familiar during the civil commotions, “so that now there
                    is scarce a person of quality but is more or less acquainted with it, and doth,
                    as there is occasion, make use of it.” Subsequent writers on the subject are
                    John Falconer <hi rend="italic">(Cryptomenysis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Patefacta),</hi> 1685; John Davys <hi rend="italic">(An Essay on the Art of

                    >(Cours Diplomatique),</hi> 1801 (a fourth edition of which appeared in 1851).
                    Perhaps the best modern work on this subject is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kryptographik</hi> of J. L. Kliiber (Tübingen, 1809), who was drawn into the
                    investigation by inclination and official circumstances. In this work the
                    different methods of cryptography are classified. Amongst others of lesser merit
                    who have treated on this art, may be named Gustavus Selenus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(iae.,</hi> Augustus, duke of Brunswick), 1624; Cospi, translated by Niceron in
                    1641; the marquis of Worcester, 1659; Kircher, 1663; Schott, 1665; Hiller, 1682;
                    Comiers, 1690; Baring, 1737; Conrad, 1739, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Schemes of cryptography are endless in their variety. Bacon lays down the
                    following as the “virtues” to be looked for in them :—“that they be not
                    laborious to write and read; that they be impossible to decipher; and, in some
                    cases, that they be without suspicion.” These principles are more or less
                    disregarded by all the modes that have been advanced, including that of Bacon
                    himself, which has been unduly extolled by his admirers as “one of the most
                    ingenious methods of writing in cypher, and the most difficult to be decyphered,
                    of any yet contrived” (Thicknesse, p. 13).</p>
                <p>The simplest and commonest of all the ciphers is that in which the writer selects
                    in place of the proper letters certain other letters in regular advance. This
                    method of transposition was used by Julius Caesar. He “per quartam elementorum
                    literam,” wrote <hi rend="italic">d</hi> for <hi rend="italic">a, e</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> and so on.</p>
                <p>There are instances of this arrangement in the Jewish rabbis, and even in the
                    sacred writers. An illustration of it occurs in Jeremiah (xxv. 26), where the
                    prophet, to conceal the meaning of his prediction from all but the initiated,
                    writes <hi rend="italic">Sheshach</hi> instead of Babel (Babylon), the place
                    meant; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in place of using the second and twelfth
                    letters of the Hebrew alphabet <hi rend="italic">(b, b,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >I)</hi> from the beginning, he wrote the second and twelfth <hi rend="italic"
                    >(sh, sh, ch)</hi> from the end. To this kind of cipher-writing Buxtorf gives
                    the name Athbash (from <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the first letter of the Hebrew
                    alphabet, and <hi rend="italic">th</hi> the last; <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the
                    second from the beginning, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the second from the
                    end). Another Jewish cabalism of like nature was called Albarn; of which an
                    example is in Isaiah vii. 6, where Tabeal is written for Remaliah. In its
                    adaptation to English this method of transposition, of which there are many
                    modifications, is comparatively easy to decipher. A rough key may be derived
                    from an examination of the respective quantities of letters in a typefounder’s
                    bill, or a printer’s “case.” The decipherer’s first business is to classify the
                    letters of the secret message in the order of their frequency. The letter that
                    occurs oftenest is e; and the next in order of frequency is <hi rend="italic"
                    >t.</hi> The following groups come after these, separated from each other by
                    degrees of decreasing recurrence:— <hi rend="italic">a, o, n,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">i;</hi><hi rend="italic">r,</hi><hi rend="italic">s, h;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d, I; c, w, u, m; f, y, g,</hi><hi rend="italic">p,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">b;</hi><hi rend="italic">v,^k</hi><hi rend="italic">; x, q, j,
                    z.</hi> All the single letters must be <hi rend="italic">a, I,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">0.</hi> Letters occurring together are <hi rend="italic">ee, oo,
                    ff, ll, ss,</hi> &amp;c. The commonest words of two letters are (roughly
                    arranged in the order of their frequency) <hi rend="italic">of, to, in, it, is,
                    be, he, by, or, as, at, an, so,</hi> Ac. The commonest words of three letters
                    are <hi rend="italic">the</hi> and <hi rend="italic">and</hi> (in great excess),
                    <hi rend="italic">for, are, but, all, not,</hi> Ac.; and of four letters— <hi
                    rend="italic">that, with, from, have, this, they,</hi> &amp;c. Familiarity with
                    the composition of the language will suggest numerous other points that are of
                    value to the decipherer. He may obtain other hints from Poe’s tale called <hi
                    rend="italic">The Gold Bug.</hi> As to messages in the Continental languages
                    constructed upon this system of transposition, rules for deciphering may be
                    derived from Breithaupt’s <hi rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >decifratoria,</hi> 1737, and other treatises.</p>
                <p>Bacon remarks that though ciphers were commonly in letters and alphabets yet they
                    might be in words. Upon this basis codes have been constructed, classified words
                    taken from dictionaries being made, to represent complete ideas. In recent years
                    such codes have been adapted by merchants and others to communications by
                    telegraph, and have served the purpose not only of keeping business affairs
                    private, but also of reducing the excessive cost of telegraphic messages to
                    distant markets. Obviously this class of ciphers presents greater difficulties
                    to the skill of the decipherer.</p>
                <p>Figures and other characters have been also used as letters; and with them ranges
                    of numerals have been combined as the representatives of syllables, parts of
                    words, words themselves, and complete phrases. Under this head must be placed
                    the despatches of Giovanni Michael, the Venetian ambassador to England in the
                    reign of Queen Mary,—documents which have only of late years been deciphered.
                    Many of the private letters and papers from the pen of Charles I. and his queen,
                    who were adepts in the use of ciphers, are of the same description. One of that
                    monarch’s letters, a document of considerable interest, consisting entirely of
                    numerals purposely complicated, was in 1858 deciphered by Professor Wheatstone,
                    the inventor of the ingenious crypto-machine, and printed by the Philobiblon
                    Society. Other letters of the like character have been published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">First Report of the Royal Commission on Historical
                    Manuscripts,</hi> 1870. In the second and subsequent reports of the same
                    commission, several keys to ciphers have been catalogued, which seem to refer
                    themselves to the methods of cryptography under <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n704/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0704-0671"/> notice. In this connection also should be
                    mentioned the “characters,” which the diarist Pepys drew up when clerk to Sir
                    George Downing and secretary to the earl of Sandwich and to the Admiralty, and
                    which are frequently mentioned in his journal. Pepys describes one of them as “a
                    great large character,” over which he spent much time, but which was at length
                    finished, 25th April 1660; “it being,” says he, “very handsomely done and a very
                    good one in itself, but that not truly alphabetical.”</p>
                <p>Shorthand marks and other arbitrary characters have also been largely imported
                    into cryptographic systems to represent both letters and words, but more
                    commonly the latter. This plan is said to have been first put into use by the
                    old Roman poet Ennius. It formed the basis of the method of Cicero’s freedman,
                    Tiro, who seems to have systematized the labours of his predecessors. A large
                    quantity of these characters have been engraved in Gruter’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inscriptiones.</hi> The correspondence of Charlemagne was in part made up of
                    marks of this nature. In Rees’s <hi rend="italic">Cyclopaedia</hi> specimens
                    were engraved of the cipher used by Cardinal Wolsey at the court of Vienna in
                    1524, of that used by Sir Thomhs Smith at Paris in 1563, and of that of Sir
                    Edward Stafford at Madrid in 1586; in all of which arbitrary marks are
                    introduced. The first English system of shorthand— Bright’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Characterie</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> 1588—almost belongs to the
                    same category of ciphers. A favourite system of Charles I., used by him during
                    the year 1646, was one made up of an alphabet of twenty-four letters, which were
                    represented by four simple strokes varied in length, slope, and position. This
                    alphabet is engraved in Clive’s <hi rend="italic">Linear System of
                    Shorthand,</hi> 1830, having been found amongst the royal manuscripts in the
                    British Museum. An interest attaches to this cipher from the fact that it was
                    employed in the well known letter addressed by the king to the earl of
                    Glamorgan, in which the former made concessions to the Roman Catholics of
                    Ireland.</p>
                <p>Complications have been introduced into ciphers by the employment of “dummy”
                    letters,—“nulls and insignificants,” as Bacon terms them. Other devices have
                    been introduced to perplex the decipherer, such as spelling words backwards,
                    making false divisions between words, &amp;c. The greatest security against the
                    decipherer has been found in the use of elaborate tables of letters, arranged in
                    the form of the multiplication table, the message being constructed by the aid
                    of preconcerted key-words. Details of the working of these ciphers may be found
                    in the treatises named in this article. The deciphering of them is one of the
                    most difficult of tasks. A method of this kind is explained in the Latin and
                    English lives of Dr John Barwick, whose correspondence with Hyde, afterwards
                    earl of Clarendon, was carried on in cryptography. In a letter dated 20th
                    February 1659-60, Hyde, alluding to the skill of his political opponents in
                    deciphering, says that “nobody needs to fear them, if they write carefully in
                    good cyphers.” In his next he allays his correspondent’s apprehensiveness as to
                    the deciphering of their letters.</p>
                <p>“I confess to you, as I am sure no copy could be gotten of any of my cyphers from
                    hence, so I did. not think it probable that they could be got on your side the
                    water. But I was as confident, till you tell me you believe it, that the devil
                    himself cannot decypher a letter that is well written, or find that 100 stands
                    for Sir H. Vane. I have heard of many of the pretenders to that skill, and have
                    spoken with some of them, but have found them all to be mountebanks; nor did I
                    ever hear that more of the King’s letters that were found at Naseby, than those
                    which they found decyphered, or found the cyphers in which they were writ, were
                    decyphered. And I very well remember that in the volume they published there was
                    much left in cypher which could not be understood, and which I believe they
                    would have explained if it had been in their power.”</p>
                <p>An excellent modification of the key-word principle was ¢onstructed by the late
                    Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort; it has been recently published in view of its
                    adaptation to telegrams and post-cards.</p>
                <p>Ciphers have been constructed on the principle of altering the places of the
                    letters without changing their powers. The message is first written
                    Chinese-wise, upward and downward, and the letters are then combined in given
