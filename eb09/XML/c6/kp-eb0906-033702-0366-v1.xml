                    (1789-1851), an American novelist, was born at Burlington, New Jersey, on the
                    15th September 1789. Reared in the wild country round the Otsego Lake, on the
                    yet unsettled estates of his father, a judge and member of Congress, he was sent
                    to school at Albany and at New Haven, and entered Yale College in his thirteenth
                    year, remaining for some time the youngest student on the rolls. Three years
                    afterwards he joined the United States navy; but after making a voyage or two in
                    a merchant vessel, to perfect himself in seamanship, and obtaining his
                    lieutenancy, he married and resigned his commission (1811). He settled for a
                    while at Westchester, the “Neutral Ground” of his earliest American romance, and
                    produced anonymously (1819) his first book, <hi rend="italic">Precaution,</hi> a
                    novel of the fashionable school. This was followed (1821) by <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Spy,</hi> which was very successful at the date of issue; <hi
                        rend="italic">The Pioneers,</hi> the first of the “Leatherstocking” series;
                    and <hi rend="italic">The Pilot</hi> (1823), a bold and dashing sea-story. The
                    next was <hi rend="italic">Lionel Lincoln</hi> (1825), a feeble and unattractive
                    work; and this was succeeded in 1826 by the famous <hi rend="italic">Last of the
                        Mohicans,</hi> a book that is often quoted as its author’s masterpiece.
                    Quitting America for Europe he published at Paris <hi rend="italic">The
                        Prairie</hi> (1826), the best of his books in nearly all respects, and <hi
                        rend="italic">The Red Rover,</hi> by no means his worst.</p>
                <p>At this period the unequal and uncertain talent of Cooper would seem to have been
                    at its best. These excellent novels were, however, succeeded by one very
                    inferior, <hi rend="italic">The Wept of Wishton-Wifih</hi> (1827); by <hi
                        rend="italic">The Notions of a Travelling Bachelor</hi> (1828), an
                    uninteresting book; and by <hi rend="italic">The Waterwitch</hi> (1830), one of
                    the poorest of his many sea-stories. In 1830 he entered the lists as a party
                    writer, defending in a series of letters to the <hi rend="italic">National,</hi>
                    a Parisian journal, the United States against a string of charges brought
                    against them by the <hi rend="italic">Révue Britannique</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi> and for the rest of his life he continued skirmishing in print,
                    sometimes for the national interest, sometimes for that of the individual, and
                    not infrequently for both at once. This opportunity of making a political
                    confession of faith appears not only to have fortified him in his own
                    convictions, but to have inspired him with the idea of imposing them on the
                    public through the medium of his art. His next three novels, <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Bravo</hi> (1831), <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Heidenmauer</hi> (1832), and <hi rend="italic">The Headman of Berne</hi>
                    (1833), were designed to exalt the people at the expense of the aristocracy. Of
                    these the first is by no means a bad story, but the others are among the dullest
                    ever written; all were widely read on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
                <p>In 1833 Cooper returned to America, and immediately published <hi rend="italic">A
                        Letter to my Countrymen,</hi> in which he gave his own version of the
                    controversy he had been engaged in, and passed some sharp censure on his
                    compatriots for their share in it. This attack he followed up with <hi
                        rend="italic">The Monikins</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The American
                        Democrat</hi> (1835); with several sets of notes on his travels and
                    experiences in Europe, among which may be remarked his <hi rend="italic"
                        >England</hi> (1837), in three volumes, a burst of vanity and ill-temper^
                    and with <hi rend="italic">Homeward Bound,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Home as
                        Found</hi> (1838),. noticeable as containing a highly idealized portrait of
                    himself. All these books tended to increase the ill-feeling between author and
                    public; the press was virulent and scandalous in its comments, and Cooper
                    plunged at once into a series of actions for libel. Victorious in all of them,
                    he returned to his old occupation with something of his old vigour and success.
                    A <hi rend="italic">Naval History of the United States</hi> (1839), supplemented
                    (1846) by a set of <hi rend="italic">Lives of Distinguished American Naval
                        Officers,</hi> was succeeded by <hi rend="italic">The Pathfinder,</hi> a
                    good “Leatherstocking” novel; by <hi rend="italic">Mercedes of Castile,</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">The Deerslayer</hi> (1841); by <hi rend="italic">The Tua
                        Admirals,</hi> and by <hi rend="italic">Wing and Wing</hi> (1842); by <hi
                        rend="italic">Wyandotte, The History of a Pocket Handkerchief,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">New Myers</hi> (1843); and by <hi rend="italic">Afloat and
                        Ashore,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Miles Wallingford</hi> (1844). From pure
                    fiction, however, he turned again to the combination of art and controversy in
                    which he had achieved distinction, and in the three <hi rend="italic">Littlepage
                        Stories</hi> (1845-6) he fought with a great deal of vigour. His next novel
                    was <hi rend="italic">The Crater, or Vulcan’s Peak</hi> (1847), in which he
                    attempted to introduce supernatural machinery with indifferent success; and this
                    was succeeded by <hi rend="italic">Oak Openings</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jack
                        Tier</hi> (1848), the latter a curious <hi rend="italic">rifacimento</hi> of
                        <hi rend="italic">The Red Rover;</hi> by <hi rend="italic">The Sea
                        Lions</hi> (1849); and finally by <hi rend="italic">The Ways of the
                        Hour</hi> (1850), another novel with a purpose, and his last book. He died
                    of dropsy at Cooperstown, New York, in his sixty-second year.</p>
                <p>Cooper was certainly one of the most popular authors that have ever written. His
                    stories have been translated into nearly all the languages of Europe and into
                    some of those of Asia, and are even now found worthy the honours of a cheap
                    reprint. Balzac admired him greatly, but with discrimination; Victor Hugo
                    pronounced him greater than the great master of modem romance, and this verdict
                    was echoed by a multitude of inferior readers, who were satisfied with no title
                    for their favourite less than that of “the American Scott.” As a satirist and
                    observer he is simply the “Cooper who ’s written six volumes to prove he ’s as
                    good as a Lord” of Lowell’s clever portrait; his enormous vanity and his
                    irritability find vent in a sort of dull violence, which is exceedingly
                    tiresome. It is only as a novelist that he deserves consideration. His qualities
                    are not those of the great masters of fiction; but he had <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n367/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0367-0338"/> an inexhaustible imagination, some faculty
                    for simple combination of incident, a homely tragic force which is very genuine
                    and effective, and up to a certain point a fine narrative power. His literary
                    training was inadequate; his vocabulary is limited and his style awkward and
                    pretentious; and he had a fondness for moralizing tritely and obviously, which
                    mars his best passages. In point of conception, each of his three-and-thirty
                    novels is either absolutely good or is possessed of a certain amount of merit;
                    but hitches occur in all, so that every one of them is remarkable rather in its
                    episodes than as a whole. Nothing can be more vividly told than the escape of
                    the Yankee man-of-war through the shoals and from the English cruisers in <hi
                        rend="italic">The Pilot,</hi> but there are few things flatter in the range
                    of fiction than the other incidents of the novel. It is therefore with some show
                    of reason that <hi rend="italic">The Last of the Mohicans,</hi> which as a chain
                    of brilliantly narrated episodes is certainly the least faulty in this matter of
                    sustained excellence of execution, should be held to be the best of his
                    works.</p>
                <p>The personages of his drama are rather to be accounted as so much painted cloth
                    and cardboard, than as anything approaching the nature of men and women. As a
                    creator of aught but romantic incident, indeed, Cooper’s claims to renown must
                    rest on the fine figure of the Leatherstocking, and, in a less degree, on that
                    of his friend and companion, the Big Serpent. The latter has many and obvious
                    merits, not the least of which is the pathos shed about him in his last
                    incarnation as the Indian John of <hi rend="italic">The Pioneers.</hi> Natty
                    Bumpo, however, is a creation of no common unity and consistency. There are
                    lapses and flaws, and Natty is made to say things which only Cooper, in his most
                    verbosely didactic vein could have uttered. But on the whole the impression left
                    is good and true. In the dignity and simplicity of the old backwoodsman there is
                    something almost Hebraic. With his naive vanity and strong reverent piety, his
                    valiant wariness, his discriminating cruelty, his fine natural sense of right
                    and wrong, his rough limpid honesty, his kindly humour, his picturesque dialect,
                    and his rare skill in woodcraft, he has all the breadth and roundness of a type
                    and all the eccentricities and peculiarities of a portrait.</p>
