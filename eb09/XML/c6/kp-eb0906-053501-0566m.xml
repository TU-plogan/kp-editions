                <p><label type="entry">COWRY</label>, the popular name of the shells of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cypraeida,</hi> a family of mollusks. Upwards of 100 species are
                    recognized, and they are widely distributed over the world,— their habitat being
                    the shallow water along the sea-shore. The best known is the money cowry or <hi
                    rend="italic">Cypraea</hi><hi rend="italic">moneta,</hi> a small shell about
                    half an inch in length, white and straw-coloured without and blue within, which
                    derives its distinctive name from the fact that in various countries it has been
                    employed as a kind of currency. It is most abundant in the Indian Ocean, and is
                    collected more particularly in the Maldive Islands, in Ceylon, along the Malabar
                    coast, in Borneo and other East Indian Islands, and in various parts of the
                    African coast from Ras Hafun to Mozambique. It was formerly in familiar use in
                    Bengal, where, though it required 3840 to make a rupee, the annual importation
                    was valued at about £30,000. In the countries of Further India it is still in
                    use; and in Siam, for example, 6400 cowries are equal to a <hi rend="italic"
                    >tical</hi> or about Is. 6d. In Western Africa— Congo, Yoruba, &lt;fcc.—it is
                    the usual tender, and before the abolition of the slave trade there were large
                    shipments of cowry shells to some of the English ports for reshipment to the
                    slave coast. As the value of the cowry was very much greater in Western Africa
                    than in the regions from which the supply was obtained, the trade was extremely
                    lucrative, and in some cases the gains are said to have been 500 per cent. The
                    use of the cowry currency has gradually spread inland in Africa, and Barth found
                    it fairly recognized in Kanó, Kukawa, Muniyoma, Gando, and even Timbuktu. In
                    Muniyoma he tells us the king’s revenue was estimated at 30,000,000 shells,
                    every full-grown man being required to pay annually 1000 shells for himself,
                    1000 for every pack-ox, and 2000 for every slave in his possession. In the
                    countries on the coast the shells are fastened together in strings of 40 or 100
                    each, so that fifty or twenty strings represent a dollar; but in the interior
                    they are laboriously counted out one by one, or, if the trader be expert, five
                    by five. The districts mentioned above receive their supply of <hi rend="italic"
                    >kurdi,</hi> as they are called, from the west coast; but the regions to the
                    north of the Land of the Moon, where they are in use under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">simbi,</hi> are dependent on Moslem traders from Zanzibar. Among
                    the Niam-Niam and other tribes who do not recognize their monetary value, the
                    shells are in demand as fashionable decorations, just as in Germany they were in
                    use as an ornament for horses’ harness, and were popular enough to acquire
                    several native names, such as <hi rend="italic">B rust</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >harnisch</hi> or breastplates, and <hi rend="italic">OtterFòpf-chen</hi> or
                    little adders’ heads. Besides the <hi rend="italic">Cypraea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">moneta</hi> various species are employed in this decorative use.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Cypraea aurora</hi> is a mark of chieftainship among the
                    natives of the Friendly Islands; the <hi rend="italic">Cypraea annulus</hi> is a
                    favourite with the Asiatic islanders; and several of the larger kinds have been
                    used in Europe for the carving of cameos. The tiger cowry, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cypraea</hi><hi rend="italic">tigris,</hi> so well known as a mantelpiece
                    ornament in England and America, is commonly used by the natives of the Sandwich
                    Islands to sink their nets; and they have also an ingenious plan of cementing
                    portions of several shells into a smooth oval ball which they then employ as a
                    bait to catch the cuttle-fish. While the species already mentioned occur in
                    myriads in their respective habitats, the <hi rend="italic">Cypraea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">princeps</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Cypraea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">umbilicata</hi> are extremely rare. Of the former, indeed, perhaps
                    not more than two or three specimens are known,— one of them being in the
                    British Museum, and another having drawn £40 at the sale of the collection of
                    the earl of Mountnorris.</p>
