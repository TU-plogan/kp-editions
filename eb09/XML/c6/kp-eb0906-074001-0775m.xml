                    wish, the name of Georges, which was that of an elder brother deceased. His
                    father, a retired officer on half-pay, belonged to a Protestant family which had
                    emigrated from the Jura in consequence of religious persecution. His mother, as
                    in the case of so many eminent men, was a cultivated and high-minded woman, who
                    took every pains to develop the nascent faculties of her son. He early showed a
                    bent towards the investigation of natural phenomena, and was noted for his
                    studious habits and marvellous memory. His higher education was carried out at
                    the Academy of Stuttgard—the school of Schiller and other men of eminence—to
                    which collegiate institution he had received a nomination from Prince Charles of
                    Wurtemberg. Devoting a year to the study of “philosophy,” lie was enrolled as a
                    student in the faculty of political economy (“Administration,”
                    “Cameralwissenschaft”); and after a brilliant university career he was thrown
                    upon the world at the age of eighteen. A short interlude was passed as
                    sub-lieutenant in the Swiss regiment of Châteauvieux, but this corps being
                    disbanded, and his family being poor, he accepted the position of tutor in the
                    family of the Comte d’Héricy, residing near Caen, in Normandy. He here spent the
                    years from 1788 to the end of 1794—including the terrific epoch of the “Reign of
                    Terror ”—peacefully occupying his leisure in the ardent pursuit of his favourite
                    sciences. About this time he attracted the attention of the Abbé Tessier, who
                    was sheltering himself from the fury of the Revolution at Fécamp, and who wrote
                    strongly in favour of his <hi rend="italic">protégé</hi> to his friends in
                    Paris,—with the result that Cuvier, after corresponding with the well-known
                    naturalist Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, was appointed in 1795 assistant to Mertrud,
                    the aged professor of comparative anatomy at the Museum d’Histoire
                    Naturelle.</p>
                <p>The pre-eminent abilities of Cuvier as a naturalist and scientific observer were
                    at once recognized in Paris, and the National Institute being founded this year
                    (1795), he was elected a member, and was associated with Lacépède and Daubenton
                    as the nucleus of the section of zoology. Detached memoirs on various zoological
                    subjects had already been published by him, one of the most important being a
                    joint memoir with Geoffroy on a new classification of the Mammalia. In this year
                    he also published a number of researches, dealing with a very wide range of
                    subjects, such as descriptions of new species of insects, the anatomy of <hi
                    rend="italic">Helix pomatia,</hi> the internal ear of the cetaceans, the
                    circulation of the invertebrates, the classification of the invertebrates,
                    &amp;c. One of the most important of these, published in the “Décade
                    philosophique” of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Natural History Society
                    of Paris,</hi> dealt with the internal and external structure and systematic
                    affinities of the miscellaneous assemblage of lower invertebrates at that time
                    grouped together under the name of “Vermes.” In 1796 Cuvier commenced his course
                    of lectures in the École Centrale du Panthéon, and published a number of
                    contributions to comparative anatomy. He also read his first palaeontological
                    paper at the opening of the National Institute in the April of this year, which
                    was subsequently published in 1800 under the title <hi rend="italic">Mémoires
                    sur les Espèces</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Éléphants
                    vivants et fossiles.</hi> Throughout the years 1797 and 1798 his scientific
                    activity continued unabated, as is implied by the production of various memoirs
                    upon such subjects as the nutritive processes in insects, the structure of the
                    ascidians, the anatomy of the bivalve mollusks, the nostrils of the cetaceans,
                    the different species of rhinoceros, the fossil bones of the Gypseous series of
                    Montmartre, &amp;c. In 1798, also jvas published his first separate work, namely
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tableau</hi><hi rend="italic">Elémentaire de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">histoire</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >naturelle des Animaux.</hi> This volume was an abridgment of his course of
                    lectures at the École du Panthéon, and may be regarded as the foundation and
                    first general statement of that natural classification of the animal kingdom,
                    which his genius originated, and which is universally accepted by modern
                    zoologists.</p>
                <p>In 1799, by the death of Daubenton, the chair of natural history in the Collège
                    de France was rendered vacant; and Cuvier was appointed to this responsible
                    post. In this year an important memoir on the blood system of the leeches
                    appeared from his pen. In 1800, in addition to various scattered contributions
                    to zoology and palaeontology, embracing observations on the <hi rend="italic"

                    classical work, in the production of which Cuvier was assisted by Dumeril in the
                    first two volumes, and by Duvernoy in three liter ones. In 1802 Cuvier became
                    titular professor at the Jardin des Plantes; and in the same year he was
                    appointed commissary of the Institute to accompany the inspectors-general of
                    public instruction. In this latter capacity he visited the south of France; but
                    he was in the early part of 1803 chosen perpetual secretary of the National
                    Institute in the department of the physical and natural sciences, and he
                    consequently abandoned the appointment j ust mentioned and returned to Paris.
                    Shortly thereafter he married the daughter of Μ. Duvancel, a contractor for the
                    public taxes, by whom he had four children, all of whom predeceased him.</p>
                <p>Cuvier’s scientific publications during the period posterior to the year 1801
                    covered a vast area, and can be but briefly alluded to here. In addition to
                    memoirs on the teeth of fishes, on the “Vermes” with red blood (Annelides), on
                    tlιe crabs known to the ancients, on the Egyptian ibis, &amp;ae, Cuvier now
                    devoted himself more especially to three lines of inquiry, one dealing with the
                    structure and classification of the Mollusca, a second treating of the
                    comparative anatomy and systematic arrangement of the fishes, and the third
                    concerned with fossil mammals and reptiles primarily, and secondarily with the
                    osteology of living forms belonging to the same groups. As regards the first of
                    these fields of investigation, Cuvier published a long series of papers on the
                    mollusca, which began as early as 1792, and dealt with almost all the groups now
                    admitted into this sub-kingdom, with the exception of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polyzoa.</hi> Most of these memoirs were published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">du Museum</hi> between 1802 and 1815, and they
                    were subsequently collected into the well-known and invaluable <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires pour servir à l’Histoire et à l’Anatomie des Mollusques,</hi>
                    published in one volume at Paris in 1817. In the department of fishes, Cuvier’s
                    researches, begun in 1801, finally culminated in the publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle</hi><hi rend="italic">des Poissons.</hi> This
                    magnificent work contained descriptions of 5000 species of fishes, and was the
                    joint production of Cuvier and Valenciennes, its publication (so far as the
                    former was concerned) extending over the years 1828-31. Palaeontology was always
                    a favourite study with Cuvier, and the department of it dealing with the
                    Mammalia may be said to have been essentially created and established by him. In
                    this region of investigation he published a long list of memoirs, partly
                    relating to the bones of extinct animals, and partly detailing the results of
                    observations on the skeletons of living animals specially examined with a view
                    of throwing light upon the structure and affinities of the fossil forms. In the
                    second category must be placed a number of papers relating to the osteology of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Rhinoceros</hi><hi rend="italic">Indicus,</hi> the tapir,
                    <hi rend="italic">Hyrax Capensis,</hi> the hippopotamus, the sloths, the
                    manatee, &amp;c. In the former category must be classed an even greater number
                    of memoirs, dealing with the extinct mammals of the Eocene beds of Montmartre,
                    the fossil species of hippopotamus, the <hi rend="italic">Didelphys</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gypsorum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Megalonyx,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Megatherium,</hi> the cave-hyaena, the extinct species of
                    rhinoceros, the cavebear, the mastodon, the extinct species of elephant, fossil
                    species of manatee and seals, fossil forms of crocodilians, chelonians, fishes,
                    birds, &lt;fcc. The results of Cuvier’s principal palaeontological and
                    geological investigations were ultimately given to the world in the form of two
                    separate works. One of these is the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur
                    les</hi><hi rend="italic">0ssemens</hi><hi rend="italic">fossiles de
                    Quadrupèdes,</hi> in four volumes quarto, published in Paris in 1812, with
                    subsequent editions in 1821 and 1825; rid the other is his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discours sur les</hi><hi rend="italic">Révolutions de la surface du Globe,</hi>
                    in one volume octavo, published in Paris in 1825.</p>
                <p>Apart from his own original investigations in zoology and palaeontology Cuvier
                    carried out a vast amount of work as perpetual secretary of the National
                    Institute, and as an official connected with public education generally; and
                    much of this work appeared ultimately in a published form. Thus, in 1808 he was
                    placed by Napoleon upon the council of the Imperial University, and in this
                    capacity he presided (in the years 1809, 18LI, and 1813) over commissions
                    charged to examine the state of the higher educational establishments in the
                    districts beyond the Alps and the Rhine which had been annexed to France, and to
                    report upon the means by which these could be affiliated with the central
                    university. Three separate reports on this subject were published by him. In his
                    capacity, again, of perpetual secretary of the Institute, he not only prepared a
                    number of <hi rend="italic">éloges historiques</hi> on deceased members of the
                    Academy of Sciences, but he was the author of a number of reports on the history
                    of the physical and natural sciences, the most important of these being his
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Rapport</hi><hi rend="italic">historique sur le
                    progrès des sciences Physiques depuis</hi> 1789, published in 1810.</p>
                <p>No work of Cuvier, however, has attained a higher reputation than his famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Règne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal</hi><hi rend="italic">distribué
                    d’après</hi><hi rend="italic">son Organisation.</hi> The first edition of this
                    appeared in four octavo volumes in 1817; the second, in five volumes, was
                    published in 1829-30. In this classical work, Cuvier embodied the results of the
                    whole of his previous researches on the structure of living and fossil animals,
                    as giving confirmation and fixity to that system of classification of which he
                    was the originator, and the main features of which still subsist. The whole of
                    this work was his own, with the exception of the Insecta, in which he was
                    assisted by his friend Latreille.</p>
                <p>The rest of Cuvier’s life, apart from his scientific labours, must be very
                    briefly told. By the unanimous consent of the learned world, he was now regarded
                    as the most eminent of living naturalists, and the scientific honours which he
                    received are beyond enumeration. Nor did he fail to meet amongst his own
                    countrymen—always ready to recognize ability, genius, energy, and
                    perseverance—with that public acknowledgment of his merits which he had so
                    richly deserved. Prior to the fall of Napoleon (1814) he had been admitted to
                    the Council of State, and his position remained unaffected by the restoration of
                    the Bourbons. He was elected chancellor of the university, in which capacity he
                    acted as interim president of the Council of Public Instruction, whilst he also,
                    as a Lutheran, superintended the faculty of Protestant theology. In 1819 he was
                    appointed president of the Committee of the Interior, which office he retained
                    until his death. In 1826 he was made grand officer of the Legion of Honour; and
                    in 1831 he was raised by Louis Philippe to the rank of peer of France, and was
                    subsequently appointed president of the Council of State. In the beginning of
                    1832, he was nominated to the Ministry of the Interior, but the end was now
                    near. On the 13th of May in this year, after a brief illness, commencing in
                    paralysis of the throat, and rapidly implicating the respiratory organs, Cuvier
                    passed away, his last surviving child having preceded him no less than five
                    years.</p>
                <p>Eminent as he was in various departments of administration, it will be as a
                    naturalist and palaeontologist that the memory of Cuvier will be nreserved. The
                    results which he accomplished in the sciences of zoology and palaeontology were,
                    however, so vast and varied that it is only possible to indicate in a general
                    manner the more important of them. These results fall naturally under three
                    heads.</p>
                <p>In the first place, as regards <hi rend="italic">systematic zoology,</hi> he
                    effected <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n777/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0777-0742"/> an entire revolution in the classification of the
                    animal kingdom as previously understood, and as explicitly formulated in the
                    system of Linnaeus. For an artificial and arbitrary classification he
                    substituted a natural arrangement, and he for the first time indicated the true
                    principles upon which a natural classification is possible. Ηe established the
                    empirical laws of correlation of growth and the subordination of different
                    systems of organs, and he showed that the primary laws of all sound
                    classification are to be found only in the anatomical examination of the animals
                    compared. In other words, for the loose, formal, and physiological analogies,
                    which had previously been used as the basis of classification, he substituted
                    the fundamental resemblances of morphological type and homology, and relegated
                    the former to a subordinate place. In no department of systematic zoology were
                    the reforms instituted by Cuvier more conspicuous than in the invertebrates.
                    Linnaeus classified the invertebrates simply by dividing them into the two
                    classes of the <hi rend="italic">Insecta</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vermes.</hi> Cuvier divided the invertebrates into the three sub-kingdoms
                    (“embranchements ”) of the <hi rend="italic">Mollusca,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Articulata,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Radiata</hi> or
                    zoophytes, and split up these again into a number of natural groups or classes.
                    It is true that modern zoologists have almost unanimously agreed on the
                    partition of the Cuvierian “Radiata” into the two sub-kingdoms of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coelenterata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Protozoa;</hi> though some
                    modern views would almost obliterate any line of demarcation between these, and
                    would thus, in effect, re-establish the <hi rend="italic">Radiata.</hi> It is
                    also true that considerable changes have been made in the classes of the lower
                    invertebrates as instituted by Cuvier. It is impossible, however, not to
                    recognize the immense step in advance made by the Cuvierian system of
                    classification upon that of Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>Cuvier’s contributions to <hi rend="italic">comparative anatomy,</hi> in the
                    second place, can be merely glanced at here. Apart from the impulse given to the
                    study of this science by the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Leçons</hi><hi

                    be said that we owe to Cuvier the general recognition that the really essential
                    portion of scientific zoology is comparative anatomy. As regards special
                    departments, his contributions to the comparative anatomy of the Mollusca and
                    fishes, and to the osteology of the Mammalia, may be particularly mentioned. As
                    an instance, further, of the manner in which Cuvier employed comparative anatomy
                    as a guide in zoological classification, the subkingdom of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mollusca</hi> may be specially singled out, or, if we prefer to a take a minor
                    group, the class of the <hi rend="italic">Cephalopoda.</hi></p>
                <p>Lastly, in the department of <hi rend="italic">palaeontology,</hi> Cuvier
                    effected a great and notable advance upon his predecessors. The notion that
                    fossils were merely <hi rend="italic">lusus</hi><hi rend="italic">naturae</hi>
                    had been already formally abandoned by such men as Leibnitz, Buffon, and Pallas.
                    Daubenton, and subsequently Fallas and Camper, compared the fossil bones of
                    quadrupeds with those of living forms, and the last of these declared his
                    opinion that some of these fossil bones belonged to extinct species of
                    quadrupeds. It is to Cuvier, however, that the world owes the first systematic
                    application of that science of comparative anatomy, which he himself had done so
                    much to place upon a sound basis, to the study of the bones of fossil animals.
                    It is to him that we owe the first complete demonstration that extinct animals
                    could be “reconstructed” from fragmentary remains by availing ourselves of the
                    law of the “correlation of growth;” though it is true, as pointed out by
                    Professor Huxley, that he rested more implicitly and securely upon this law than
                    its empiric nature and its now proved exceptions would justify at the present
                    day. Cuvier, as a palaeontologist, devoted himself principally to the study of
                    the fossil Mammalia of the Tertiary period, and especially to those of the
                    Eocene basin of Paris; and the flood of light which he was enabled to throw upon
                    the structure and affinities of these lost forms was mainly derived from a
                    careful and laborious comparison of the extinct types with their nearest living
                    congeners. .Whatever new victories may be in store for the science of
                    palaeontology, the <hi rend="italic">Ossemens</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Fossiles</hi> will remain an imperishable monument of the genius and industry
                    of one of the first and of the greatest of the pioneers in this region of human
                    investigation.</p>
