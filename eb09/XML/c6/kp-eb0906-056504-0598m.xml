                    said to have been the general’ practice of the ancient world, with the important
                    exceptions of Egypt, where bodies were embalmed, Judaea, where they were buried
                    in sepulchres, and China, where they were buried in the earth. »In Greece, for
                    instance, so well ascertained was the law that only suicides, unteetbed
                    children, and persons struck by lightning were denied the right to be burned. At
                    Rome, one of the XII. Tables said, “Hominem mortuum in urbe ne sepelito, neve
                    urito;” and in fact, from the close of the republic to the end of the 4th
                    Christian century, burning on the pyre or <hi rend="italic">rogus</hi> was the
                    general rule.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> Macrobius

                    rejected for sanitary or for superstitious reasons, it is difficult to say.

                <p>warm and dry than the Egyptian. The scarcity of fuel might also be a
                    consideration. The Chinese are influenced by the doctrine of Feng-Shui, or
                    incomprehensible wind water; they must have a properly placed grave in their own
                    land, and with this view corpses are often sent home from California. Even the
                    Jews used cremation in the vale of Tophet when a plague came; and the modern
                    Jews of Berlin and the Spanish and Portuguese Jews at Mile End Cemetery have
                    been among the first to welcome the lately revived process. Probably also, some
                    nations had religious objections to the pollution of the sacred principle of
                    fire, and therefore practised exposure, suspension, throwing into the sea,
                    cave-burial, desiccation, or envelopment.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> The Colchians, says Sir Thos. Browne, made their graves in
                    the air, ι.e., on trees.</p></note> Some at least of these methods must
                    obviously have been suggested eimply by the readiest means at hand. Cremation is
                    still practised over a great part of Asia and America, but not always in the
                    same form. Thus, the ashes may be stored in urns, or buried in the earth, or
                    thrown to the wind, or (as among the Digger Indians) smeared with gum on the
                    heads of the mourners. In one case the three processes of embalming, burning,
                    and burying are gone through; and in another, if a member of the tribe die at a
                    great distance from home, some of his money and clothes are nevertheless burned
                    by the family. As food, weapons, &amp;c., are sometimes buried with the body, so
                    they are sometimes burned with the body, the whole ashes being collected.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> In the case of a great man
                    there was often a burnt offering of animals and even of slaves (See Caesar, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Bell. Gall,</hi> iv.)</p></note> The Siamese have a singular
                    institution, according to which, before burning, the embalmed body lies in a
                    temple for a period determined by the rank of the dead man,—the king for six
                    months, and so downwards. If the poor relatives cannot afford fuel and the other
                    necessary preparations, they bury the body, but exhume it for burning when an
                    opportunity occurs. There can be little doubt that the practice of cremation in
                    modern Europe was at first stopped, and has since been prevented in great
                    measure, by the Christian doctrine of the resurrection of the body; partly also
                    by the notion that the Christian’s body was redeemed and purified.<note

                    “Begräbniss”).</p></note> Science has shown that burning merely produces quickly
                    what putrefaction takes a long time to accomplish; but the feeling of opposition
                    still lingers among the clergy of more than one nation. Some clergymen, however,
                    as Mr Ha weis in his <hi rend="italic">Ashes to Ashes, a Cremation Prelude,</hi>
                    London, 1874, have been prominent in the reforming movement. The objection was
                    disposed of by Lord Shaftesbury when he asked, “What would in such a case become
                    of the blessed martyrs <hi rend="italic">ì”</hi> The very general practice of
                    burying bodies in the precincts of a church in order that the dead might take
                    benefit from the prayers of persons resorting to the church, and the religious
                    ceremony which precedes both European burials and Asiatic cremations, have given
                    the question a religious aspect. It is really a sanitary one. The disgusting
                    results of pit-burial made cemeteries necessary. But cemeteries are equally
                    liable to overcrowding, and are often nearer to inhabited houses than the old
                    churchyards. There is indeed a disposition to build villas near ornamental
                    cemeteries. It is possible to make a cemetery safe approximately by selecting a
                    soil which is dry, close, and porous, by careful drainage, and by rigid
                    inforcement of the rules prescribing a certain depth (8 to 10 feet), and a
                    certain superficies (4 yards) for graves. But one has only to read such a work
                    as Baker’s <hi rend="italic">Laιvs</hi><hi rend="italic">Relating to Burial</hi>
                    to see how many dangers burial legislation has to contend with. A certain amount
                    of irrespirable gas will escape into the air, or into sewage drains, and thus
                    reach houses, or will percolate so as to contaminate water which is afterwards
                    used. The great Paris cemeteries inflict headache, diarrhoea, and ulcerated sore
                    throat on their immediate neighbours; and a great mass of similar
                    well-authenticated facts may be brought against even recent cemeteries in
                    various countries. A dense clay, the best soil for preventing the levitation of
                    gas, is the worst for the process of decomposition. The danger is strikingly
                    illustrated in the careful planting of trees and shrubs to absorb the carbonic
                    acid. Vault-burial in metallic coffins, even when sawdust charcoal is used, is
                    still more dangerous than ordinary burial. It must also be remembered that tho
                    cemetery system can only be temporary. The soil is gradually filled with bones;
                    houses crowd round; the law itself permits the re-opening of graves at the
                    expiry of fourteen years. We shall not, indeed, as Browne says, “be knaved out
                    of our graves to have our skulls made drinking bowls and our bones turned into
                    pipes !” But on this ground of sentiment cremation would certainly prevent any
                    interruption of that “sweet sleep and calm rest” which the old prayer thatthe
                    earth might lie lightly has associated with the grave. And in the meantime we
                    should escape the horror of putrefaction and of the “small cold worm that
                    fretteth the enshrouded form.”</p>
                <p>For the last ten years many distinguished physicians and chemists in Italy have
                    warmly advocated the general adoption of cremation, and in 1874, a congress
                    called to consider the matter at Milan resolved to petition the Chamber of
                    Deputies for a clause in the new sanitary code, permitting cremation under the
                    supervision of the syndics of the commune. In Switzerland Dr Vegmann Ercolani is
                    the champion of the cause (see his <hi rend="italic">Cremation the most Rational
                    Method of Disposing of the Dead,</hi> 4th ed., Zurich, 1874), and there are two
                    associations for its support. So long ago as 1797 cremation was seriously
                    discussed by the French Assembly under the Directory, and the events of the
                    Franco-Prussian war have again brought the subject under the notice of the
                    medical press and the sanitary authorities. The military experiments at Sédan,
                    Chalons, and Metz, of burying large numbers of bodies with quicklime, or pitch
                    and straw, were not successful, but very dangerous. Tho matter was considered by
                    the municipal council of Paris in connection with the new cemetery at
                    Méry-sur-Oise; and the prefect of the Seine in 1874 sent a circular asking
                    information to all the cremation societies in Europe. Thθ municipality of Vienna
                    has actually made cremation permissive. There is a propagandist society, called
                    the “Urne,” and the main difficulty for the poor seems to bo the cost of
                    conveying the bodies five miles. To overcome this a pneumatic tube has been
                    proposed. Dresden, Leipsic, and Berlin are the centres of the German movement,
                    and Professor· Reclam’s <hi rend="italic">De la Cremation</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Cadavres</hi> seems to be the most important work. In Britain tho subject
                    has slumbered for two centuries, since in 1658 Sir Thomas Browne published his
                    quaint <hi rend="italic">Hydriotqphia, or Urnburial</hi> (see edition by St
                    John, London, 1838), which was mainly founded on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Funere Romanorum</hi> of tho learned Kirchmannus. In
                    1817 Dr J. Jamieson gave a sketch of the “Origin of Cremation” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Proc. Royal Soc.</hi><hi rend="italic">Edin.,</hi> 1817), and for many years
                    prior to 1874 Dr Lord, medical officer of health for Hampstead, continued to
                    urge the practical necessity for the introduction of the system. It wa∙ Sir
                    Henry Thompson, however, who first brought the question prominently before the
                    public, and started in 1874 the Cremation Society of London. Its object is to
                    introduce through the agency of cemetery companies, and parochial and municipal
                    authorities, and burial boards, some rapid process of disposing of the dead,
                    “which cannot offend the living and shall render the remains absolutely
                    innocuous.” Thompson’s problem was—“Given a dead body, to resolve<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n600/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0600-0567"/> it into carbonic acid, water, and ammonia,
                    rapidly, safely, and not unpleasantly.” Relying on the evidence which suggested
                    recent burial legislation (see <hi rend="italic">Report to the General Board of
                    Health on a General Scheme for Extramural Sepulture,</hi> Clowes and Son, 1850,
                    signed by Lord Shaftesbury, Chadwick, and Southwood Smith; also Walker <hi
                    rend="italic">On Graveyards,</hi> Longmans, 1839), he pointed out that in the
                    neighbourhood of cemeteries there is a constantly increasing risk of
                    contaminated air and water. The problem he solved by the Siemens process of
                    cremation, which, when generally employed, would effect a great saving in the
                    cost of funerals, and would also leave a quantity of bone earth equal in value
                    to the bones imported into this country chiefly for manure. The British
                    authorities in India have already had much practical experience of cremation.
                    Poor Hindus often did not supply wood and oil (ghee) enough for the total
                    consumption of the body, and hence Sir Cecil Beadon at Calcutta, and the
                    sanitary commissioner of Madras, both found it necessary in the public interest
                    to erect cinerators on the burning ghat or ground (Latin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ustrina),</hi> which might be used on payment of a fee. So also at Poonah,
                    Colonel Martin, struck with the high cost (above 12 rupees) of even a poor
                    funeral, constructed in 1864 a pentagonal cinerator for the use of Brahmans and
                    the other Hindu castes. The idea is spreading rapidly in New York.</p>
                <p>Among the practical methods of cremation which have recently been attempted, we
                    may mention, in the first place, the experiments of Dr Polli at the Milan gas
                    works, which have been fully described in Dr Pietra Santa’s book, <hi
                    rend="italic">La cremation</hi><hi rend="italic">des morts en</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">France</hi><hi rend="italic">et à, T étranger,</hi> and those of
                    Professor Brunetti, who exhibited an apparatus at the Vienna Exhibition'of 1873,
                    and who states his results in <hi rend="italic">La Cremazione</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dei Cadaveri,</hi> Padua, 1873. Polli obtained completo
                    incineration or calcination of dogs by the use of coal-gas mixed with
                    atmospheric air, applied to a cylindrical retort of refracting clay, so as to
                    consume the gaseous products of combustion. The process was complete in two
                    hours, and the ashes weighed about 5 p.c. of the weight before cremation.
                    Brunetti used an oblong furnace of refracting brick with side-doors to regulate
                    the draught, and above a cast-iron dome with movable shutters. The body was
                    placed on a metallic plate suspended on iron wire. The gas generated escapes by
                    the shutters, and in two hours carbonization is complete. The heat is then
                    raised and concentrated, and at the end of four hours the operation is over; 180
                    lb. of wood costing 2s. 4d. sterling was burned. In the reverberating furnace
                    used by Sir Henry Thompson a body, weighing 144 Ib., was reduced in fifty
                    minutes to about 4 lb of lime-dust. The noxious gases, which were undoubtedly
                    produced during the first five minutes of combustion, passed through a flue into
                    a second furnace and were entirely consumed. In the ordinary Siemens
                    regenerative furnace (which has been adapted by Reclam in Germany for cremation,
                    and also by Sir Henry Thompson) only the hot-blast is used, the body supplying
                    hydrogen and carbon; or a stream of heated hydrocarbon mixed with heated air is
                    sent from a gasometer supplied with coal, charcoal, peat, or wood,—the brick or
                    iron-cased chamber being thus heated to a high degree before cremation begins.
                    In one arrangement both gas and air are at a white heat before they meet and
                    burst into flame in the furnace. The advantages of the Siemens furnace and gas
                    producer (which would cost about £800 in construction) are that the heat of the
                    expended fuel is nearly all retained by the regenerators, and that the gas
                    retort admits of the production being stopped without'much loss. Some difficulty
                    has been felt about keeping the ashes free from foreign material. The Greeks
                    used a shroud of asbestos, the Egyptians one of amianth. Mr Eassie suggests a
                    zinc coffin,—that metal being volatile. It is also suggested that the ashes
                    might be deposited in urns, and these placed in a columbarium which might be in
                    the church or at home.</p>
