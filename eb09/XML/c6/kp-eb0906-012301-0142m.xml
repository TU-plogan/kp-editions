                    parliamentary borough, and river-port of England, in the county of Essex, 51
                    miles from London by the Great Eastern Railway, on the Colne, which is there
                    crossed by three bridges. The town within the walls forms an oblong of <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0143-0124"/> about 108 acres; but new streets stretch far
                    beyond these limits. Large alterations have taken place since the accession of
                    Queen Victoria: the Middle Row and various other districts have been abolished
                    or rebuilt; the streets have been repaved, and a new supply of water obtained
                    for the town. Of the buildings in Colchester of interest for their antiquity the
                    first is the castle or keep, which occupies an area of 21,168 square feet (or
                    nearly twice that of the White Tower of London), and thus forms the largest
                    specimen extant of this department of Norman architecture. It was founded in
                    12th century by Eudo, the steward of</p>
                <p>Henry I., to whom the town was also indebted for the Benedictine abbey of St
                    John’s now almost totally demolished. Of the churches the oldest is St Peter’s,
                    which like several others has been restored within recent years; the remains of
                    the church of St Botolph’s priory, founded in the early part of the 12th
                    century, present fine examples of Norman workmanship; and St James’s, St
                    Giles’s, and St Leonard’s at the Hythe are all of antiquarian interest. The last
                    preserves some early frescoes. The present century has added largely to the
                    number of the churches and chapels, and many of the newer buildings are not
                    unworthy of the town in which they stand. Of secular structures the most
                    important are the town hall, the county police station (formerly the county
                    jail), the borough jail, the theatre, two corn exchanges, the Eastern Counties
                    asylum for idiots and imbeciles, the Essex and Colchester hospital, and the
                    assembly rooms. The town possesses a free grammarschool, in connection with
                    which is a scholarship at St John’s College, Cambridge; it has also a literary
                    institute with a library attached, a literary, a medical, and other societies.
                    Colchester is the centre of a large agricultural district, and has very
                    extensive corn and cattle markets. Baize was formerly the principal manufacture;
                    but this has been superseded by silk, more especially the kind employed for
                    umbrellas. The minor industrial establishments include flour-mills,
                    vinegar-works, foundries, engineering-works, rope-yards, printing offices, and
                    lime-works. The import and export trade is conducted at the suburb of Hythe, to
                    which vessels of 150 tons can come up the river. In 1874 the value of the
                    imports was £48,367, and of the exports £9173. The oyster fishery, for which the
                    town has been famous for centuries, is not so extensive as it once was; but it
                    is still carried on under the control of the Colchester town council, and
                    measures are taken for its maintenance and development. The borough, which
                    returns two members to parliament, has an area of 11,314 acres; the population
                    was in 1871 26,343, an increase since 1861 of 2534, and since 1801 of 14,823.
                    Colchester is the head-quarters of the Eastern Military District.</p>
                <p>That Colchester occupied the site of some important Roman city was all along
                    abundantly evident; but it is only within the present century that it has been
                    definitively identified with Camulodunum. This Roman settlement was established
                    by Claudius, to assist in the reduction of the fierce Silurians; but its
                    existence was jeopardized by the sudden rise of the Iceni to avenge the wrongs
                    of Boadicea. The colonists were massacred, their houses burned, and the site
                    left a mass of ruins. The Roman general, Suetonius Paullinus, however, soon
                    after recovered possession of the place; strong fortifications were erected, and
                    the colony soon attained a high degree of prosperity. To the present day the
                    walls then erected remain almost intact, and form one of the noblest specimens
                    of Roman architecture in the island. Minor antiquities—such as Samian pottery,
                    coins, articles of ornament—occur in the greatest profusion; and, both within
                    the city and in the neighbourhood, numerous villas have been discovered, with
                    tesselated pavements, hypocausts, and baths. The coins belong to all periods,
                    down to the secession of the Romans from the island?. On the arrival of the
                    Saxons the old name of Camulodunum gave place to that of Colneceastor, or the
                    Castnun on the Colne, which is still preserved in the present modification. In
                    921 the town was recovered from the Danes by Edward tho Elder, and its
                    fortifications were strengthened. At the time of the <hi rend="italic">Domesday
                    Book</hi> it was a place of decided importance, and in the reign of Edward III.
                    it sent five ships and 140 seamen to the siege of Calais. In 1348 and 1360 it
                    was ravaged by the plague, which again visited it in the dreadful year of 1665.
                    Meanwhile it was the scene of a memorable siege; having in 1648 declared for the
                    Royalists, it was captured by Fairfax, after an investment of eleven weeks, its
                    gallant defenders, Sir C. Lucas and Sir C. Lisle, were put to death, and the
                    castle was dismantled. See Morant’s <hi rend="italic">Essex;</hi> Rev. Henry
