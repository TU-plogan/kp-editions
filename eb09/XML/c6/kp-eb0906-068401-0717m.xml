                    rend="italic">(Erythroxylon Coca),</hi> is a plant of the natural order <hi
                    rend="italic">Erylhroxylaceae,</hi> the leaves of which are used as a
                    masticatory in the western countries of South America. <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> It resembles a blackthorn bush, and grows .to a height of 6 or 8 feet.
                    The branches are straight, and the leaves, which have a lively green tint, are
                    thin, opaque, oval, tapering at the extremities, and similar to tea-leaves; on
                    each side of the strong mid-rib is a longitudinal vein. Good samples of the
                    dried leaves are uncurled, are of a deep green on the upper, and a grey-green on
                    the lower surface, and have a strong tea-like odour; when chewed they produce a
                    sense of warmth in the mouth, and have a pleasant, pungent taste. Bad specimens
                    have a camphora-ceons smell and a brownish colour, and lack the pungent taste.
                    The flowers are small, and disposed in little clusters on short stalks; the
                    corolla is composed of five yellowish-white petals, the anthers are
                    heart-shaped, and the pistils are three in number. The flowers are succeeded by
                    red berries. The seeds are sown in December and January in small plots <hi
                    rend="italic">(almacigas)</hi> sheltered from the sun, and the young plants when
                    from l¾ to 2 feet in height are placed in holes <hi rend="italic">(aaepî),</hi>
                    or, if the ground is level, in furrows <hi rend="italic">(uachos)</hi> in
                    carefully-weeded soil. The plants thrive best in hot, damp situations, such as
                    the clearings of forests; but the leaves most preferred are obtained in drier
                    localities, on the sides of hills. The leaves are gathered from plants varying
                    in age from one and a half to upwards of forty years. They are considered ready
                    for plucking when they break on being bent. The first and most abundant harvest
                    is in March, after the rains; the second is at the end of June, the third in
                    October or November. The green leaves <hi rend="italic">(matu)</hi> are spread
                    in thin layers on coarse woollen cloths and dried in the sun; they are then
                    packed in sacks, which, in order to preserve the quality of the leaves, must be
                    kept from damp.</p>
                <p>It has been estimated that cuca is used by about 8,000,000 of the human race,
                    being consumed in Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Rio Negro. In Peru the
                    Indians carry a leathern pouch (the <hi rend="italic">chuspa,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">huallqui)</hi> for the leaves, and a supply of pulverized unslaked
                    lime, or a preparation of the ashes of the quinoa plant <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Chenopodium quinoa),</hi> called <hi rend="italic">lliρta</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">llucta.</hi> Three or four times a day labour is suspended for <hi
                    rend="italic">chacchar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">acullicar,</hi> as the
                    mastication of cuca is termed. The leaves, deprived of their stalks, are chewed
                    and formed into a ball <hi rend="italic">(acullico)</hi> in the mouth; a small
                    quantity of the lime or llipta is then applied to the acullico to give it a
                    proper relish. Two or three ounces of cuca are thus daily consumed by each
                    Indian.</p>
                <p>Cuca is a powerful stimulant of the nervous system; it enables fatigue to be
                    borne with less nourishment and greater ease than ordinarily, and diminishes the
                    difficulty of breathing in ascending mountains; when used externally it is said
                    to be a remedy for rheumatism and headache.</p>
                <p>The poet Cowley represents the Indian “Pachamma” as addressing Venus thus :—</p>
                <p>“Our <hi rend="italic">Varicocha</hi> first this <hi rend="italic">Coca</hi>

                <p>Dr Pöppig <hi rend="italic">(Travels in Chili and Peru)</hi> considers the habit
                    of cuca-chewing to be as dangerous to the health as opium-eating, and in the
                    highest degree pernicious, and Mr J. A. Lloyd alludes to cuca as a “poisonous
                    narcotic” <hi rend="italic">(&lt;7ourn.</hi><hi rend="italic">R. Geog.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Soc.,</hi> 1854, p. 260). It does not, however, appear from the
                    writings of Garcilasso that he observed any ill results among the Peruvian
                    Indians from the practice of cuca-chewing. Von Tschudi refers to numerous
                    instances of their longevity and good health, notwithstanding the habit, almost
                    from boyhood, of masticating cuca three times a day. Markham regards cuca as the
                    least injurious, and the most soothing and invigorating of all the narcotics
                    used by man; and Dr Archibald Smith <hi rend="italic">(Peru as it is,</hi>
                    London, 1839) states that cuca when fresh and good, and used in moderate
                    quantity, increases nervous energy, removes drowsiness, enlivens the spirits,
                    and enables the Indian to bear cold, wet, great bodily exertion, and even want
                    of food, to a surprising degree, with apparent ease and impunity. Though it is
                    said, if taken to excess, to <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Garcilasso de la
                    Vega, writing of the plant, says that it is called <hi rend="italic">cuca</hi>
                    by the Indians, <hi rend="italic">coca</hi> by the Spaniards; and Father Blas
                    Valera states that the leaves are called <hi rend="italic">cuca</hi> both by
                    Indians and Spaniards. <hi rend="italic">(The Royal Commentaries of the
                    Yncas,</hi> 1609-1617; trans, by C. R. Markham, Hakluyt Soc., 1871). See also,

                <p>occasion tremor in the limbs, and even a gloomy sort of mania, such dire effects,
                    he considers, must be of rare occurrence, since, after living for years in
                    constant intercourse with persons accustomed to frequent cuca plantations, and
                    with Indian yanacones or labourers, all of whom, whether old or young,
                    masticated the favourite leaf, he never witnessed a single instance in which the
                    chewer was affected with mania or tremor.</p>
                <p>Cuca was used by the Peruvian Indians in the most ancient times. It was employed
                    as an offering to the sun, or to produce smoke at the great sacrifices; and the
                    priests, it was believed, must chew it during the performance of religious
                    ceremonies, otherwise the gods would not be propitiated. Cuca is still held in
                    superstitious veneration among the Peruvians, and is believed by the miners of
                    Cerro de Pasco to soften the veins of ore, if masticated and thrown upon
                    them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cocaine,</hi> the alkaloid to which cuca owes its special
                    properties, was discovered by Niemann in 1859. Tlιe formula assigned to it is
                    Ci6H <hi rend="subscript"> 19</hi> NO4, or C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> H <hi

                    physiological action is apparently identical with that of theine, caffeine,
                    guaraninè, and theobromine, which all, as has been shown by Dr A. Bennet,
                    “induce a series of symptoms affecting the nervous, respiratory, circulatory,
                    vaso motor, and glandular systems” <hi rend="italic">(Edin. Med.</hi><hi
