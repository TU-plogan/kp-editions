                    law. The most interesting episode of his life was his intimacy with Locke, who
                    in his letters speaks of him with the most affectionate regard. During a visit
                    to Holland, made, it is said, in order to escape the storm raised by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Discourse of Freethinláng,</hi> he also made the <pb break="no"

                    scholars. Iu 1715 he settled in Essex; and he was in that county appointed to
                    the offices of justice of the peace and deputylieutenant, which he had before
                    held in Middlesex. His open expression of his opinions, with all its freedom,
                    was, as he owns, carefully kept “within the bounds of doing himself no harm;” he
                    always published anonymously, though the authorship of his books never appears
                    to have been long a secret; and the independence of his position, together with
                    his pure and genial character, saved him from all personal annoyance. The only
                    attack reported to have been made upon him, otherwise than by means of the
                    press, was the fruitless petition presented by Whiston, while smarting under his
                    criticism, praying that he might be removed from the commission of the peace.
                    Collins died at his house in Harley Street, London, on December 13, 1729, at the
                    age of fifty-three.</p>
                <p>The first work of note published by Collins was his <hi rend="italic">Essay
                    concerning the Use of Reason in Propositions the Evidence whereof depends on
                    Human Testimony</hi> (1707). He demands that the revelation of God should be
                    conformable to man’s natural ideas of God, but draws a distinction between what
                    is contrary to reason and what is merely contrary to our experience. ∙</p>
                <p>Six years later appeared his most famous work, <hi rend="italic">A Discourse of
                    Freethinking, occasioned by the Rise and Growth of a Sect called
                    Freethinkers</hi> (1713). Notwithstanding the ambiguity of its title, and though
                    it attacks the priests of all churches without moderation, it contends for the
                    most part, at least explicitly, for no more than must be admitted by every
                    Protestant, or than is maintained in such works as Taylor’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liberty of Prophesying;</hi> and it points out forcibly that the first
                    introduction of Christianity, and the success of all missionary enterprise,
                    involve freethinking (in its etymological sense) on the part of those converted.
                    In England this essay, which was regarded and treated as a plea for deism, made
                    a great sensation, calling forth several replies, among others from Whiston,
                    Bishop Hare, Bishop Hoadly, and Richard Bentley, who, under the signature of <hi
                    rend="italic">Phileleutherus Lipsiensis,</hi> roughly handles certain arguments
                    carelessly expressed by Collins, but triumphs chiefly by an attack on his
                    scholarship. Swift also, being satirically referred to in the book, made it the
                    subject of a caricature. In France, where it was answered by Crousaz, it
                    produced a still deeper impression.</p>
                <p>In 1724 Collins published his extraordinary <hi rend="italic">Discourse on the
                    Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion,</hi> with <hi rend="italic">An
                    Apology for Free Debate and Liberty of Writing</hi> prefixed. Ostensibly it is
                    written in opposition to Whiston’s attempt to show that the passages of the Old
                    Testament prophecies quoted in the New had since the time of Christ been
                    corrupted by the Jews, and with the object of proving that the fulfilment of
                    prophecy by the events of Christ’s life is all “secondary, secret, allegorical,
                    and mystical,” since the original and literal reference is always to some other
                    fact. To explain this “allegorical” reading, he quotes from the Dutch Hebraist
                    Surenhusius ten methods according to which the authors of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gemara</hi> and other allegorical writers among the Jews interpret difficult
                    parts of the Scriptures, and which are asserted to have been used in the New
                    Testament. Of these methods the gentlest is altering the points, and the most
                    severe is “changing the order of words, adding words, and retrenching words,
                    which is a method often used by Paul;” and the true purpose of the book would
                    appear to have been to show, in a veiled satire, that the fulfilment of prophecy
                    in the New Testament is of the same kind as that contrived by the rabbis. And
                    further, as he strives to prove that the fulfilment of prophecy is the only
                    valid proof of Christianity, he thus secretly aims a blow at Christianity as a
                    revelation. The canonicity of the New Testament he ventures openly to deny, on
                    the ground that the canon could only be fixed by men who were inspired. No less
                    than thirty-five answers were directed against this book, the most noteworthy of
                    which were those of Bishop Edward Chandler, Arthur Sykes, Clarke, and Sherlock.
                    To these, but with special reference to the work of Chandler, which maintained
                    that a number of prophecies were literally fulfilled in Christ, Collins replied
                    by his <hi rend="italic">Scheme of Literal Prophecy Considered,</hi> 1727. An
                    appendix contends against Whiston that the book of Daniel was forged in the time
                    of Antiochus Epiphanes.</p>
                <p>In philosophy, Collins takes a foremost place as a defender of Necessitarianism.
                    His brief <hi rend="italic">Inquiry Concerning Human Liberty</hi> (1715) gives,
                    in a remarkably clear and concise form, all the important arguments in favour of
                    his theory, with able and suggestive replies to the chief objections that have
                    been urged against it Little, in fact, of moment has been added by modern
                    determi nists. One of his arguments, however, calls for special criticism,—his
                    assertion that it is self-evident that nothing that has a beginning can be
                    without a caus <hi rend="superscript"> k</hi> e is an unwarranted assumption of
                    the very point at issue. Collins’s position was attacked in an elaborate
                    treatise by Samuel Clarke, in whose system the freedom of the will is made
                    essential to religion and morality. During Clarke’s lifetime, fearing perhaps
                    (as has been suggested) to be branded as an enemy of religion and morality,
                    Collins gave no reply, but in 1729 he published an answer, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Liberty and Necessity.</hi></p>
                <p>The other of Collins’s two purely philosophical treatises is <hi rend="italic">A
                    Letter to Mr Dodwell.</hi> A controversy was then being carried on between
                    Clarke, who asserted the natural immortality of the soul, and Dodwell, who held
                    that the soul is mortal till baptism confers immortality upon it; and Collins
                    entered the lists to suggest other possibilities. Adopting Locke’s suggestion,
                    he maintained that it is conceivable that the soul may be material; and,
                    secondly, that if the soul be immaterial it does not follow, as Clarke had
                    contended, that it is immortal; indeed in no way, he argues, can philosophy
                    prove its immortality.</p>
                <p>Two of Collins’s early works yet remain to be mentioned— his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vindication of the Divine Attributes,</hi> in which he attacks a sermon of
                    King, archbishop of Dublin, and maintains that from our knowledge of human
                    qualities we can attain to a true, if limited, knowledge of the divine
                    attributes; and his <hi rend="italic">Priestcraft in Perfection, or a Detection
                    of the Fraud of inserting and continuing the Clause, “The Church hath power to
                    decree Rites and Ceremonies and Authority in Controversies of Faith,” in the
                    Twentieth Article of the Church of England</hi> (1709), to which—as the question
                    excited a very active controversy—he added, early in the next year, a second
                    pamphlet on the same subject. (τ. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ. w.)</hi></p>
