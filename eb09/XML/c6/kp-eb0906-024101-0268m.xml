                    >λ.d.)</hi> were very great; they included a power of absolving sovereigns and
                    subjects from their oaths, a large feudal revenue collected abroad, a peculiar
                    status for the Catholic clergy. Against these, temporal sovereigns claimed what
                    were called <hi rend="italic">jura</hi><hi rend="italic">majestatis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">circa sacra,—</hi> viz., <hi rend="italic">jus</hi> (Schutzrecht),

                    rend="italic">cavendi</hi> (Recht der Versorge), or right of considering whether
                    ecclesiastical regulations conflict with civil duties; and <hi rend="italic"

                    the morals of the church and the administration of its property. The great
                    historical assertions of Papal supremacy were made in the Decretals :—“<hi

                    of the imperial electors who had chosen Philip of Swabia; <hi rend="italic">“Ad

                    (1296 and 1302), which dealt with the taxation of church property, and laid down
                    the principle “oportet autem gladium esse sub gladio.” The same claims appear in
                    the Extravagant “<hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Consuetudine,”</hi>
                    issued by John XXII. in 1322, and in the frequently published Bull <hi
                    rend="italic">“In Caena Domini”</hi> (1773). The Encyclical Letter “<hi
                    rend="italic">Quanta Curaſt</hi> and relative Syllabus of 1864, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Costituzione “Pastor Aetemus”</hi> of 1870 contain the latest
                    expression by the Pope of his international functions. It was after the empire
                    had, by the decree of Frankfort (1338), declared that Papal confirmation and
                    coronation were unnecessary, and the reformatory councils of Constance and Basel
                    had increased the controlling power of the whole church, and diminished the
                    appeals and <hi rend="italic">annates</hi> which caused so much discontent, that
                    pragmatic sanctions and concordats began to be used to regulate the relations
                    between the different European powers and the Papacy. The French Pragmatic of
                    1268, which defended the local jurisdictions and rights of presentation, and
                    prohibi-tedPapal imports exceptforpious,rational,and urgentcauses, and the
                    Pragmatic Sanction which in 1438 at the Council of Bruges the French clergy
                    composed in imitation of the Basel decrees, were largely modified in favour of
                    Rome by the concordat entered into in 1510 between Francis I. and Leo X. This
                    arrangement left the nomination of bishops with the Crown, which had before
                    merely given a <hi rend="italic">conge</hi><hi rend="italic">d’élire</hi> for
                    the election by chapter, but assigned no term within which the Pope must
                    institute. The consequence was that whenever it suited his purpose the Pope
                    delayed institution. After a long period of irritating dispute the French
                    clergy, Γed by Le Pellier and Bossuet, in their famous declaration of 1682,
                    formally asserted what are now called Cismontane or national church principles.
                    Louis XIV. had considerably enlarged the Crown right of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Regale,</hi> which included the revenues of vacant churches, but he was now
                    (1693) ignominiously compelled to write a letter to Innocent XI., in which he
                    undertook not to enforce the edict of 1682. The suppression of the Jesuits, in
                    1773, was a heavy blow to. the temporal influence of Rome. It was mainly brought
                    about by the behaviour of Clement XIII. The duke of Parma had prohibited appeals
                    from his territory to Rome in questions about the benefices of Parma, and had
                    also republished the principle, familiar in the common law of Europe, that no
                    Papal rescript should take effect in Parma without receiving the ducal <hi
                    rend="italic">exaequatur.</hi> Clement then fired off the “Monitorio di Parma,”
                    excommunicating in terms of the Bull “<hi rend="italic">In Coena”</hi> all
                    concerned in the Parmesan edict. The indignant reaction which followed in all
                    the courts of Catholic Europe decided the triumph of Ganganelli and the
                    Regalisti party, who were opposed at the Vatican by the Ultramontane party of
                    Zelanti. Under the civil constitution which the French Church received from the
                    Revolution, the bishops received institution from their metropolitan. In 1801, a
                    concordat was arranged between Napoleon as first consul and Pius VII. Under this
                    the consul nominated and the Pope appointed bishops, who were all required to
                    swear allegiance to the republic<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> Several bishops, who refused this oath, were driven from
                    France, and formed in England La Petite Eglise, which existed for some time (see

                    important matters of the verification of Bulls by <hi rend="italic">Exaequatur,

                    >comme</hi><hi rend="italic">d’Abus,</hi> were all settled by the “Regulations
                    of the Gallican Church,” better known as the Organic Articles, with regard to
                    which the Pope was not consulted. Shortly afterwards Napoleon, by the decree of
                    Schönbrunn (1809), annexed the Papal dominions to France, and imprisoned the
                    Pope at Fontainebleau, where the “false” concordat of 1813 was signed. The main
                    provision of this was to devolve the right of institution on the metropolitan
                    bishop, if not exercised by the Pope within six months. In 1817 the Bourbons
                    tried to negotiate a retrograde concordat, but the attempt was fortunately
                    frustrated. The political attitude of Guizot and Napoleon III. towards Gregory
                    XVI. and Pius IX. was friendly, but in 1870 the Prussian victories brought to an

                    which had begun in the intervention of 1849, and had been continuous from 1864.
                    By the Italian statute of guarantees (13th May 1871) personal inviolability and
                    the honours of a sovereign are secured to the Pope. He has also a large income
                    and several residences, and a private postal and telegraphic service; and he is
                    allowed to receive diplomatic agents from foreign states. The same statute gives
                    complete freedom to the church, but deprives it of coercive jurisdiction. The
                    royal <hi rend="italic">Placet</hi> is relinquished as unnecessary, but a
                    stringent penal law (7th June 1871) is directed against seditious words,
                    writings, or acts of the clergy.</p>
                <p>In the empire the earliest concordat is the Concordatum Calixtinum of 1122,
                    between Henry V. and Pope Calixtus II. The benefits of the Basel Decrees were in
                    great measure lost by the concordat entered into in 1448 between Frederick III.
                    and Nicholas V. The political position of the Pope was much altered by the
                    Treaty of Westphalia, which, without his consent, and even against his protests,
                    conceded the right to certain nations of freely exercising the Protestant
                    religion.</p>
                <p>Early in the 18th century the cause of the national church in Austria, and of the
                    immediate divine right of Episcopacy, was placed on solid foundations of
                    learning and argument by the writings of Van Espen <hi rend="italic"

                    of the permanent <hi rend="italic">Nuntiatura,</hi> maintained by the Pope,
                    called forth the <hi rend="italic">Punctation</hi> of the four archbishops who
                    met at Ems, 25th August 1786. Joseph II. had already carried out large reforms,
                    but these episcopal resolutions recommended still further changes in the
                    “Recursus ad Principem,” or prohibition of appeals to Rome, the power of
                    dispensation and of granting faculties, the administration of conventual
                    property and charitable funds, the reservation of benefices and their
                    transmission by inheritance, the exaction of <hi rend="italic">annates</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">pallium</hi> money, &amp;c. Under the decrees of Joseph II. in
                    1781, no Papal Bulls or rescripts were allowed to be published, except such as
                    had received the Placitum Regium, and had been effected through the intervention
                    of the imperial and royal agency at Rome. In 1850, however, both the bishops and
                    the faithful under their charge were allowed to have recourse to the Pope in
                    spiritual matters, and to receive the decisions of his Holiness without the
                    previous consent of the secular authorities. With the exception of the three
                    archbishoprics of Olmütz, Salzburg, and Breslau, where the archbishop is elected
                    by the chapter, the practice was, on a bishopric becoming vacant, for the
                    emperor to propose three candidates from whom the Pope selects one— a selection
                    subsequently ratified by the emperor. The same decree of 1850, proceeding on the
                    anti-revolutionary imperial patent of 4th March 1849 (§ 2), permits Catholic
                    bishops to issue admonitions and ordinances, without consent of the civil power,
                    to decree ecclesiastical punishments which do not affect purely civil rights, to
                    suspend and remove from ecclesiastical office, and to declare emoluments
                    forfeited, and to control education in primary and intermediate schools and in
                    the universities. This arrangement was sealed by the concordat of 18th August
                    1855 (printed fully in <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> 20th November 1855), which,
                    however, was repealed by the series of Church Acts passed by Prince Auersperg in
                    1874, in imitation of the Falk legislation of Prussia.</p>
                <p>The relations of Belgium with Rome were of course at one time determined by the
                    decree of the French N ational Assembly (1791), and the concordat between Pius
                    VII. and Napoleon (1801). On 18th June 1827, William I., Protestant king of the
                    Netherlands, entered into a concordat with Pope Leo XII., which confirmed and
                    extended the provisions of the earlier concordat relating to the institution of
                    bishops by letters apostolic. The power which the Crown then reserved of
                    striking out objectionable names from the list of candidates prepared by the
                    chapter was entirely renounced by the 16th Article of the Belgian Constitution
                    of 1830, which declares that the -state has no jight to interfere with the
                    nomination or installation of any religious ministers, or to prevent them from
                    corresponding with their superiors or from publishing their Acts. But then the
                    Government has this indirect control, that all the salaries of the Catholic
                    clergy are voted in the annual budget, and do not belong to the church. The
                    concordat of 1827 was never in force in Holland, where the fundamental law of
                    1848 (§ 65) declares that no Dutchman can accept titles without the permission
                    of the king, and where public opinion has prevented the creation of Catholic
                    bishops.</p>
                <p>Spain, although the most Catholic of powers, has, at least since the accession of
                    the Austrian dynasty, zealously defended its national church rights against the
                    Pope. In 1568, Philip II. claimed as royal prerogative the right to present to
                    all Spanish bishoprics, and created a Board, “Supremo Consejo de ]a Camara,” to
                    preserve the royal jurisdiction, to protect the canons, and to watch over the
                    external policy in ecclesiastical matters. The Pope having sided with Austria in
                    the Succession War, the breach between Spain and Rome widened during the 18th
                    century. The principles that no causes should be carried before a judge outside
                    the kingdom, that benefices should be conferred only on natives, that sovereigns
                    are not subject to interdict or spiritual censure, that all Bulls should, before
                    publication, be subject to the royal <hi rend="italic">Cedula,</hi> were loudly
                    and angrily proclaimed; and in 1805 the king attacked the secret influences of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Curia</hi> by directing that all applications to Rome for
                    grants and dispensation should receive the <hi rend="italic">Visto Bueno</hi> of
                    the royal agent at Rome. The estrangement continued in the 19th century, when
                    till 1848 the Pope refused to recognize the succession of Isabella II. under the
                    Pragmatic Sanction of 1830. From 1753 to 1851, matters had stood on a concordat
                    which the eminent statesman, De Carbajal, persuaded Ferdinand VI. to negotiate
                    with Clement XII. It gave the king the right of presentation to vacant
                    bishoprics (patronatos), and to the Pope 22,000,000 reales as compensation for
                    the loss of <hi rend="italic">annates</hi> and fees on briefs. The concordats of
                    1851 and 1859 are more favourable to Rome; but the attempt of Canovas del
                    Castillo and the Cardinal Simeoni to procure a recognition of the 1851
                    concordat, in 1875, was defeated by General Jovellar.</p>
                <p>In non-Roman Catholic states, of course, no valid concordat could be framed.
                    Accordingly, as in the cases of Prussia (1821) and Hanover (1824), edicts
                    relating to the adjustment of dioceses, or other matters not purely spiritual,
                    were issued by the Pope under the name of Bullae Circumscriptionis. These were
                    formally sanctioned by th© Home Government, and directed to be printed in the
                    collection of laws.</p>
                <p>The most important sources of information on this subject are the reports
                    presented to Parliament in 1816 and 1851, on the “Regulation of Roman Catholic
                    Subjects in Foreign Countries,” which have been summarized in the 2d volume of
