                    into the hands of the Roman emperor Severus (232 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi>
                    its population must have been very great, as it furnished no fewer than 100,000
                    prisoners of war. About 263 it was besieged by Odenathus, king of Palmyra; and
                    in the minority of Sapor II. it was taken by storm by a Mesopotamian chieftain
                    named Thair. Though the emperor Julian gained the day in a great battle before
                    the city, and its capture seems to have been one of the chief objects of his
                    manoeuvres, he retired without attempting an investment. ¢ In 637 it was
                    abandoned by Yezdejird, the last of the Sassanids, and seized by Sa’ad, the
                    Arabian general, who found within its walls so extensive and costly a booty
                    that, after the works of art and a fifth of the whole were set apart for the
                    caliph, he was able to bestow 12,000 dirhems, or upwards of £300, on each of his
                    60,000 soldiers. After this date the destruction of the city seems to have been
                    rapidly accomplished; and in the present day the site is marked by desolate
                    ruins which, instead of preserving the ancient name of Ctesiphon or the more
                    modern name of Maidan, are known to the people of the district as the
                    burial-place of Soliman Pak, the barber of Mahomet. Amid the mounds of sun-dried
                    bricks, one building still remains sufficiently entire to give some
                    authentication to the glowing descriptions of the Arabian writers. This is the
                    Takht-i-Khesra (throne of Chosroes), Tak-i-Khesra (arch of Chosroes), or, using
                    the other form of Chosroes’s name, the arch of Nushirvan, which consists of the
                    great central hall of the palace, built in all probability by the monarch whose
                    name it perpetuates. According to Tabari, the edifice when complete was 450 feet
                    in length, 180 feet in breadth, and 150 feet in height: adorned in front by a
                    portico of twelve marble pillars of the noblest dimensions; and the vaulted
                    hall, which had a height of 85 feet and a width of 72, was decorated with the
                    signs of the zodiac in golden stars. The whole building appears from the remains
                    to have been composed of baked bricks covered with a coating of plaster; but the
                    Arabian writers speak of it as consisting of polished stone. See Flandin, <hi
