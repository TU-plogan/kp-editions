                <p><label type="entry">COLONY</label>. The term colony, often loosely applied, is
                    most commonly used to denote a settlement of the subjects of a sovereign state
                    in lands beyond its boundaries, owning no allegiance to any foreign power, and
                    retaining a greater or less degree of dependence on the mother country. The
                    founding and the growth of such communities furnish matter for an interesting
                    chapter iu the history as well of ancient as of modern civilization; and the
                    regulation of the relations between the parent state and its dependencies abroad
                    gives rise to important problems alike in national policy and in international
                    economics.</p>
                <p>It was mainly the spirit of commercial enterprise that led the Phoenicians to
                    plant their colonies upon the islands and along the southern coast of the
                    Mediterranean; and even beyond the Pillars of Hercules this earliest great
                    colonizing race left enduring traces of its maritime supremacy. Carthage,
                    indeed, chief of the Phoenician settlements, sent forth colonies to defend her
                    conquests and strengthen her military power; and these sub-colonies naturally
                    remained in strict subjection to her power, whereas the other young Phoenician
                    states assumed and asserted entire independence.</p>
                <p>In this latter respect the Greek colonies resembled those of the Phoenicians.
                    From a very early period the little, civic communities of Greece had sent forth
                    numerous colonizing streams. At points so far asunder as the Tauric Chersonese,
                    Cyrene, and Massilia were found prosperous centres of Greek commercial energy;
                    but the regions most thickly peopled by settlers of Greek descent were the
                    western seaboard of Asia Minor, Sicily, and the southern parts of the Italian
                    peninsula. Nor were the least prosperous communities those which were sprung
                    from earlier colonies. The causes that led to the foundation of the Greek
                    colonies were very various. As in Phoenicia, pressure created by the narrow
                    limits of the home country coincided with an adventurous desire to seek new
                    sources of wealth beyond seas; but very many Greek emigrations were caused by
                    the expulsion of the inhabitants of conquered cities, or by the intolerable
                    domination of a hated but triumphant faction within the native state. The polity
                    of the new community, often founded in defiance of the home authorities, might
                    either be a copy of that just left behind or be its direct political antithesis.
                    But wherever they went, and whether, as apparently in Asia Minor, Greek blood
                    was kept free from barbaric mixture, or whether, as in Magna Graecia and Sicily,
                    it was mingled with that of tſie aboriginal races, the Greek emigrants carried
                    with them the Hellenic spirit and the Hellenic tongue; and the colonies
                    fostered, not infrequently more rapidly and more brilliantly than at home, Greek
                    literature, Greek art, and Greek speculation. The relation to be preserved
                    towards the mother states was seldom or never definitely arranged. But filial
                    feeling and established custom secured a measure of kindly sympathy, shown by
                    precedence yielded at public games, and by the almost invariable abstinence of
                    the colony from a hostile share in wars in which the mother city was
                    engaged.</p>
                <p>The relation of Rome to her colonies was altogether different. No Roman colony
                    started without the sanction and direction of the public authority; and while
                    the <hi rend="italic">Colonia</hi><hi rend="italic">Romana</hi> differed from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Colonia Latina</hi> in that the former permitted its
                    members to retain their political rights intact, the colony, whether planted
                    within the bounds of Italy or in provinces such as Gaul or Britain, remained an
                    integral part of the Roman state. In the earlier colonies, the state allotted to
                    proposing emigrants from amongst the needy or discontented class of citizens
                    portions of such lands as, on the subjection of a hostile people, the state took
                    into its possession as public property. At a later time, especially after the
                    days of Sulla, the distribution of the territories of a vanquished Roman party
                    was employed by the victorious generals as an easy means of satisfying the
                    claims of the soldiery by whose help they had triumphed. The Roman colonies were
                    thus not merely valuable as <hi rend="italic">propugnacula</hi> of the state, as
                    permanent supports to Roman garrisons and armies, but they proved a most
                    effective means of extending over wide bounds the language and the laws of Rome,
                    and of inoculating the inhabitants of the provinces with more than the rudiments
                    of Roman civilization.</p>
                <p>The occupation of the fairest provinces of the Roman empire by the northern
                    barbarians had little in common with colonization. The Germanic invaders came
                    from no settled state; they maintained loosely, and but for a short while, any
                    form of brotherhood with the allied tribes. A nearer parallel to Greek
                    colonization may be found in Iceland, whither the adherents of the old Norse
                    polity fled from the usurpation of Harold Haarfager; and the early history of
                    the English pale in Ireland shows, though not in orderliness and prosperity,
                    several points of resemblance to the Roman colonial system.</p>
                <p>Though both Genoese and Venetians in their day of power planted numerous trading
                    posts on various portions of the Mediterranean shores, of which some almost
                    deserve the name of colonies, the history of modem colonization on a great scale
                    opens with the Spanish conquests in America. The first Spanish adventurers came,
                    not to colonize, but to satisfy as rapidly as possible and by the labour of the
                    enslaved aborigines, their thirst for silver and gold. Their conquests were
                    rapid, but the extension of their permanent settlements was gradual and slow.
                    The terrible cruelty at first exercised on the natives was restrained, not
                    merely by the zeal of the missionaries, but by effective official measures; and
                    ultimately home-born Spaniards and Creoles lived on terms of comparative
                    fairness with the Indians and with the half-breed population. Till the general
                    and successful revolt of her American colonies, Spain maintained and employed
                    the latter directly and solely for what she conceived to be her own advantage.
                    Her commercial <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n184/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0184-0159"/> policy was one of most irrational and intolerable
                    restriction and repression; and till the end of Spanish rule on the American
                    continent, the whole political power was retained by the court at Madrid, and
                    administered in the colonies by an oligarchy of home-bred Spaniards.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese colonization in America, in most respects resembling that of
                    Spain, is remarkable for the development there given to an institution sadly
                    prominent in the history of the European colonies. The nearness Of Brazil to the
                    coast of Africa made it easy for the Portuguese to supply the growing lack of
                    native labour by the wholesale importation of purchased or kidnapped
                    Africans.</p>
                <p>Of the French it is admitted that in their colonial possessions they displayed an
                    unusual faculty for conciliating the prejudices of native races, and even for
                    assimilating themselves to the latter. But neither this nor the genius of
                    successive governors and commanders succeeded in preserving for France her once
                    extensive colonies in Canada or her great influence in India. In Algeria the
                    French Government has not merely found a practical training school for her own
                    soldiers, but by opening a recruiting field amongst the native tribes it has
                    added an available contingent to the French army.</p>
                <p>The Dutch took early a leading share in the carrying trade of the various
                    European colonies. They have still extensive plantations in the East Indian
                    Archipelago; and though their settlement at the Cape passed into British hands,
                    a republic of Dutch-speaking boers maintains a precarious existence northward
                    from the British posséssions. The Danish and Swedish dependencies in the
                    Antilles are but trifling in extent or importance.</p>
                <p>It is the English-speaking race that has shown an unexampled energy and capacity
                    for colonization. The English settlements in Virginia, New England, Maryland,
                    and Pennsylvania had, between the second decade of the 17th and the seventh
                    decade of the 18th century, developed into a new nation that was soon able to
                    take rank with the most powerful of European states. Promoted in great measure
                    by the desire to escape from the political or religious oppression of the
                    English court, the transatlantic settlements were, though remaining under
                    governors appointed by England, permitted to arrange their civil
                    polity—necessarily assuming a democratic shape—very much as they chose; and, at
                    first, troubles at home, and later, their distance, saved the colonies from much
                    political interference on the part of successive English Governments. Though by
                    the “Navigation Laws” and other enactments, England had always undertaken to
                    regulate, in her own interest, the commercial relations between herself and her
                    American colonists, encroachment, in the matter of taxation, on the immunity
                    till then enjoyed provoked the spirit that in 1776 “solemnly published and
                    declared that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and
                    independent States.” The vast unoccupied territories of the United States
                    relieve her citizens and the immigrants who join them from seeking scope for
                    their enterprize beyond the recognized limits of the Republic; but the method
                    according to which the United States Government provides for the continuous
                    westward advance of new settlements is essentially a system of colonization. The
                    newly occupied lands are governed as a “territory” by the Federal Government,
                    till the population reaches a fixed limit high enough to justify a demand to be
                    admitted to the Union on an equal footing with the other States. The “American
                    Colonization Society” has made in interesting philanthropic experiment for the
                    establishment of negro freedmen in Africa; the result is the existing
                    independent Republic of Liberia.</p>
                <p>It is estimated that the existing colonies and depen dencies of Great Britain
                    cover about one-sixth of the landsurface of the globe, and nearly the same
                    proportion of its population. The various origin of these colonial possessions,
                    and their different relations to the Crown of Great Britain, suggest the
                    question, How the foreign dependencies of a sovereign state may best be
                    classified <hi rend="italic">ì</hi></p>
                <p>It is clear that the ultimate constitution of a colony depends but little on the
                    manner in which the territory for settling was originally acquired. Whether it
                    was by conquest or by formal cession from a foreign power, the new population,
                    even if, as in the case of Canada, it at first consisted largely of people alien
                    in blood and language to the colonizing country, may soon obtain a constitution
                    and relations to the ruling state identical with those of lands originally
                    acquired from thinly-scattered and wandering savages merely by the occupancy of
                    citizen emigrants. Of almost equal unimportance for the future organization of
                    the colony are the motives which led the earliest settlers to emigrate. The
                    caprice of mere adventurers, the desperate desire of broken men to repair their
                    fortunes, .and the stern determination of public-spirited men to escape for ever
                    some unendurable civil or religious grievance at home, have in their turn given
                    rise to colonies now hardly distinguishable in tlïeir general features. Whether
                    the emigration be purely voluntary and undertaken with or without official
                    sanction, or systematically promoted by a Government for the furtherance of
                    national commerce or in order to relieve itself of over-population; whether the
                    new lands be handed over under a royal charter to a company, or granted, as
                    proprietary, to an individual, the traces of the initiatory conditions may
                    speedily disappear. And around a military outpost, a mere trading factory, or
                    the prison walls of a penal settlement, a numerous and enterprizing population
                    may soon be tending increasing herds or engaged in the steady and profitable
                    tillage of the soil.</p>
                <p>The circumstances whereon the characteristic development and permanent
                    constitution of the colony depend are the physical conditions of the
                    territory—its climate and its products. A colony in the fullest sense of our
                    usage of the term can arise only where the European colonist may look on his
                    adopted habitation as his permanent home, where he can found a family and rear
                    his children in robust health, where his and their growing patriotism may come
                    to regard their interests as bound up with the well-being of the community of
                    which they form a part. Here alone can “daughter lands” hope to establish a
                    polity that, without wholly severing the bond that unites them to the parent
                    country, shall secure for them the self-government which the British emigrant
                    regards as his birthright. New nations of the European stock can arise only
                    where the cereals thrive, where the settler can without physical harm undergo
                    the fatigue of rearing and tending his flocks, and where the line that divides
                    master from servant is narrow and easily passed—that is, in a temperate climate.
                    On these conditions it depends whether a foreign settlement shall be, on the one
                    hand, an <hi rend="italic">agricultural ox pastoral</hi> colony, or, on the
                    othçr, a <hi rend="italic">plantation</hi> colony merely. In the plantation the
                    European is a cultivator too, and may from year to year superintend his crops of
                    sugar, coffee, or tobacco; but his relation to the soil on which he lives is
                    comparatively a loose and transitory one. The difficulty of maintaining health
                    undeteriorated by the tropical climate for more than a few years, and the
                    impossibility of rearing a family in physical vigour, compel the planter to
                    regard Europe as his home, even though his interests in the plantation pass to
                    sons bred in a northern climate. They in their turn go abroad only to hasten
                    home as soon as their views of what constitutes a competency admit. The number
                    of European residents remains small; and the necessity of employing negro or
                    coolie labour must divide the population into two castes,—one of masters and one
                    of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n185/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0185-0160"/> servants. And thus results the impossibility of
                    that equal distribution of privileges and of responsibilities wherein lies the
                    advantage of local self-government. Into one or other of the two classes of
                    colonies thus distinguished those sometimes technically termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >mining</hi> and <hi rend="italic">trading</hi> colonies are, according to
                    circumstances, likely to pass. The trading colony, so long as it is a mere
                    factory or emporium of commodities, differs but little from the settlements of
                    Europeans within the bounds of foreign states such as China, sometimes loosely
                    spoken of as colonies of Europeans. The term <hi rend="italic">internal
                    colonization</hi> is occasionally used of schemes for promoting the prosperity
                    of thinly-peopled and unfertile areas in some European states. The <hi
                    rend="italic">military colonies</hi> planted by Austria along her southern
                    frontier serve a useful and very obvious purpose.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Colonial Office List</hi> arranges British dependencies
                    under three heads, according to their governmental relations with the English
                    Crown. Officially, British “colonial possessions” are either :—1. “Crown
                    colonies, in which the Crown has the entire control of legislation, while the
                    administration is carried on by public officers under the control of the Home
                    Government; 2. Colonies possessing representative institutions but not
                    responsible government, in which the Crown has no more than a veto on
                    legislation, but the Home Government retains the control of public officers; 3.
                    Colonies possessing representative institutions and responsible government, in
                    which the Crown has only a veto on legislation, and the Home Government has no
                    control over any officer except the governor. . . . Under responsible government
                    the executive councillors are appointed by the governor alone with reference to
                    the exigencies of representative government, the other public officers by the
                    governor on the advice of the Executive Council. In no appointment is the
                    concurrence of the Home Government requisite.” Some of the dependencies ranked
                    here as Crown colonies can be called colonies only in a very loose sense.
                    Military stations, such as Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, are convenient both to the
                    navy and the commercial marine as coaling stations or ports for repair and for
                    provisioning. The distinction between classes 2 and 3 is manifestly temporary,
                    in most cases at least; there being, for example, no reason why an agricultural
                    colony like that at the Cape, at present without “responsible government,”
                    should not ere long possess that privilege. India, a “Crown colony” in the list,
                    is rarely spoken of under that name; the enormous numerical disparity between
                    the handful of resident Europeans and the millions of civilized natives makes it
                    seem incongruous to put India under the same category as Canada or Victoria, and
                    to some extent justifies the recent adoption of the title “Empress of India” by
                    the Queen.</p>
                <p>It is rather the force of circumstances than the consistent maintenance of any
                    definite policy that has shaped the relation of England to her various
                    dependencies. But the colonial policy of the future has of late been largely
                    debated, and with widely divergent issues. The “colonial system” so long
                    maintained by England, as well as by all other powers, has been finally
                    abandoned. No one now claims that the mother country has the right, still less
                    that in self-defence she is bound, to restrict and hamper the trade of the
                    colony for her own benefit; nor are there now found many to advocate the
                    differential duties in favour of colonial produce, which that ancient system
                    rendered all but necessary. Many, indeed, go to an opposite extreme, and argue
                    that for both sides it would be better that the interdependent relation should
                    be totally sundered, and each colony, as soon as possible, left to shift for
                    itself. The trade of neither party, it is alleged, gains anything by the
                    maintenance of the connection; the European state is exposed to needless risk in
                    time of war by her responsibility to her scattered dependencies, and to
                    additional expense in providing against that risk; while the colonies are liable
                    to be dragged into wars with which they have no concern. The good-will arising
                    from the sense of common origin would, it is said, amply maintain all the mutual
                    advantages enjoyed under the present system, and would secure a virtual
                    confederacy. The democratic experiments some of our colonies have been freely
                    permitted to. carry out, and their trade legislation, divergent from that of
                    England, the incorporative federation of contiguous colonies, and. the
                    withdrawal of royal troops from the most developed colonial communities, are by
                    many regarded as actual steps’ taken in the direction of an eventual separation.
                    To another class of theorizers it appears that a “personal union,” the entire
                    legislative independence of the colonies with allegiance to the sovereign of the
                    old country, would better secure the well-being of the several parts of the
                    empire thus constituted; while again others contend that the interests of
                    England and of her possessions abroad, and the cause of freedom and civilization
                    throughout the world, would gain if the bonds of relation were yet more closely
                    drawn together, and if provision could be made for the representation of the
                    colonies in the imperial parliament. Meanwhile, that parliament is supreme over
                    the whole British empire; all the proceedings in the colonial legislatures are
                    liable to be annulled by the Crown. The Crown appoints all governors, is the
                    supreme fountain of justice, and has the sole right of declaring peace and war
                    save in so far as that power is, under certain conditions, delegated to the
                    Governor-general of India; while the admitted aim of colonial policy is to
                    develop the colonies socially, politically, and commercially quite as much as if
                    their ultimate independence were the end contemplated.</p>
                <p>Whether European Governments systematically encourage or repress emigration, it
                    is clear that the overgrowth of population in the more densely-peopled centres
                    of the old civilization must continue to send forth emigrants and to increase
                    the already rapid growth of the existing colonies. It is significant for the
                    future of European colonization that, of available territory in the temperate
                    regions of America and Australasia (the temperate portions of Central Asia
                    being, as inaccessible, ill adapted for European settlements), eighty per cent,
                    is calculated to belong to the Anglo-Saxon race; and while t⅛e colonies of the
                    English-speaking race have welcomed industrious men of all nationalities,
                    tongues, and religious and political prepossessions, the colonial institutions,
                    even where they differ most widely in their administration from those of
                    England, bear an unmistakably English stamp, and have been manifestly moulded by
                    an English spirit.</p>
