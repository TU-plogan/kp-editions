                <p><label type="entry">CORN LAWS</label>. Legislation on corn was early applied both
                    to the home and foreign trade in this essential produce. Roads were so bad, and
                    the chain of home trade so feeble, that there was often scarcity of grain in one
                    part, and plenty in another part of the same kingdom. Export by sea or river to
                    some foreign market was in many cases more easy than the carriage of corn from
                    one market to another within the country. The frequency of local dearths, and
                    the diversity and fluctuation of prices, were thus extreme. It was out of this
                    general situation that the first corn laws arose, and they appear to have been
                    wholly directed towards lowering the price of corn. Exportation was prohibited,
                    and home merchandize in grain was in no repute or toleration. As long as the
                    rent of land, including the extensive domains of the Crown, was paid in kind,
                    the sovereign, the barons, and other landholders had little interest in the
                    price of corn different from that of other classes of people, the only demand
                    for corn being for consumption, and not for re-sale or export. But as rents of
                    land came to be paid in money, the interest of the farmer to be distinguished by
                    a remove from that of the landowner, the difference between town and country to
                    be developed, and the business of society to be more complex, the ruling powers
                    of the state were likely to be actuated by other views; and hence the force
                    which corn legislation afterward assumed in favour of what was deemed the
                    agricultural interest. But during four centuries after the Conquest the corn law
                    of England simply was that export of corn was prohibited, save in years of
                    extreme plenty under forms of state licence, and that producers carried their
                    surplus grain into the nearest market town, and sold it there for what it would
                    bring among those who wanted it to consume: and the same rule prevailed in the
                    principal countries of the Continent. This policy, though, as one may argue from
                    its long continuance, probably not felt to be acutely oppressive, was of no
                    avail in removing the evils against which it was directed. On the contrary it
                    prolonged and aggravated them. The prohibition of export discouraged
                    agricultural improvement, and in so much diminished the security and liberality
                    even of domestic supply; while the intolerance of any home dealing or
                    merchandize in corn prevented the growth of a commercial and financial interest
                    strong enough to improve the means of transport by which the plenty of one part
                    of the same country could have come to the aid of the scarcity in another.</p>

                <p>Apart from this general feudal germ of legislation on corn, the history of the
                    British corn laws, as they have come down to recent times, may be said to have
                    begun with the statute in the reign of Henry VI., 1436, by which exportation was
                    permitted without state licence, when the price of wheat or other corn fell
                    below certain prices. The reason given in the preamble of the statute was that
                    the previous state of the law had compelled farmers to sell their corn at low
                    prices, which was no doubt true, but which also showed the important turn of the
                    tide that had then set in. M <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Culloch, in his
                    elaborate article in the <hi rend="italic">Commercial Dictionary,</hi> to which
                    reference may be made for the most authentic details on this subject, says that
                    the fluctuation of the prices of corn in that age was so great, and beyond all
                    present conception, that “it is not easy to determine whether the exportation
                    price of 6s. 8d. for wheat” [l2s. lθd. in present money per quarter] “was above
                    or below the medium price.” But while the medium price of the kingdom must be
                    held to be unascertainable in a remote time, when the medium price in any
                    principal market town of England did not agree with that of another for any year
                    or series of years, one may readily perceive that the cultivators of the wheat
                    lands in the south-eastern counties of England, for example, who could
                    frequently have sold their produce in that age to Dutch merchants to better
                    advantage than in their own market towns, or even in London, but were prohibited
                    to export abroad, and yet had no means of distributing their supplies at home so
                    as to realize the highest medium price in England, must have <pb break="no"

                    of the shire would have a common interest in making a strong effort to rectify
                    the injustice in Parliament. This object appears to have been in some measure
                    accomplished by this statute, and twenty-seven years afterwards ( 1463) a
                    decided step was taken towards securing to agriculturists a monopoly of the home
                    market by a statute prohibitory of importation from abroad. Foreign import was
                    to be permitted only at and above the point of prices where the export of
                    domestic produce was prohibited. The landed interest had now adopted the idea of
                    sustaining and equalizing the value of corn, and promoting their own industry
                    and gains, which for four centuries, under various modifications of plan, and
                    great changes of social and political condition, were to maintain a firm place
                    in the legislation and policy of England. But there were many reasons why this
                    idea, when carried into practice, should not have the results anticipated from
                    it.</p>
                <p>The import of grain from abroad, even in times of dearth and high prices at home,
                    could not be considerable as long as the policy of neighbouring countries was to
                    prohibit export; nor could the export of native corn, even with the Dutch and
                    other European ports open to such supplies, be effective save in limited
                    maritime districts, as long as the internal corn trade was suppressed, not only
                    by want of roads, but by legal interdict. The regulation of liberty of export
                    and import by rates of price, moreover, had the same practical objection as the
                    various sliding-scales, bounties, and other legislative expedients down to 1846,
                    viz., that they failed, probably more in that age than in later times, to create
                    a permanent market, and aimed only at a casual trade. When foreign supplies were
                    needed, they were often not to be found; and when there was an excess of corn in
                    the country a profitable outlet was both difficult and uncertain. It would
                    appear, indeed, that during the Wars of the Roses the statutes of Henry VI. and
                    Edward IV. had become obsolete; for a law regulating export prices in identical
                    terms of the law of 1436 was re-enacted in the reign of Philip and Mary (1554).
                    In the preceding reign of Edward VI., as well as in the succeeding long reign of
                    Elizabeth, there were unceasing complaints of the decay of tillage, the dearth
                    of corn, and the privations of the labouring classes; and these complaints were
                    met by the same kind of measures—by statutes encouraging tillage, forbidding the
                    enlargement of farms, imposing severer restrictions on storing and buying and
                    selling of grain, and by renewed attempts to regulate export and import
                    according to prices. In 1562 the price at which export might take place was
                    raised to 1 Os. per quarter for wheat, and 6s. 8d. for barley and malt. This
                    only lasted a few years, and in 1570 the export of wheat and barley was
                    permitted from particular districts on payment of a duty of Is. 8d. per quarter,
                    although still liable to prohibition by the Government or local authority, while
                    it was entirely prohibited under the old regulations from other districts. Only
                    at the close of Elizabeth’s reign (1603) did a spark of new light appear in a
                    further statute, which removed the futile provisions in favour of tillage and
                    against enlargement of pastoral farms, and rested the whole policy for promoting
                    an equable supply of corn, while encouraging agriculture, on an allowed export
                    of wheat and other grain at a duty of 2s. and Is. 4d. when the price of wheat
                    was not more than 20s., and of barley and malt 12s. per quarter. The import of
                    corn appears to have been much lost sight of from the period of the statute of
                    1463. The internal state of England, as well as the policy of other countries of
                    Europe, was unfavourable to any regular import of grain, though many parts of
                    the kingdom were often suffering from dearth of corn. It is obvious that this
                    legislation, carried over more than a century and a halt’, failed of its
                    purpose, and that it neither promoted agriculture, nor increased the supply of
                    bread. So great a variance and conflict between the intention of statutes and
                    the actual course of affairs might be deemed inexplicable, but for an
                    explanation which a close economic study of the circumstances of the times
                    affords.</p>
                <p>Besides the general reasons of the failure already indicated, there were three
                    special causes in active operation, which, though not seen at the period, have
                    become distinct enough since. (1) A comparatively free export of wool had been
                    permitted in England from time immemorial. It was subject neither to conditions
                    of price nor to duties in the times under consideration, was easier of transport
                    and much less liable to damage than corn, and, under the extending manufactures
                    of France and the Low Countries, was sure of a foreign as well as a domestic
                    market. Here was one description of rural produce on which there was the least
                    embargo, and on which some reliance could be placed that it would in all
                    circumstances bring a fair value; while corn, the prime rural produce, was
                    subject as a commodity of merchandize to every difficulty, internally and
                    externally, which meddling legislation and popular prejudice could impose. The
                    numerous statutes enjoining tillage and discouraging pastoral farms—or in other
                    words requiring that agriculturists should turn from what was profitable to what
                    was unprofitable—had consequently no substantial effect, save in the many
                    individual instances in which the effect may have been injurious. (2) The value
                    of the standard money of the kingdom had been undergoing great depreciation from
                    two opposite quarters at once. The pound sterling of England was reduced in
                    weight of pure metal from £1, l8s. 9d. in 1436, the date of the first of the
                    corn statutes, to 4s. 7¾d. in 1551, as far as can be estimated in present money,
                    and to £1, Os. 6∣d. under the restoration of the coinage in the following year.
                    At the same time the greater abundance of silver, which now began to be
                    experienced in Europe from the discovery of the South American mines, was
                    steadily reducing the intrinsic value of the metal. Hence a general rise of
                    prices remarked by Hume and other historians; and hence also it followed that a
                    price of corn fixed for export or import at one period became always at another
                    period more or less restrictive of export than had been designed. (3) The wages
                    of labour would have followed the advance in the prices of commodities had they
                    been left free, but they were kept down by statute to the three or four pence
                    per day at which they stood, when the pound sterling contained one-fourth more
                    silver, and silver itself was much more valuable,—a refinement of cruelty, for
                    which an excuse is hardly to be found in the prevailing ignorance of principles
                    of political economy, great as that was. The feudal system was breaking up; ã
                    wage-earning population was rapidly increasing both in the farms and in the
                    towns; but the spirit of feudalism remained, and the iron collar of serfdom was
                    rivetted round the necks of the labourers by these statutes many generations
                    after they had become nominally freemen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> Mr M'Culloch, to whose researches on this subject every
                    subsequent writer must be much indebted, found from a comparison of the prices
                    of corn and wages of labour in the reign of Henry VII. and the latter part of
                    the reign of Elizabeth, that in the former period a labourer could earn a
                    quarter of wheat in 20, a quarter of rye in 12, and a quarter of barley in 9
                    days; whereas, in the latter period, to earn a quarter of wheat required 48, a
                    quarter of rye 32, and a quarter of barley 29 days’ labour. See the article <hi

                    barbarized; and an age, in some high respects among the most brilliant in the
                    annals of England, was marked by an enormous <pb break="no"

                    the merciful but wasteful remedy of the Γoor Laws.</p>
                <p>The corn legislation of Elizabeth remained without change during the reign of
                    James, the civil wars, and the Commonwealth. But on the restoration of Charles
                    II. in 1660, the question was resumed, and an Act was passed of a more
                    prohibitory character. Export and import of corn, while nominally permitted,
                    were alike subjected to heavy duties—the need of the Exchequer being the
                    paramount consideration, while the agriculturists were no doubt pleased with the
                    complete command secured to them in the home market. This Act was followed by
                    such high prices of corn, and so little advantage to the revenue, that
                    Parliament in 1663 reduced the duties on import to 9 per cent. <hi rend="italic"
                    >ad valorem,</hi> while at the same time raising the price at which export
                    ceased to 48s., and reducing the duty on export from 20s. to 5s. 4d. per
                    quarter. In a few years this was found to be too much free-trade for the
                    agricultural liking, andin 1670 prohibitory duties were re-imposed on import
                    when the home price was under 53s. 4d., and a duty of 8s. between that price and
                    80s., with the usual make-weight in favour of home supply, that export should be
                    prohibited when the price was 53s. 4d. and upwards. But complaints of the
                    decline of agriculture continued to be as rife under this Act as under the
                    others, till on the accession of William and Mary, the landed interest, taking
                    advantage of the Revolution as they had taken advantage of the Restoration to
                    promote their own interests, took the new and surprising step of enacting a
                    bounty on the export of grain, which continued to infect the corn laws of the
                    kingdom, varied, on one occasion at least, with the further complication of
                    bounties on import, until a comparatively recent period. The duties on export
                    being abolished, while the heavy duties on import were maintained, this is
                    probably the most one-sided form which the British corn laws ever assumed, but
                    it was attended with none of the advantages anticipated. The prices of corn
                    fell, instead of rising. There had occurred at the period of the Revolution a
                    depreciation of the money of the realm, analogous in one respect to that which
                    marked the first era of the corn statutes (1436-1551), and forming one of the
                    greatest difficulties which the Government of William had to encounter. The coin
                    of the realm was greatly debased, and as rapidly as the mint sent out money of
                    standard weight and purity, it was melted down, and disappeared from the
                    circulation. The influx of silver from South America to Europe had spent its
                    action on prices before the middle of the century; the precious metals had again
                    hardened in* value; and for forty years before the Revolution the price of corn
                    had been steadily falling in money price. The liberty of exporting wool had also
                    now been cut down before the English manufactures were able to take up the home
                    supply, and agriculturists were consequently forced to extend their tillage.
                    When the current coin of the kingdom became wholly debased by clipping and other
                    knaveries, there ensued both irregularity and inflation of nominal prices, and
                    the producers and consumers of corn found themselves equally ill at ease. The
                    farmers complained that the home-market for their produce was unremunerative and
                    unsatisfactory; the masses of the people complained with no less reason that the
                    money wages of labour could not purchase them the usual necessaries of life.
                    Lord Macaulay, in his <hi rend="italic">History of England,</hi> says of this
                    period, with little exaggeration, that “the price of the necessaries of life, of
                    shoes, of ale. of oatmeal, rose fast. The labourer found that the bit of metal
                    which, when he received it, was called a shilling, would hardly, when he
                    purchased a pot of beer or a loaf of rye bread, go as far as sixpence.” The
                    state of agriculture could not be prosperous under these conditions. But when
                    the Government of William surmounted this difficulty of the coinage, as they did
                    surmount it, under the guidance of Sir Isaac Newton, with remarkable
                    statesmanship, it necessarily followed that prices, so far from rising,
                    declined, because, as one reason, they were now denominated in a solid metallic
                    value. The rise-of prices of corn attending the first years of the export bounty
                    was consequently of very brief duration. The average price of wheat in the
                    Winchester market, which in the ten years 1690-99 was <hi rend="italic">£2,</hi>
                    10s., fell in the ten years 1716-25 to £1, 5s. 4d., and in the ten years 1746-55
                    to £1, Is. 2¾d. These figures are enough to dispel much illusion as to the
                    effect of promoting particular branches of industry by legislative and fiscal
                    protection. The system of corn law established in the reign of William and Mary
                    was probably the most perfect to be conceived for advancing the agricultural
                    interest of any country. Every stroke of the legislature seemed complete to this
                    end. Yet it wholly failed of its purpose, because no industrial interest
                    whatever can by any artificial means prosper, save in harmonious connection with
                    the progress of other interests. If the price of wheat again rose in 1750-60 and
                    1760-70 to £1, 19s. 3¾d. and £2, Ils. 3¾d., it was simply because many causes
                    had meanwhile been at work, as invariably happens in such economic developments,
                    the operation of which no statutes could embrace, either to control or to
                    prevent. Between the reign of William and Mary and that of George III., the
                    question of bounty on export of grain had, in the general progress of the
                    country, fallen into the background, while that of the heavy embargoes on import
                    had come to the front. Therefore it is that Burke’s Act of 1773, as a deliberate
                    attempt to bring the corn laws into some degree of reason and order, is worthy
                    of special mention. This statute permitted the import of foreign wheat at a
                    nominal duty of 6d. when the home price was 48s. per quarter, and it stopped
                    both the liberty to export and the bounty on export together when the home price
                    was 44s. per quarter. There was probably an error in stopping export and cutting
                    ofl bounty on export at the same point of price. But apart from this passing
                    blemish, the statute of 1773 was worthy of the genius of Burke, and it would
                    have been well for the country to have imbibed more fully its spirit and
                    principles.</p>
                <p>Fewquestions have been more discussed or more differently interpreted than the
                    elaborate system of com laws dating from the reign of William and Mary. Even so
                    careful an observer as Malthus was of opinion that the bounty on export had
                    enlarged the area of subsistence. But a bounty on export is obviously liable to
                    the same objection as a heavy duty on foreign import. It fails to create a
                    natural, and therefore permanent, market for the favoured produce. The foreigner
                    is induced at the expense of the exporting state to take the commodity at less
                    cost than it can be produced. A bounty on export consequently never adjusts
                    itself to the real conditions either at home or abroad. That the bounty on
                    export of corn had large operation is sufficiently attested by the fact that, in
                    the years from 1740 to 1751, bounties were paid out of the Exchequer to the
                    amount of £1,515,000, and in 1749 alone they amounted to £324,000. But the trade
                    thus forced was of no permanence, and the British exports of corn, which reached
                    a maximum of 1,667,778 quarters in 1749-50, had fallen to 600,000 quarters in
                    1760, and continued to decrease.</p>
                <p>Burke’s Act lasted long enough to introduce a regular import of foreign grain,
                    varying with the abundance or scarcity of the home harvest, yet establishing in
                    the end a systematic preponderance of imports over exports. The period,
                    moreover, was marked by great agricultural improvements, by extensive
                    reclamation of waste lands, and by an increased home produce of wheat, in the
                    twenty years from 1773 to 1793, of nearly 2,000,000 quarters. Nor had the course
                    of prices been unsatisfactory. The average price <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">£2,</hi> 6s. 3d., and in only three years of the twenty was the
                    price a fraction under <hi rend="italic">£2.</hi> But the ideas in favour of
                    greater freedom of trade, of which the Act of 1773 was an indication, and of
                    which another memorable example was given in Pitt’s Commercial Treaty with
                    France, were overwhelmed in the extraordinary excitement caused by the French
                    Revolution, and all the old corn law policy was destined to have a sudden
                    revival. The landowners and farmers complained that an import of foreign grain
                    at a nominal duty of 6d., when the price of wheat was only 48s., deprived them
                    of the ascending scale of prices when it seemed due; and on this instigation an
                    Act was passed in 1791, whereby the price at which importation could proceed at
                    the nominal duty of 6d. was raised to 54s., with a duty of 2s. 6d. from 54s. to
                    50s., and at 50s. and under 50s. a prohibitory duty of 24s. 3d. The bounty on
                    export was maintained by this Act, but exportation was allowed without bounty
                    till the price reached 46s.; and the permission accorded by the statute of 1773
                    to import foreign corn at any price, to be re-exported duty free, was modified
                    by a warehouse duty of 2s. 6d., in addition to the duties on import payable at
                    the time of sale, when the corn, instead of being re-exported, happened to be
                    sold for home consumption. The legislative vigilance in this statute to prevent
                    foreign bread from reaching the home consumer is remarkable. There were
                    deficient home harvests for some years after 1791, particularly in 1795 and
                    1797, and Parliament was forced to the new expedient of granting high bounties
                    on importation. At this period the country was involved in a great war; all the
                    customary commercial relations were violently disturbed; freight, insurance, and
                    other charges on import and export were multiplied fivefold; heavier and heavier
                    taxes were imposed; and the capital resources of the kingdom were poured with a
                    prodigality without precedent into the war channels. The consequence was that
                    the price of com, as of all other commodities, rose greatly; and the Bank of
                    England having stopped paying in specie in 1797, this raised nominal prices
                    still more under the liberal use of bank paper in loans and discounts, and the
                    difference that began to be established in the actual value of Bank of England
                    notes and their legal par in bullion.</p>
                <p>The average price of British wheat rose to <hi rend="italic">£5,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">1</hi> 9s. 6d. in 180L So unusual a value must have led to a large
                    extension of the area under wheat, and to much corn-growing on land that after
                    great outlay was ill prepared for it. In the following years there were
                    agricultural complaints; and in 1804, though in 1803 the average price of wheat
                    had been as high as £2, 18s. 10d., an Act was passed, so much more severe than
                    any previous statute, that its object would appear to have been to keep the
                    price of corn somewhere approaching the high range of 1801. A prohibitory duty
                    of 24s. 3d. was imposed on the import of foreign wheat when the home price was
                    63s. or less; and the price at which the bounty was paid on export was lowered
                    to 40s., while the price at which export might proceed without bounty was raised
                    to 54s. Judging from the prices that ruled during the remaining period of the
                    French wars, this statute would appear to have been effective for its end,
                    though, under all the varied action of the times on a rise of prices, it would
                    be difficult to assign its proper place in the general effect. The average price
                    of wheat rose to £4, 9s. 9d. in 1805, and the bank paper price in 1812 was as
                    high even as £6, 6s. 6d. The bullion prices from 1809 to 1813 ranged from 86s.
                    6d. to 100s, <hi rend="subscript"> w</hi> 3d. But it was foreseen that when the
                    wars ended aserious re action would ensue, and that the rents of land, and the
                    general condition of agriculture, under the warlike, protective, and monetary
                    stimulation they had received, would be imperilled. In the brief peace of 1814
                    the average bullion price cf British wheat fell to 55s.</p>
                <p>8cL All the means of select committees of inquiry on agricultural distress, and
                    new modifications of the corn laws, were again brought into requisition. The
                    first idea broached in Parliament was to raise the duties on foreign imports, as
                    well as the prices at which they were to be leviable, and to abolish the bounty
                    on export, while permitting freedom of export whatever the home price might be.
                    The latter part of the scheme was passed into law in the session of 1814; but
                    the irritation of the manufacturing districts against the new scale of import
                    duties was too great to be resisted. In the subsequent session an Act was
                    passed, after much opposition, fixing 80s. (14s. more than during the wars) as
                    the price at which import of wheat was to become free of duty.</p>
                <p>This Act of 1815 was intended to keep the price of wheat in the British markets
                    at about 80s. per quarter; but the era of w ar and great expenditure of money
                    raised by public loans had ended, the ports of the Continent -were again open to
                    some measure of trade and to the equalizing effect of tradç upon prices, the
                    Bank of England and other banks of issue had to begin the uphill course of a
                    resumption of specie payments, the nation had to begin to feel tho whole naked
                    weight of the war debt, and the idea of the protectors of a high price of corn
                    was proved by the event to be an utter hallucination. The corn statutes of the
                    next twenty years, though’ occupying an enormous amount of time and attention in
                    the Houses of Parliament, may bo briefly treated, for they are simply a record
                    of the impotence of legislation to maintain the price of a commodity at a high
                    point when all the natural economic causes in operation are opposed to it. In
                    1822 a statute was passed reducing the limit of prices at which importation
                    could proceed to 70s. for wheat, 35s. for barley, 25s. for oats; but behind this
                    apparent relaxation was a new scale of import duties, by which foreign grain was
                    subject to heavy three-month duties up to a price of 85s.,—17s. wſhen wheat w as
                    70s., 12s. when between 70s. and 80s., and 10s. when 85s., showing the grasping
                    spirit of the would-be monopolizers of the home supply of corn, and their
                    reluctance to believe in a lower range of value for com as for all other
                    commodities. This Act never operated, for the reason that, with the exception in
                    some few instances of barley, prices never were so high as its projectors had
                    contemplated. The corn trade had passed rapidly beyond reach of the statutes by
                    which it was to be so painfully controlled; and as there were occasional seasons
                    of scarcity, particularly in oats, the king in council was authorized for
                    several years to override the statutes, and do whatever the public interests
                    might require.</p>
                <p>In 1827 Canning introduced a new system of duties, under which there would have
                    been a fixed duty of ls. per quarter when the price of wheat was at or above
                    70s., and an increased duty of 2s. for every shilling the price fell below 69s.;
                    but though Canning’s resolutions were adopted by a large majority in the House
                    of Commons, his death and the consequent change of ministers involved the
                    failure of his scheme of corn duties. In the following year Mr Charles Grant
                    introduced another scale of import duties on corn, by which the duty was to be
                    23s. when the price was 64s., 16s. 8d. when the price -was 69s., and only Is.
                    when the price was 73s. or above 73s. per quarter; and this became law the same
                    year. This sliding scale was more objectionable, as a basis of foreign corn
                    trade, than that of Canning, though not following so closely shilling by
                    shilling the variation of prices, because of the abrupt leaps it made in the
                    amount of duties leviable. For example, a merchant who ordered a shipment of
                    foreign wheat when the home price was 70s. and rising to 73s., instead of having
                    a duty of Is. to pay, should on a backward drop of the home price to 69s. have
                    !6s. 8d. of duty to pay. The result was to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n441/mode/1up"

                    speculation into all transactions in foreign corn. The prices during most part
                    of this period were under the range at which import was practically prohibited.
                    The average price of British wheat was 96s. lld. in 1817, but from that point
                    there was in succeeding years a rapid and progressive decline, varied only by
                    the results of the domestic harvests, till in 1835 the average price of wheat
                    was 39s. 4d., of barley 29s. 1 Id., and oats 22s. The import of foreign grain in
                    these years consisted principally of a speculative trade, under a privilege of
                    warehousing accorded in the statute of 1773, and extended in subsequent Acts, by
                    which the grain might be sold for home consumption on payment of the duties, or
                    re-exported free, as suited the interest of the holders.</p>
                <p>The Act of 1822 admitted corn of the British possessions in North America under a
                    favoured scale of duties, and in 1825 a temporary Act was passed, allowing the
                    import of wheat from these provinces at a fixed duty of 5s. per quarter,
                    irrespective of the home price, which, if maintained, would have given some
                    stability to the trade with Canada. The idea of a fixed duty on all foreign
                    gram, however, appears to have grown in favour from about this period. It was
                    included in the programme of import duty reforms of the Whig Government in 1841,
                    and fell with its propound ers in the general election of that year. Sir Robert
                    Peel, on succeeding to office, and commencing his remarkable career as a
                    free-trade statesman, introduced and carried in 1842 a new sliding scale of
                    duties somewhat better adjusted to the current values. But public opinion by
                    this time had penetrated the imprudence of the whole system; and the prime
                    minister, convinced, as he confessed, by the arguments of Cobden and the
                    Anti-Corn Law League, and stimulated into action by the failure of the potato
                    crop in Ireland, put an effectual end to the history of the corn laws by the
                    famous Act 9 and 10 Vict. c. 22. It was provided under this measure that the
                    maximum duty on foreign wheat was to be immediately reduced to 1 Os. per quarter
                    when the price was under 48s., to 5s. on barley when the price was under 26s.,
                    and to 4s. on oats when the price was under 18s., with lower duties as prices
                    rose above these figures; but the conclusive part of the enactment was that in
                    three years—on 1st of February 1849—these duties were to cease, and all foreign
                    corn to be admitted at a duty of Is. per quarter, and all foreign meal and flour
                    at a duty of 4Jd. per cwt.—the same nominal imposts which were conceded to grain
                    and flour of British possessions abroad from the date of the Act. Moreover, in
                    1860, even these nominal duties were abolished in a Customs Duties Act, and
                    since that time corn and other provisions have been admitted into the United
                    Kingdom free of all fiscal charge.</p>
                <p>As has been remarked above more than once the distribution of corn supplies in
                    the kingdom was much impeded by laws directed against all dealing in corn as an
                    article of ordinary merchandize, apart from questions of foreign import or
                    export. The theory was that when corn was plentiful in any district it should be
                    consumed at what it would bring, without much respect to whether the next
                    harvest might be equally abundant, or to what the immediate wants of an
                    adjoining province of the same country might be. The first statute on the
                    subject appears to have been passed in the reign of Edward VI., though the
                    general policy had prevailed before that time both in popular prejudice and in
                    the feudal custom; and by this statute any one who bought corn to sell it again
                    was made liable to two months’ imprisonment with forfeit of the corn. A second
                    offence was punished by six months’ imprisonment and forfeit of double the value
                    of the corn, and a third by the pillory, and utter ruin. Severe as this statute
                    was, liberty was given by it to transport corn irom one part of the country
                    under licence to men of approved probity, which implied that there was to be
                    some buying of corn to sell it again and elsewhere. Practically “engrossing”
                    came to be considered buying wſholesale to sell again wholesale. “Forestalling”
                    was different, and tire statutes were directed against a class of dealers who
                    went forward and bought or contracted for corn and other provisions, and spread
                    false rumours in derogation of the public and open markets appointed by law, to
                    which our ancestors appear to have attached much importance, and probably in
                    these times not without reason. The statute of Edward VI. was modified by many
                    subsequent enactments, particularly by the statute of 1663, by which it was
                    declared that there could be no “engrossing” of corn when the price did not
                    exceed 48s. per quarter, and which Adam Smith recognized, though it adhered to
                    the variable and unsatisfactory element of price, as having contributed more to
                    the progress of agriculture than any previous law in the statute book. In 1773
                    these injurious statutes were abolished, but the penal character of “engrossing”
                    and “forestalling” had a root in the common law of England, as well as in the
                    popular prejudice, which kept the evil alive to a later period. As the public
                    enlightenment increased the judges were at no loss to give interpretations of
                    the common law consistent with public policy. Subsequent to the Act of 1773, for
                    example, one Waddington was convicted and punished for engrossing hops; but
                    though this was deemed a sound and proper judgment at the time, yet it was soon
                    afterwards overthrown in other cases, on the ground that'buying wholesale to
                    sell wholesale was not in “restraint of trade” as the former judges had assumed.
                    Popular antipathy to corn-dealers and corndealing survived to still more recent
                    times; but meal riots, and violent interference with the storing or movement of
                    grain, may be said to have wholly disappeared from the United Kingdom since the
                    repeal of the corn laws in 1846.</p>
                <p>Freedom of export of corn from customs duties has become the general rule of
                    nearly all foreign countries. The opening of so great a market as the United
                    Kingdom for corn free of import duty, from every quarter alike, was calculated
                    in itself to have considerable influence in dispelling the ancient prejudice
                    against a free export of grain. It is somewhat curious to remark that Spain,
                    which has not been forward in adopting modern ideas of trade, saw the advantage
                    to her various splendid wheat-producing provinces of freedom of export of wheat
                    as early as 1820, and three years afterwards extended this freedom to all
                    “fruits of the soil” in Spain, which has since remained the policy of the
                    country. But heavy duties on the import of cereal produce continue to be levied
                    there, and must fall with very different effects on various parts of a kingdom
                    in which the physical difficulties of interior transport are so great, and so
                    little has hitherto been done to overcome them. Rice imported into any part of
                    Spain is subject to a duty of 75s. per ton, wheat to 25s., dry pulse to 25s.,
                    oats to 21s. 8d., and barley, rye, and maize to 18s. 9d. per ton. The cereal
                    produce of Portugal is exported free of duty, but on the import of wheat and
                    flour by sea, there are duties at the rate of 6 rees per kilo on wheat and 8
                    rees on flour; inland, or through “dry ports,” the duty is 2 rees on wheat and 4
                    rees on flour. Export and import of grain in France were prohibited down to the
                    period of the repeal of the British corn laws, save when prices were below
                    certain limits in the one case and above certain other limits in the other. But
                    export of grain and flour from France has for many years been free of duty. On
                    the import of grain and flour, on the other hand, France not only levies duties,
                    but makes a distinction between countries within and beyond Europe. The duty on
                    grain imported into France from countries <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n442/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0442-0413"/> outside of Europe is 60 centimes, and on flour
                    If. 20c., per 100 kilos, and from countries in Europe on grain 3f. 60c., and on
                    flour 4f. 20c., per 100 kilos. These duties on import have accompanying
                    drawbacks on export when the grain has been converted into flour, or the flour
                    into biscuits. In Belgium the export and import of grain are alike free of duty,
                    and, as far as we have ascertained, this remark applies also to flour and other
                    manufactures of grain. The policy of the Netherlands, which was formerly
                    favourable to import and export of grain from the advantages possessed by
                    Rotterdam and Amsterdam as international entrepôts, has undergone some change in
                    recent times. For some years prior to 1845 there was a moderate sliding scale of
                    import duties on grain in Holland, and this gave place, on the ravages of the
                    potato disease which fell on many parts of that country with only less severity
                    than in Ireland, to a low fixed duty which proved satisfactory in its operation.
                    At the present time the import duties on grain, beans, pulse, &amp;c., are 1’50
                    guilders (2s. 6d.) per hectolitre, or 2 ’ 8 Winchester bushels, and on bread,
                    biscuit, flour, 40c. (8d.) per 100 lb; these exhibit, more especially in the
                    case of raw grain, a considerable increase on the duties which were deemed
                    sufficient and expedient about the period of the repeal of the English corn
                    laws. In Italy there are no duties on the export of grain, which, though
                    extremely irregular in one season as compared with another, shows a remarkable
                    progressive increase within the last fifteen years. Flour does not figure
                    largely in the list of Italian exports, and for this there may be some reason in
                    the peculiar tax which the Italian Government levies on the milling of all
                    grain, whether of domestic or foreign produce, and which can hardly be
                    compensated even by drawbacks on export as long as the domestic industry of
                    flour-making is cramped by a severe excise. This is the more worthy of being
                    remarked, because the commerce of Italy includes a great portion of the very
                    best qualities of wheat from the Black Sea; and in her flour, and macaroni, and
                    vermicelli preparations, so highly prized in her domestic consumption, she has a
                    basis of what might become a considerable foreign trade. The duties on import of
                    grain and flour in Italy are not high—75c. on wheat and other grain per 100
                    kilos, and 125f. on flour and 75c. on bran for the same quantity. The franc and
                    centime, being received in the Italian custom-houses in the paper-money of the
                    country, is of lower value than the franc and centime in France, though of the
                    same denomination in metallic coinage. From Austria and Hungary the export of
                    grain is also free of duty; and in the internal corn trade of the Austrian
                    empire, important measures of improvement now pending are likely to be
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p>The great countries, famous for a production of raw materials much beyond their
                    own means of consumption, are favourable, of course, to the utmost freedom of
                    export. The empire of China itself was never unwilling to sell to foreigners
                    tea, for which there was no domestic use. The United States promote transit and
                    export of corn, internally and externally, with all the intelligence and
                    resources of a civilized people. If the shareholders in railways and canals and
                    steam-boat lines in the United States were consulted, they would probably say
                    that this policy of freedom of export had been promoted beyond due bounds cf
                    equity. But on the other hand, the protective and prohibitive tariff of the
                    United States on necessary supplies to agriculturists must be held to be
                    equivalent; to an embargo on the export of American corn, as well as cotton,
                    tobacco, and other raw products of the soil. The same remark applies to Russia,
                    which, while expediting her export of raw produce with help of borrowed capital,
                    as much as possible, maintains a high tariff against foreign commodities, and
                    lays the foundation even of her conquests in the interior of Asia, by decreeing
                    that nothing shall be sold within her territories but what is of Russian
                    manufacture or Russian merchandize.</p>
                <p>The facility with which the soundest views of the efficacy of freedom of trade in
                    corn, as a permanent policy, may be called in question under circumstances of
                    extremity, was shown in the course of the recent famine in Bengal. A cry arose
                    in India for a prohibition of the export of rice, and was supported by some of
                    the most enlightened organa of public opinion at home. The governor-general,
                    Lord Northbrook, who had taken a different view of the situation, was subjected
                    to severe rebuke; but the more the reasons were examined the more clear it
                    became that the wisdom was on his part and the imprudence on the other.
                    Mauritius, for example, almost wholly tilled not only by subjects of Great
                    Britain but by natives of India, would have been reduced by prohibition of
                    export to almost-as great starvation as the poor people in the districts where
                    the harvest had failed. The rice of India, moreover, exported to Europe, was of
                    a quality seldom or never used by the common people of India, and its arrest
                    could have been of the slightest possible utility in relieving the famished
                    districts. Besides the whole internal trade and movement of rice in India had to
                    be taken into consideration. There was extreme scarcity in several provinces of
                    Bengal, but there was the usual abundance in many other parts of India. A decree
                    prohibiting export would have stopped the customary movement of rice in
                    Hindustan, diminished the supplies in all the central markets, and both
                    aggravated the calamity and put difficulties in the way of its being overcome.
                    The sound policy was to allow scope to all effective demand for rice in India
                    according to the ordinary course of trade, and as there were some tens of
                    thousands of people in a certain quarter of India who had no effective demand to
                    offer, to bring the help of the Government to their relief. This was the policy
                    pursued, and the result was that the famine in Bengal was relieved, as no famine
                    in India had been before, with the least avoidable disturbance of the markets on
                    which India is dependent for the sale of her surplus produce, <hi
