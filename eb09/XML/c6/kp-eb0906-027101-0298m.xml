                    monument, in 1672; and whether in England or in Ireland, at Bardsey near Leeds
                    or at some place unknown beyond St George’s Channel, has likewise been matter of
                    doubt and dispute; but we may presumably accept the authority of Lord Macaulay,
                    who decides against Dr Johnson in favour of the later date, and dismisses
                    without notice the tradition of an Irish birthplace. To Ireland, at all events,
                    is due the credit of his education,—as a schoolboy at Kilkenny, as an
                    undergraduate at Dublin. From college he came to London, and was entered as a
                    student of law at the Middle Temple. The first-fruits of his studies appeared
                    under the boyish pseudonym of “Cleophil,” in the form of a novel whose existence
                    is now remembered only through the unabashed avowal of so austere a moralist as
                    Dr Johnson, that he “would rather praise it than read it.” In 1693 Congreve’s
                    real career began, and early enough by the latest computation, with the
                    brilliant appearance and instant success of his first comedy, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Old Bachelor,</hi> under the generous auspices of Dryden, then as ever a
                    living and immortal witness to the falsehood of the vulgar charge which taxes
                    the greater among poets with jealousy or envy, the natural badge and brand of
                    the smallest that would claim a place among their kind. The discrowned laureate
                    had never, he said, seen such a first play; and indeed the graceless grace of
                    the dialogue was as yet only to be matched by the last and best work of
                    Etherege, standing as till then it had done alone among the barefaced
                    brutalities of Wycherley and Shadwell. The types of Congreve’s first work were
                    the common conventional properties of stage tradition; but the fine and
                    clear-cut style in which these types were reproduced was his own. The gift of
                    one place and the reversion of another were the solid fruits of hi» splendid
                    success. Next year a better play from the same hand met with worse fortune on
                    the stage, and with yet higher honour from the first living poet of his nation.
                    The noble verses, as faultless in the expression as reckless in the extravagance
                    of their applause, prefixed by Dryden to <hi rend="italic">The Double
                    Dealer,</hi> must naturally have supported the younger poet, if indeed such
                    support can have been required, against the momentary annoyance of assailants
                    whose passing clamour left uninjured and secure the fame of his second comedy;
                    for the following year witnessed the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n299/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0299-0272"/> crowning triumph, of his art and life, in the
                    appearance of <hi rend="italic">Love for Love.</hi> Two years later his ambition
                    rather than his genius adventured on the foreign ground of tragedy, and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Mourning Bride</hi> began such a long career of good fortune
                    as in earlier or later times would have been closed against a far better work.
                    Next year he attempted, without his usual success, a reply to the attack of
                    Jeremy Collier, the nonjuror, “on the immorality and profaneness of the English
                    stage,”—an attack for once not discreditable to the assailant, whose honesty and
                    courage were evident enough to approve him incapable alike of the ignominious
                    precaution which might have suppressed his own name, and of the dastardly
                    mendacity which would have stolen the mask of a stranger’s. Against this merit
                    must be set the mistake of confounding in one indiscriminate indictment the
                    levities of a writer like Congreve with the brutalities of a writer like
                    Wycherley,—an error which ever since has more or less perverted the judgment of
                    succeeding critics. The general case of comedy was then, however, as untenable
                    by the argument as indefensible by the sarcasm of its most brilliant and
                    comparatively blameless champion. Art itself, more than anything else, had been
                    outraged and degraded by the recent school of the Restoration; and the comic
                    work of Congreve, though different rather in kind than in degree from the
                    bestial and blatant licence of his immediate precursors, was inevitably for a
                    time involved in the sentence passed upon the comic work of men in all ways
                    alike his inferiors. The true and triumphant answer to all possible attacks of
                    honest men or liars, brave men or cowards, was then as ever to be given by the
                    production of work unarraignable alike by fair means or foul, by frank
                    impeachment or furtive imputation. In 1700 Congreve thus replied to Collier with
                    the crowning work of his genius,—the unequalled and unapproached master-piece of
                    English comedy. The one play in our language which may fairly claim a place
                    beside or but just beneath the mightiest work of Molière is <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Way of the World.</hi> On the stage which had recently acclaimed with
                    uncritical applause the author’s more questionable appearance in the field of
                    tragedy, this final and flawless evidence of his incomparable powers met with a
                    rejection then and ever since inexplicable on any ground of conjecture. During
                    the twenty-eight years which remained to him, Congreve produced little beyond a
                    volume of fugitive verses, published ten years after the miscarriage of his
                    master-piece. His even course of good fortune under Whig and Tory Governments
                    alike was counterweighed by the physical infirmities of gout and failing sight.
                    He died, January 29, 1729, in consequence of an injury received on a journey to
                    Bath by the upsetting of his carriage; was buried in Westminster Abbey, after
                    lying in state in the Jerusalem Chamber; and bequeathed the bulk of his fortune
                    to the chief friend of his last years, Henrietta, duchess of Marlborough,
                    daughter of the great duke, rather than to his family, which, according to
                    Johnson, was then in difficulties, or to Mrs Bracegirdle, the actress, with whom
                    he had lived longer on intimate terms than with any other mistress or friend,
                    but who inherited by his will only £200. The one memorable incident of his later
                    life was the visit of Voltaire, whom he astonished and repelled by his rejection
                    of proffered praise and the expression of his wish to be considered merely as
                    any other gentleman of no literary fame. The great master of well-nigh every
                    province in the empire of letters, except the only one in which his host reigned
                    supreme, replied that in that sad case Congreve would not have received his
                    visit.</p>
                <p>The fame of our greatest comic dramatist is founded wholly or mainly on but three
                    of his five plays. His first comedy was little more than a brilliant study after
                    such models as were eclipsed by this earliest effort of their imitator; and
                    tragedy under his hands appears rouged and wrinkled, in the patches and powder
                    of Lady Wishfort. But his three great comedies are more than enough to sustain a
                    reputation as durable as our language. Were it not for these we should have no
                    samples to show of comedy in its purest and highest form. Ben Jonson, who alone
                    attempted to introduce it by way of reform among the mixed work of a time when
                    comedy and tragedy were as inextricably blended on the stage as in actual life,
                    failed to give the requisite ease and the indispensable grace of comic life and
                    movement to the action and passion of his elaborate and magnificent work. Of
                    Congreve’s immediate predecessors, whose aim had been to raise on French
                    foundations a new English fabric of simple and unmixed comedy, Wycherley was of
                    too base m∙etal and Etherege was of metal too light to bo weighed against him;
                    and besides theirs no other or finer coin was current than the crude British ore
                    of Shadwell’s brutal and burly talent. Borrowing a metaphor from Landor, we may
                    say that a limb of Molière would have sufficed to make a Congreve, a limb of
                    Congreve would have sufficed to make a Sheridan. The broad and robust humour of
                    Vanbrugh’s admirable comedies gives him a place on the master’s right hand; on
                    the left stands Farquhar, whose bright light genius is to Congreve’s as female
                    is to male, or “as moonlight unto sunlight.” No English writer, on the whole,
                    has so nearly touched the skirts of Molière; but his splendid intelligence is
                    wanting in the deepest and subtlest quality which has won for Molière from the
                    greatest poet of his country and our age the tribute of exact and final
                    definition conveyed in that perfect phrase which salutes at once and denotes
                    him— “ce moqueur pensif comme un apôtre.” Only perhaps in a single part has
                    Congreve half consciously touched a note of almost tragic depth and suggestion;
                    there is something well-nigh akin to the grotesque and piteous figure of
                    Arnolphe himself in the unvenerable old age of Lady Wishfort, set off and
                    relieved as it is, with grace and art worthy of the supreme French master,
                    against the only figure on any stage which need not shun comparison even with
                    that of Célimène. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. c. s.)</hi></p>
