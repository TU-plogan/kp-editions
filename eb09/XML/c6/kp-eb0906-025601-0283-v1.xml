                        >condotta,</hi> conduct, <hi rend="italic">condurre,</hi> to lead; Latin,
                        <hi rend="italic">conducere)</hi> were leaders of military companies, often
                    numerous enough to constitute a large army, which they used to hire out to carry
                    on the wars of the Italian states. The condottieri played a very important part
                    in Italian history during the 14th and 15th centuries, especially from the
                    middle of the 14th to the middle of the 15th. The explanation of their origin is
                    to be sought in the special circumstances of Italy towards the close of the
                    Middle Ages. The republics and lordships into which the country was divided were
                    incessantly engaged in war, while the arts of peace and luxury were cultivated
                    to such a degree that the military spirit of the people had greatly declined in
                    comparison with the rest of Europe. In many cities, such as Milan, tyrants had
                    begun to supersede the old republican governments, and they found it much safer
                    to engage a mercenary army to fight their battles than to arm their own
                    subjects. Soldiers of foreign armies, which then as afterwards not seldom
                    overran the Italian soil, did not always return, but often stayed with their
                    feudal leaders, and lived at free quarters. Montreal d’Albarno, a gentleman of
                    the Provence, was the first to give a definite form to these lawless bands. A
                    severe discipline and an elaborate organization were introduced within the
                    company itself, while in their relations to the people the most barbaric licence
                    was permitted. Montreal himself was put to death at Rome by Cola di Rienza, and
                    Count Lando succeeded to the command. The Grand Company, as it was called, soon
                    numbered about 7000 cavalry and 1500 select infantry, and was for some years the
                    terror of Italy. They seem to have been Germans chiefly. On the conclusion
                    (1360) of the peace of Bretigny between England and France, Sir John Hawkwood,
                    an able general, led an army of English mercenaries, called the White Company,
                    into Italy, which, in the service of Pisa, and afterwards of Florence, took a
                    prominent part in the confused interminable wars of the next thirty years.
                    Towards the end of the century the Italians began to organize armies of the same
                    description, the first of importance being the company of St George, originated
                    by Alberigo, count of Barbiano. The defeat of the German emperor, Rupert, by the
                    great condottiere, Jacopo del Verme, due to the superior equipment and
                    organization of the Italian army, taught the northern barbarians to respect the
                    skill of the south. Shortly after, the organization of these mercenary armies
                    was carried to the highest perfection by Sforza Attendolo, condottiere in the
                    service of Naples, who had been a peasant of the Romagna, and by his rival
                    Braccio di Montone in the service of Florence. The army and the renown of Sfor/a
                    were inherited by his son Francesco Sforza, who married a natural daughter of
                    one of the Visconti of Milan, conducted the wars of that city against Venice,
                    and eventually became duke of Milan (1450), which his family continued to rule
                    for some generations. Less fortunate was another great condottiere, Carmagnola,
                    who first served one of the Visconti, and then conducted the wars of Venice
                    against, his former masters, but at last awoke the suspicion of the Venetian
                    oligarchy, and was put to death before the palace of St Mark (1432). Towards the
                    end of the 15th century, when the large cities had gradually swallowed up the
                    small states, and Italy itself was drawn into the general current of European
                    politics, and became the battle-field of powerful armies,—French, Spanish, and
                    German,—the condottieri disappeared. The soldiers of the condottieri were almost
                    entirely cavalry, and were clad in armour from head to foot. Not being connected
                    with the people among whom they fought by any of the ordinary ties of humanity,
                    and given up to all the licence of the worst profession in the world, they were
                    a dreadful scourge wherever they went.</p>
                <p>They were always ready to change sides at the prospect of higher pay. And as they
                    were connected with each other by the interest of a common profession, and the
                    possibility that the enemy of to-day might be the friend and fellowsoldier of
                    to-morrow, their battles were often as bloodless as they were theatrical.
                    Splendidly equipped armies of several thousand strong were known to fight for
                    several hours with hardly the loss of a man. (See Symonds’s <hi rend="italic"
