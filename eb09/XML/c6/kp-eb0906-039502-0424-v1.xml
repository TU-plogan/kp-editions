                    island of Greece, in the Ionian Sea, off the coast of Albania or Epirus, from
                    which it is separated by a strait varying in breadth from less than two to about
                    fifteen miles. In shape it is not unlike the sickle or <hi rend="italic"
                        >drepane,</hi> to vdιich it was compared by the ancients,—the hollow side,
                    with the town and harbour of Corfu in the centre, being turned towards the
                    Albanian coast. Its extreme length is about forty miles and its greatest breadth
                    about twenty. The area is estimated at 227 square miles, and the population is
                    about 72,500. Two high and well-defined ranges divide the island into three
                    districts, of which the northern is mountainous, the central undulating, and the
                    southern low-lying. The most important of the two ranges is that of San
                    Salvador, probably the ancient Istone, which stretches east and west from Cape
                    St Angelo to Cape St Stefano, and attains its greatest elevation of 3300 feet in
                    the summit from which it takes its name. The second culminates in the mountain
                    of Santi Deca, or Santa Decca, as it is called by misinterpretation of the Greek
                    designation oí "Aγιoι ∆εκα, or the Ten Saints. The whole island, composed as it
                    is of various limestone formations, presents great diversity of surface, and the
                    prospects from the more elevated spots are magnificent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetation and Agriculture.—</hi> Travellers generally agree
                    that, with the exception, perhaps, of Crete, Corfu is the most beautiful of all
                    the Greek isles, but resident foreigners complain of the monotonous colour of
                    the olive, whose grayish-green is little relieved by the cypress and pine, or
                    the mulberry and <hi rend="italic">jujubier.</hi> This lack of variety, which is
                    the more to be regretted as the island is adapted for the oak, the plane, the
                    Spanish chestnut, and the w alnut, is mainly due to the fact that the government
                    of Venice at one time gave premiums for planting olive-trees, partly to
                    encourage the produce of oil, and partly to discourage the raising of wheat.
                    Once planted, the olive has suited the people. Single trees of fi.-st quality
                    yield sometimes as much as 2 gallons of oil, and this with little trouble or
                    expense beyond the collecting and pressing of the fallen fruit. As the trees are
                    allowed to grow unrestrained, they are generally much larger and more
                    wide-spreading than those in Provence or Tuscany, and some are not less than
                    three centuries old. It is worthy of remark that Homer names, as adorning the
                    gaιden of Alcinous, seven plants only—the wild olive, the oil olive, the pear,
                    pomegranate, apple, fig, and vine. Of these the apple and pear are now very
                    inferior in Corfu; the others thrive well, and are accompanied by all the
                    fruit-trees known in Southern Europe, w’ith addition of the Japanese medlar (or
                    loquat) and, in some spots, of the banana. When undisturbed by cultivation, the
                    myrtle, arbutus, bay, and ilex form a rich brushwood and the minor <hi

                <p>Corfiot proprietors in general display little taste for the country, and their
                    absenteeism is probably increased by the “<hi rend="italic">colonia</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">perpetuafl</hi> by which the landlord grants a lease to the
                    tenant and his heirs for ever, in return for a rent, payable in kind, and fixed
                    at a certain proportion of the produce. Of old, a tenant thus obtaining half the
                    produce to himself was held to be co-owner of the soil to the extent of
                    one-fourth; and if he had three-fourths of the crop, his ownership came to
                    one-halt Such a tenant could not be expelled but for non-payment, bad culture,
                    or the transfer of his lease without the landlord’s consent. Attempts have been
                    made to prohibit so embarrassing a system; but as it is preferred by the
                    agriculturists, the existing laws permit it. The portion of the olive crop due
                    to the landlord, whether by <hi rend="italic">colonia</hi> or ordinary lease, is
                    paid, not according to the actual harvest, but in keeping with the estimates of
                    valuators mutually appointed, who, just before the fruit is ripe, calculate how
                    much each tree will probably yield. The large old fiefs <hi rend="italic"
                        >(baronie)</hi> in Corfu, as in the other islands, have left their traces in
                    the form of quit rents (known in Scotland by the name of feu-duties), generally
                    equal to one-tenth of the produce. But they have been much subdivided, and the
                    vassals may by law redeem them.</p>

                <p>The Corſiot peasantry are reputed the idlest of all the Ionians. The olive
                    receives little or no culture from them, and the vineries alone are laboured by
                    the broad heart-shaped hoe. The vintage, which begins on the festival of Santa
                    Croce, or the 26th of September (O.S.), is neither a pretty nor a lively scene,
                    and little care is taken in the various operations. None of the Corfu wines are
                    prized.</p>
                <p>Cottagers cultivate no gardens for themselves; they purchase their vegetables in
                    the Corfu market, and a considerable sum goes annually to buy in Apulia the
                    garlic and onions so largely used by the people.</p>
                <p>The capital (noticed below) is the only city or town of much extent in the
                    island; but there are a number of villages, such as Benizze, Gasturi, Ipso,
                    Glypho, with populations varying from 300 to 1000.</p>
                <p>Corfu contains very few and unimportant remains of antiquity. The site of the
                    ancient city of Kerkyra iswell ascertained, about 1 ⅜ miles to the south-east of
                    Corfu, upon the narrow piece of ground between the sea-lake of Calichiopulo and
                    the Bay of Castrades, in each of which it had a port. Under the hill of
                    Ascension are the remains of atemple, popularly calledof Neptune, a very simple
                    Doric structure, which still in its mutilated state presents some peculiarities
                    of architecture. Of Cassiope, the onlyothercity of ancientimportance, the name
                    is still preserved by the village of Cassopo, and there are some rude remains of
                    building on the site; but the temple of Zeus Cassius for which it was celebrated
                    has totally disappeared. Throughout the island there are numerous monasteries
                    and other buildings of Venetian erection, of which the best known are
                    Paleocastrizza, San Salvador, and Pelleka.</p>
                <p>The ancient Corcyreans delighted to identify their island with the Homeric
                    Scheria—the kingdom of Alcinous and his Phaeacian subjects; but the first
                    authentic event in the history of Corcyra is its colonization in 734 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> by the Corinthians, and the expulsion of the
                    previous Cretan and Liburnian settlers. So prosperous was the new community that
                    in a short time it rivalled the mother country, and in 695 B.c., in a sea-fight
                    which is remarkable as the first on record, destroyed the fleet which had been
                    sent to compel its allegiance. Not long afterwards, however, it was forced to
                    recognize Corinthian supremacy by the tyrant Periander, the son of Cypselus. At
                    a subsequent period its dissensions with the parent state brought on the
                    Peloponnesian war, during which it repelled several attempts of the
                    Lacedaemonians. After various vicissitudes it fell into the hands of Pyrrhus,
                    king of Epirus, and on his death it was seized by the Illyrian pirates. Under
                    the Romans, who obtained possession in 229 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> it
                    became an important naval station, and so continued till the fall of the Eastern
                    Empire. In 1081 Robert Guiscard, the Norman, captured Corfu, and in 1085 he died
                    at Cassopo. It was again conquered by his nephew Roger of Sicily in 1146; but it
                    was recovered by Manuel Comnenus in 1152. In 1192 Richard I. of England landed
                    at Corfu on his voyage from Palestine; and the forces of the fifth crusade were
                    welcomed to the island after the capture of Zara. The Genoese corsair, Leon
                    Vetrano, who had made himself master of what was then regarded as a Venetian
                    possession, was defeated and executed, and the Venetian senate in 1206 sent a
                    colony of ten noble families to secure its occupancy. Through the rest of the
                    13th and most of the 14th century, Corfu and the other Ionian Islands were a
                    prey by turns to corsairs, and to Greek and Neapolitan claimants; and it was not
                    till 1386 that the Corfiots voluntarily placed themselves under Venice, which in
                    1401, on the payment of 30,000 ducats, had its right to the island recognized by
                    Ladislas, king of Naples. Barbarossa ravaged Corfu in 1537, and Selim II. did
                    much the same in 1570. In 1571 the great fleet which was about to become
                    illustrious through the battle of Lepanto, was reviewed at Corfu by the
                    generalissimo, Don John of Austria. The last and greatest struggle for the
                    possession of the city and island was in 1716, when the forces of Achmet III.
                    were defeated by the Venetians under Count Schulenburg, already famous for his
                    crossing of the Oder and his share in t∏e battle of Malplaquet. The peace of
                    Campo Formio gave the Ionian Islands to the French, but in 1799 they were forced
                    to capitulate to a Russo-Turkish fleet. By the treaty of Paris, 1815, the
                    republic of the Ionian Islands was revived, and placed under the protectorate of
                    Great Britain, Corfu being the chief island of the group. In 1864 that
                    protectorate was resigned in favour of the kingdom of Greece, and Corfu now
                    forms one of the nomarchies of that country, along with the neighbouring islands
                    of Merlera, Fano, Salmastraki, Paxo, Antipaxo, and Leukadia.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Corfu,</hi> the capital of the above island, stands on the
                    broad part of a peninsula, whose termination in the citadel is cut from it by an
                    artificial fosse formed in a natural gulley, with a salt-water ditch at the
                    bottom. Seen from the water, or from a height, it is picturesque in masses, but
                    in detail it is not to be praised for either beauty or comfort. Having grown up
                    within fortifications, where every foot of ground was precious, there is nothing
                    spacious about it except the handsome esplanade between the town and the
                    citadel. Indeed, it is still, in spite of recent improvements, a perfect
                    labyrinth of narrow, tortuous, up-and-down streets, accommodating themselves to
                    the irregularities of the ground, few of them fit for wheel carriages. The
                    palace, built by Sir Thomas Maitland, is a large structure of white Maltese
                    stone, but the exterior has no architectural merits, although internally its
                    apartments are very stately. In several parts of the town may be found houses of
                    the Venetian time, with some traces of past splendour, but they are few, and are
                    giving place to structures in the modern and more convenient French style. Of
                    the thirty-seven Greek churches the most important are the cathedral, dedicated
                    to Our Lady of the Cave (17 ∏αvαγια <hi rend="italic">'fi&lt;πηλnhτισσa.)</hi>;
                    St Spiridion’s, with the tomb of the patron saint of the island; and the
                    suburban church of St Jason and St Sosipater, reputed the oldest in the island.
                    The city is the seat of a Greek and a Roman Catholic bishop; and it possesses a
                    gymnasium, a theatre, an agricultural and industrial society, and a library and
                    museum preserved in the buildings formerly devoted to the university, which was
                    founded by Lord Guildford in 1823, but disestablished on the cessation of the
                    English protectorate. There are three suburbs of some importance—Castrades,
                    Manduchio, and San Rocco. The old fortifications of the town, being so extensive
                    as to require a force of from 10,000 to 20,000 troops to man them, were in great
                    part thrown down by the English, and a simpler plan adopted, limiting the
                    defences to the island of Vido and the old citadel. Population about 25,000.</p>
