                <p><label type="entry">CROUP</label> (synonym, <hi rend="italic">Cynanche
                    trachealis),</hi> a common and dangerous form of disease, occurring chiefly in
                    young children. Its essential nature is an acute inflammation of the air
                    passages, particularly the larynx and trachea, accompanied with the exudation of
                    a fibrinous material or “false membrane” which spreads over the interior of the
                    tube, narrowing its calibre, and thus obstructing respiration.</p>
                <p>Croup occurs most frequently in the second and third years of life, although it
                    may affect children of any age. It is exceedingly rare in adults.</p>
                <p>The attack sometimes comes on suddenly in the night without previous warning, but
                    in general some premonitory symptoms exist in thfe shape of the phenomena of a
                    common cold or catarrh, which may precede the onset of the croup for several
                    days. There is a slight hoarseness of the voice and an occasional cough of a
                    peculiarly harsh or brassy sound, together with a feeling of pain in the throat
                    and breast, and a high degree of feverishness and general disturbance. The
                    disease soon assumes its characteristic features. The loud croupy cough comes on
                    in frequent paroxysms, and is attended with an increasing difficulty of
                    breathing, the respirations partaking of the shrill metallic noise of the cough,
                    while the voice is reduced to a hoarse whisper. The child lies with the head
                    thrown back, making strong efforts to breathe, the countenance indicating
                    intense suffering and anxiety. At first little or nothing is expectorated with
                    the cough, but as the latter increases, fragments of the so-called false
                    membrane are brought up into the mouth, with the effect of affording some
                    temporary relief to the breathing. The power of swallowing is not much impaired.
                    Should the attack undergo no abatement, symptoms of asphyxia soon make their
                    appearance. The surface of the body becomes livid, the respiration long drawn
                    out and laboured, while the cough continues to recur in fits which threaten
                    instant suffocation. Drowsiness or coma succeeds; and death takes place, either
                    gradually from exhaustion, or suddenly in the midst of a suffocative paroxysm.
                    Throughout the whole course of the disease remissions in the severity of the
                    symptoms are common, and generally occur during the daytime, the attack
                    returning with all its violence as night approaches. In favourable cases the
                    symptoms undergo gradual abatement, and there is a speedy return to health, but
                    it is to be borne in mind that one attack of croup appears to predispose to
                    another, and relapses are not uncommon.</p>
                <p>The inflammatory product, or false membrane formed in the air passages in the
                    course of an attack of croup, varies both as to its amount and the extent of its
                    distribution. It may consist merely of a thin white film covering portions of
                    the windpipe, or on the other hand it may have the character of a tough compact
                    membrane of several lines in thickness, and may extend from the upper part of
                    the larynx down to the ramifications of the bronchial tubes. It adheres closely
                    to the mucous surface, and although large portions are occasionally detached by
                    coughing or vomiting, the false membrane appears to be reproduced with great
                    rapidity. It is the chief source of danger in the disease, and where it has
                    spread downwards into the bronchial tubes death by asphyxia is the rapid
                    result.</p>
                <p>Croup is apt to be complicated with other serious diseases, such as bronchitis
                    and inflammation of the lungs, and it may also be accompanied with many of the
                    phenomena of diphtheria, in which case it has been named diphtheritic croup.
                    This latter form of the disease is sometimes observed when croup occurs in
                    connection with some of the infectious diseases, such as measles, scarlet fever,
                    or small-pox. On this point it ought to be stated that much discussion has from
                    time to time taken place respecting the relation of croup to diphtheria, not a
                    few eminent authorities holding that in all essential points they are one and
                    the same disease. The generally prevailing opinion, however, among physicians
                    who have had extensive opportunities of observation, is, that while many points
                    of similarity exist betwen croup and diphtheria they cannot be regarded as
                    identical. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Diphtheria.</hi></p>
                <p>Croup has sometimes appeared in an epidemic form. This was the case in the year
                    1805-7, when it spread over a large portion of the continent of Europe. In the
                    last-named year an inquiry into the nature of the disease by the faculty of
                    medicine of Paris was ordered by Napoleon I., <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n650/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0650-0617"/> whose nephew, the crown-prince of Holland, had
                    fallen a victim to the epidemic, and who offered a prize for the best essay on
                    the subject. Besides the two prize essays of MM. Jurine and Albers, many
                    valuable treatises were written, and it is to the information thus obtained that
                    much of our present knowledge of this malady is due.</p>
                <p>Croup is a disease of northern climates, and of low-lying, damp, and cold
                    localities. The exciting cause of an attack is generally exposure to cold,
                    particularly cold winds, such as prevail in winter and spring. There appears to
                    be in some families a special liability to this disease, as shown in the
                    readiness with which the children are attacked on alight exposure. Male children
                    appear to be more frequently affected than female. Croup is not contagious.</p>
                <p>The mortality from croup is very great, and it has been computed that about
                    one-half of those in whom the attack is developed die. Its course is in general
                    rapid, seldom exceeding three or four days. It sometimes proves fatal in less
                    than one day, while again recovery may take place after several days’ severe
                    suffering. »</p>
                <p>With respect to the treatment of croup, it may be stated that in few acute
                    diseases are greater vigilance and more prompt and energetic measures requisite.
                    The disease in many cases hastens on with such rapidity that as regards
                    treatment the loss of a few hours may be fatal to the patient. In the earlier or
                    premonitory stage, when the only symptoms present are hoarseness and some amount
                    of croupy cough, it is essential that the child should be kept in a warm
                    temperature, while warm baths and medicines to promote perspiration, such as
                    small doses of antimonial or ipecacuanha wine should be administered. The
                    abstraction of blood by one or two leeches over the upper part of the
                    breast-bone is recommended by many physicians when the child is robust and the
                    attack violent. When the breathing becomes embarrassed the administration of
                    emetic doses of the above-named medicines, or of the sulphate of zinc or of
                    copper, are of great use, as in the act of vomiting portions of false membrane
                    may be dislodged and expelled from the air passages. The child should be
                    surrounded with an atmosphere of steam (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bronchitis),</hi> and fomentations, by means of a sponge or piece of flannel
                    dipped in hot water, applied to the neck. Abundance of liquid nutriment may be
                    given, thirst being always present. When remedies such as those now indicated
                    fail to afford relief, and the child threatens to die from asphyxia, the
                    question of tracheotomy has to be considered as a last resource. This operation
                    has so often succeeded in croup as to justify its being resorted to in the
                    circumstances now described. Indeed, in the opinion of many competent
                    authorities, more lives might be saved were the operation performed earlier in
                    the course of the attack than is commonly the case. However this may be, it is
                    certain that not only are many children thus rescued from death, but even where
                    the operation fails to accomplish this, suffering is greatly mitigated and death
                    rendered easier.</p>
                <p>λVhat is known as <hi rend="smallcaps">Spasmodic Croup</hi> (synonyms, <hi
                    rend="italic">False Croup, Laryngismus stridulus, Spasm of the Glottis,
                    Child-Crowing)</hi> bears some resemblance to the disease above described as
                    regards its chief symptom, but differs from it entirely as to its pathology.
                    This affection occurs mostly in young infants during dentition, and manifests
                    itself by a sudden and violent interruption to the breathing, during which the
                    attempts to inspire are accompanied with a noise resembling the crowing of a
                    cock. Unlike true croup this disease is unattended with fever or inflammation of
                    the air passages, and is a purely nervous ailment depending on the irritation of
                    the nerves which regulate the closing of the aperture of the glottis (the upper
                    part of the larynx). This irritation is usually of reflex origin, being due to
                    some disturbance at some distance from the part, as teething or disorders of the
                    stomach or bowels, all of which, as first shown by Dr Marshall Hall, have the
                    effect of bringing on attacks of this kind. The attack is sometimes precipitated
                    in a child liable to it by exposure to a cold wind, or by its being violently
                    tossed in the arms of a nurse. The nervous origin of the seizure is f arther
                    proved by the fact that the child-crowing is often accompanied by marked
                    contraction of the muscles of the fingers and toes, and also sometimes by
                    convulsions. During the spasm all the symptoms of asphyxia are rapidly
                    developed, and unless relief is speedily obtained death may suddenly take place.
                    The attack often passes off with a forcible expiratory effort, after which the
                    child lies quite exhausted. The paroxysm, however, is apt to return. Like croup,
                    a liability to this disease may run in families, and sometimes with disastrous
                    results. The treatment must bear reference to any cause likely to have given
                    rise to the attack. For relief during the paroxysm efforts to make a sudden
                    impression on the nervous system should be used, such as warm baths or cold
                    affusion to the surface of the body. Artificial respiration ought to be tried
                    where death threatens from asphyxia, and tracheotomy performed, if time be
                    sufficient to make the attempt. (j. o. <hi rend="smallcaps">a.)</hi></p>
