                    relation to the last king of Media. The one preferred by Herodotus is probably
                    the most legendary of all four; at any rate it has the same source as the tales
                    told of Perseus or Romulus, or other popular heroes who survived exposure and
                    obscurity to revenge themselves upon the tyrant, and be restored to the royal
                    dignity. Cyrus, Herodotus, states, was the son of Cambyses, a Persian prince,
                    and Mandane, -a daughter of the Median king Astyages, in whose name we may see
                    the <hi rend="italic">Azhi dahâka</hi> (“the biting snake,”) of Zend mythology,
                    the Ahi or “serpent” of darkness of the Veda, the Zohak of Firdusi’s epic; and
                    of whom Moses of Chorene declared in the 4th century of our era that popular
                    songs still spoke as Ajdahak, the wicked serpent In consequence of a dream
                    Astyages delivered Cyrus to Harpagus to be put to death. Harpagus transferred
                    the order to the king’s herdsman Mitradates, whose wife Cyno, “the bitch,”
                    persuaded him to bring up the child as his own instead of exposing it, and a
                    still-born infant was sent to Harpagus in its place. At the age of ten Cyrus was
                    discovered and recognized by Astyages, who punished Harpagus by making him eat
                    the flesh of his own son. Cyrus returned to Persia; and some years afterwards
                    Harpagus, who had never forgotten the injury he had suffered, induced him to
                    raise the standard of revolt. Harpagus, appointed commander of the Median
                    forces, went over to the enemy, the Medes were defeated, and Astyages taken
                    prisoner. He w as kept in prison till his death, while Cyrus made the Medes
                    subservient to the Persians.</p>
                <p>Xenophon in the <hi rend="italic">Cyropaedia,</hi> where the life of a model
                    prince rather than of the historical Cyrus is depicted, agrees with Herodotus in
                    making Cyrus the grandson of Astyages, though he calls his father Cambyses an
                    independent king. Cyrus received, we are told, the simple and hardy education of
                    a Persian up to the age of twelve, when he visited the luxurious and effeminate
                    oourt of Media, and while there gained the admiration of his grandfather by
                    repelling an unprovoked attack of Evil-Merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar.
                    Astyages was succeeded by his son Cyaxares II., on whose death the Median empire
                    passed peaceably into the hands of Cyrus, now forty years old.</p>
                <p>A third account is given by Nicolas of Damascus. According .to this Cyrus was the
                    son of the Persian satrap Atradates, and spent the greater part of his youth in
                    the court of Astyages at Ecbatana. Having escaped by a stratagem and evaded the
                    pursuit of the Medes, he led the Persians into revolt, and attempted to stem the
                    attack of the Median monarch. The Persians, however, w ere defeated in four
                    great battles, in one of which Atradates was slain, and Pasargadae, the Persian
                    capital, was besieged. Here the tide of fortune turned, the insignia of royalty
                    fell into the hands of Cyrus, and Astyages was overtaken and captured during his
                    flight. The whole of Media at once submitted to the conqueror.</p>
                <p>The version of Ctesias is totally unlike either of the preceding three. Like
                    Nicolas of Damascus he denies that Cyrus was in any way related to Astyages,
                    whose daughter Amytis was the wife of Spitaces, or Spite mas, a Mede. Cyrus,
                    after his escape from Media, invaded the country and defeated Astyages, who fled
                    to Ecbatana and was there concealed by Amytis. The Persian Oebaras, however,
                    discovered his hiding-place; but Astyages was well treated by Cyrus, and died a
                    natural death. Cyrus put Spitaees to death and married Amytis.</p>
                <p>None of these versions can be regarded as satisfactory. The cuneiform
                    inscriptions have proved that Persia could not have been a mere dependency of
                    Media, as Darius declares that his eight ancestors had been kings like himself,
                    while Cyrus calls himself, on a brick from Senkereh, “the son of Cambyses, the
                    powerful king.” The Persian conquest of Media, moreover, must have been a slow
                    process. Xenophon <hi rend="italic">(Anab.,</hi> iii. 4) describes Larissa and
                    Mespila on the Tigris as strongly-fortified cities which had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n788/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0788-0753"/> been built by the Medes after the overthrow of
                    Nineveh, but ruined by the Persians during the Median war. Mespila had afforded
                    refuge to a wife of the Median monarch.</p>
                <p>The conquest of Media and the consequent establishment of the Persian empire is
                    fixed somewhat doubtfully at 559 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> According to
                    Strabo (xv. p. 729) the earlier name of Cyrus was Agradates; if so, he must have
                    changed it about this period, borrowing his new title perhaps from the River
                    Cyrus, near Pasargadae. In any case the name Cyrus (Old Persian, <hi
                    rend="italic">Kurus)</hi> cannot be connected with the later Persian <hi
                    rend="italic">Khor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Khorshéd,</hi> “the sun,” which
                    would be <hi rend="italic">uwara</hi> in the Persian of the Achaemenian epoch
                    (Zend, <hi rend="italic">lιware).</hi> The reduction of Media must have occupied
                    a considerable time, as it was not until 546 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> that
                    Cyrus found himself strong enough to face Craesus of Lydia, who had entered into
                    alliance with Egypt and Babylonia. Without waiting for his allies, however,
                    Craesus crossed the Halys, and a drawn battle was fought in Pteria. The Lydian
                    king returned to Sardis and disbanded his forces, believing that Cyrus would not
                    undertake a winter campaign. This, belief proved illusive; Cyrus followed the
                    enemy, defeated the Lydian army in spite of its bravery, besieged Sardis, and
                    took it within fourteen days. A Greek legend accounted for the preservation of
                    Craesus and his future position as confidential counsellor in the Persian
                    court.</p>
                <p>The conquest of the Greek cities of Ionia followed, and a revolt that broke out
                    in Sardis under Pactyes during the absence of Cyrus caused the general
                    disarmament of the Lydians and the reduction of Lycia and Caria.</p>
                <p>Cyrus now turned his attention to the East—Parthia, Sogdiana, Arachosia, and the
                    neighbouring countries being added to the empire. According to Ctesias, Bactria
                    had submitted on the marriage of Cyrus with Amytis; and the most formidable
                    campaign Cyrus had to undertake in the East was against the Sacae. According to
                    one story, Cyrus was taken prisoner in this campaign; according to another,
                    Sparetha, the queen of the Sacae, gained important advantages over the Persians.
                    Pliny states that Kapisa (perhaps the modern Kafshan), near the Upper Indus, was
                    destroyed by Cyrus; and Arrian’s assertion that a Persian army was lost in the
                    desert of Gedrosia is confirmed by the fact that this country formed part of the
                    Persian empire in the reign of Darius.</p>
                <p>In 539 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Babylonia was attacked. Nabonidus, the
                    Babylonian king, called Labynetus by Herodotus, had been preparing for the
                    invasion for years. Cyrus carried with him the water of the Choaspes for
                    drinking, and delayed a whole summer and autumn on his march in order to
                    dissipate the River Gyndes, in which one of the sacred white horses haα been
                    drowned. The Jews settled in Babylonia hailed the Persians as deliverers and
                    monotheists, and it was doubtless in return for the assistance they had afforded
                    that Cyrus permitted then! to return to their country and restore Jerusalem and
                    the temple. Nabonidus, defeated in the field, took refuge in Borsippa, while the
                    Persians laid siege to Babylon, where Belshazzar, the son of Nabonidus, was in
                    command. Babylon was taken during a feast; Nabonidus surrendered and was sent to
                    Carmania, and the sceptre of Nebuchadnezzar passed to Persia.</p>
                <p>Instead of reducing Phoenicia, which had resumed its freedom, Cyrus led his
                    troops across the Araxes against the Massagetae. At first victorious, he was
                    afterwards defeated and slain (538 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) by the
                    Massagetic queen Tomyris, the double of Sparetha, after a reign of twenty-nine
                    years <hi rend="italic">(Herod,</hi> i. 208-214). According to Ctesias, however,
                    this campaign was against the Derbices and their Indian allies, and Cyrus died
                    of a wound received in battle three days after gaining a complete victory over
                    them. The conquest of Egypt was left to a successor, Cyrus having made this side
                    of his empire secure by restoring the Jews to Palestine.</p>
                <p>The tomb at Murghâb cannot be that of Cyrus, as is often supposed. Murghâb, like
                    Persepolis, is on the Araxes, while Pasargadae (Persian, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paisiyãuvâdã,</hi> “valley of springs”), where Cyrus was buried, was on the
                    Cyrus (Kur). The cuneiform inscription at Murghâb points to a period subsequent
                    to the accession of Darius, as does also the Egyptian head-dress of the figure
                    below it. Andreas suggests that the Cyrus Achaemenides mentioned in the
                    inscription is the viceroy of Egypt, brother of Xerxes, called Achaemenides by
                    Ctesias, whose corpse was brought to Persia to be buried there. Pasargadae, and
                    the real tomb of Cyrus, must be looked for near Darabjerd, in southeastern
                    Farsistán. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. h.</hi> s.)</p>
