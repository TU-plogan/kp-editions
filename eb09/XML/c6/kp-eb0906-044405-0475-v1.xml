                        rend="italic">ràv</hi> Kω), an island in that part of the Turkish
                    archipelago which was anciently known as the Myrtoan Sea, not far from the
                    south-western corner of Asia Minor, at the mouth of the Gulf of Halicarnassus,
                    or Bay of Budrum. Its total length is about 25 miles, and its circumference
                    about 74. A considerable chain of mountains, known to the ancients as Oromedon,
                    or Prion, extends along the southern coast with hardly a break except near the
                    island of Nisyros; so that the greatest versant and most important streams turn
                    towards the north. The whole island is little more than a mass of limestone, and
                    consequently unites great aridity in the drier mountain regions with the richest
                    fertility in the alluvial districts. As the attention of the islanders is mainly
                    directed to the culture of their vineyards, which yield the famous Sultana
                    raisins, a considerable proportion of the arable land is left untouched, though
                    wheat, barley, and maize are sown in some quarters, and melons and sesamum seed
                    appear among the exports. Formerly one of the most valuable products of the
                    island was its lemons and oranges, but since the destruction of the trees by a
                    severe frost in 1850, these fruits hardly take any place in the market. The wild
                    olive is abundant enough, but neglected; and cotton, though it thrives well, is
                    only grown in small quantities. As the principal harbour, in spite of dredging
                    operations, is only fit for smaller vessels, the island is not of so much
                    commercial importance as it would otherwise be; but since 1868 it has been
                    regularly visited by steamers, and about fifty vessels annually enter the
                    harbour. The only town in the island is Cos, or Stanko, at the eastern
                    extremity, remarkable for its fortress, founded by the knights of Rhodes, and
                    for the gigantic plane-tree in the public square. The fortress is supposed to
                    occupy the site of the temple of AEsculapius so celebrated in antiquity, and it
                    preserves in its walls a number of interesting architectural fragments. The
                    plane-tree has a circumference of about 30 feet, and its huge and heavy branches
                    have tobe supported by pillars; of its age there is no certain knowledge, but
                    the popular tradition connects it with Hippocrates. The town is supplied by an
                    aqueduct, about four miles in length, with water from a hot chalybeate spring,
                    which is likewise named after the great physician of the island. The villages of
                    Pyli and Kephalas are interesting, the former for the Greek tomb of a certain
                    Chamylos, and the latter for a castle of the knights of St John and the numerous
                    inscriptions that prove that it occupies the site of an ancient city called
                    Isthmos. The population of the island amounts to about 10,400 souls, of whom
                    about a third are Mahometans, and the rest, with the exception of a dozen Jewish
                    families, Christians.</p>
                <p>Cos is said to have been colonized from Epidaurus, the great Peloponnesian centre
                    of the worship of Aesculapius, and it is certain that the Aesculapian cultus had
                    a remarkable hold in the island. For a time the city was a member of the Dorian
                    Pentapolis which ]ιeld its federal assemblies in the Triopian headland; but at a
                    later date it became subject to the Athenians by whom it was fortified. The
                    Emperor Claudius made it a free state, and to Antoninus Pius it was indebted for
                    restoration from the effects of a great eartl - quake. During the Greek and
                    Roman period the island was famous for its purple and its wines; the Coan robes
                    were celebrated by the poets for the delicacy and transparency of their texture;
                    and it also enjoyed a nobler celebrity as the birthplace of Hippocrates the
                    physician and Apelles the artist. In modern times its history presents few
                    details, the most interesting fact being its possession by the knights of St
                    John.</p>
