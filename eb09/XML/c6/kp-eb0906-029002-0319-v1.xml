                        rend="smallcaps">Ercole</hi> (1757-1824), cardinal and statesman, was born
                    at Rome on the 8th of June 1757, of a noble family originally belonging to Pisa.
                    His boyhood was sickly, and presents nothing remarkable. From the college at
                    Urbino, he passed to the Frascati College and the religious academy at Rome,
                    studying theology, politics, music, and literature. Entering the Pontifical
                    court as page in 1783, he rapidly advanced, and in 1797 obtained the office of
                    auditor of the rota, which brought him into public notice. Accused of
                    participation in the assassination of I)uphot, he was arrested by the French on
                    their seizure of Rome, and after a period of incarceration condemned, like so
                    many of his brethren, to exile. On the death of Pius VI. he succeeded, in
                    conjunction with Cardinal Maury, in securing in the conclave at Venice the
                    election of Chiaramonti as Pius VII.; and the new Pope rewarded his devotion by
                    appointing him secretary of state. Though from the beginning an avowed
                    antagonist of the principles of the Revolution, Consalvi was too wise not to
                    know that even Rome required in some degree to acknowledge their influence. He
                    accordingly instituted various reforms, and but for the bitter opposition of the
                    Conservative party his measures would have been more thoroughgoing than they
                    were. He permitted laymen to hold certain public offices, under surveillance of
                    the prelates, organized a guard fιom among the Roman nobility, decreed a plan
                    for redeeming the base coinage, permitted the communes a certain degree of
                    municipal liberty, and promised the liquidation of the public debt In the long
                    debates between Rome and France about the Concordat, Cρnsalvi was the leading
                    power on the side of the church; and he fought for the Papal privileges during
                    his visit to Paris, with a pertinacity and spirit that won at once the hatred
                    and respect of Napoleon. Impressed with Napoleon’s power, and anxious, if
                    possible, to make him subservient to the designs of Rome, he strongly urged the
                    Pope to accede to the conqueror’s request that the imperial crown should be
                    placed on his head by the most sacred hands in Christendom. During the Pope’s
                    absence on this mission he remained as virtual sovereign in Rome; and his
                    regency was rendered remarkable by a great inundation, caused by the overflow of
                    the Tiber, during which he exposed himself with heroic humanity, for the
                    preservation of the sufferers. Not long after the return of the Pope, the amity
                    between the Vatican and the Tuileries was again broken. Rome was full of
                    anti-Revolutionary and anti-Napoleonic strangers from all parts of Europe. The
                    emperor was irritated; and his ambassador, Cardinal Fesch, kept up the
                    irritation by perpetual complaints directed more especially against Consalvi
                    himself. “Tell Consalvi,” wrote the conqueror, still flushed with Austerlitz,
                    “that if he loves his country he must either resign or do what I demand.”
                    Consalvi did accordingly resign on the 17tħ June 1807, and was followed in rapid
                    succession by Casoni, Doria, Gabrielli, and Pacca. When in 1808 Miollis entered
                    Rome, and the temporal power of the Pope was formally abolished, he broke off
                    all relations with the French, though several of them were his intimate friends.
                    In 1809 he was at Paris, and, in a remarkable interview, of which he has left a
                    graphic account in his memoirs, he received from Napoleon’s own lips what was
                    practically an apology for the treatment he had received. With unbending
                    dignity, however, he retained his antagonism; and shortly afterwards he was one
                    of the thirteen cardinals who refused to recognize the marriage of Marie Louise.
                    The result, as is well known, was a confinement at Rheims which only terminated
                    about three years afterwards, when Napoleon had extorted what terms he pleased
                    from the half-captive Pope at Fontainebleau. On his release Consalvi hastened to
                    his master’s assistance; and he was soon after permitted to resume his functions
                    under the restored pontificate at Rome. Despatched to England to meet the allied
                    sovereigns, he was well received both by king and people; and at the Congress of
                    Vienna he obtained the restitution of the Marches (Ancona, Treviso, and Fermo)
                    and the Legations (Bologna, Ferrara, and Ravenna). The rest of his life was
                    spent in the work of reorganizing the States of the Church, and bringing back
                    the allegiance of Europe to the Fapal throne. He was practically governor of
                    Rome; and Pius was so much under his control that “Pasquin” said the Pope would
                    have to wait at the gates of paradise till the cardinal came from purgatory with
                    the keys. In his foreign policy he was actuated mainly by antagonism to Austria;
                    in his domestic policy he imitated the centralizing system of France. In all
                    essentials a most rigid churchman, he was disposed to yield in minor matters,
                    and obtained the praise of many Protestant visitors to Rome for his affability
                    and liberality. Science, literature, and especially the fine arts received his
                    most abundant patronage; the ancient buildings of Rome were excavated and
                    preserved by his direction; chairs of natural science and archaeology were
                    founded in the univen sity; and extensive purchases were made for the Vatican
                    Museum, which was augmented by the addition of the <pb break="no"

                    and the like expenses, however, were a heavy drain on the Papal treasury, and
                    brought Consalvi into financial difficulties, from which he only got free by the
                    imposing of unpopular taxes. On the death of Pius VII. he retired to his villa
                    of Porto d’Anzio; and, though he afterwards accepted from the new Pope the
                    honorary office of prefect of the college <hi rend="italic">De Propaganda

                    leaving the most of his moderate fortune to the poor. A fine portrait of
                    Consalvi by Sir T. Lawrence is preserved at Windsor, and his tomb in South
                    Marcello is surmounted by a monument by Rinaldi.</p>
