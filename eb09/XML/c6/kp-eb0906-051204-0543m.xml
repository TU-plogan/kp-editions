                    Alfred. It is tolerably clear, however, that this theory is a reversal of the
                    natural process, and that, instead of counties having been formed by the
                    division of the country, the country itself was formed by the aggregation of
                    counties. The county, in fact, is the representative of an independent <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0544-0513"/> kingdom or community, now long merged in the
                    larger unity of the English kingdom. The same mistake that has been made as to
                    the historical relations of the county and the kingdom is repeated in the
                    popular accounts of the subdivisions of the county itself. Alfred the Great, it
                    is said, divided the county into hundreds, and these again into tithings. The
                    truth is exactly the contrary—the subdivision of the county being an earlier
                    aggregate than the county itself. The parish, the manor, and the township all
                    appear to be traceable to the independent tribal settlement—the village
                    community—of the early Saxons. They appear in history with their political and
                    judicial organism complete. A combination of these units forms the district of
                    the hundred; and a combination of hundreds forms the county. All of these groups
                    have the same kind of organization. They all have their moots or meetings,
                    partly judicial partly political in character, and their head-man or reeve. The
                    Witenagemot of the Saxon kingdom is the folk-moot for the whole kingdom,
                    corresponding to the folk-moot for the shire or county.</p>
                <p>In the period preceding the Norman Conquest two officers appear at the head of
                    the county organization. These are the ealdorman or earl and the scirgerefa or
                    sheriff. The latter was more particularly the representative of the king; the
                    former represented, in dignity at least, the head of the county before ithad
                    ceased to be an independent community. After the Conquest the sheriff became a
                    purely royal officer <hi rend="italic">(υice-comes</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ballivus).</hi> He held an annual court (the sheriff’s tourn or leet) to which
                    the vassals of the king were suitors. These were the judicial tribunals for the
                    people within the jurisdiction of the county. An appeal lay from them to the
                    king, and the growth of the king’s court, in its three developments—King’s
                    Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer—tended to draw suits at the first instance
                    away from the county court into the higher tribunal. The county court, moreover,
                    arranged the assessment of rates, and the sheriff was, in fact, the financial
                    representative of the Crown within his district. When the principle of
                    representation came into existence, the county court was the assembly which
                    elected the knights of the shire. The ancient offices of coroner and verderer
                    were also filled up by the same assembly. The county organization thus in many
                    points retained the features of an independent political society. From the time
                    of the Plantagenets its importance in the constitution declined.</p>
                <p>The office of sheriff in England has lost all its financial and nearly all its
                    judicial duties. He is now chiefly a ministerial officer—he arrests or
                    imprisons, summons and returns the jury, carries the judgment or sentence of the
                    court into effect, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The military functions of the sheriff were in the reign of Henry VIII. (or,
                    according to some, Edward VI.) handed over to a new officer, the
                    lord-lieutenant, who is now more prominently associated with the headship of the
                    county than the sheriff is. The office is honorary, and is held during royal
                    pleasure, but virtually for life. The Government of the day invariably appoints
                    one of its own supporters,— generally a person of high position in the county.
                    He is the chief conservator of the peace and keeper of the records of quarter
                    sessions. He is also commander of the militia and yeomanry of the county, whose
                    officers he appoints.</p>
                <p>In the United States of America the county forms the section into which the State
                    is divided; it is again subdivided into townships. The financial affairs of the
                    county are superintended by county officers, and each county is provided with a
                    court of inferior jurisdiction. Louisiana is the only State which is divided
                    into parishes, instead of counties.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Counties Palatine</hi> are three in number, viz., Durham,
                    Chester, and Lancaster. The counts palatine (earl of Chester, bishop of Durham,
                    and duke of Lancaster) exercised royal rights within their districts. Chester
                    was united with the Crown under Henry HL, but the palatinate jurisdictions
                    survived in the other two cases. The Court of Common Pleas at Lancaster and the
                    Court of Common Pleas at Durham are among the courts -whose jurisdiction is
                    transferred to the High Court of Justice by the Judicature Act, 1873. The
                    palatine authority of the bishop of Durham was vested in the Crown by 6 and 7
                    Will. IV. c. 19. The duchy of Lancaster has still its own chancellor, in whose
                    name a chancery court is held, presided over by a vice-chancellor, and the
                    courts of the Jord chancellor of England do not run in the districts. The
                    chancery court is not affected by the Judicature Act. Section 99 of that Act,
                    provides that, from and after the commencement of this Act, the counties
                    palatine of Lancaster and Durham shall respectively cease to be counties
                    palatine, so far as respects the issue of commissions of assize, or other like
                    commissions, but not further or otherwise.</p>

                    The 9 and 10 Vict. c. 95 (County Courts Act, 1846), reciting various Acts, the
                    provisions of which should bo amended, and that one rule, and manner of
                    proceeding for the lecovery of small debts and demand, should prevail
                    throughout, England; that the County Court is a court of ancient jurisdiction,
                    having cognizance of all pleas of personal actions to any amount by virtue of a
                    writ of justices issued in that behalf; that the proceedings in the County Court
                    are dilatory and expensive, and that it is expedient to alter and regulate the
                    manner of proceeding in the said courts for the recovery of small debts and
                    demands; that the courts established under the said recited Acts of Parliament,
                    or such of them as ought to be continued, should be holden after the passing of
                    this Act as branches of the County Court under the provisions of this
                    Act,—enacts that “it shall be lawful for her Majesty, with the advice of her
                    Privy Council, to order that this Act shall be put in force in such county or
                    counties as to her Majesty, with the advice aforesaid, shall seem fit.” By
                    section 2 her Majesty, with the advice aforesaid, may divide the whole or part
                    of any such county, including all counties of cities and counties of towns,
                    cities, boroughs, towns, ports, and places, liberties and franchises therein
                    contained into districts, and may order that the County Court shall be holden
                    under this Act in each of such districts. Courts under this Act are to have “all
                    the jurisdiction and powers of the County Court for recovery of debts and demand
                    as altered by this Act,” and shall be courts of record. For all other purposes
                    the County Court shall be holden as if this Act had not passed. Judges,
                    treasurers, registrars, high bailiffs, and their assistants were to be appointed
                    for each district. The 21 and 22 Vict. c. 74 § 3 limits the number of judges to
                    sixty. The salary of a County Court judge was originally fixed at £1200, but as
                    a rule he now receives £1500. He must be a barrister-at-law of seven years’
                    standing; after appointment he cannot sit as a member of Parliament, or practise
                    at the bar. The appointment is made by the lord chancellor, with whom also rests
                    the power of dismissal for sufficient cause shown. Lawyers of considerable
                    repute have in many cases accepted these appointments.</p>
                <p>The jurisdiction of the County Courts was at first confined to pleas in personal
                    actions, when the sum claimed was not more than £20, but it has since been
                    considerably enlarged. The limit was raised to £50 by the 13 and 14 Vict. c. 61.
                    A jurisdiction in ejectment, where the annual rent or value of the land was not
                    more than £20, was conferred by the County Courts Act, 1867. Up to 1865 the
                    jurisdiction of the County Courts was with a few trifling exceptions a common
                    law jurisdiction, but the County Courts Act of that year conferred an equitable
                    jurisdiction, limited as to tha value of the amount at stake to £500. This Act,
                    and the power to set up equitable defences to actions under the Common Law
                    Procedure Act, 1854, are noticeable in the history of English law, as
                    anticipations of the fusion of law and equity now being carried out under the
                    recent Judicature Act. Jurisdiction in probate (up to £200), in admiralty, in
                    bankruptcy, and certain powers in aid of the jurisdiction of other courts nave
                    also been conferred by separate Acts. By the consent of parties the court may
                    have jurisdiction in any action. In certain cases <hi rend="italic">(e.g∙,</hi>

                    County Courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Otherwise they have jurisdiction
                    concurrently with the superior courts, but when a case which a County Court
                    might have tried is brought into a superior court, the costs will not in general
                    be granted. The County Courts Act, 1867, dealing with this subject enacts (§ 5)
                    that costs shall not be recoverable by the plaintiff in any action in the
                    superior courts, when the amount recovered does not exceed £20 in a case of
                    contract, or £10 in a case of tort (civil injury)—unless the judge certify that
                    there was a good reason for bringing the action in a superior court. By § 8 when
                    any action of contract is brought in a superior court for a sum in dispute not
                    exceeding £50, the judge may on the application of the defendant order the case
                    to be sent to the County Court. By § 8 proceedings in equity may be transferred
                    to the County Court which might have commenced therein; and. by § 10 in actions
                    for tort, the judge may, on an affidavit by defendant that the plaintiff has no
                    visible means of paying costs if unsuccessful, send down the case to the County
                    Court. These provisions, which it will be observed only indirectly compel
                    Buitors to resort to the County Courts in cases of minor importance, are
                    embodied in the Judicature Act, 1873, by section 67 :—“The provisions contained
                    in the fifth, seventh, eighth, and tenth sections of the County Court Act, 1867,
                    shall apply to all actions commenced or pending in the said High Court of
                    Justice on which any relief is Bought which can be given in a County Court.”</p>
                <p>A County Court judge may determine all matters of fact as vzell as law, but a
                    jury may be summoned at the option of either plaintiff or defendant -when the
                    amount in dispute exceeds £5, and the judge may at his discretion summon a jury
                    in any case. Counsel as well as attorneys may appear in the County Courts, but
                    as the object of the legislature was to establish a cheap tribunal, costs are in
                    the discretion of the judge, and the remuneration for professional services
                    recoverable as costs is paid on a reduced scale. By the Judicature Act, 1873,
                    appeals from County Courts and other inferior courts are heard in divisional
                    courts of the High Court of Justice, consisting of such judges as may be
                    assigned for that purpose, and the decision of any such divisional court shall
                    be final, unless it gives special leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The
                    Acts relating to County Courts are now numerous, and through frequent amendment
                    and repeal are in a state of great confusion. A Consolidation Act is much to be
                    desired. (E. R.)</p>
