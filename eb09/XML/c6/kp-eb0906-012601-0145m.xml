                <p><label type="entry">COLEOPTERA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Beetles</hi></label>, a
                    vast and remarkably homogeneous order of Insects, characterized, as the name
                    implies (κoλ∈o ’ s, a sheath, and τrτepα, wings), by the structure of the upper
                    wings, or <hi rend="italic">elytra,</hi> as they are called, which are so
                    modified as to form shields for the protection of the under wings—the true
                    organs of flight in those insects. The name was given, and the principal
                    characters of the order defined, by Aristotle; and owing doubtless to their
                    singular and varied forms and habits, the brilliant colouring and great size of
                    numerous species, and that solid consistence which renders their collection and
                    preservation comparatively easy, Coleopterous insects have since the days of the
                    Stagirite received the special attention of entomologists.</p>
                <p>The body in Coleoptera is enclosed in a chitinous integument of a more or less
                    rigid consistence, and is somewhat oval in form, although in most cases greatly
                    longer than broad. In this respect, however, the utmost diversity prevails even
                    among the members of the same family, the form being modified to suit the habits
                    of the insect. Thus, according to Bates, among the South American forms of <hi
                    rend="italic">Dermestidae,</hi> the species of one group are cubical in shape,
                    and live in dung; those of another, inhabiting the stems of palm trees, are much
                    flatter; those of a third, only found under the bark of trees, are excessively
                    depressed, some species being literally “as thin as a wafer;” while the members
                    of a fourth group of the same family are cylindrical in shape, and are
                    woodborers, “looking,” says Bates, “like animated gimlets, their pointed heads
                    being fixed in the wood, while their glossy bodies work rapidly round so as to
                    create little streams of saw-dust from the holes” <hi rend="italic">(Naturalist
                    on the Amazons).</hi> The body, in common with that of all other insects, is
                    divided into three parts,—head, thorax, and abdomen. The head, which is usually
                    rounded or somewhat triangular in shape (except in the Weevil tribe, where it is
                    produced into an elongated rostrum or snout), bears the organs of the senses.
                    The eyes of beetles are two in number and compound, and in predaceous species
                    are somewhat protuberant, thus affording greater range of vision. The simple
                    eyes, or <hi rend="italic">ocelli,</hi> common among butterflies and moths, are
                    almost unknown among beetles, although present in the larvae. In many species,
                    especially of Lamellicorn Beetles, these organs are more or less completely
                    divided by a process known as the <hi rend="italic">cantfius;</hi> and in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gyrinidae,</hi> or Whirligigs, the intersection is so complete
                    as to give the appearance of a pair of eyes on each side. In burrowing and
                    cave-dwelling species, whose lives are spent in almost total darkness, the eyes,
                    although distinctly visible in the young, become more or less atrophied in the
                    adult forms. The two antennae, supposed by some to be organs of hearing, and by
                    others of smell, are placed between or in front of the eyes, and usually consist
                    of 11 joints. These differ greatly in form and size, not only in different
                    species, but in the two sexes of the same species, the most prevalent forms
                    being the setaceous, moniliform, serrate, pectinate, clavate, and lamellate. In
                    many groups the antennae are exceedingly short, while in such forms as the
                    Longicorn Beetles they, in a few cases, measure four times the length of the
                    body.</p>
                <p>The parts which go to form the mouth are typically developed in beetles, and for
                    this among other reasons the order Coleoptera has generally been placed at the
                    head of the class of insects. It is known as the masticatory mouth, and consists
                    of the four parts (Plate VI. fig- 1). (1) The <hi rend="italic">labrum,</hi> or
                    upper lip, is usually a continuation of the upper surface of the head. (2) The
                    <hi rend="italic">mandibles,</hi> or true masticatory organs, consist of two
                    powerful arched jaws generally dentated, moving horizontally and opposed to each
                    other, the teeth in some cases interlocking, in others, as in the Tiger Beetles,
                    crossing like the blades in a pair of scissors. In many species they are so
                    small as to be almost concealed within the cavity of the mouth, while in such
                    forms as the Stag Beetles they measure half the length of the entire body. The
                    form and texture of the mandibles are largely dependent on the nature of the
                    insect’s food, being acute and sharply dentated in predaceous species, and thick
                    and blunt in vegetable feeders. Their margins are soft and flexible in those
                    which feed on decaying animal and vegetable matters, while the entire mandibles
                    are soft and flattened in those which live on fluids. (3) The <hi rend="italic"
                    >maxillae,</hi> or lesser jaws, placed beneath the mandibles, and like them
                    moving horizontally, serve to hold the food and guide it to the mouth. Their
                    extremities are in many cases furnished with a movable claw, and their inner
                    surfaces with a series of bristles, which are probably of use in straining the
                    juices from their food. The maxillae are provided with a pair of appendages
                    called maxillary palps—delicate organs that vibrate intensely, and are supposed
                    to be principal organs of touch. (4) Tlιe <hi rend="italic">labium,</hi> or
                    lower lip, also provided with palps.</p>
                <p>The thorax bears the organs of locomotion, consisting of three pairs of legs and
                    two pairs of wings (Plate VI. fig. 2). The legs vary in their structure and
                    development according to the habits of the species; thus in running and walking
                    beetles these organs are usually of equal length, and generally similar in other
                    respects, the anterior pair, however, being often stronger in the male than in
                    the female; and in a few species, as the Harlequin Beetle, the anterior legs are
                    enormously elongated and proportionately thickened. In burrowing beetles the
                    anterior legs are developed into fossorial organs with broad and strongly
                    dentated tarsi, and in arboreal forms the under side of the tarsi is usually
                    covered with hair, forming a cushion-like sole terminating in toothed claws, by
                    which they are enabled to keep their footing on the leaves and branches of
                    trees. Water beetles generally have the posterior pair of legs elongated,
                    flattened, and ciliated, so as to form swimming organs; those known as
                    Whirligigs using the middle and posterior pairs for this purpose, while the
                    anterior limbs are employed as rudders; and jumping beetles, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Halticidae,</hi> have the thighs of the posterior pair of legs
                    greatly thickened for saltatory purposes (Plate VIII. fig. 10). The two anterior
                    wings become solidified in beetles, and are thus rendered useless as organs of
                    flight. They are termed <hi rend="italic">elytra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(eλυτpov,</hi> a shield), and serve to protect the delicate wings beneath, as
                    well as the <hi rend="italic">stigmata,</hi> or breathing pores, placed ¾loug
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n150/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0150-0127"/> the sides of the abdomen. The elytra are always
                    present except in the females of a few species, as the Glow-worm, and are
                    generally large enough to cover the upper surface of the abdomen and to conceal
                    the under wings when at rest. In Brachelytrυus Beetles, however, they are
                    exceedingly short, and the wings in these are only shielded by being folded more
                    than once beneath them. The elytra when at rest meet on the middle of the back,
                    their internal margins forming a straight longitudinal line or suture highly
                    characteristic of the Coleoptera; but even this character is not universal, as
                    in the Oil Beetles <hi rend="italic">(Meloë)</hi> and a few others the one
                    elytron partly folds over the other. The posterior wings are large, veined, and
                    membranaceous and form the true organs of flight, but they are much more
                    frequently absent than the elytra, and where this occurs, as in manyCarabideous
                    Beetles, the latter are more or less soldered together. During flight the elytra
                    are either extended horizontally or merely raised without being separated, as in
                    the Rose-Chafers <hi rend="italic">(Cetonia);</hi> and as might be expected from
                    their general stoutness of body and comparative deficiency of wings, the flight
                    of beetles is heavy and seldom long sustained. Their weakness in this respect is
                    further shown in the apparent inability of many species suddenly to alter their
                    course so as to avoid collision with any object that may unexpectedly come in
                    their way, a defect popularly but erroneously attributed, in. the phrase “as
                    blind as a beetle,” to weakness of sight rather than of wing. In certain water
                    beetles <hi rend="italic">fDytiscidae)</hi> a pair of <hi rend="italic"
                    >aſlulae,</hi> or winglets, are developed at the inner angle of the elytra.</p>
                <p>The colouring of the chitinous integument of beetles is often exceedingly
                    brilliant, and the elytra and other parts of many species are largely used in
                    the manufacture of personal ornaments. This colouring can in many instances be
                    shown to bear a close resemblance to that of surrounding nature; thus burrowing
                    beetles, and those which dwell in subterranean .caves, are generally black or
                    brown; "Weevils, found on the ground, are earth-coloured; while arboreal species
                    of this and other groups are of various shades of green. Bates found a species
                    of beetle, on a particular tree in South America, which so resembled the bark on
                    which it spent its existence as to be, when motionless, no longer visible. This
                    assimilation in colour to surrounding nature is probably useful in assisting
                    them to elude their enemies; and when the markings are such as to render the
                    beetle conspicuous it is often provided with, and no doubt protected by, an
                    offensive odour or nauseous juices; thus the naturalist already mentioned found
                    on a sandy beach two species of Tiger Beetles, the one of a pallid hue like the
                    sand it ran upon, the other of a brilliant and conspicuous copper colour, but
                    having “a strong, offensive, putrid, and musky odour,” from which the other was
                    entirely free. Fireflies, a group of Coleopterous insects, are also exceedingly
                    conspicuous, but are similarly protected. The phenomena of mimicry, or the
                    imitation of one animal by another for protective purposes, have been, observed
                    in several instances among beetles. Mr Belt, in his interesting work, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Naturalist in Nicaragua,</hi> states that he captured what he
                    supposed was a hairy caterpillar, but on closer inspection he found it to be a
                    Longicorn Beetle, the antennae being concealed among the hair. Hairy
                    caterpillars are almost universally rejected by insecteating animals, and thus
                    probably this beetle shared in the immunity from attack accorded to its model. A
                    species of beetle found in South America closely resembles a bee found in the
                    same locality, its body being covered with hair and its legs similarly tufted;
                    another, with yellow banded abdomen, sufficiently resembled a wasp as to make
                    its captor both cautious and. timid in handling it at first. One of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chrysomfilidae (Crioceris</hi><hi rend="italic">merdigera}</hi> is
                    said to disguise itself by covering its upper surface with its own dung; while
                    many species to be afterwards noticed, when in danger, simulate death. Brilliant
                    colouring in beetles is not as in some orders of animals a characteristic mainly
                    of the male sex, both sexes being usually similar in this respect, while iu
                    those cases in which they differ, the female is generally the more gaudy insect.
                    The chief external difference, however, between the sexes in many beetles is to
                    be found in the presence of horns on the head and thorax of the males. These
                    vary exceedingly in their development even in individuals of the same species,
                    while in their form they resemble the horns of the rhinoceros, and the antlers
                    of the stag; and as among mammals the reindeer is exceptional in the possession
                    of antlers by both sexes, so among beetles there is at least one species, <hi
                    rend="italic">Phanaeus</hi><hi rend="italic">lancifor,</hi> in which both male
                    and female are similarly equipped. The male beetle has not been observed to use
                    its horns either for purposes of offence or defence, some of the most pugnacious
                    species being entirely destitute of them; and in Darwin’s opinion these
                    appendages have been acquired merely as ornaments.</p>
                <p>The abdomen of Coleopterous insects is sessile, that is, attached to the‘thorax
                    by its largest transverse diameter. On the under side it is always of a firm
                    horny consistence, while the upper surface is generally soft, being protected by
                    the elytra and wings; when these, however, are absent or abbreviated, it is as
                    hard above as below. It bears the organs of generation as well as the
                    respiratory openings, or <hi rend="italic">stigmata,</hi> which form the
                    apertures of the tracheae by means of which air is disseminated through all
                    parts of the insect system. Beetles belonging to several distinct families
                    possess stridulating organs, and these are generally found in both sexes. The
                    apparatus by which the sound, loud enough to be heard in many cases at some
                    yards distance, is produced, consists of a couple of delicate rasps placed on
                    the upper surface of the abdomen, on the elytra, or on the prothorax, and a
                    scraper formed by the margins of the elytra, the edges of the abdominal
                    segments, or the mesothorax, the rapid motion of the latter over the rasps
                    producing the sound. In many cases, according to Darwin, the males only
                    stridulate, the females being destitute of those organs, and in such cases the
                    sound is employed as a call to the female; with most beetles, however, the
                    stridulation proceeds from both sexes and serves as a mutual call. Beetles are
                    entirely destitute of stinging organs, but a few are furnished with a retractile
                    tube, or <hi rend="italic">ovipositor,</hi> at the extremity of the abdomen, by
                    means of which they deposit their eggs in the cracks of wood and other suitable
                    localities.</p>
                <p>The eggs of beetles are deposited in a great variety of situations, and in the
                    case of a certain group of <hi rend="italic">Staphylinidae</hi> found in the
                    nests of white ants in South America, it was recently discovered by Schödte that
                    the eggs are not deposited at all, but remain in the abdomen until they are
                    hatched. These ovo-viviparous beetles are only one-tenth of an inch in length,
                    and have the abdominal region enormously distended and turned over so as to rest
                    on the back. Dung beetles deposit their eggs in the midst of the manure on which
                    the future larvae feed; the Sacred Beetle of Egypt rolling each of hers about
                    until a globular pellet is formed, when the whole is buried in the ground; while
                    the Sexton Beetle finds an appropriate <hi rend="italic">nidus</hi> for her eggs
                    in the dead bodies of animals. One species of <hi rend="italic">Cleridae</hi>
                    selects the nest of the solitary bee, another (Plate VII. fig. 31) that of the
                    hive bee, while several species of Rose Beetles choose the nest of the ant for
                    this purpose. The water beetles belonging to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrophilus</hi> deposit their eggs in a single mass, which they surround with
                    a oocoon, formed of a silky substance secreted by certain glands in the abdomen,
                    and then either fix this to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0151-0128"/> the leaf of an aquatic plant or leave it to float
                    on the surface of the water. Certain species of the Weevil tribe deposit their
                    eggs on the leaves of trees, splitting the median nervures in several places,
                    and afterwards rolling them up. In its progress from the egg to the perfect
                    insect the beetle undergoes complete metamorphosis, passing from the larval to
                    the pupa stage, and remaining totally quiescent during the latter. Coleopterous
                    larvae generally consist of 13 segments, of which those forming the head and
                    thorax are usually of a hard horny texture,—the mouth, as in the perfect insect,
                    being masticatory, and the eyes, when present, simple, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ocelli.</hi> They have usually six legs, and prolegs, as in caterpillars, are
                    occasionally present; but the larvae of many species are legless grubs, while in
                    others the limbs are but feebly developed. In those groups in which the elytra
                    are abbreviated, the larvae are exceedingly active and closely resemble the
                    perfect insect. Like their parents the larvae of beetles feed on living animals,
                    on plants, or on decaying animal and vegetable substances, but greatly exceed
                    the perfect insect in the quantity of food which they consume, and it is in this
                    condition that beetles do most injury to field crops and forest trees. The
                    larvae of burrowing beetles, known as “White Worms,” spend their existence in
                    the earth, and are destitute of eyes; those of the Stag Beetles and other
                    wood-boring groups live in the trunks of decaying trees; mealworms—the larvae of
                    <hi rend="italic">Tenebrio molitor</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> live enveloped
                    in flour, and those of the Corn Weevil in the heart of the wheat grain; while
                    those of another species of Weevil make their homes in the fleshy parts of the
                    receptacles of composite flowers. The larvae of Oil Beetles <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Melo'e),</hi> or at least certain species of them whose life-history has been
                    observed, after leaving the <hi rend="italic">egg,</hi> which the perfect insect
                    has deposited just beneath the surface of the ground, climb upon the stems of
                    plants, and take the first opportunity of attaching themselves to any insect
                    that may happen to alight near them, and in this way they are occasionally
                    conveyed into the hives of bees, in which alone they meet with their appropriate
                    food. Only a few of them are thus fortunate, the majority of the larvae getting
                    attached to the wrong insect, and so perishing of hunger. The species probably
                    owes its preservation to the great number of eggs, amounting to upwards of 4000,
                    deposited by a single female. The larvae of one group of water beetles, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydrophilus,</hi> swim readily by means of their ciliated legs,
                    those of another group, <hi rend="italic">Dytiscus,</hi> make use also of their
                    flexible abdomen provided at its extremity with a pair of leaf-like appendages
                    (Plate VII. fig. 6); while the Whirligig larvae <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gyrinus),</hi> in addition to ciliated swimming organs, are provided with four
                    movable hooks on the posterior segment, by which they are enabled to take
                    extensive leaps (Plate VII. fig. 17). The duration of the larval state varies in
                    different groups of beetles, being comparatively short in leaf-eating species,
                    but lasting for three or four years in those which burrow in the earth or in
                    wood. The larvae in the latter case pass the winter in a torpid state,
                    abstaining almost entirely from food, until awakened from their temporary trance
                    by the return of genial weather, when they greedily attack their favourite food,
                    and grow rapidly. In passing from the condition of a larva, the beetle does not,
                    like the butterfly, assume a form altogether different from that of the perfect
                    insect, but in the pupa or nymph state shows all the parts of the future insect,
                    only in a condition of almost complete immobility. In preparing for this
                    quiescent period, the larvae of many species surround themselves with a cocoon,
                    consisting, in the case of the <hi rend="italic">Scarabaeidae,</hi> of earth and
                    small pieces of wood glued together with saliva, and in that of the Goliath
                    Beetles, of mud. Others resemble the larvae of moths in constructing tubes in
                    which to undergo their transformations, while the Jarvae of Lady-Birds— <hi
                    rend="italic">Coccinella—</hi> suspend themselves by the tail and make use of
                    their larval covering as a protection to the nymph within. When the condition of
                    nymph is assumed in autumn, no further change takes place till the ensuing
                    spring, but under suitable conditions of heat this stage does not last usually
                    for more than three or four weeks, after which it emerges a full-blown
                    beetle.</p>
                <p>The number of known species of beetles is estimated at J0,000, and these are
                    probably not more than one-half of the total number in existence—Great Britain
                    alone possessing 3614 indigenous species. They occur in greatest abundance in
                    the wooded parts of tropical regions. “A large proportion of the beetles of the
                    tropics,” says Wallace, “are more or less dependent on vegetation and
                    particularly on timber, bark, and leaves in various stages of decay. In the
                    untouched virgin forest the beetles are found at spots where trees have fallen
                    through decay and old age.” The number gradually decreases towards the poles,
                    only a few species occurring as far north as Greenland. The six zoological
                    provinces proposed by Mr Sclater in 1859 as applicable to the existing
                    distribution of birds, have lately been shown by Mr A. R. Wallace, in his
                    admirable work on the <hi rend="italic">Geographical Distribution of
                    Animals</hi> (1876), to mark off equally characteristic groups of Coleopterous
                    insects, a conclusion arrived at from a study of the distribution of the
                    following six important families :—</p>

                <p>The Palaearctic Region, which comprises Europe, Africa north of the Sahara, and
                    Northern Asia, possesses about 20,000 species of beetles, and is specially
                    characterized by abundance of <hi rend="italic">Carabidae,</hi> nearly
                    two-fifths of the entire number belonging to this region; Longicorns are also
                    well represented by 196 genera, of which 51 are peculiar to it. The Coleoptera
                    of the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Azores are Palaearctic, but are peculiar
                    in the total absence of such forms as the Tiger Beetles, the Chafers, and the
                    Rose-Chafers, also in the great number of wingless species. The latter are
                    specially numerous in groups of beetles peculiar to those islands, but they also
                    occur in other cases, 22 genera which either usually or at least sometimes are
                    winged in Southern Europe having only wingless species in Madeira, while at
                    least three species winged in Europe occur in those islands in an apterous
                    condition. On the other hand, those species in Madeira which possess wings have
                    them more largely developed than they are among allied continental forms; the
                    strong-winged and the wingless thus appearing best suited to live in islands
                    exposed, as these Atlantic groups are, to frequent storms. The Ethiopian Region,
                    which includes Africa south of the Sahara and Madagascar, is specially rich in
                    <hi rend="italic">Cetoniidce,</hi> possessing 76, or more than half of the known
                    genera, with 64 of these peculiar to it, of which no less than 21 are found
                    exclusively in Madagascar. It has also 262 genera oí Longicorns, 216 of which
                    are peculiar. The Oriental Region, comprising Southern Asia and the islands
                    adjacent, contains some of the most remarkable forms of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carabidae,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Mormolyce phyllodes,</hi> and is rich in
                    gorgeous metallic beetles <hi rend="italic">(Buprestidae)</hi> and in
                    Longicorns, having 360 genera of the latter, with 70 per cent, peculiar to it.
                    The Australian Region shows affinity with the Oriental in its Coleoptera; it is
                    equally rich in peculiar forms of Longicorns, and is the richest of all the
                    regions in <hi rend="italic">Buprestidae,</hi> having 47, or more than one-half
                    of the knowm genera, and 20 of these confined to it. Several genera belonging to
                    this and other families have their species divided between the Australian and
                    Neotropical or South American Regions, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n152/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0152-0129"/> and this resemblance has given rise to the
                    supposition that at some distant period a land connection existed between the
                    two continents; it is more probable, however, as Wallace holds, “that it may
                    have arisen from intercommunication during the warm southern period -when
                    floating timber would occasionally transmit a few larvae from island to island
                    across the Antarctic seas.” The Neotropical Region comprehends southern and
                    Central America and the West Indies, and is enormously rich in Longicorn
                    Beetles, having no fewer than 516 genera, of which 487 are found nowhere else.
                    The most remarkable fact in the distribution of the Stag Beetles <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lucanidae)</hi> is their almost total absence from the tropical
                    parts of this region, and their presence in North America, while in the old
                    world they are specially characteristic of the hottest parts of the Oriental and
                    Australian Regions. The Nearctic Region comprises the northern and temperate
                    parts of America, and is comparatively poor in Coleoptera, showing greater
                    affinity, however, with the Palaearctic than with the contiguous Neotropical
                    Region.</p>
                <p>The insects belonging to this extensive Order comprise numerous well-defined and
                    generally recognized families, but great diversity of opinion exists as to the
                    best mode of grouping these together so as to exhibit their natural affinities.
                    Geoffroy, a French naturalist, was the first to make use of the number of joints
                    in the tarsi for this purpose, a method adopted and extended by Olivier, and
                    brought into general use by Latreille. According to the tarsal system the
                    Coleoptera are divided into the following four sections :—(1) <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pentamera,</hi> in which all the tarsi are five-jointed; (2)
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Heteromera,</hi> with five articulations to the first four
                    tarsi and four to the posterior pair; (3) <hi rend="smallcaps">Tetramera,</hi>
                    with four articulations to all the tarsi; and (4) <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Trimera,</hi> with all the tarsi three-jointed. Macleay, an English naturalist,
                    altogether rejected the tarsal system of Geoffroy, and founded his five primary
                    divisions on characters derived from the larvae of those insects—a system
                    adopted by Stephens in his <hi rend="italic">Classification of British
                    Insects,</hi> and by several other English writers on this subject. The tarsal
                    system is to a large extent artificial, and when slavishly followed brings
                    together forms which in other respects differ very widely, while separating many
                    that are as obviously related. Its simplicity and consequent easiness of
                    application have, in the absence of a more natural system, led to its very
                    general adoption by both British and foreign naturalists, who do not, however,
                    apply it where obviously unnatural.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pentamera.</hi> —The majority of the beetles in this section
                    have the tarsi of the feet five-jointed, and they comprise fully one-half of all
                    the known species of Coleoptera. It is subdivided into the following 8 groups
                    :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Geodephaga,</hi> or Predaceous Land Beetles, resemble the
                    succeeding group and differ from other Coleoptera in having the outer lobe of
                    the maxillae distinct and articulated, thus appearing to possess six palpi. They
                    are extremely active, their legs being admirably adapted for running; the
                    majority are nocturnal in their habits, secreting themselves under stones and
                    clods of earth; and all are carnivorous, feeding on other insects and
                    occasionally devouring individuals of their own species, while their larvae are
                    equally predaceous. They are exceedingly numerous in temperate regions, and are
                    eminently serviceable in checking the increase of insects which feed on fruit
                    and grain. The mandibles, by which they seize and tear their living prey, are
                    long horny organs, hooked and sharp at the points, and toothed on the inner
                    edges. This group includes the Tiger Beetles, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cicindelidae</hi> ( Plate VI. figs. 4, 9-12), so called from the fierceness of
                    their disposition, and probably also from the spots and stripes with w hich the
                    elytra are generally adorned. Most of the epecies are diurnal, frequenting hot
                    sandy districts, enjoying the bright sunshine, and flying for short distances
                    with great velocity. They are elegant in form and adorned with brilliant
                    metallic colours, the prevalent hue being a golden green. The habits of the
                    larvae of these insects are very remarkable. Unfit, from the softness of their
                    bodies and the slowness of their motions, effectually to protect themselves from
                    the attacks of their enemies, or to capture their prey on the surface of the
                    ground, the larvae of the Tiger Beetles have recourse to stratagem in order to
                    effect these purposes. By means of their short thick legs, assisted by their
                    powerful sickle-shaped jaws, they dig burrows in the sandy banks which they
                    frequent, vertical for some distance, and afterwards curving so as to become
                    horizontal. These are about a foot in depth, and within them the Tiger Beetle
                    remains during its larval and pupa stages. In seeking its food the creature
                    makes its way from the bottom of its den until the head segment, which is broad
                    and flat, reaches the level of the ground, and thus blocks up the aperture of
                    its tunnel. It remains fixed in this position by means of two bent hooks placed
                    on the upper surface of the 'eighth segment, which is considerably thicker than
                    the others, until an unsuspecting ant or other insect passing over or close to
                    it is seized by its formidable jaws and speedily conveyed to the bottom of the
                    pit-fall, where it is greedily devoured. Should the tunnels of different
                    individuals happen to come in contact, the more powerful larva is said to devour
                    its weaker neighbour. When full grown it closes the mouth of its burrow and
                    there undergoes metamorphosis. The best known and most beautiful of British
                    species is the Tiger Beetle, <hi rend="italic">Cicindela campestris,</hi> of a
                    sea-green colour with six whitish spots on the elytra. When handled it exhales,
                    according to Westwood, a pleasant odour like that of roses. Ground beetles <hi
                    rend="italic">(Carabidae)</hi> are generally less brilliant in colour than the
                    Tiger forms, being more nocturnal in their habits, and with the jaws less
                    formidably toothed. Many of the species are entirely apterous, with the elytra
                    more or less soldered together, and the majority of them secrete an acrid juice
                    which they expel when menaced or attacked. Of the latter the most remarkable are
                    the Bombardier Beetles, <hi rend="italic">Brachinus</hi> (Plate VI. fig. 8).
                    These congregate together under stones, and when disturbed discharge a caustic
                    fluid of an extremely penetrating odour, and so volatile that no sooner does it
                    come in contact with the atmosphere than it passes into a vapour, accompanied by
                    a considerable explosion, during which they seek to escape. When placed on the
                    tongue this fluid causes a sharp pain and leaves a yellow spot somewhat similar
                    to that produced by a drop of nitric acid. The Bombardiers are said to be
                    capable of giving off as many as 18 of such discharges at a time. One of the
                    most beautiful of European beetles is the <hi rend="italic">Calosoma</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sycophanta</hi> (Plate VII. fig. 2), belonging to this group. Its
                    body is of a deep violet colour, and the elytra, which are striated and
                    punctured, are of a rich green and gold tint. Both in the larva and perfect
                    states these beetles frequent the trunks and branches of the oak, where they
                    find their favourite food—the large caterpillars of the Processionary Moth <hi
                    rend="italic">(Bombyx</hi><hi rend="italic">processionea),</hi> of which they
                    devour enormous numbers, apparently undeterred by the hairs which clothe the
                    body of the caterpillar, and which when seized by the human hand cause
                    considerable pain. One of the most curious of Carabideous Beetles, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mormolyce phyllodes</hi> (Plate VI. fig. 5), is a native of Java.
                    Its body is about 3 inches long and 1∣ inches across the elytra. The latter are
                    flat, thin, and greatly dilated, while the other parts of the body are
                    remarkably depressed, the beetle thus somewhat resembling the Orthopterous
                    leaf-insects, and hence the specific name <hi rend="italic">phyllodes,</hi> or
                    leaf-like. Many of the ground beetles, such as the typical <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carabi</hi> (Plate VI. figs. 6, 7) and the <hi rend="italic">Calosoma,</hi>
                    live in the sunshine and are generally brilliant in colouring; others spend
                    their existence <pb break="no"

                    and blind; while such forms as <hi rend="italic">Biennis areolatus,</hi> found
                    on the coast of Normandy, live for the most part under water, being only found
                    when the tide is low.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Hydradephaga,</hi> or Carnivorous Water Beetles, are oval
                    and somewhat depressed in form, with the two posterior pairs of legs flattened
                    and otherwise fitted for swimming. They include the Diving Beetles <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dytiscus)</hi> and the Whirligigs <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gyrinus).</hi> The former (Plate VII. figs. 3-7) occur in all quarters of the
                    globe, and are truly amphibious, for although water is their favourite element,
                    they survive for a long time on moist land, and most of them fly about in the
                    evening and morning twilight with great power and speed. When needing to breathe
                    they allow themselves to float on the surface of the water, raise their elytra,
                    and expose their stigmata to the atmosphere, thus getting quit of exhausted air
                    and obtaining a fresh supply, which is stored up by closing the elytra. They are
                    exceedingly voracious, devouring aquatic insects, as <hi rend="italic">Hy
                    drophilus</hi><hi rend="italic">piceus,</hi> much larger than themselves, and
                    doing considerable damage in fish ponds by devouring the young fish. They are
                    readily kept in confinement, having been known to live thus for 3¾ years,
                    feeding on raw beef and insects. The larvae are even more voracious than the
                    perfect insects, sucking the juices of their prey through perforated mandibles,
                    and protected from attack by their horny integuments. Whirligigs <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gyrinus)</hi> (Plate VII. figs. 10,11) differ from the Diving
                    Beetles in the antennae, which are short and stout, and are so placed as
                    somewhat to resemble ears. They are sociable creatures, and may be seen in ponds
                    and ditches, congregated in groups varying from 2 to 100, swimming upon the
                    surface with their backs above the water, and chasing each other in circles or
                    darting about in more irregular gyrations. Unlike other water beetles their
                    backs show a brilliant metallic lustre, and when darting about in the sunshine
                    they look like pearls dancing on the surface. Their eyes are so divided as to
                    appear to consist of two turned upwards and another pair looking downwards. The
                    larvae (Plate VII. fig. 17) are long, slender creatures somewhat resembling
                    small centipedes, having each of the abdominal segments provided with a pair of
                    slender ciliated appendages employed as organs of respiration as well as of
                    locomotion, while the last segment is provided with four hooked organs by means
                    of which they leap about.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Philhydrida,</hi> or Water-loving Beetles, are aquatic or
                    subaquatic in their habits, being found in the water or on the moist margins of
                    ponds and marshes. Along with the two following groups they feed on decaying
                    animal and vegetable substances, and for this reason those insects have been
                    classed together as <hi rend="italic">Rhypophaga,</hi> or Cleansers. The
                    antennae are short and clavate, and they are specially distinguished from other
                    aquatic forms by the great length of the maxillary palps, a feature which has
                    procured for them the name <hi rend="italic">Palpicornes,</hi> often applied to
                    them. The best known forms belong to the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrophilidee,</hi> of which one species, and that the largest, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydrophilus</hi><hi rend="italic">piceus</hi> (Plate VII. fig.
                    32), is an inhabitant of Europe. This beetle is oval in form, and of a dark
                    olive colour, and measures 1∣ inches in length. It uses its hind legs for
                    swimming or rather paddling, moving them not together, as the true water beetles
                    do, but alternately. Its movements in the water are thus slower than those of
                    the former, but speed in this case is less necessary, their principal food
                    consisting of aquatic leaves. In the larval stage, however, <hi rend="italic">H.
                    piceus</hi> makes an approach to the true water beetles in its food, and is so
                    ferocious as to have earned the name <hi rend="italic">ver assassin</hi> on the
                    Continent. The mode of respiration in the perfect insect is curious; unable to
                    raise its upper surface above the water, it merely protrudes its head, and
                    folding its clubshaped antennae, the ends of which are slightly hollow, it thus
                    conveys little bubbles of air beneath the surface of the water, where it brings
                    them into contact with the tracheal openings. The larvae swim with facility, and
                    are provided at the posterior extremity with two appendages which serve to
                    maintain them at the surface when they ascend to breathe.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Necrophaga</hi> are the beetles of most service in removing
                    decaying animal matter, although a few species live õn putrescent fungi, and
                    others resemble the carnivorous groups in attacking and devouring the larvae of
                    other insects. They are chiefly marked by the form of the antennae, which are
                    not much longer than the head, and get thickened or club-shaped at the
                    extremity. This group comprises the Sexton Beetles <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Necrophorus),</hi> of which <hi rend="italic">Necrophorus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vespillo</hi> (Plate VII. fig. 27) may be taken as the type. These
                    insects have thick bodies and powerful limbs, and owe their popular name to the
                    peculiar manner in which they provide a <hi rend="italic">nidus</hi> for their
                    eggs. Their sense of smell is exceedingly acute, and no sooner does one of the
                    smaller quadrupeds, as mice or moles, die, than several of those burying
                    beetles, gathering about, begin to remove the earth from beneath the dead
                    animal, and in a few hours succeed in sinking the carcase beneath the level of
                    the ground, which they then cover over with earth. Having thus prevented the
                    body from being devoured by other carrion-eating animals, or from having its
                    juices dried up by exposure to the sun, they make their way into the carcase and
                    there deposit their eggs. Several individuals generally work together in this
                    grave-digging operation, although <hi rend="italic">Necrophorus germanicus</hi>
                    is said to labour alone, and they have been known to show considerable
                    intelligence in performing this operation; thus Gleiditsch states that in order
                    to get possession of the body of a mole, fixed on the end of a stick, they
                    undermined the latter and thus brought the dead body to the ground. The larvae
                    on leaving the egg thus find themselves surrounded by an abundance of food; and
                    when full grown they bury themselves fully a foot beneath the surface of the
                    ground, where they form an oval chamber, the walls of which are strengthened by
                    a coating of a gluey liquid, and in which they undergo metamorphosis. Shield
                    Beetles <hi rend="italic">(Silpha)</hi> (Plate VII. fig. 22)—so called from the
                    flattened form of their bodies, feed chiefly on carrion; some, however, climb
                    upon plants, particularly the stems of wheat and other grain, where they find
                    small <hi rend="italic">helices</hi> on which they prey; while others, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Silpha punctata,</hi> dwell on trees and devour caterpillars. They
                    exhale a disagreeable odour, probably arising from the nature of their food, and
                    when they are seized a thick dark-coloured liquid exudes from their bodies. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Dermestidae</hi> are a family of small but widely-distributed
                    beetles, which work great havoc among skins, furs, leather, and the dried or
                    stuffed animals in museums. The perfect insects are timid creatures, which when
                    disturbed fold their short contractile feet under their bodies, and, remaining
                    perfectly motionless, admirably counterfeit death. The mischief is mainly
                    wrought by the larvae. These shed their skins several times, and take nearly a
                    year in attaining their full growth. One of the most common and injurious
                    species of this family is the Bacon Beetle <hi rend="italic">(Dermestes
                    lardarius)</hi> (Plate VII. fig. 14)—so called from its fondness for lard, but
                    equally ready to attack the furrier’s wares. Their tastes are exceedingly
                    general, as they have been known to destroy a whole cargo of cork and even to
                    perforate asbestos. The larvae of <hi rend="italic">Anthrenus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">museorum,</hi> a species not exceeding one-tenth of an inch in
                    length, is exceedingly injurious to collections of insects, among which it
                    eludes observation by its minuteness and by working in the interior of the
                    specimens, which are thus ruined before the damage is observed.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Brachelytra</hi> (Plate VII. figs. 12, 15, 20) are readily
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n156/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0156-0131"/> distinguished from the other groups of beetles by
                    having the elytra much shorter than the abdomen, although they still suffice to
                    cover the long membranous wings, which when not in use are completely folded
                    beneath. The abdomen is long and exceedingly mobile, and is employed in folding
                    and unfolding the wings. It is furnished at its extremity with two vesicles
                    which can be protruded or withdrawn at pleasure, and from which, when irritated,
                    many species emit a most disagreeable odour, although in a few the scent is more
                    pleasing; “one species,” says Kirby, “which I once took, smelt precisely like a
                    fine high scented pear, another like the water-lily, a third like watercresses,
                    and a fourth like saffron.” They are very voracious both in the larval and
                    perfect states, feeding chiefly upon decaying animal and vegetable matters,
                    although a few species devour living prey. Many of the smaller forms reside in
                    and feed on mushrooms, some are found abundantly under putrescent plants, others
                    in manure heaps, where they feed upon the maggots of flies, while there are a
                    few forms which make their homes in the nests of the hornet and the ant. The
                    larvae bear a considerable resemblance to their parents in form and habits, and
                    have the terminal segment of the abdomen prolonged into a tube with two conical
                    and hairy appendages attached. The Brachelytrous beetles form an extensive
                    group, almost entirely confined to the temperate regions of the northern
                    hemisphere, Great Britain alone possessing nearly 800 species. They are
                    familiarly known in this country as Cock-tails, one of the largest and most
                    familiar species being that known as the Devil’s Coach horse <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Go'érius</hi><hi rend="italic">olens)</hi> It is about an inch in length, of a
                    black colour, and its eggs are larger than those of any other British insect. It
                    may often be seen crossing garden walks; and when approached or otherwise
                    threatened, it immediately assumes a most ferocious aspect and attitude,
                    elevating its head and opening wide its formidable jaws, raising and throwing
                    back its tail after the manner of the scorpion, protruding its anal vesicles,
                    and emitting a disagreeable odour. It is carnivorous.</p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Glavicornes</hi> have the antennae terminating in a solid
                    or perfoliated club, and include the Pill Beetles <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Byrrhidsh</hi> and the Mimic Beetles <hi rend="italic">(Histeridae).</hi> The
                    former are small insects, generally short, oval, and highly convex, although a
                    few species found under the bark of trees are flattened. They most frequently
                    occur in sandpits and on pathways, and when in danger withdraw their highly
                    contractile legs into cavities prepared for them on the under side of the body,
                    at the same time folding up their antennae and remaining motionless. In this
                    condition they may readily be mistaken for oval seeds or pills, hence the common
                    name. The Mimic Beetles (Plate VII. fig. 13) seldom exceed one-third of an inch
                    in length, and are of very solid consistence, their elytra being so hard that
                    the pin of the entomologist is with difficulty made to enter. They are somewhat
                    square in form, with the upper surface highly polished, feeding chiefly on
                    putrid substances and found in great abundance in spring on the dung of oxen and
                    horses. Like Pill Beetles they roll themselves up on the approach of danger and
                    feign death with great perseverance, and to this they owe their generic name <hi
                    rend="italic">Hister,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">histrio,</hi> a stage
                    mimic.</p>
                <p>VIL <hi rend="italic">Lamellicornes</hi> comprise a vast assemblage of beetles,
                    many of which, especially such as feed on flowers and living plants, are
                    remarkable alike for beauty of form and splendour of colour. They are
                    distinguished, by the form of their antennae, which always terminate in a club
                    composed of several leaf-like joints, disposed like the spokes of a fan, the
                    leaves of a book, or the teeth of a comb, or in a series of funnels placed above
                    and within each other. The males often differ from the females in having
                    horn-like projections on the head and thorax, and in the greater size of their
                    mandibles. They are all winged insects, although somewhat dull and heavy in
                    their flight; and alike in the larval and perfect states they are herbivorous,
                    feeding either on living vegetation and flowers or on putrescent plants aud
                    excrementitious substances. The following species may be regarded as
                    illustrative of the most important subdivisons of the Lamellicorn Beetles :—Stag
                    Beetles <hi rend="italic">(Lucanidae)</hi> (Plate VIII. fig. 14), with the club
                    of the antennae composed of leaflets disposed perpendicularly to its axis like
                    the teeth of a comb, owe their most striking feature to the immense development
                    of the mandibles in the males, the purpose served by these formidable looking
                    organs being by no means fully understood. The males appear to be more numerous
                    than the females, and fierce contests take place among the former for possession
                    of the latter. The Stag Beetle <hi rend="italic">(Lucanus cervus),</hi> of a
                    uniform brown colour, measures 2 inches in length including the mandibles, and
                    is the largest of British beetles. It inhabits woods, passing its immature
                    stages in the interior of the oak and beech, and may be seen flying in the
                    evening in search of the female. It has a patch of golden-coloured hair towards
                    the base of the foreleg with which it cleans its antennae after these have been
                    in contact with any sticky substance. After coupling and depositing their eggs
                    both sexes soon die. The Dor Beetle <hi rend="italic">(Geotrupes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">stercorarius)</hi> is the type of a large tribe of dung-eating
                    beetles (Plate VII. figs. 21, 25, 26). It is a black insect, with brilliant
                    metallic blue or purple reflections on the under side, and well known as
                    “wheeling its drowsy flight” during fine evenings. This i t does in search of a
                    patch of cow-dung, through which it makes its way until reaching the ground,
                    where it bores a perpendicular tunnel about 8 inches deep, and as wide as a
                    man’s finger; then ascending to the surface it conveys a quantity of dung to the
                    bottom, and on this it proceeds to deposit an egg; another layer of the same
                    material and another egg follow until the entire shaft is filled. The larvae on
                    leaving the egg thus find themselves surrounded with their appropriate food. The
                    Sacred Beetle of Egypt, <hi rend="italic">Ateuchus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sacer</hi> (Plate VII. fig. 29), somewhat resembles the Dor in form and habits.
                    After depositing her egg on a piece of dung the female rolls the mass about in
                    the sunshine with her forelegs until it forms a rounded ball. The process of
                    hatching is thus accelerated, and a thin hardened crust is formed around the
                    sôfter material inclosing the egg. A hole is then dug in the earth by means of
                    its powerful forelegs, into which the ball is rolled and then covered over with
                    earth, where it remains until fully developed. Those beetles show great
                    perseverance in conveying the egg-laden pellets to their destination, frequently
                    carrying them over rough ground on the broad flat surface of their heads, and
                    seeking, when unable singly to complete the work, the assistance of their
                    fellows. Two species of Sacred Beetles were worshipped by the ancient Egyptians,
                    who regarded them as emblems of fertility, and as representing the resurrection
                    of the soul, owing to their sudden appearance in great numbers on the banks of
                    the Nile after the annual subsidence of that river. They form a conspicuous
                    feature in the hieroglyphics of that nation, and are found sculptured on their
                    monuments, sometimes of gigantic size. They were also formed into separate
                    figures, as seals and amulets, made of gold and other precious materials, and
                    hung around the necks of the living, or buried along with their mummies. The
                    insect itself is sometimes found in their coffins. The male Hercules Beetle <hi
                    rend="italic">(Scarabaeus</hi><hi rend="italic">hercules)</hi> of Guiana has the
                    head produced into an enormous horn, bent downwards at the extremity, and
                    clothed on the under surface with a reddish brown pile, and measures 6 inches in
                    length. The Cockchafers, <hi rend="italic">Melolonthidce</hi> (Plate VII. fig.
                    28), have a short <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n157/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0157-0132"/> labrum and strong mandibles suited for feeding on
                    leaves. The club of the antennae consists of a variable number of plates, those
                    in the male being considerably elongated and resembling a folded fan (Plate VII.
                    fig. 23). The common Cockchafer <hi rend="italic">(Mélolordha vulgaris)</hi> is
                    of a pitchy black colour clothed with a white pubescence or layer of minute
                    scales. It is one of the commonest and most destructive of beetles, feeding in
                    the perfect state on the leaves of the oak, beech, poplar, and elm, and
                    sometimes appearing in such numbers as to utterly destroy the foliage over large
                    districts; thus in the year 1688 they are said to have covered the hedges and
                    trees in a district of Galway in such infinite numbers as to have hung in
                    clusters like bees when they sw arm. When on the wing they almost darkened the
                    light of day, and when feeding the noise of their jaws might have been mistaken
                    for the sawing of timber. In a short time the foliage of the trees for miles
                    round was so totally consumed that at midsummer the country wore the aspect of
                    leafless winter. Destructive as they are in the perfect state they are still
                    more injurious as larvae. The female buries herself beneath the surface of the
                    ground and there deposits about 40 eggs. The larvae produced from these feed on
                    the roots of grass and grain, thus “undermining,” according to Kirby and Spence,
                    “the richest meadows, and so loosening the turf that it will roll up as if cut
                    with a turfing spade.” These grubs continue their ravages for three years before
                    undergoing metamorphosis, and thus do incalculable damage to the agriculturist.
                    They are believed to have spread with the progress of agriculture, for it is
                    only on soil rendered light and porous by tillage that they thrive. Enormous
                    numbers of the grub are consumed by birds of the crow tribe, and it is
                    principally in search of these that rooks so industriously follow the plough in
                    England and France. The species is rare in Scotland. “Spinning” the cockchafer
                    is a favourite but barbarous sport, practised by the boys of most countries in
                    which this beetle commonly occurs, and seems to be at least as ancient as the
                    time of Aristophanes, who refers to it in his <hi rend="italic">Clouds</hi> as
                    practised by the youth of Greece. Rose Beetles, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cetoniidae</hi> (Plate VIII. fig. 7), a beautiful tribe of insects, are
                    distinguished from other Lamellicorn Beetles by the membranaceous character of
                    their mandibles and maxillae. The Rose-Chafer <hi rend="italic">(Cetonia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aurata)</hi> is common in the south of England, where it feeds on
                    the juices and petals of the rose, honeysuckle, and privet. It is about an inch
                    long, of a brilliant-golden green above with coppery reflections beneath, and
                    with whitish markings on the elytra. Its eggs are deposited among decayed wood,
                    but certain species make use for this purpose of the nests of ants. The Goliath
                    Beetles (Plate VIII. fig. 11) of tropical Africa are the largest of known
                    Coleoptera, and their larvae form enormous cocoons of mud in which they undergo
                    metamorphosis. One of these, <hi rend="italic">Goliathus cacicus,</hi> is said
                    to be roasted and eaten by the natives.</p>
                <p>VIII. <hi rend="italic">Serricornes</hi> form a group of beetles chiefly
                    distinguished from the others by their elongate filiform antennae of equal
                    thickness throughout, or tapering towards the extremity, but generally serrated
                    or pectinated. They are subdivided into the <hi rend="italic">Sternoxi,</hi>
                    characterized by the solid consistence of their bodies, and by having the middle
                    portion of the thorax elongated and advanced as far as beneath the mouth, and
                    usually marked by a groove on each side, in which the short antennae are lodged,
                    while the opposite extremity is prolonged into a point which is received into a
                    cavity on the hinder part of the breast; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Malacodermata,</hi> characterized by their bodies being generally, in whole or
                    in part, of a soft or flexible texture, and by the absence of the prolongation
                    just referred to. The <hi rend="italic">Sternoxi</hi> include the Metallic
                    Beetles, <hi rend="italic">Buprestidae</hi> (Plate VII. figs. 18, 19) the most
                    gorgeous of the Coleopterous families. “Nothing can exceed,” says Westwood, “the
                    splendour of colour in many of the species, being decorated with the most
                    brilliant metallic tints; some have a general coppery hue, whilst some present
                    the beautiful contrast of fine yellow spots and marks upon a highly polished
                    blue or green ground, and others exhibit the appearance of burnished gold or of
                    rubies, inlaid on emerald or ebony.” The elytra of the Metallic Beetles are
                    those usually employed in the embroidery of ladies’ dresses and for other
                    purposes of personal ornament. They are most plentiful in the thick forests of
                    tropical countries, and seem partial to the various species of fir-trees. They
                    pass their larval· stage in the heart of timber, and there is an instance
                    recorded of the escape of <hi rend="italic">Buprestis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >splendens</hi> from the wood of a desk which had stood in one of the Guildhall
                    offices for over twenty years. Springing Beetles, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elateridae</hi> (Plate VII. fig. 30), are narrower and more elongate than the
                    former, and their legs are so short that when they fall on their backs they are
                    as unable to right themselves as a capsized turtle, but by bending the head and
                    thorax backwards, and making use of the prolongation already described, they are
                    enabled to spring to a height fully ten times their own length, and this
                    operation they repeat until they fall on their feet. The noise which accompanies
                    the springing process has earned for them the name of Click Beetles. Some
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Elateridae</hi> are luminous iu the dark, and are
                    known as Fireflies. A South American form diffuses during the night from its
                    thoracic spots a strong and beautiful light sufficient to enable a person to
                    read ordinary type, particularly if several are placed together in a glass
                    vessel. By means of this natural illumination the women of the country can
                    pursue their ordinary work, and ladies use this fire-fly as an ornament, placing
                    it among their tresses during their evening promenades. The larva of <hi
                    rend="italic">Elater</hi><hi rend="italic">lineatus</hi> is known as the
                    Wire-worm, a grub which often does great damage to tho turnip crop. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Malacodermata</hi> include the Glowworms, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lampyridae</hi> (Plate VII. fig. 1), of which the best known is the common
                    Glow-worm <hi rend="italic">(Lampyris noctiluca)</hi> (Plate VII. figs. 8, 9,
                    16), found in meadows and under hedges in England, but rare in Scotland. The
                    male of this beetle has large wings and elytra, and flies swiftly, but the
                    female is wingless and is a sluggish nocturnal creature; the latter, however,
                    emits a beautiful phosphorescent light, by means of which the male, who is
                    generally concealed by day in the trunks of trees, is directed to his mate. In
                    the perfect insect the luminous matter chiefly occupies the under part of the
                    three last segments of the abdomen, which differ from the rest in colour, being
                    usually of a yellow hue, and the luminous property is apparently under the
                    control of the Glow-worm, for when approached it may frequently be observed to
                    diminish or extinguish its light. In form the larvae somewhat resemble the
                    female, and possess in common with the pupae and eggs a slight degree of
                    luminosity. The larvae are predaceous, attacking and devouring the smaller
                    snails and slugs, Rut in the perfect state they become entirely herbivorous,
                    only eating the tender leaves of plants. Many of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Afalacodermata</hi> are wood-borers; these include the Death-watch Beetles <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anobium),</hi> which as larvae perforate chairs, tables, and
                    other wood-work in such numbers as usually to render the wood completely rotten.
                    During the pairing season they make a noise like the ticking of a watch, by
                    striking with their jaws against the object on which they rest. This is intended
                    as a mutual call of the sexes, but it has long been regarded by the ignorant as
                    of evil omen, hence the name, and the import of Gay’s words—</p>

                    into the timber of the oak tree.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Heteromera.</hi> —The beetles comprising this section have
                    five joints to the first four tarsi, and four to the posterior pair, and form
                    two groups, <hi rend="italic">Trachelia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atrachelia.</hi></p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Trachelia</hi> have the head triangular or heart-shaped, and
                    connected with the thorax by a kind of neck or abrupt pedicle. Most of the
                    species in the perfect state live on various plants, of which they devour the
                    foliage or suck the juices, and many when seized bend their heads, contract
                    their limbs, and simulate death. This group includes the Oil Beetles <hi
                    rend="italic">(Melöe)</hi> (Plate VIII. fig. 2), large black insects, destitute
                    of wings, and with short elytra. They secrete an oily fluid possessing slightly
                    blistering properties, which when alarmed they emit from the joints of their
                    legs, and when eaten by cattle, as they sometimes are when feeding on the wild
                    buttercups of pasture-lands, they produce sores in the mouth. In some parts of
                    Spain they are used instead of the Blistering Fly, or are mixed with it. The
                    young ]arvae of several species of Oil Beetles, it has been ascertained, get
                    conveyed to the nests of bees, where alone they can find their appropriate food,
                    and where also they undergo metamorphosis. The most important insect of this
                    group is the Spanish Fly, or Blistering Beetle <hi rend="italic">(Lytta
                    vesicatoria)</hi> (Plate VIII. fig. 19), found abundantly in SouthWestern
                    Europe, but of rare occurrence in England. It is a handsome insect of a golden
                    green colour, and measures about three-fourths of an inch in length. In Spain,
                    where this species is most abundant, they are collected for commercial purposes
                    in the month of June. A sheet is placed beneath the trees frequented by the
                    blister-flies, and the branches are shaken, so as to cause the insects to fall
                    off. They are then killed by exposure to the vapour of vinegar, and completely
                    dried after they are dead. The blistering principle, known to chemists as
                    cantharadin, is contained in their integuments. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cantharides.</hi></p>
                <p>II. The <hi rend="italic">Atrachelia</hi> have no distinct neck, the part of the
                    head behind the eyes being immersed in the thorax. They are in most cases
                    nocturnal insects, obscure in colour, and slow in motion. The Church-yard Beetle
                    <hi rend="italic">(Blaps mortisaga)</hi> (Plate VIII. fig. 1 ) is one of the
                    commonest species. It is of a shining black colour, avoids the light, and emits
                    an offensive odour. It is found in cellars, store-rooms, and the neglected parts
                    of houses, feeding on rubbish of all kinds, and regarded as of evil omen by the
                    superstitious. It is very tenacious of life, having been known to survive
                    several hours immersion in spirits of wine, and cases are on record in which the
                    larvae have been discharged from the human stomach. The Meal-worm is the larva
                    of <hi rend="italic">Tenebrio molitor</hi> (Plate VIII. figs. 4, 5), a
                    well-known insect belonging to this group, which appears in the evening in the
                    least frequented parts of houses. It is found abundantly in flour-mills and
                    bake-houses, greatly relishing the heat of the latter. The larvae, which are
                    long, cylindrical, and of an ochry yellow colour, pass their lives enveloped in
                    the flour which forms their favourite food, and in the midst of which they
                    become pupae. While injurious to flour and bran, and destroying great quantities
                    of ship biscuits, the Meal-worm is used as bait by fishermen, and as food for
                    the nightingale and other pet insectivorous birds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tetramera.</hi> —The beetles composing this section have
                    four apparent joints to all the tarsi, but in most cases the tarsi are in
                    reality five-jointed, the fourth being so minute as to have been overlooked by
                    the founders of the tarsal system. For this reason Westwood proposed the term
                    Pseudo-tetramera in place of Tetramera, a change which lias been adopted by
                    several systematic writers. This section includes a vast number of small or
                    moderate sized beetles, all vegetable feeders, found in the perfect state on
                    flowers and plants. It is subdivided into the three following groups :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Rhynchophora,</hi> the species of which are readily
                    recognized by having the front of the head produced into a rostrum or snout,
                    which bears the organs of the mouth at its extremity. The larvae are either
                    entirely destitute of legs, or havfe them in the form of small fleshy tubercles,
                    and are in most cases equally destitute of eyes. The most numerous and
                    best-known tribe of Rhynchophorous beetles are the Weevils (Plate VIII. figs. 8,
                    9, 15, 16, 20, 22), of which several thousand species have been described, and
                    whose larvae, dwelling in the interior of fruits and seeds, do immense damage to
                    the produce of the farmer, the grain dealer, and the horticulturist. They are
                    generally minute in size and exceedingly varied in colour, the South American
                    forms, known as Diamond Beetles, being among the most gorgeous of insects. These
                    owe their colour, which in the finest of them is a light-green tinged with
                    golden yellow, to the presence of minute scales on the elytra. The Weevil <hi
                    rend="italic">par excellence (Calandra</hi><hi rend="italic">granaria)</hi>
                    measures about one-eighth of an inch in length, is of a pitchy red colour, and
                    does great damage in granaries. The female buries herself among the grains of
                    wheat, in each of which she bores a small hole, where she deposits a single egg,
                    thereafter closing the aperture with a glutinous secretion. The egg is soon
                    hatched, and the larva, furnished with two strong mandibles, eats out the
                    interior of the grain, becomes a nymph, and in the course of eight or ten days
                    is transformed into the perfect insect, ready to raise another brood. The whole
                    time occupied with their reproduction, from the union of the sexes to the
                    appearance of the perfect Weevil, is not more than 50 days, and it has been
                    calculated that from a single pair 23,600 individuals may thus take origin in a
                    single season. Grain injured by these insects is readily detected, from the fact
                    that it floats when immersed in water. Kiln-drying the grain is the mode most
                    generally adopted for arresting the evil. Filberts, acorns, rice, the
                    sugar-cane, and the palm tree have each its own species of Weevil. The Palm Tree
                    Weevil <hi rend="italic">(Calandra</hi><hi rend="italic">palmarum)</hi> is the
                    largest of the tribe, measuring 2 inches in length, and its larvae, as well as
                    those of the sugar-cane species, are, when cooked, considered delicacies by the
                    natives of Guiana and the West Indies. <hi rend="italic">Bruchus pisi</hi>
                    (Plate VIII. fig. 12), belonging to another family of this group, deposits its
                    eggs in peas, the interior of which is devoured by the larva. It has probably
                    been introduced into Britain from America, where its ravages are occasionally
                    such as totally to destroy the pea crop over large districts. The larvae of many
                    species burrow beneath the bark of trees and thus destroy immense quantities of
                    timber. Of these the most familiar are <hi rend="italic">Scolytus
                    destructor,</hi> whose curiously designed burrows in the bark of the elm are
                    well known, and the Typographic Beetle <hi rend="italic">(Tomicus
                    typographicus),</hi> so called from the resemblance which its burrows, made in
                    the soft wood Immediately beneath the bark, bear to printed characters.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Longicornes</hi> (Plate VIII. fig. 13) form an extensive
                    group of beetles characteristic of tropical forests, and readily distinguished
                    by the great length of their antennae, which in some cases are several times
                    longer than the body. These are usually setaceous or filiform, and are
                    occasionally adorned with tufts of hair at the joints (Plate VIII. fig. 3). The
                    larvae of almost all the Longicorns live in the interior, or beneath the bark,
                    of trees, perforating the timber of the largest forest trees, and thus hastening
                    in these the natural process of decay. They are either apodal, or furnished with
                    inconspicuous feet, but progress chiefly by the aid of small tubercles on the
                    upper and under surfaces of the segments. The female is provided with an
                    ovipositor of horny consistence, issuing from the posterior segment, by means of
                    which the eggs are deposited in cracks and fissures of wood. The larvae remain
                    for several years buried in the <pb break="no"

                    species are conveyed to this country, and are occasionally taken alive in the
                    London and Liverpool docks. Several of the Longicorn Beetles are among the
                    largest of Coleopterous insects, <hi rend="italic">Prionus giganteus</hi>
                    measuring 5 inches in length, while its eggs are nearly as large as those of the
                    smaller birds. The Harlequin Beetle <hi rend="italic">(shcrocinus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">longimanus),</hi> so called from the variety of its colouring, the
                    grotesqueness of its markings, and the enormous elongation of its front pair of
                    legs, is a South American species of this group, as is also the Musk Beetle <hi
                    rend="italic">(Callichroma</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">moschata),</hi> one of the handsomest of our native species, and
                    remarkable for the musky odour of its body.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Phytophaga</hi> comprise the tetramerous beetles which
                    have neither the rostrum of the first group nor the lengthened antennae of the
                    second. They are small insects of an oval or quadrate shape, and include the
                    Golden Beetles, <hi rend="italic">Chrysomelidae</hi> (Plate VIII. fig. 21),
                    ornamented with metallic colours, among which blue, green, gold, and copper are
                    conspicuous. The Turnip-fly <hi rend="italic">(Haltica nemorum),</hi> a small
                    species belonging to a family in which the posterior thighs are enlarged for
                    leaping, devours the .young leaves of the turnip as soon as they appear above
                    ground, and occasionally does immense injury to the turnip crop. Helmet or
                    Tortoise Beetles, <hi rend="italic">Cassidae</hi> (Plate VIII. figs. 20, 24), so
                    called from the thorax and elytra overlapping so as to shield the limbs and
                    abdomen on all sides, are oval, and in some cases almost square, flat insects,
                    and often beautifully marked with combinations of green and golden hues, They
                    are herbivorous, and are specially fond of artichoke and thistles. The larvae
                    are provided at the posterior extremity with a two-branched fork, curved over
                    the back, and usually bearing a pile of excrementitious matter, under which they
                    lie partly concealed It can elevate or depress this stercoraceous parasol at
                    pleasure, according as it needs shade or shelter. The Colorado Potato Beetle <hi
                    rend="italic">(Doτyphora</hi><hi rend="italic">decemlineata)</hi> belongs to the
                    phytophagous family <hi rend="italic">Ghrysomelidae.</hi> It measures nearly
                    half an inch in length; its body is of a tawny or yellow cream colour, darkly
                    spotted; and the elytra are marked with ten black longitudinal stripes. It is a
                    native of the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, where it fed on a wild
                    solanaceous plant, <hi rend="italic">Solanum rostratum,</hi> until the
                    introduction of the potato plant, consequent on the settlement and cultivation
                    of the “Far West,” provided it with what appears to have been a more appropriate
                    food. Since 1859 it has travelled eastward, towards the more highly cultivated
                    lands, at the rate of nearly 100 miles per annum, until it has reached the
                    Atlantic Coast. It is now found over all the central and northern parts of the
                    United States east of the Rocky Mountains, and throughout Canada, anti has
                    already done incalculable mischief to the potato crops of those regions. The
                    damage is chiefly wrought by the larvae, which are hatched on, and greedily
                    devour, the leaves and stalk of the potato plant. They are said to produce three
                    broods annually.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Trimera.</hi> —The majority of the beetles composing this
                    section have only three apparent joints to the tarsi of all the feet, but a
                    small articulation has been found to lie between the second and third joints, so
                    that they are in reality four-jointed, aud for this reason Westwood has changed
                    the name of the section to Pseudotrimera.</p>
                <p>Trimerous beetles form a single group, the species of which are partly
                    herbivorous, feeding on fungi (Plate VIII. figs. 17, 18), and partly
                    carnivorous, devouring <hi rend="italic">aphides</hi> or plant lice. The most
                    familiar examples of this group are Lady-birds, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coccinellidae</hi> (Plate VIII. fig. 23), small convex insects of a black
                    colour, spotted with red or yellow, or of a reddish colour, spotted with black.
                    The larvae do great service by devouring the plant lice, which usually infest
                    garden bushes. When alarmed the Lady-birds retract their limbs and emit a yellow
                    juice from their joints, which has a very disagreeable odour. They occasionally
                    occur in great numbers, extending for miles, in the south-eastern districts of
                    England, where they are invaluable for freeing the hops of <hi rend="italic"
                    >aphides.</hi> They walk slowly but fly well. The Seven-Spotted Lady-bird <hi
                    rend="italic">(f!occinella</hi><hi rend="italic">7-punctata),</hi> the common
                    species of Britain, is found in all quarters of the globe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">On Collecting and Preserving Coleopterous Insects.</hi> —The
                    collector of beetles, in order to obtain perfect specimens, need not have
                    recourse to the plan adopted by the lepidopterist of rearing the insect from the
                    egg. The successful rearing of these is much more difficult than in the case of
                    butterflies and moths, and the specimens so procured are generally inferior to
                    those collected in the ordinary way. The complete life history, however, of
                    comparatively few even of our native species has yet been fully traced; and
                    although the collector thus might not greatly enrich his cabinet with specimens
                    of his own rearing, yet by adopting this method he would almost certainly add to
                    the general stock of knowledge regarding the transformations of these insects.
                    Beetles may often be obtained in what may be termed accidental
                    situations,—sand-pits into which they have fallen, or artificial traps set for
                    them, as a white sheet spread on the grass; but “sweeping” and “beating” are the
                    means mainly relied on by the coleopterist for filling his cabinet, and for
                    these all the apparatus necessary consists of an umbrella-net and a stick for
                    beating. The net is swept over the grass, and among the foliage of trees, and
                    when the branches are shaken with the hand, or beaten with the stick, the net is
                    held beneath to catch the falling insects. An umbrella inverted, or a sheet
                    placed beneath the tree, serves the same purpose. A knowledge of the habits of
                    the various tribes of beetles will give the collector a clue to the localities
                    in which, and the time when, he may expect to find the species he is in search
                    of. In this way the bark and timber of trees, decaying branches and leaves,
                    putrescent fungi, the droppings and the dead bodies of mammals, fresh water
                    ponds, and even the nests of wasps, bees, and ants will all be found to yield
                    their own harvest of Coleoptera. Beetles when caught may either be dropped into
                    a phial containing spirits of any kind, or into what is known as the “killing
                    bottle,” the bottom of which contains cyanide of potassium covered over with a
                    layer of gypsum. In either case, with few exceptions, the beetles die almost
                    instantaneously. If kept too long in spirits, however, the limbs get loosened
                    through maceration and fall off. The “setting” of a beetle, or of any other
                    insect, consists in placing its limbs and antennae in a natural position and
                    fixing them there by means of pins until they stiffen on a board on which there
                    is a layer of cork. If not set when either moist or recent, they may be softened
                    by being placed for a night in any small vessel containing a layer of wet sand,
                    and covered with a damp cloth to prevent evaporation. The smaller beetles are
                    usually mounted on card, each insect being stuck on a small dab of gum with its
                    legs and antennae properly set; all others are pinned through the centre of the
                    upper part of the right elytron. In the case of large beetles as much of the
                    contents of the body as possible should be removed by making an opening in the
                    abdomen; and with the Oil Beetles it is necessary to stuff the abdomen. This can
                    be best effected by separating the latter from the body, emptying it, and
                    refilling with wadding; it can then be readily gummed to the body. Mould may be
                    got rid of by exposing the specimens to a strong heat for some hours, and mites
                    and grease by washing the beetles with a small brush dipped in benzine. <hi
