                    roi à la</hi><hi rend="italic">Tabic</hi><hi rend="italic">de Marbre</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Palais,</hi> and also held the position of <hi rend="italic"
                    >maître des eaux et</hi><hi rend="italic">fôrets</hi> in the vicomté of Rouen.
                    In this latter office he is said to have shown him self a vigorous magistrate,
                    suppressing brigandage and plunder without regard to his personal safety. He was
                    ennobled in 1637 (it is said not without regard to his son’s distinction), and
                    the honour was renewed in favour of his sons Pierre and Thomas in 1669, when a
                    general repeal of the letters of nobility recently granted had taken place.
                    There appears, however, to be no instance on record of the poet himself assuming
                    the “de” of nobility. His mother’s name was Marthe le Pesant.</p>
                <p>After being educated by the Jesuits of Rouen, Corneille at the age of eighteen
                    was entered as <hi rend="italic">avocat,</hi> and in 1624 took the oaths, as we
                    are told, four years before the regular time, a dispensation having been
                    procured. He was afterwards appointed advocate to the admiralty and to the
                    “waters and forests,” but both these posts must have been of small value, as we
                    find him parting with them in 1650 for the insignificant sum of 6000 livres. No
                    other evidence of any professional employment on his part is forthcoming, though
                    he seems to have discharged certain parochial functions. His first play, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mélite,</hi> was acted in 1629. It is said by Fontenelle to have
                    been inspired by personal experiences/ and was extremely popular, either because
                    or in spite of its remarkable difference from the popular plays of the day,
                    those of Hardj. In 1632 <hi rend="italic">Clitandre,</hi> a tragedy, followed;
                    in the following year <hi rend="italic">La Veuve,</hi> and in 1634 the <hi
                    rend="italic">Galerie</hi><hi rend="italic">du Palais</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >La Suivante,</hi> all the three last-named plays being comedies. In 1634, also,
                    having been selected as the composer of a Latin elegy to Richelieu on the
                    occasion of the cardinal visiting Rouen, he was introduced to the subject of.his
                    verses, and was soon after enrolled among the “five poets.” These officers (the
                    others being Colletet, Bois Robert, and De ΓEtoile, who in no way merited the
                    title, and Rotrou, who was no unworthy yokefellow even of Corneille) had for
                    tasks the more profitable than dignified occupation of working up Richelieu’s
                    ideas into dramatic form. No one could be less suited for such work than
                    Corneille, and he soon incurred his employer’s displeasure by altering the plan
                    of the third act of <hi rend="italic">Les Thuileries,</hi> which had been
                    intrusted to him.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the year 1635 saw the production of two dramas— <hi rend="italic">La
                    Place</hi><hi rend="italic">Royale,</hi> a comedy of the same stamp as his
                    preceding works, and <hi rend="italic">M'edèe,</hi> a grand but unequal tragedy.
                    In the next year the singular extravaganza entitled <hi rend="italic">L</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ulusion</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >comique</hi> followed, and was succeeded by the <hi rend="italic">Cid.</hi> The
                    triumphant success of this, perhaps the most ‘‘epoch-making” play in all
                    literature, the jealousy of Richelieu and the Academy, the open attacks of
                    Scudériand Mairet and others, and the pamphlet-war which followed, are among the
                    best-known incidents in the history of letters. The trimming verdict of the
                    Academy, when its arbitration was demanded by Richelieu, and not openly
                    repudiated by Corneille, was virtually unimportant; but it is worth remembering
                    that Scudéri, a writer of at least temporary eminence and of some talent,
                    gravely and apparently sincerely asserted and maintained of this great play that
                    the subject was utterly bad, that all the rules of dramatic composition were
                    violated, that the action was badly conducted, the versification constantly
                    faulty, and the beauties as a rule stolen! Corneille himself was awkwardly
                    situated in this dispute. The <hi rend="italic">esprit</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bourru</hi> by which he w as at all times distinguished, and which he now
                    displayed in his rather arrogant <hi rend="italic">Excuse</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >à</hi><hi rend="italic">Ariste,</hi> unfitted him for controversy, and it was
                    of vital importance to him that he should not lose the outward marks of favour
                    which Richelieu continued to show him. Perhaps the pleasantest feature in the
                    wſhole matter is the unshaken and generous admiration with which Rotrou, the
                    only contemporary whose genius entitled him to criticise Corneille, continued to
                    regard his friend, rival, and in some sense (though Rotrou was the younger of
                    the two) pupil. Finding it impossible to make himself fairly heard in the
                    matter, Corneille (who had retired from his position among the· “five poets ”)
                    withdrew to Rouen and passed nearly three years in quiet there. In 1639, or at
                    the beginning of 164.0, <pb break="no"

                    dedication to Richelieu. The good offices of Madame de Combalet, to whom the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cid</hi> had been dedicated, and perhaps the satisfaction of the
                    cardinal’s literary jealousy, had healed what breach there may have been, and
                    indeed the poet was in no position to quarrel with his patron. Richelieu not
                    only allowed him 500 crowns a year, but soon afterwards employed his omnipotence
                    in reconciling the father of the poet’s mistress, Marie de Lampérière, to the
                    marriage of the lovers. These were years of considerable importance to
                    Corneille. Not only <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi> but <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cinna</hi> appeared therein. A brief but very serious illness attacked him, and
                    the death of his father increased his family anxieties by leaving his mother in
                    very indifferent circumstances.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of 1640 <hi rend="italic">Polyeucte</hi> was produced; and in the
                    following year Corneille figured as a contributor to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guirlande</hi><hi rend="italic">de Julie,</hi> a famous album which the marquis
                    de Montausier, assisted by all the literary men of the day, offered to his lady
                    love Julie d’Angennes. 1642 saw <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Mort
                    de Pompée</hi> and the memorable comedy of <hi rend="italic">Le Menteur,</hi>
                    which though adapted from the Spanish stood in relation to French comedy very
                    much as <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Cid,</hi> which owed to Spain
                    only its subject, stood to French tragedy. The sequel which followed it in 1644
                    was not popular, but <hi rend="italic">Rodogune</hi> was a brilliant success.
                    <hi rend="italic">Théodore,</hi> a tragedy on a somewhat perilous subject, was
                    the first of Corneille’s plays which was definitely damned. Some amends may have
                    been made to him by the commission which he received to write verses for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Triomphes poétiques</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lozιis</hi><hi rend="italic">XIII,</hi> Soon after (January 22, 1647) the
                    Academy at last (it had twice rejected him on frivolous pleas) admitted the
                    greatest of living French writers. <hi rend="italic">Heraclius</hi> (1647), <hi
                    rend="italic">Andromède</hi> (1650), a spectacle rather than a play, <hi

                    >Nicomède</hi> (1651) were the products of the next few years’work; but in 1653
                    <hi rend="italic">Pertharite</hi> was received with decided disfavour, and the
                    poet in disgust resolved, like Ben Jonson, to quit the loathed stage. In this
                    resolution he persevered for six years, during which he worked at a verse
                    translation of the <hi rend="italic">Imitation of Christ</hi> (finished in
                    1656), at his three <hi rend="italic">Discourses on Dramatic Poetry,</hi> and at
                    the <hi rend="italic">Examens</hi> which are usually printed at the end of his
                    plays. In 1659 Fouquet, the Maecenas of the time, persuaded him to alter his
                    resolve, and <hi rend="italic">Oedipe,</hi> a play which became a great
                    favourite with Louis XIV., was the result. It was followed by <hi rend="italic"
                    >La Toison</hi><hi rend="italic">d'Or</hi> (1660), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sertorius</hi> (1662), and <hi rend="italic">Sophonisbe</hi> (1663). In this
                    latter year Corneille was included among the list of men of letters pensioned at
                    the proposal of Colbert. He received 2000 livres. <hi rend="italic">Othon</hi>
                    (1664), <hi rend="italic">Agésilas</hi> (1666), <hi rend="italic">Attila</hi>

                    rend="italic">Berenice</hi> (1670), were generally considered as proofs of
                    failing powers,—the cruel quatrain of Boileau—</p>
                <p>Après l’Agésilas</p>
                <p>Hélas!</p>
                <p>Mais après l’Attila Holà!</p>
                <p>in the case of these two plays, and the unlucky comparison with Racine in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bérénice,</hi> telling heavily against them. In 1665 and 1670 some
                    versifications of devotional works addressed to the Virgin had appeared. The
                    part which Corneille took in <hi rend="italic">Psyche</hi> (1671), Molière and
                    Quinault being his coadjutors, showed signs of renewed vigour; but <hi
                    rend="italic">Pulchéri¢</hi> (1672) and <hi rend="italic">Suréna</hi> (1674)
                    were allowed even by his faithful followers to be failures. He lived for ten
                    years after the appearance of <hi rend="italic">Suréna,</hi> but was almost
                    silent save for the publication, in 1676, of some beautiful verses thanking
                    Louis XIV. for ordering the revival of his plays. He died at his lodging in the
                    Rue d’Argenteuil on the 30th of September 1684. For nine years (1674-81), and
                    again in 1683, his pension had, for what reason is unknown, been suspended, and
                    he was in great straits. The story goes that at last Boileau, hearing of this,
                    went to the king and offered to resign his own pension if there were not money
                    enough for Corneille, and that Louis sent the aged poet 200 pistoles. He might
                    have said, with a great English poet in like case, “I have no time to spend
                    them.” Two days afterwards he was dead.</p>
                <p>Corneille was buried in the church of St Roch, where no monument marked his grave
                    until 1821. He had six children, of whom four survived him. Pierre, the eldest
                    son, a cavalry officer, left posterity in whom the name has continued; Marie,
                    the eldest daughter, was twice married, and by her second husband, Μ. de Farcy,
                    became the ancestress of Charlotte Corday. Repeated efforts have been made for
                    the benefit of the poet’s descendants, Voltaire, Charles X., and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Comédie Française</hi> having all borne part therein.</p>
                <p>The portraits of Corneille (the best and most trustworthy of which is from the
                    burin of Lasne, an engraver of Caen) represent him as a man of serious, almost
                    of stern countenance, and this agrees well enough with such descriptions as we
                    have of his appearance and with the idea of him which we should form from his
                    writings and conduct. His nephew Fontenelle admits that his general address and
                    manner were by no means prepossessing. Others use stronger language, and it
                    seems to be confessed that either from shyness, from pride, or from physical
                    defects of utterance, probably from all three combined, he did not attract
                    strangers. Racine is said to have assured his son that Corneille made verses
                    “cent fois plus beaux” than his own, but that his own greater popularity was
                    owing to the fact that he took some trouble to make himself personally
                    agreeable. Almost all the anecdotes which have been recorded concerning the
                    greatest of French dramatists testify to a rugged and somewhat unamiable
                    self-contentment. “Je n’ai pas le mérite de ce pays-ci,” he said of the court.
                    “Je n’en suis pas moins Pierre Corneille,” he is said to have replied to his
                    friends whenever they dared to suggest certain shortcomings in his behaviour,
                    manner, or speech. “Je suis saoul de gloire et affamé d’argent” was his reply to
                    the compliments of Boileau. Yet tradition is unanimous as to his affection for
                    his family and as to the harmony in which he lived with his brother Thomas who
                    had married Marguerite de Lampérière, younger sister of Marie, and whose
                    household both at Rouen and at Paris was practically one with that of his
                    brother. No story about Corneille is better known than that which tells of the
                    trap between the two houses, and how Pierre, whose facility of versification was
                    much inferior to his brother’s, would lift it when hard bestead, and call out
                    “Sans-souci, une rime !” Notwithstanding this domestic felicity, an impression
                    is left on the reader of Corneille’s biographies that he was by no means a happy
                    man. Melancholy of temperament will partially explain this, but there were other
                    reasons. He appears to have been quite free from envy properly so called, and to
                    have been always ready to acknowledge the excellencies of his contemporaries.
                    But, as was the case with a very different man—Goldsmith—praise bestowed on
                    others always made him uncomfortable unless it w ere accompanied by praise
                    bestowed on himself. As Guizot has excellently said, “Sa jalousie fut celle d’un
                    enfant qui veut qu’un sourire le rassure contre les caresses que reçoit son
                    frère."</p>
                <p>Another cause of discomfort must have been the pressure of poverty. His pensions
                    covered but a small part of his long life and were most irregularly paid. The
                    occasional presents of rich men, such as Montauron (who gave him 1000, others
                    say 200, pistoles for the dedication of <hi rend="italic">Cinna)</hi> and
                    Fouquet (who commissioned <hi rend="italic">Oedipe),</hi> were few and far
                    between, though they have exposed him to reflections which show great ignorance
                    of the manners of the age. Of his professional earnings, the small sum for
                    which, as <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n448/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0448-0419"/> Λve have seen, he gave up his offices, and the
                    expression of Fontenelle that he practised “sans goût et suns succès” are
                    sufficient proof. His patrimony and his wife’s dowry must have been both
                    trifling. On the other hand, it was during the early and middle part of his
                    career impossible, and during the later part very difficult, for a dramatist to
                    live decently by his pieces. It was not till the middle of the century that the
                    custom of allowing the author two shares in the profits during the first run of
                    the piece was observed, and even then revivals profited him nothing. Thomas
                    Corneille himself, who to his undoubted talents united wonderful facility,
                    untiring industry, and (gift valuable above all others to the playwright) an
                    extraordinary knack of hitting the public fancy, died, notwithstanding his
                    simple tastes, “as poor as Job.” We know that Pierre received for two of his
                    later pieces 2000 livres each, and it would seem that this was the utmost he
                    ever did deceive.</p>
                <p>But if his gains in money were small and insufficient, it must not be supposed
                    that his reward in fame was stinted. Corneille, unlike many of the great writers
                    of the world, was not driven to wait for “the next age” to do him justice. The
                    cabal which attacked the <hi rend="italic">Cid</hi> was a cabal of a purely
                    cliquish character, and had, as we are assured on the amplest evidence, no
                    effect whatever on the judgment of the public. All his subsequent masterpieces
                    were received with the same ungrudging applause, and the rising star of Racine,
                    even in conjunction with the manifest inferiority of the last five or six plays
                    of the author of <hi rend="italic">Cinna,</hi> with difficulty prevailed against
                    the towering reputation of the latter. The great men of his time—Condé, Turenne,
                    the maréchal de Grammont, the knight-errant due de Guise—were his fervent
                    admirers. Nor had he less justice done him by a class from whom less justice
                    might have been expected, the brother men of letters whose criticisms he treated
                    with such scant courtesy. The respectable mediocrity of Chapelain might
                    misapprehend him; the lesser geniuses of Scudéri and Mairet might feel alarm at
                    his advent; the envious Claverets and D’Aubignacs might snarl and scribble. But
                    Balzac did him justice; Rotrou, as we have seen, never failed in generous
                    appreciation; Molière in conversation and in print recognized him as his own
                    master and the foremost of dramatists. We have quoted the informal tribute of
                    Racine; but it should not be forgotten that Racine, in discharge of his duty as
                    respondent at the Academical reception of Thomas Corneille, pronounced upon the
                    memory of Pierre perhaps the noblest and most just tribute of eulogy that ever
                    issued from the lips of a rival. Boileau’s testimony is of a more chequered
                    character; yet he seems never to have failed in admiring Corneille whenever his
                    principles would allow him to do so. Of his conduct in the poet’s dire necessity
                    we have spoken already, and there is one story of the period of his extreme old
                    age which must not be omitted. Questioned as to the great men of Louis XIV.’s
                    reign, he is said to have replied: “I only know three,—Corneille, Molière, and
                    myself.” “And how about Racine <hi rend="italic">ì”</hi> his auditor ventured to
                    remark. “He was an extremely clever fellow whom I taught with great difficulty
                    to write verse.” It was reserved for the 18th century to exalt Racine above
                    Corneille. Voltaire, who was prompted by his natural benevolence to comment on
                    the latter (the profits went to a relation of the poet), was not altogether
                    fitted by nature to appreciate Corneille, and moreover, as has been ingeniously
                    pointed out, was not a little wearied by the length of his task. His partially
                    unfavourable verdict was endorsed earlier by Vauvenargues, who knew little of
                    poetry, and later by La Harpe, whose critical stand-point has now been
                    universally abandoned. Napoleon I. was a great admirer of Corneille (“s’il
                    vivait je le ferais prince,” he said), and under the Empire and the Restoration
                    an approach to a sounder appreciation was made. But it was the glory of the
                    romantic school, or rather of the more catholic study of letters which that
                    school brought about, to restore Corneille to his true rank, that of the
                    greatest writer of France,—perhaps the only one who up to our own times can take
                    rank with the Dantes and Shakespeares of other countries. So long, indeed, as a
                    certain kind of criticism was pursued due appreciation was impossible. When it
                    was thought sufficient to say with Boileau that Corneille excited, not pity or
                    terror, but admiration which was not a tragic passion; or that</p>

                <p>Almost the first thing which strikes a reader is the singular inequality of this
                    poet. Producing, as he certainly has produced, work which classes him with the
                    greatest names in literature, he has also signed an extraordinary quantity of
                    verse which has not merely the defects of genius, irregularity, extravagance,
                    <hi rend="italic">bizarretê,</hi> but the faults which we are apt to regard as
                    exclusively belonging to those who lack genius, to wit, the dulness and
                    tediousness of mediocrity. Molière’s manner of accounting for this is famous in
                    literary history or legend. “My friend Corneille,” he said, “has a familiar who
                    inspires him with the finest verses in the world. But sometimes the familiar
                    leaves him to shift for himself, and then he fares very badly.” That Corneille
                    was by no means destitute of the critical faculty his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discourses</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Examens</hi> (often admirably acute)
                    of his plays show well enough. But an enemy might certainly contend that a
                    poet’s critical faculty should be of the Promethean, not the Epimethean order.
                    The fact seems to be that the form in which Corneille’s work was cast, and which
                    by an odd irony of fate he did so much to originate and make popular, was very
                    partially suited to his talents. He could imagine admirable situations, and he
                    could write verses of incomparable grandeur—verses that reverberate again and
                    again in the memory. But he could not, with the patient docility of Racine,
                    labour at strictly proportioning the action of a tragedy, at maintaining a
                    uniform rate of interest in the course of the plot and of excellence in the
                    fashion of the verse. Especially in his later plays a verse and a couplet will
                    crash out with fulgurous brilliancy, and then be suçceeded by pages of very
                    second-rate declamation or argument. It was urged against him also by the party
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Doucereux,</hi> as he called them, that he could not
                    manage, or did not attempt, the great passion of love, and that except in the
                    case of Chimène his principle seemed to be that of one of his own heroines

                <p>There is perhaps some truth in this accusation, however much some of us may be
                    disposed to think that the line just quoted is a fair enough description of the
                    admired ecstasies of Achille and Bajazet. But these are all the defects which
                    can be fairly urged against him; and in a dramatist bound to a less strict
                    service they would hardly have been even remarked. On the English stage the
                    liberty of unrestricted incident and complicated action, the power of
                    multiplying characters and introducing prose scenes, would have exactly suited
                    his somewhat intermittent genius, both by covering defects and by giving greater
                    scope for the exhibition of power.</p>

                    characters of Aristie, Viriate, and Sertorius himself, in the play named after
                    the latter, are not to be surpassed in grandeur of thought, felicity of design,
                    or appropriateness of language. Admiration may or may not properly be excited by
                    tragedy, and until this important question is settled the name of tragedian may
                    be at pleasure given to or withheld from the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rodogune.</hi> But his rank among the greatest of dramatic poets is not a
                    matter of question. For a poet is to be judged by his best things, and the best
                    things of Corneille are second to none.</p>
                <p>It was, however, some time before his genius came to perfection. It is undeniable
                    that the first six or seven of his plays are of no very striking intrinsic
                    merit. On the other hand, it requires only a very slight acquaintance with the
                    state of the drama in France at the time to see that these works, poor as they
                    may now seem, must have struck the spectators as something new and surprising.
                    The language and dialogue of <hi rend="italic">Mélite</hi> are on the whole
                    simple and natural, and though the construction is not very artful (the fifth
                    act being as is not unusual in Corneille superfluous and clumsy) it is still
                    passable. The fact that one of the characters jumps on another’s back, and the
                    rather promiscuous kissing which takes place, are nothing to the liberties
                    usually taken in contemporary plays. A worse fault is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >στιχoμμθia,</hi> or, to borrow Butler’s expression, the Cat and Puss dialogue
                    which abounds. But the common objection to the play at the time was that it was
                    <hi rend="italic">too</hi> natural and too devoid of striking incidents.
                    Corneille accordingly, as he tells us, set to work to cure these faults, and
                    produced a truly wonderful work, <hi rend="italic">Clitandre.</hi> Murders,
                    combats, escapes and outrages of all kinds are provided; and the language makes
                    <hi rend="italic">The. Rehearsal</hi> no burlesque. One of the heroines rescues
                    herself from a ravisher by blinding him with a hair-pin, and as she escapes the
                    seducer apostrophizes the blood which trickles from his eye, and the weapon
                    which has wounded it, in a speech forty verses long. This, however, was his only
                    attempt of the kind. His next four pieces were comedies. They are not
                    particularly comic, and they labour under the same defect of construction as <hi
                    rend="italic">Mélite.</hi> But there is claimed for them the introduction of
                    some important improvements, such as the choos* ing for scenes places well known
                    in actual life (as in the <hi rend="italic">Galerie</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Palais),</hi> and the substitution as a stock comic character of tho soubrette
                    in place of the old inconvenient and grotesque nurse. It is certain, however,
                    that there is more interval between these six plays and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Médée</hi> than between the latter and Corneille’s greatest drama. Here first
                    do we find those sudden and magnificent lines which characterize the poet. The
                    title role is, however, the only good one, and as a whole the play is heaVy.
                    Much the same may be ειid of its curious successor, <hi rend="italic">L'illusion
                    comique.</hi> This is not only a play within a play, but in part of it there is
                    actually a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> involution, one set of characters
                    beholding another set discharging the parts of yet another. It contains,
                    however, some very fine lines,—in particular, a defence of the stage and some
                    heroics put into the mouth of a braggadocio. We have seen it said of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cid</hi> that it is difficult to understand the enthusiasm it
                    excited. But the difficulty can only exist for persons who are insensible to
                    dramatic excellence, cr who so strongly object to the forms of the French drama
                    that they cannot relish anything so presented. To relish <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iphigénie</hi> one must in some sort make oneself of the age of its first
                    spectators. But Rodrigune, Chimène, Don Diègue are not of any age but of all
                    time. The conflicting passions of love, honour, duty, are here represented
                    asthey never had been on a French stage, and no one who has ever felt either can
                    be indifferent to their representation in the “strong style” which was
                    Corneille’s own. Of the many objections urged against the play, perhaps the
                    weightiest is that which condemns the frigid and superfluous part of the
                    Infanta. <hi rend="italic">Horace,</hi> though more skilfully constructed, is
                    perhaps less satisfactory. Ι here is a .hardness about the younger Horace which
                    might have been, but is not made, imposing, and Sabine's effect on the action is
                    quite out of proportion to the space she occupies. The splendid declamation of
                    Camille, and the excellent part of the elder Horace, do not altogether atone for
                    these defects. <hi rend="italic">Cinna</hi> is perhaps generally considered the
                    poet’s masterpiece, and it undoubtedly contains the finest single scene in all
                    French tragedy, a scene which may take rank with any other perhaps ever written.
                    The blot on it is certainly the character of Emilie, who is spiteful and
                    thankless, not heroic. <hi rend="italic">Polyeucte</hi> has sometimes been
                    elevated to the same position. There is, however, a certain coolness about the
                    hero’s affection for his wife which somewhat detracts from the merit of his
                    sacrifice; while the Christian part of the matter is scarcely so well treated as
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Saint Genest</hi> of Rotrou or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Virgin Martyr</hi> of Massinger. On the other hand, the entire parts of Pauline
                    and Sévère are beyond praise, and the manner in which the former reconciles her
                    duty as a wife with her affection for her lover is an astonishing success. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Pompée</hi> (for <hi rend="italic">La Mort de Pompée,</hi>
                    though the more appropriate, was not the original title) the splendid
                    declamation of Cornélie is the chief thing to be remarked. <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Menteur,</hi> which in its English form is well known to play-goers on this side
                    the Channel, fully deserves the honour which Molière paid to it. Its
                    continuation, notwithstanding the judgment of some French critics, we cannot
                    think so happy. But <hi rend="italic">Théodore</hi> is perhaps the most
                    surprising of literary anomalies. The central situation, which so greatly
                    shocked Voltaire and indeed all French critics from the date of the piece, does
                    not seem to blame. A virgin martyr who is threatened with loss of honour as a
                    bitterer punishment than loss of life offers points as powerful as they are
                    perilous. But the treatment is thoroughly bad. From the heroine, who is in a
                    phrase of Dryden’s “one of the coolest and most insignificant” heroines ever
                    drawn, to the undignified Valens, the termagant Marcelle, and the peevish
                    Placide, there is hardly a good character. Immediately upon this in most printed
                    editions, though older in representation, follows the play which (therein
                    agreeing rather with the author than with his critics) we should rank as his
                    greatest triumph, <hi rend="italic">Rodogune.</hi> Here there is hardly a weak
                    point. The magnificent and terrible character of Cleopatre, and the contrasted
                    dispositions of the two princes, of course attract most attention. But the
                    character of Rodogune herself, which has not escaped criticism, comes hardly
                    short of these. <hi rend="italic">Hcraclius,</hi> despite great art and much
                    fine poetry, is injured by the extreme complication of its argument and by the
                    blustering part of Pulchérie. <hi rend="italic">Andromède,</hi> with the later
                    spectacle piece, the <hi rend="italic">Toison</hi><hi rend="italic">dOr,</hi> do
                    not call for comment, and we have already alluded to the chief merit of <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Sanche,</hi> a play which, however, deserves both admiration
                    and study. <hi rend="italic">Nicomède,</hi> often considered one of Corneille’s
                    best plays, is chiefly remarkable for the curious and unusual character of its
                    hero. Of <hi rend="italic">Pcrtharite</hi> it need only be said that no single
                    critic has to our knowledge disputed the justice of its damnation. <hi
                    rend="italic">Oedipe</hi> is certainly unworthy of its subject and its author,
                    but in <hi rend="italic">Sertorius</hi> we have one of Corneille’s finest plays.
                    It is remarkable not only from its many splendid verses and for the nobility of
                    its sentiment, but from the fact that not one of its characters lacks interest,
                    a commendation not generally to be bestowed on its author’s work. Of the last
                    six plays we may say that perhaps only one of <hi rend="italic">Wem,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Agésilas,</hi> is almost wholly worthless. Its irregular verses
                    make one very glad that they found few imitators. In the others, though the
                    spectator would not be likely to appreciate them, yet the reader will find not
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> little verse of the brand which only Corneille could
                    impose. Not a few speeches of <hi rend="italic">Suréna</hi> and of <hi
                    rend="italic">Othon</hi> are of a very high order. As to the poet’s non-dramatic
                    works, we have already spoken of his extremely interesting critical
                    dissertations. His minor poems and poetical devotions are not likely to be read
                    save from motives of duty or curiosity. The verse translation of à Kern pis,
                    indeed, which was in its day ini mensely popular (it passed through many
                    editions), condemns itself. Yet these, as well as Ins greater works, deserve
                    honour as the instruments by which Corneille wrought, prehaps, a mightier change
                    in his mother tongue than any one man ever effected. Of him much rather than of
                    Dryden might it be said, <hi rend="italic">Lateritiam invenit, reliquit
                    marmoream.</hi> And in so saying it need not be forgotten that for some purposes
                    brick is better than marble.</p>
                <p>The subject of the bibliography of Corneille has been recently treated in the
                    most exhaustive manner by Μ. E. Picot in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliographie
                    Cornélienne</hi> (Paris, 1875). Less elaborate but still ample information may
                    be found in Taschereau’s <hi rend="italic">Vie</hi> and ir. Μ. Marty Laveaux <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s edition of the <hi rend="italic">Works.</hi> A
                    short but useful list is given in Louandre’s edition, vol. i. p. 47. The chief
                    collected editions in the poet’s lifetime were those of 1644, 1648, 1652, 166C
                    (with important corrections), 1664, and 1682. In 1692 T. Corneille published a
                    complete <hi rend="italic">Théâtre</hi> in 5 vols. 12mo. Numerous editions
                    appeared in the early part of the 18th century, that of 1740 (6 vols. 12mo,
                    Amsterdam) containing the <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres diverses</hi> as well as the
                    plays. Eight editions are recorded between this and that of Voltaire (12 vols.
                    8vo; Geneva, 1764, 1776, 8 vols. 4to), whose <hi rend="italic">Commentaires</hi>
                    have often been reprinted separately. In the year IX. (1801) appeared an edition
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> with Voltaire’s commentary and criticisms
                    thereon by Palissot (12 vols. 8vo, Paris). Since this the editions have been
                    extremely numerous. Those chiefly to be remarked are the following. Lefevre’s
                    (12 vols. 8°, Paris, 1854), well printed and with a useful variorum commentary,
                    lacks bibliographical information and is disfigured by hideous engravings.
                    Louandre’s (2 vols. 18mo. Paris, 1853), though entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oeuvres</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n450/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0450-0421"/><hi rend="italic">deux Corneilles,</hi> contains
                    only twelve pieces with some miscellaneous works of Pierre. It is, however, very
                    well edited, and good as far as it goes. Of Taschereau’s, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliothèque</hi><hi rend="italic">Elzêviriennc,</hi> only two
                    volumes were published. Lahure’s appeared in 5 vols. (1857-62) and 7 vols.
                    (1864-66). The edition of Ch. Marty Laveaux in Regnier’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grands</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecrivains</hi><hi rend="italic">de la France</hi>
                    (1862-1868), in 12 vols. 8vo, is likely for some time to remain the standard. In
                    appearance and careful editing it leaves nothing to desire, containing the
                    entire works, a lexicon, full bibliographical information, and an album of
                    illustrations of the poet’s places of residence, his arms, some title pages of
                    his plays, facsimiles of his writings, &amp;c. Nothing is wanting but variorum
                    comments, which Lefèvre's edition supplies. A handy edition of the plays
                    appeared in 1873 (3 vols. 8vo Paris). Fontenelle's <hi rend="italic">Life of His
                    Uncle</hi> is the chief original authority on that subject, but Taschereau’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Vie</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    des Ouvrages</hi><hi rend="italic">de P. Corneille</hi> (1st ed. 1829, 2d in the
                    Bibl. Elzévirienne, 1855) is the standard work. Its information has been
                    corrected and augmented in various later publications, but not materially. Of
                    the exceedingly numerous writings relative to Corneille we can only mention the
                    <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi><hi rend="italic">de dissertations</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sur plusieurs</hi><hi rend="italic">tragedies de Corneille</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">de Racine</hi> of the Abbé Granet (Paris,
                    1740), the criticisms already alluded to of Voltaire, La Harpe, and Palissot,
                    the well-known work of Guizot, <hi rend="italic">Corneille</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">son temps,</hi> and the essay of Sainte-Beuve. The
                    best-known English criticism, that of Hallam, is inadequate. The translations of
                    separate plays are very numerous, but of the complete <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theatre</hi> only one version (into Italian) is recorded by the French editors.
                    Fontenelle tells us that his uncle had translations of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cid</hi> in every European tongue but Turkish and Slavonic, and Μ. Picot’s book
                    apprises us that the latter want at any rate is now supplied. Corneille has
                    suffered less than some other writers from the attribution of spurious works.
                    Besides a tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Sylla,</hi> the chief piece thus assigned
                    is <hi rend="italic">L'</hi><hi rend="italic">occasion perdue</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">recouverte,</hi> a rather loose tale in verse. Internal evidence
                    by no means fathers it on Corneille, and all external testimony (except a
                    foolish story that the poet composed his devotional works as a penance for its
                    production) ascribes it to a contemporary poet Cantenac. It has never been
                    included in Corneille’s works. It is curious that a translation of Statius
                    (Thebaid, bk. iii.), an author of whom Corneille was extremely fond, though
                    known to have been written, printed, and published, has entirely dropped, out of
                    sight. Three verses quoted by Ménage are all we possess. (G. SA.)</p>
