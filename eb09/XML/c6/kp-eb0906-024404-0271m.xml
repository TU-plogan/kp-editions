                    duke of Vendome (see next article). His son, Henry, prince of Condé (1552-1588),
                    also belonged to the Huguenot party. Fleeing to Germany, he raised a small army,
                    with which in 1575 he joined Alençon. He became leader of the Huguenots, but
                    after several years’ fighting was taken prisoner of war. Not long after he died
                    of poison, administered, according to the belief of his contemporaries, by his
                    wife, Catherine de la Trémouille. This event, among others, awoke strong
                    suspicions as to the legitimacy of his heir and namesake, Henry,prince of
                    Condé(1588-1646). King Henry IV.,however, did not take advantage of the scandal.
                    In 1609 he caused the prince of Condé to marry Charlotte de Montmorency, whom
                    shortly after Condé was obliged to save from the king’s persistent gallantry by
                    a hasty flight, first to Spain and then to Italy. On the death of Henry, Condé
                    returned to France, and intrigued against the regent, Mary de Medici; but he was
                    seized, and imprisoned for three years.</p>

                <p>There was at that time before the court a plea for his divorce from his wife, but
                    she now devoted herself to enliven his captivity at the cost of her own liberty.
                    During the rest of his life Condé was a faithful servant of the king. He strove
                    to blot out the memory of the Huguenot connections of his house by affecting the
                    greatest zeal against Protestants. His old ambition changed into a desire for
                    the safe aggrandizement of his family, which he magnificently achieved, and with
                    that end he bowed before Richelieu, whose niece he forced his son to marry. His
                    son Louis, the great Condé, is separately noticed below. The next in succession
                    was Henry Jules, prince of Condé (1643-1709), the son of the great Condé and of
                    Clémence de Maillé, niece of Richelieu. He fought with distinction under his
                    father in Franche-Comté and the Low Countries; but he was heartless, avaricious,
                    and undoubtedly insane. The end of his life was marked by singular
                    hypochondriacal fancies. He believed at one time that he was dead, and refused
                    to eat till some of his attendants dressed in sheets set him the example. His
                    grandson, Louis Henry, duke of Bourbon (1692-1740), who did not assume the title
                    of prince of Condé which belonged to him, was member of the council of regency
                    which ruled during the minority of Louis XV., and first minister from the death
                    of the duke of Orleans in 1723 to 1726, when he was superseded by Cardinal de
                    Fleury. He greatly enriched his family and his mistress, De Prie, by taking
                    every advantage of his position; but he made himself unpopular by the weight of
                    taxes which he imposed. The son of the duke of Bourbon, Louis Joseph, prince of
                    Condé (1736-1818), after receiving a good education, distinguished himself in
                    the Seven Years’ War, and most of all by his victory at Johannisberg. As
                    governor of Burgundy he did much to improve the industries and means of
                    communication of that province. At the Revolution he took up arms in behalf of
                    the king, became commander of the “army of Condé,” and fought in conjunction
                    with the Austrians till the peace of Campo Formio in 1797, being during the last
                    year in the pay of England. He then served the emperor of Russia in Poland, and
                    after that (1800) returned into the pay of England, and fought in Bavaria. In
                    1800 Condé arrived in England, where he resided for several years. On the
                    restoration of Louis XVIII. he returned to France. He died at Paris in 1818. He
