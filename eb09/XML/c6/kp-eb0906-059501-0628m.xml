                    He belonged to a respectable family of English origin that had been settled in
                    Ireland for several generations, being the only son of John Croker, well known
                    and popular as the surveyor-general of Ireland. He was educated at Trinity
                    College, Dublin, where he graduated in 1800. Immediately afterwards he was
                    entered as a student of Lincoln’s Inn, and in 1802 he was called to the Irish
                    bar. In 1803 he published anonymously <hi rend="italic">Familiar Epistles to J.
                    F. Jones, Esquire, on the State of the Irish Stage,</hi> á series of witty and
                    caustic criticisms in verse on the leading dramatists of the day, which passed
                    through several editions in a short time. Equally successful was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Intercepted Letter from China</hi> (1805), also anonymous, a
                    satire on Dublin society. In 1807 he published a pamphlet on <hi rend="italic"
                    >The State of Ireland, Past and Present,</hi> in which he advocated Catholic
                    emancipation. In the following year he entered Parliament as member for
                    Downpatrick, obtaining the seat on petition, though he had been unsuccessful at
                    the poll. The notorious case of the duke of York furnished him with an
                    opportunity of obtaining patronage and place of which he skilfully availed
                    himself. The speech which he delivered on the 14th March 1809, in answer to the
                    charges of Colonel Wardle, was generally regarded as the most able and ingenious
                    defence of the duke that was made in the debate; and to the gratitude of the
                    latter for this service was probably due Croker’s appointment in the close of
                    the year to the office of secretary to the Admiralty, which he held without
                    interruption under various administrations for more than twenty years. In 1827
                    he became the representative of the university of Dublin, having previously sat
                    successively for the boroughs of Athlone, Yarmouth, and Bodmin. He was a
                    determined opponent of the Reform Bill, and vowed that he would never sit in a
                    reformed Parliament; his parliamentary career accordingly terminated in 1832.
                    Two years earlier he had retired from his post at the Admiralty on a pension of
                    £1500 a year. Many of his political speeches were published in a pamphlet form,
                    and they show him to have been a vigorous and effective, though somewhat
                    unscrupulous and often virulently personal, party debater. The same character
                    attaches to him in his capacity as a political writer. He was one of the
                    founders of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> and for many years was
                    one of its leading contributors on political and historical subjects. The
                    rancorous spirit in which many of his articles were written did much to embitter
                    party feeling, and to cause men on both sides of greater eminence than himself
                    to stoop to unworthy controversy. It also reacted unfavourably on Croker’s
                    reputation as a worker in the department of pure literature by bringing
                    political animosities into literary criticism. No reply is possible to the
                    majority of the criticisms which Macaulay in his unsparing review brings against
                    Croker’s <hi rend="italic">magnum opus,</hi> his edition of Boswell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi> (1831), but with all these defects the work
                    had merits which Macaulay was of course not concerned to point out. It certainly
                    possessed whatever evidence of excellence is afforded by the fact of a very
                    extensive circulation. Its success in this respect led the publisher to propose
                    to Croker the preparation of an annotated edition of Pope’s works, on which he
                    was occupied for several years. - It was left unfinished at the time of his
                    death, but it has since been completed by Peter Cunningham and the Rev. W. El
                    win, and published. A list of Croker’s other chief works is given below. Special
                    mention, however, may be made of his <hi rend="italic">Stories from the History
                    of England for Children,</hi> not only because it had a very large circulation,
                    but because it was taken by Scott as the model for his <hi rend="italic">Tales
                    of a Grandfather.</hi> In an amusing letter to Croker accompanying a
                    presentation copy of the latter work, Sir Walter speaks of it as “a sample of
                    the <hi rend="italic">swag."</hi></p>
                <p>Croker did good service to the cause of literature and art by other means besides
                    his pen. He was one of the founders of the Athenaeum Club. In his place in
                    Parliament he advocated the claims of the fine arts upon state recognition and
                    aid at a time when these claims had fewer supporters than they have now. In his
                    later years his house at West Molesey near Hampton Court was the resort of many
                    eminent literary men, chiefly of his own party. He died at St Albans Bank,
                    Hampton, on the 10th August 1857.</p>
                <p>The chief works of Croker not already mentioned were his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letters on the Naval War with America; A Reply to the Letters of
                    Malachi</hi><hi rend="italic">Malagrowthaer</hi><hi rend="italic">; Military
                    Events of the French Revolution of</hi> 1830; a translation of Bassompierre’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Embassy to England;</hi> and several lyrical pieces of some
                    merit, such as the <hi rend="italic">Songs of Trafalgar.</hi> He also edited the
                    <hi rend="italic">Suffolk Papers, Hervey’s Memoirs of the Court of George I
                    I.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Letters of Lady Hervey,</hi> and <hi
