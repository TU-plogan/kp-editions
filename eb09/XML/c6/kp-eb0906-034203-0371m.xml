                    conchoidal fracture, and, when dissolved in alcohol, spirit of turpentine, or
                    any other suitable menstruum, forming one of the most valuable varnishes. Like
                    many other commercial substances, copal is obtained from a variety of sources;
                    the term is not uniformly applied or restricted to the products of any
                    particular legion or series of plants, but is vaguely used for resins which,
                    though very similar in their physical properties, differ somewhat in their
                    constitution, and are altogether distinct as to their source. Thus the resin
                    obtained from <hi rend="italic">Trachylobium Hornemannianum</hi> is known in
                    commerce as Zanzibar copal, or gum animé. Madagascar copal is the produce of <hi
                    rend="italic">T.</hi><hi rend="italic">verrucosum.</hi> From <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guibourtia copallifera</hi> is obtained Sierra Leone copal, and another variety
                    of the same resin is found in a fossil state on the west coast of Africa,
                    probably the produce of a tree now extinct. From Brazil and other South American
                    countries, again, copal is obtained which is yielded by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trachylobium</hi><hi rend="italic">Martianum, Hymenaea Courbaril,</hi> and
                    various other species, while the dammar resins and the piney varnish of India
                    are occasionally classed and spoken of as copal. Of the varieties abovo
                    enumerated by far the most important in a commercial point of view is the
                    Zanzibar or East African copal, yielded by <hi rend="italic">Trachylobium
                    Hornemannianum.</hi> The resin is found in two distinct conditions :—1st, raw or
                    recent, called by the inhabitants of the coast sandarusiza miti or chakazi, the
                    latter name being corrupted by Zanzibar traders into “jackass” copal; and 2d,
                    ripe or true copal, the sandarusi inti of the natives. The raw copal, which is
                    obtained direct from the trees, or found at their roots or near the surface of
                    the ground, is not regarded by the natives as of much value, and does not enter
                    into European commerce. It is sent to India and China, where it is manufactured
                    into a coarse kind of varnish. The true or fossil copal is found embedded in the
                    earth over a wide belt of the mainland coast of Zanzibar, on tracks where not a
                    single tree is now visible. The copal is not found at a greater depth in the
                    ground than 4 feet, and it is seldom the diggers go deeper than about 3 feet. It
                    occurs in pieces varying from the size of small pebbles up to masses of several
                    ounces in weight, and occasionally lumps weighing 4 or 5 K) have been obtained;
                    and it is said that one piece of 35 lb weight has been found. After garbling and
                    freeing from foreign matter, the resin is submitted to various chemical
                    operations for the purpose of clearing the “goose-skin,” the name given to the
                    peculiar pitted-like surface possessed by fossil copal. The goose-skin was
                    formerly supposed to be caused by the impression of the small stones and sand of
                    the soil into which the soft resin fell in its raw condition; but Dr Kirk states
                    that the copal when first dug up has no trace of the goose-skin on it. He
                    believes the appearance to arise from an oxidation of the surface taking place
                    to a certain depth after exposure to the air, or to be caused by some molecular
                    change which renders the skin more brittle than the inner mass. The copal
                    digging is conducted by the natives in a careless and desultory manner, and the
                    whole trade is, as usual in dealings with untutored tribes, surrounded with many
                    difficulties. It is believed that the supply is practically inexhaustible, and
                    with proper organization the trade would be a permanent source of support to a
                    larger community than at present inhabits the copal-yielding regions. A large
                    proportion of the resin is sent to the European market by way of Bombay; but
                    considerable<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0372-0343"/> quantities are also shipped direct to Hamburg and
                    to British ports. The amount annually exported is subject to great fluctuations,
                    which equally affect the market value of the product. During the year 1872-73
                    the imports into Bombay were 966 cwts., and probably at least an equal quantity
                    went in other directions. The following analysis of Zanzibar and Madagascar
                    copal is given by Filhol :—</p>
