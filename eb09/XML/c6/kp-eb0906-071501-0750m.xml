                    the grape-vine, <hi rend="italic">Vitis vinifera,</hi> cultivated principally in
                    Zante, Cephalonia, and Ithaca, and near Patras, in the Morea. Currants were
                    brought originally from Corinth, whence their name; in the 13th and 14th
                    centuries they were known as <hi rend="italic">raisins de Corauntz.</hi> In the
                    Ionian Islands the currant-vine is grown on the sides of the lower hills, or in
                    the valleys, the grape-vine occupying the higher and less open and rich ground.
                    Gypseous marls, or calcareous marls containing a little gypsum, are preferred to
                    limestone soils, as they allow of the deep penetration of the roots of the
                    vines. The most favourable situations are those where a good supply of water can
                    be obtained for the irrigation of the plantations. This is carried on from the
                    end of October to the close of the year, after which all that is necessary is to
                    keep the ground moist. The vines are planted in rows 3 or 4 feet apart.
                    Propagation is effected by grafting on stocks of the grape-vine, or by planting
                    out in spring the young vigorous shoots obtained at the end of the previous year
                    from old currant-vines that have been cut away below the ground. The grafts bear
                    fruit in three years, the slips in about double that time. The vine-stock for
                    grafting is cut down to the depth of a foot below the surface of the soil; two
                    or three perpendicular incisions are made near the bark with a chisel; and into
                    these are inserted shoots of the last year’s growth. The engrafted part then
                    receives an application of moist marl, is wrapped in leaves and bound with
                    rushes, and is covered with earth, two or three eyes of the shoots being left
                    projecting above ground. In December the currant plantations are cleared of dead
                    and weak wood. In February the branches are cut back, and pruned of median
                    shoots, which are said to prevent tho lateral ones proceeding from the same bud
                    from bearing fruit. In order effectually to water the trees, the earth round
                    about them is in February and March hoed up so as to leave them in a kind of
                    basin, or is piled up against their stems. In May, when the leaves begin to
                    show, the ground is thoroughly turned, and if requisite manured, and is then
                    re-levelled. By the middle of April the leaves are fully out, and in June it is
                    necessary to break back the newly-formed shoots. The fruit begins to ripen in
                    July, and in the next month the vintage takes place. At this season rain is
                    greatly dreaded, as it always damages and may even destroy the ripe fruit. The
                    plantations, Which are commonly much exposed, are watched by dogs aħd armed men.
                    In Cephalonia the currant-grape is said to ripen at least a week earlier than in
                    Zante. To destroy the oïdium, a pest that severely injures the plantations, the
                    vines are dusted, at the time the fruit is maturing, with finely-ground brr
                    ιstone. The currants when sufficiently ripe are gathered and placed on a drying
                    ground, where they are exposed to the sun in layers half an inch thick; from
                    time to time they are turned and swept into heaps, until they become entirely
                    detached from stalk. They are then packed in large butts for exportation. The
                    wine made from the currant-grape is inferior in quality, but is said to be
                    capable of much improvement. The fresh fruit is luscious and highly flavoured,
                    but soon cloys the palate. In 1834 the duty on currants was made 22s. 2d. per
                    cwt., or one-half what it had previously been; in 1844 it was reduced to 15s.,
                    and in 1860 to 7s. per cwt. In 1874 the imports of currants into the United
                    Kingdom were :—</p>
