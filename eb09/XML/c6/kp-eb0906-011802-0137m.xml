                    spongy or pumice-like texture, and ignites with comparative ease, though less
                    readily than bituminous coal, so that it may be burnt in open fire-places; but
                    when a long-continued heat is used, as in the preparation of coke for iron and
                    steel melting, the product is hard and dense, is often prismatic in structure,
                    has a brilliant semi-metallic lustre and silvery-grey colour, is a good
                    conductor of heat and electricity, and can only be burnt in furnaces provided
                    with a strong chimney draught or an artificial blast. The strength and cohesive
                    properties are also intimately related to the nature and composition of the
                    coals employed, which are said to be caking or non-caking according to the
                    compact or fragmentary character of the coke produced.</p>
                <p>The simplest method of coking, that in open heaps or piles, is conducted in a
                    very similar manner to charcoal burning. The coal is piled in a domed heap about
                    30 feet in diameter and 5 feet high, with a chimney of bricks arranged in open
                    chequer work in the centre, around which the largest lumps of coal are placed so
                    as to allow a free draught through the mass. The outside of the heap is covered
                    with a coating of wet coke dust, except a ring about a foot high at the bottom.
                    Fire is communicated by putting a few live coals near the top of the chimney, or
                    from the interior by throwing them down the chimney, and the combustion proceeds
                    downwards and outwards by the draught through the uncovered portion at the
                    bottom. Whenever the fire takes too strong a hold and burns out to the surface
                    it is damped by plastering over the spot with wet coke dust and earth, this
                    being a point requiring considerable skill on the part of the coke burner. When
                    flame and smoke are no longer given off, which usually happens in from five to
                    six days, the whole surface is smothered with coke dust, and the chimney is
                    stopped for three or four days longer, when the heap is sufficiently cooled to
                    allow of the coke being broken up and removed, or, as it is called, drawn. The
                    cooling is usually expedited by throwing water upon the heap before drawing. The
                    principle of coking in rectangular piles is generally similar to the foregoing,
                    but chimneys are not used. The dimensions generally adopted are a height of from
                    3J to 5 feet, and a breadth of 12 feet at the base.</p>
                <p>In coking by clamps or kilns a rectangular pile of coal is enclosed between
                    upright walls, having a system of vertical and horizontal passages traversing
                    them at intervals, which serve as chimneys to conduct the combustion through the
                    pile. This system has been used at different times in South Wales, Germany, and
                    other places, but is now generally abandoned, as the draught holes have a
                    tendency to consume the coal unnecessarily unless very carefully watched.</p>
                <p>The largest proportion of the coke used for industrial purposes is made in close
                    kilns or ovens. These vary very considerably in form and details of
                    construction, but the same general principles are observed in all, the object
                    being to effect the coking as much as possible by the consumption of the
                    volatile inflammable gases given off above the surface of the coal, and to
                    protect the latter from the direct access of currents of air. A further object
                    is the utilization of the heat given off by the waste gases, which may be
                    employed to heat the oven by circulating them in flues round the outside, and
                    further by employing them for the accessory objects of raising steam, heating
                    air, &amp;c., in collieries and iron-works.</p>
                <p>In its oldest and simplest form, the coke oven consists of a round chamber from 7
                    to 10 feet in diameter, with a low cylindrical wall, and a domed roof rising
                    about 20 inches in height above the floor. A hole about 1 foot in diameter in
                    the crown of the roof serves for charging, and the finished coke is drawn
                    through a door in the wall, about 2⅜ feet square. When cleared for a fresh
                    charge, the oven being red-hot, small coal is introduced through the hole in the
                    roof, and spread uniformly over the floor, until it is filled up to the level of
                    the springing of the roof, when the doorway is filled up with loose bricks which
                    give a sufficient passage between them for the admission of air to ignite the
                    gases given off by the distillation of the heated coal. After a few hours these
                    air-ways must be closed by plastering up the brickwork, except the top layer,
                    which is left open for twenty-four hours. The heat developed by the burning
                    gases causes the coking to proceed downwards until the entire charge is
                    converted, this taking from three to four days, according to the quantity of
                    coal. When the escape of flame from the hole in the roof ceases, all apertures
                    are stopped whereby air can enter to the incandescent mass, which being no
                    longer protected by an atmosphere of combustible gases, would bum to waste if
                    brought in contact with the atmosphere. At this point, therefore, all holes in
                    the oven and chimney are completely closed for about twelve hours, when the door
                    is opened, and the coke, which forms a coherent mass, somewhat less in size than
                    the original charge, and divided by a system of columnar joints, is removed by
                    an iron drag, or cross-bar, inserted at the far end of the floor, and moved by a
                    chain and windlass, a stream of water from a hose being used to quench the
                    glowing coke as it is brought out. This class of oven, which is now not much
                    used, was adopted by most of the railway companies, tvhen coke was burnt
                    exclusively in locomotives, and is also common in the Durham ooal-field. They
                    are generally known as beehive ovens, also as bakers’ ovens. Usually from six to
                    ten, or twelve, or more ovens are placed side l&gt;y side in one block of
                    brickwork, which is supplied with a tall chimney, the individual ovens being
                    connected by pillars, with well-regulated dampers. A railway is generally laid
                    along the top of the range of ovens, so that the charging can be effected
                    directly from the colliery trucks. The yield of coke by this method may be from
                    55 to 65 per cent., according to the nature of the coal. With charges varying<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n138/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0138-0119"/> from 3 to 10 tons, the operation, including the
                    period of cooling, lasts from four to seven days. The coke obtained is of the
                    highest quality, being dense and well burned. In some cases the cooling of the
                    coke is effected by watering it before drawing. There is a certain amount of
                    sulphur removed by this method, as the steam generated being brought into
                    contact with the sulphide of iron in the heated mass, formed from pyrites in the
                    coal, produces sulphuretted hydrogen and magnetic oxide of iron. The amount of
                    desulphurization by this method is, however, practically insignificant, as the
                    operation does not last a sufficient time to allow the mass of the fuel to be
                    affected. The proportion of sulphur in finished coke, as compared with that of
                    the original coal, may be roughly stated at about one-half. It has been sought
                    to reduce the amount by decomposing the residual ferrous sulphide in various
                    ways, as by the addition of salt, carbonate of soda, lime, &amp;c., to the coal
                    before coking but none of these methods is found to be practically useful.</p>
                <p>In the South Wales coal-field the ordinary form of coke oven is nearly
                    rectangular, being about 14 feet long, 5 feet wide at the back, and 6 feet at
                    the front or drawing ends; the height to the crown of the cylindrical roof is 5
                    feet 6 inches, with usually two charging holes. Two charges are worked weekly,
                    the first, of 4⅜ tons, is finished in three days, while the second, of 5 tons,
                    is allowed four days, so as to remain in the oven over Sunday. The yield in both
                    cases is about the same.</p>
                <p>The addition of heating flues exterior to the wall of the oven allows the time of
                    coking to be very much shortened, Of the numerous contrivances proposed for this
                    purpose, that of a Belgian engineer, Mr Coppée. has latterly come into favour in
                    many places, as very well adapted for use with comparatively dry coal. The
                    coking chamber is a long narrow retort of fire brick, measuring about 30 feet in
                    length, 17 inches in width at the front, and about 2 inches more at the back,
                    where the charge is pushed out, with vertical walls about 3 4 feet high, covered
                    by a low arched roof. One of these walls is solid, but the other contains
                    twenty-eight vertical descending flues (∕) which communicate with the interior
                    at the springing of the roof, and below with the large flue of the same width as
                    the oven, and running along its entire length. As usually built, a series or
                    battery includes about thirty ovens, which are arranged in pairs as in the
                    figure, from which it will be seen that the left hand oven (A) is heated by the
                    joint current of gases on both sides, while B is heated on one side by its own
                    gas, and on the other by that of the next oven to the right The current then
                    passes along the bottom flue of A, and back through that of B, whence it escapes
                    by a flue to the chimney, or may be led to a steam boiler if the waste heat is
                    used, as is generally the case, for raising steam The working of the adjacent
                    pair of ovens is so. arranged that they are drawn alternately at exactly
                    intermediate periods; thus supposing the time of coking to be fortyeight hours,
                    A is drawn twenty-four hours after the charging of B, while the latter is in
                    full activity, and keeps up the heat of the empty oven during charging, while
                    necessarily the burning hydrocarbon gases given off during the first heating of
                    the coal tend to keep up the heat in the adjoining oven. At Ebbw Vale, in
                    Monmouthshire, where the coking requires only twenty-four hours, the ovens are
                    numbered consecutively, the odd numbers being drawn and re-charged in the
                    morning, and the even ones twelve hours later. The combustion of the gases is
                    effected by air which is brought in through special channels (c) in the
                    brickwork communicating with the gas flues at the top, and becomes heated in the
                    passage. The object sought to be obtained is the combustion of the gases as much
                    as possible in the flues, and not in the oven itself. The oven is closed at both
                    ends by cast-iron doors in two parts, which can be opened together or separately
                    during the drawing and recharging. The charging is effected through three holes
                    (D D) in the roof, the coal, in the form of slack, being contained in
                    hopper-shaped trams, running upon rails, which are run over the holes and
                    emptied by drawing a slide. The charge is about 3 tons, and the yield from 36 to
                    44 cwt., according to the nature of the coal operated upon. The finished coke
                    forms a prismatic mass, 30 feet long, 3 feet high, and 16 inches broad; it is
                    pushed out by a ram, shaped like the cross section of the oven, which is moved
                    by steam power acting upon a long racked rod. This apparatus, together with the
                    engine and boiler for moving it, is mounted on a carriage moving on a railway in
                    front of the range of ovens, so that it can be brought up to any one of them as
                    required. The mass of coke is pushed out on to a floor running along the back,
                    where it is immediately broken, and quenched by heavily watering the fragments.
                    The whole operation, including the drawing and recharging of the empty oven, is
                    effected in about eight minutes. The yield of coke very closely approximates to
                    that obtained by experiments in crucibles. A similar kind of oven with outside
                    heating flues, that of the Brothers Appolt, has been in use for several years on
                    the Continent, more particularly in France. It differs from Coppée’s in the
                    position of the coking chambers, which are vertical instead of horizontal, the
                    coal being charged from the top, and the finished coke dropped into a truck
                    placed below. Various schemes have been proposed at different times for the
                    purpose of utilizing the condensible products, such as tar, ammoniacal water,
                    &amp;c., given off during the earlier stages of the process of coking, but they
                    are not generally found to be applicable to the manufacture of meìallur-gieal
                    coke, being only suited for gas-works, where the quality of the coke is only a
                    secondary consideration.</p>
                <p>The slack of dry or non-caking coal, or anthracite, which cannot be coked alone,
                    may* be converted into a useful coke by mixing it with a proportion of
                    bituminous coal, or gas-pitch, or a mixture of both. At Swansea, a mixture of 60
                    to 70 per cent, of anthracite with from 30 to 35 per cent, of bituminous coal,
                    and 5 or 6 of gas pitch, made by grinding the ingredients in one of Carr’s
                    disintegrator mills, is coked in the ordinary South Wales ovens, a thin layer of
                    bituminous coal being placed above the charge before it is lighted, to prevent
                    the pitch from burning to waste. The yield of coke is about 80 per cent, of the
                    weight of the charge. It is exceedingly hard, and about 23 per cent, heavier
                    than that made from bituminous coal, with a correspondingly higher calorific
                    value.</p>
                <p>Coke is used for all purposes where a smokeless fire is required, as, for
                    instance, in drying malt or hops, or in raising steam in locomotives within the
                    limits of towns, also for producing strong local heat, as in melting metals
                    (gold, silver, brass, or steel) in crucibles in air furnaces. In blast furnaces
                    its value depends upon the difficulty of combustion, so that the particles keep
                    their form until they reach the proper place of combustion at the point of entry
                    of the blast in the lower part of the furnace. The great economy of fuel that
                    has been effected in the process of iron smelting in the Cleveland district by
                    increasing the height of the furnaces, is in great part due to the strength of
                    the coke used, which is made in the south part of the Durham coal-field, and has
                    sufficient cohesive power to bear the pressure of a column of iron-making
                    materials from 80 to 100 feet in height without crushing, a result which cannot
                    be obtained with the coke of otħer districts. Finely ground coke is used mixed
                    with clay for making crucibles for steel melting, and also for filling the
                    hearths of blast-furnaces in many German smelting works.</p>
                <p>Apart from its convenience for special purposes, coke is not an economical fuel,
                    the useful heating effect being about the same as that of an equal weight of
                    coal. This circumstance has led to the nearly general abandonment of coke and
                    the substitution of raw coal as fuel in locomotive engines on railways.</p>
