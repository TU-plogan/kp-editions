                    who could either ratify or reject, but without discussion, the proposals made to
                    them. Such, at least in theory, and, during the best days of the republic, in
                    practice also, was the function of these popular assemblies.</p>
                <p>As may be readily understood, different elements had the ascendency among the
                    Roman people at different periods in their history. So far as it was possible
                    for a state exposed to so many and such various influences to be conservative of
                    its political traditions, Rome, whether monarchical, republican, or imperial,
                    was essentially so. But under the force of circumstances innovations were
                    introduced from time to time, which materially altered the position of the two
                    political parties—the patricians and the plebeians—into which the state was
                    early divided, and by whose dissensions it was long distracted. And in none of
                    her institutions can the progress of the struggle between these rival factions
                    be more clearly traced, than in the nature and powers of those assemblies or
                    comitia, by which the supreme authority at Rome was in succession wielded.</p>
                <p>It is usual to describe the Roman comitia as of three kinds, named from the mode
                    in which the people were organized and in which they voted—the comitia curiata,
                    or assembly of the curiae; the comitia centuriata, or assembly of the centuries;
                    and the comitia tributa, or assembly of the tribes. To these some add a
                    fourth,—the comitia calata (from <hi rend="italic">calare,</hi> to call); but as
                    this assembly had neither political functions nor a separate organization, it is
                    unnecessary to do more than mention the name.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Comitia Curiata.</hi> The assembly of the curiae is believed
                    to have been coeval with the rise of Rome itself, and its origin is therefore
                    rightly ascribed by tradition to the mythical founder of the city. The system
                    seems to have been an essential part of the constitution of the early Latin
                    communities, of which Rome was originally only one. Its primary object cannot
                    now be satisfactorily determined; but the purpose for which it came to be
                    employed is sufficiently clear. From a very early period, the Roman curiae, or
                    “wardships,” as they may be called, numbered thirty, being ten for each of the
                    three once independent com munities—the Ramnians, Tities, and Luceres—from whose
                    amalgamation the Roman people sprang. At first these curiae were probably made
                    up exclusively of the freeholders, or patricians, as the latter were afterwards
                    designated, on whom devolved exclusively the right and duty of bearing arms. It
                    has been maintained by some that the class of dependents called by Roman writers
                    clients as well as the burgesses or citizens had a right to vote in the assembly
                    of the curiae. No direct evidence, however, can be brought forward in support of
                    this supposition, which in the nature of the case is highly improbable; and, if
                    allowed to be present at all, they were likely nothing more than spectators.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n222/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0222-0195"/>
                <p>or, as their name is said to imply, “listeners.” In an assembly each curia had
                    one vote, which was determined by the majority of the individual votes in the
                    different curiae. As the number of the latter was even, and no provision was
                    made for deciding the matter in the case of their being equally divided on any
                    question, it would seem as if this function had not been thought of in fixing
                    the number of the curiae, or had been subordinated to some other
                    consideration.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Comitia Centuriata.</hi> By the operation of causes
                    sufficiently obvious, a great increase soon took place rn the numbers and
                    influence of the dependent members of the Roman commonwealth. As a natural
                    consequence, the way was paved for a reform of the constitution, though we may
                    well conceive that the step was hastened by the gradual thinning of the ranks of
                    the old freeholders in the incessant wars in which Rome found herself involved
                    with her neighbours. Thus in the course of time a new class, the plebeians of
                    history, arose out of the clients, preponderating in numbers and by no means
                    destitute of wealth. If this class was allowed no rights as citizens, it was
                    exempt from service in the field; and while their political inferiority must
                    have been galling to its members, their immunity from the chances of war can
                    hardly have been looked upon with equanimity by the ruling faction. It was to
                    redress this twofold grievance that the reform ascribed to King Servius Tullius
                    is generally believed to have been effected. But the whole scheme was one
                    skilfully devised, so as to assign to the plebeians duties rather than to bestow
                    upon them rights, and it was evidently the work of a statesman who was in the
                    interest of the patricians. Our chief authorities for the details of the
                    arrangement are Livy and Dionysius, whose accounts, though they differ in some
                    particulars, agree in the main. We must bear in mind, however, that both of them
                    describe the assembly of the centuries rather as it existed in their own day
                    than as it was at first constituted.</p>
                <p>According to the authors just named, the whole body of free Romans, burgesses and
                    non-burgesses, was divided into a certain number of classes (f.e., “summonings,”
                    probably from <hi rend="italic">calarfi),</hi> numbered according to the amount
                    of fortune possessed’ by each citizen. The class of each man was ascertained by
                    means of a register, drawn up every five years by officers appointed for the
                    purpose, in which were set forth in detail the age of the citizen, the amount of
                    his property, and other particulars. The first class comprised all whose fortune
                    was estimated at not less than 100,000 asses or pounds of copper, sub-divided
                    into 40 centuries of “jùniors,” who could be called upon for active service, and
                    40 centuries of “seniors,” who in time of war were to do garrison duty at home.
                    In the second class were enrolled those who had property valued at not less than
                    75,000 asses, with 10 centuries of juniors, 10 of seniors, and 2 of artificers.
                    The third, fourth, and fifth classes included those who possessed not less than
                    50,000, 25,000, and 12,500 (according to Livy, 11,000) asses respectively,
                    sub-divided into centuries in a similar manner. Those who had not a sufficient
                    money qualification are included by Livy in the fifth class, and made to form a
                    single century, but are reckoned by Dionysius as a sixth class. In addition,
                    there were 18 centuries of equites, or cavalry, who always voted first, made up
                    of the most wealthy members of the landholder class, the actual possession of
                    land being apparently regarded as a necessary qualification for this, the
                    favourite branch of the service. Livy gives the whole number of the centuries as
                    194; Dionysius makes them 193. The voting in the assembly was by centuries, each
                    century possessing a collective vote exactly as in the case of the curiae. It
                    was so arranged that the 18 centuries of equites and the 80 centuries of the
                    first class voted first.</p>
                <p>If they were agreed on the question at issue, the other classes were not called
                    upon to vote at all. As the centuries, though nominally “hundreds,” might and
                    probably did contain fewer in the first class, and certainly many times more
                    than that number in some of the other classes, it is plain that in the assembly
                    by far the largest share of power was retained in the hands of the wealthy, of
                    whom the original burgess element would long form the main portion. How far we
                    have in this scheme merely a modification of an earlier arrangement there are no
                    means of determining, As Mommsen remarks, it is more than probable that the
                    assessments were originally laid on land. Be this as it may, the Servian reform
                    was originally a new military rather than a new political organization, its
                    author intending that the privileges of the patricians, assembled in their
                    curiae, should remain as before. But its results were different from what had
                    been anticipated. By a process easily understood, the rights of the curiae
                    gradually passed to the centuries. The assembly of the former continued indeed
                    to meet, but the assembly of the latter became thenceforth the chief guardian of
                    the rights of the Roman people.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Comitia Tributa.</hi> The further growth and development of
                    the democratic element in the Roman constitution, consequent on the change just
                    described, soon Jed to a demand for greater changes in the same direction. The
                    tribunes of the people, now the acknowledged leaders of the democracy, took
                    advantage of an ancient division of the original territory of Rome into tribes,
                    to give greater prominence to this element than it had yet possessed. These
                    tribes, 30 and afterwards 35 in number, which, as is supposed by some, had
                    already supplied a basis for the arrangement into curiae as well as classes,
                    seem to have at first~existed for purely local purposes. But the leaders of the
                    people succeeded at length in forming them into a political union entitled to
                    exercise certain functions, chief among which was the election of the inferior
                    magistrates, and the approval or rejection of such legislative measures as
                    affected the interests of the plebeians as a class. Whether the assembly of the
                    tribes was composed of plebeians only, or of all, whether patrician or plebeian,
                    living within certain limits, has not been ascertained, the balance of opinion
                    inclining to the hypothesis that makes it to have consisted of plebeians alone.
                    After the rise of this new power, it became a matter of great difficulty to
                    determine what questions were to be submitted to the tribes and what to the
                    centuries, each claiming to be the real representatives of the whole body of the
                    people. A solution appears to have been sought for and found in some combination
                    of the two rival assemblies. At what times this change took place, and what was
                    its exact nature, are matters that must ever remain involved in the greatest
                    obscurity. All that can be said is this; either by means of their own assembly,
                    or by their using it somehow for the purpose of counterbalancing the power of
                    the patricians in the assembly of the centuries, the plebeians ultimately gained
                    what they had so long aimed at—a position of supreme importance in the republic.
                    When the wealthier classes found their influence thus neutralized, they ceased
                    to attend the comitia altogether, and the popular will was represented by the
                    lower classes alone. A period of moral and political corruption followed, ending
                    in the military despotism of the Caesars. Under the first emperors, the form of
                    calling the assemblies together was still observed, but the people met no longer
                    to control their chief ruler, but simply to receive information as to what he
                    had done. Even this form was by and by discontinued, and in the last days of the
                    empire the comitia was an institution known only as one of the traditions of the
                    past greatness of Rome. (J. <hi rend="smallcaps">n'd.)</hi><pb break="no"
