                    rend="italic">(Colchicum</hi><hi rend="italic">autumnale),</hi> is a perennial
                    plant of the natural order <hi rend="italic">Melanthaceae</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Colchicaceae,</hi> found wild in rich moist meadow-land in England
                    and Ireland, in Middle and Southern Europe, and in the Swiss Alps. It has
                    palepurple flowers, rarely more than three in number; the perianth is
                    funnel-shaped, and produced inferiorly into a long slender tube, in the upper
                    part of which the six stamens are inserted. The ovary is three-celled, and lies
                    at the bottom of this tube. The leaves are three or four in <pb break="no"

                    and there is no stem. Propagation is by the formation of corms from the parent
                    bulb, and by seeds. The latter are numerous, round, reddish-brown, and of the
                    size of black mustardseeds. The bulb of the meadow-saffron attains its full size
                    in June or early in July. A smaller bulb is then formed from the old one, close
                    to its root; and this in September and October produces the crocus-like flowers.
                    In the succeeding January or February it sends up its leaves, together with the
                    ovary, which perfects its seeds during the summer. The young corm, at first
                    about the diameter of the flower-stalk, grows continuously, till in the
                    following July it attains the size of a small apricot. The parent bulb remains
                    attached to the new one, and keeps its form and size till April in the third
                    year of its existence, after which it decays. In some cases a single corm
                    produces several new plants during its second spring by giving rise to immature
                    corms.</p>
                <p>Colchicum owes its medicinal properties to an alkaloid, named <hi rend="italic"
                    >colchicine,</hi> which is present in all parts of the plant. It was discovered
                    by Pelletier and Caventon, and was identified as distinct from veratrine by
                    Geiger and Hesse in 1833. According to Oberlin, colchicine is a complex body,
                    containing a crystallizable neutral substance, colchiceine. Hübler assigns to
                    colchicine the formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 17</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    19</hi> NO <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, and considers it to be isomeric with
                    colchiceine <hi rend="italic">(Arch,</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pharm.,</hi> tom. cxi. 194; <hi rend="italic">Journ. de
                    Pharm.</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Chim.,</hi> tom. ii. 490, 4th ser). It is an intensely bitter body, soluble in
                    alcohol and water, but insoluble in ether, and is a powerful poison, small
                    quantities causing violent vomiting and purging; tannin, which precipitates it
                    from solution, has been recommended as an antidote for it. Colchicine is present
                    in smaller quantity in the seeds than in the bulbs; and in the latter, according
                    to Stolze, it is more abundant in spring than in autumn; Shroff, however, states
                    that the corms for medicinal use should be collected after or during the time of
                    flowering. The preparations of colchicum employed as medicine are the extract,
                    made by macerating dried shreds of the bulbs in sherry or acetic acid, the
                    expressed juice of the bulbs, purified and concentrated by heating, straining,
                    and evaporation at a temperature below 160° Fahr., and an alcoholic tincture of
                    the seeds. Whether swallowed or injected into the veins colchicum acts as an
                    irritant of the stomach and intestines and a nervine sedative; small doses
                    stimulate the secreting and excreting functions, but when continued they impair
                    the appetite, and much disturb the stomach. Large quantities produce vomiting,
                    profuse perspiration, heat in the abdomen, considerable reduction of the rate of
                    the pulse, and dysenteric symptoms, and may cause death from exhaustion.</p>
                <p>Colchicum was known to the Greeks under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >KoKχεκAv,</hi> from Koλχiv, or Colchis, a country in which the plant grew; and
                    it is described by Dioscorides as a poison. In the 17th century the corms were
                    worn by some of the German peasantry as a charm against the plague. The drug was
                    little used till 1763, when Baron Storck of Vienna introduced it for the
                    treatment of dropsy. In febrile diseases it was first extensively employed by Mr
                    Haden. As a specific for gout colchicum was early employed by the Arabs; and the
                    preparation known as <hi rend="italic">eau médicinale,</hi> much resorted to in
                    the last century for the cure of gout, owes its therapeutic virtues to
                    colchicum; but general attention was first directed by Sir Everard Home to the
                    use of the drug in gout. Full doses are apt to provoke sickness and diarrhoea,
                    but give immediate relief from the sufferings caused by arthritic disease;
                    whereas small quantities are not effectual for several days. According to Dr A.
                    B, Garrod, the beneficial effects of colchicum are not explicable either by its
                    purgative properties, or by its sedative influence on the vascular system; nor
                    is there evidence that it produces any of its effects by causing an increase in
                    the elimination of urea and uric acid by the kidneys. Dr Graves considers that
                    colchicum operates in gout by lessening the formation of uric acid in the
                    system.</p>
                <p>Colchicum may often be employed in acute rheumatism, in the treatment of
                    bronchitis, asthma, eruptions of the skin, and of dyspepsia in gouty patients;
                    also as a cholagogue instead of mercurials. The “hermodactyl” of ancient writers
                    is supposed to be the same as the modern drug of that name, which consists of
                    the corms of a species of colchicum.</p>
