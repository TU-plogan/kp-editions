                    with a width of about twelve, and a population of 35,000. Near its southern
                    extremity it rises into a fine dome-shaped mountain, wdιich has a height of
                    upwards of 8500 feet, and is visible for more than 100 miles. Eruptions are
                    recorded for the years 1830, 1855, and 1858; and traces of the last of these
                    commotions are still very distinct. The island is politically divided into
                    various petty principalities, and maintains its own petty feuds. The natives are
                    tall of stature and well-formed, and appear to be mainly of Arabic descent, with
                    a mixture of Malagasy blood. The chief towns are Maroni, Itzanda, and
                    Mouchamouli; the first, situated at the head of a bay in 11° 40' 44 ’ ' S. lat,,
                    being the seat of the principal sultan in the island. 2. <hi rend="italic"

                    it culminates in a central peak, upwards of 5000 feet above the sea, in 12° 14'
                    17" S. ]at. and 44 <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> 27' 34" E. long. The whole
                    island is under one sultan, who resides at the town of Johanna on the north
                    side. The natives are hospitable to foreigners, and especially to Englishmen.
                    Domestic slavery exists, but of a very mild description. The capital, which is
                    sometimes called Moussamondou, is substantially built of stone, surrounded by a
                    wall, and commanded by a dilapidated citadel; it is the seat of an English
                    consul, and carries on a considerable trade in supplying ships with provisions.
                    There is a small but safe anchorage at Pomony. where coal is kept for H.M. ships
                    in the Mozambique Channel. The population amounts to about 12,000. 3. <hi

                    surrounded by an extensive and dangerous coral-reef. The principal heights on
                    its extremely irregular surface are Mavegani Mountain, which rises in two peaks
                    to a maximum of 2164 feet, and Uchongin, which only falls below it by about 60
                    feet. The island belongs to the French since 1843, and they have established a
                    small military and naval colony on the contiguous islet of Zaudzi, which lies
                    within the reef in 12° 46' 48" S. lat.</p>

                    store-houses; the garrison numbers about 100 soldiers; and a number of sugar
                    estates have been formed, especially on the eastern side of the island. Before
                    the French acquisition Mayotta was subject to Dansulu, king of the Sacalavas,
                    who had been expelled from the north-west coast of Madagascar by the conquests
                    of Radama, king of the Ovahs. Population, 12,000. 4. <hi rend="italic"

                    length, and 7 or 8 miles at its maximum breadth, with a population of 6000.
                    Unlike the other three it has no peaks, but rises gradually to a central ridge
                    about 1900 feet in height. It is governed by an independent sovereign resident
                    at Douany, a walled town close to the coast, in 12° 17' S. lat. and 43° 46' E.
                    long. The most important town besides the capital is Numa-Choa,</p>
                <p>All the islands possess a very fertile soil; they produce cocoa-nuts, rice,
                    maize, sweet-potatoes, yams, sugar, coffee, cotton, indigo, and various tropical
                    fruits. A large number of cattle and sheep, the former similar to the small
                    species at Aden, are reared by the natives; turtle is caught in abundance along
                    the coasts, and forms an article of ex port, and the fauna is comparatively rich
                    for the size of the area. Population of the group, 65,000.</p>
