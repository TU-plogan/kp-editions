                <p><label type="entry">CYPRUS</label>, one of the largest islands in the
                    Mediterranean, situated in the easternmost basin of that sea, at nearly equal
                    distance from the coasts of Asia Minor to the north and of Syria to the east.
                    The headland of Cape Kormakiti in Cyprus is distant about 46 miles from Cape
                    Anamur in Cilicia, and its north-east point, Cape St Andrea, is about 60 miles
                    from Latakieh in Syria. It lies between 34° 30' and 35° 40' N. lat., and between
                    32° 15' and 34° 35' E. long., so that it is situated in almost exactly the same
                    latitude as Crete. Its greatest length is about 145 miles, from Cape Drepano in
                    the west to Cape St Andrea in the north-east, aud its greatest breadth, from
                    Cape Gata in the south to Cape Kormakiti in the north, reaches nearly 60 miles;
                    while it retains an average width of from 35 to 50 miles through the greater
                    part of its extent, but narrows suddenly to less than 10 miles in about 34°
                    long., and from thence sends out a long narrow tongue of land towards the E.N.E.
                    for a distance of more than 45 miles, terminating in Cape St Andrea. It is the
                    third largest island in the Mediterranean, considerably exceeding in area both
                    Corsica and Crete.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mountains.—</hi> Great part of the island is occupied by two
                    mountain ranges, both of which have a general direction from west to east. Of
                    these the most extensive, as well as the most lofty, is that which fills up
                    almost the whole southern portion of the island, and is generally designated by
                    modern geographers as Mount Olympus, though that name appears to have been
                    applied by the ancients only to one particular peak. The highest summit is known
                    at the present day as Mount Troödos, and attains an elevation of 6590 feet. It
                    sends down subordinate ranges or spurs, of considerable altitude, on all sides,
                    one of which extends to Cape Arnauti (the ancient Acamas), which forms the
                    north-west extremity of the island, while others descend on both sides quite to
                    the northern and southern coasts. The main range is continued eastwards by the
                    lofty summits known as Mount Adelphi and Mount Machera (both of them, however,
                    considerably inferior to Troödos) until it ends in the somewhat isolated peak
                    called Oros Stavro, or Hill of the Holy Cross. This mountain, which is evidently
                    the one designated by Strabo as Mount Olympus, is only 2300 feet high, but is a
                    conspicuous object from Larnaca, from which it is only 12 miles distant, and is
                    well known from being frequented as a place of pilgrimage.</p>
                <p>The northern range of mountains, which is not known by any collective name,
                    begins at Cape Kormakiti (the ancient Crommyon) and is continued from thence in
                    an unbroken ridge to the eastern extremity of the island, Cape St Andrea, a
                    distance of more than 100 miles. It is very inferior iu elevation to the
                    southern, range, its highest summits not attaining to more than about 3200 feet,
                    while in the eastern portion they but rarely exceed 2000 feet. But it is
                    remarkable for its continuous and unbroken character—consisting throughout of a
                    narrow, but rugged and rocky ridge, descending abruptly <hi rend="superscript">
                    x</hi> o the south into the great plain of Lefkosia, and to the norct to a
                    narrow plain bordering the coast.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Messaria.—</hi> Between these two mountain ranges lies a
                    broad tract of plain, extending quite across the island from the Bay of
                    Famagosta to that of Morphu on the west, through a length of nearly 60 miles,
                    with a breadth varying from 10 to 20 miles. It is known by the name of the
                    Messaria, and is watered by two streams, both of which descend from the
                    mountains on the south; but, on reaching the plain, the one turns eastward and
                    flows into the Bay of Famagosta, close to the ruins of Salamis; the other flows
                    westward into the Bay of Morphu. The greater part of this plain is open and·
                    uncultivated, and presents nothing but barren downs; but corn is grown in
                    considerable quantities in the northern portions of it, and there is no doubt
                    that the whole is readily susceptible of cultivation. It is remarkable that
                    Cyprus was celebrated in antiquity for its forests, which not only clothed the
                    whole of its mountain ranges, but covered the entire central plain with a dense
                    mass, so that it was with difficulty that the land could be cleared for
                    cultivation. At the present day the whole plain of the Messaria is utterly bare
                    and treeless, and it is only the loftiest and central summits of Mount Olympus
                    that still retain their covering of pine woods. The disappearance of the forests
                    has naturally affected the rivers, which are mostly mere torrents, dry iu
                    summer. The most considerable is that called in ancient times the Pediaeus,
                    which, as already mentioned, traverses the plain of the Messaria, and falls into
                    the sea near Salamis. But even this does not reach the sea in summer, and its
                    stagnant waters form marshes which contribute much to the unhealthy character of
                    the plain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> Next to its forests, which long supplied the
                    Greek monarchs of Egypt with timber for their fleets, Cyprus was celebrated
                    among the ancients for its mineral wealth, especially for its mines of copper,
                    which were worked from a very early period, and continued to enjoy such
                    reputation among both Greeks and Romans that the modern name for the metal is
                    derived from the term of Aes Cyprium or Cuprium by which it was known to the
                    latter. According to Strabo the most valuable mines were worked at a place
                    called Tamasus, in the centre of the island, on the northern slopes of Mount
                    Olympus, but their exact site has not been identified, and no mines are at
                    present worked in Cyprus. Besides copper, according to Strabo, the island
                    produced considerable quantities of silver; and Pliny records it as producing
                    various kinds of precious stones, among which he mentions diamonds and emeralds,
                    but these were doubtless nothing more than rock crystal and beryl. But the
                    mineralogy and geology of Cyprus have as yet been very imperfectly explored.
                    Salt, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n783/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0783-0748"/> which was in ancient times one of the productions
                    for which the island was noted, is still made in large quantities, and there are
                    extensive salt works in the neighbourhood of Larnaca and Limasol.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetable Products.—</hi> Cyprus was noted among the ancients
                    for its fertility and beauty; and under the Venetian rule it carried on an
                    extensive trade in its various natural productions; but this has greatly
                    declined in modern times. Besides corn, however, the island exports considerable
                    quantities of wine, oil, madder, the fruit of the carob tree, silk, and wool.
                    Tobacco and cotton are also grown in small quantities, and their cultivation
                    might doubtless be largely increased. The small plains at the foot of the range
                    of Mount Olympus, between the underfalls of the mountains and the sea, as well
                    as the narrow strip of level land along the north coast, though limited in
                    extent, are districts of great fertility; the latter especially is described by
                    Colonel Leake as one of the most beautiful and best cultivated districts in
                    Turkey. The great central plain, on the contrary, is in many parts marshy and
                    unhealthy; and indeed the whole interior of the island suffers much from
                    unhealthiness, and is subject to fevers of a peculiarly dangerous
                    description.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Harbours.—</hi> One of the greatest disadvantages of Cyprus is
                    the want of ports, there not being a good natural harbour in the whole island.
                    Larnaca and Limasol, which are the chief places of trade at the present day,
                    have nothing but mere roadsteads; and Salamis, which was the chief port of the
                    island in antiquity, as well as Famagosta, which held that position under the
                    Venetians, were only artificial harbours upon an open sandy coast. Tzerinia, on
                    the north coast, which serves as the place of direct communication with the
                    mainland of Asia Minor, has a very small and bad port, which, bad as it is, is
                    the only one on this side of the island.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Towns.—</hi> The only towns in Cyprus worthy of notice are the
                    following. 1. Lefkosia, or, as it is more commonly called, Nicosia, has since
                    the time of the Lusignan kings been the capital of the island. 2. Famagosta, on
                    the east coast, near the ruins of Salamis, also first rose to importance under
                    the Lusignan dynasty, by whom it was fortified, and continued under the
                    Venetians to be the chief port, as well as the strongest fortress in the island.
                    It became celebrated by its heroic defence against the Turks in 1571. It still
                    retains its external walls, but is a very poor and decayed place, with only a
                    few hundred inhabitants. 3. Larnaca, on the south-east coast, on the sita of the
                    ancient Citium, is now the chief place of trade, and the most rising and
                    flourishing town in the island. It contains from 5000 to 6000 inhabitants, and
                    consists of two portions—the old town, a short distance inland, and the Marina,
                    immediately facing the sea, where the foreign consuls reside, and foreign
                    steamers touch, which gives a degree of life and activity to the place unknown
                    to the rest of Cyprus. Recent excavations have discovered here many interesting
                    remains of the ancient city of Citium. 4. Limasol, on the south coast, some
                    miles west of the site of Amathus, is still a place of considerable trade,
                    though partially eclipsed by the rising prosperity of Larnaca. It is the
                    principal place of export of the wines of Cyprus, which enjoy a high reputation
                    throughout the Levant. 5. Baffo, or Papho, on the site of the ancient Paphos,
                    called for distinction’s sake New Paphos, at the south-west angle of the island,
                    has a small but insecure port, and is a very small place, though still the seat
                    of a Greek bishop. 6. Tzerini or Tzerinia (the ancient Kerynea) has been already
                    mentioned. It retains its old Venetian fortifications, and has therefore still
                    the air of a town, but is a very inconsiderable place.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">population</hi> of the island, which is said to have
                    amounted under the Venetians to not less than 1,000,000 (probably, however, a
                    great exaggeration), is now estimated at about 135,000 souls, of whom about
                    two-thirds are Greeks, the rest principally Turks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The early history of Cyprus is very obscure and
                    imperfectly known. It is certain, indeed, that it was colonized at a very early
                    period by the neighbouring Phcenicians, who introduced the worship of the
                    goddess Ashtaroth (called by the Greeks Astarte, and identified by them with
                    their own Aphrodite), for which the island always continued to be celebrated in
                    ancient times. But nothing is historically known of the period or extent of
                    these Phoenician settlements. Equally uncertain is the history of the Greek
                    colonies in the island, which are found in historical times existing side by
                    side with the Phoenicians. Their foundation was ascribed by popular legend and
                    tradition to the heroic ages—Salamis, for instance, being supposed to have been
                    founded by Teucer, the brother of Ajax—but there can be little doubt that they
                    were in reality posterior to the Phoenicians. Of the relations between the two
                    we know little, except from conjecture or inference; but it seems probable that
                    the Greeks gradually established a political supremacy, while the Phoenicians
                    continued to form an important element in the population, and exercised an
                    influence over the manners and customs, arts and religious rites of the
                    inhabitants in general, wholly different from anything found in Crete, Rhodes,
                    or the other islands of the AEgean. The first positive fact in the history of
                    Cyprus is its conquest by the Egyptian king Amasis in the 6th century B.c.
                    (Herodot., ii. 182). It did not, however, long continue subject to the Egyptian
                    monarchy, having revolted on occasion of the invasion of Egypt by Cambyses (525
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> when it declared in favour oí the Persians, and
                    became thenceforth a tributary province of the Persian empire.</p>
                <p>On occasion of the Ionian revolt in 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the
                    Cyprians were persuaded to take part in the insurrection, but after a year’s
                    interval were again reduced to subjection, and contributed a contingent of not
                    less than 150 ships to the Persian fleet under Xerxes (Herod., vii. 90)—a
                    striking proof of the power and prosperity they at this time possessed. During
                    the subsequent wars between the Greeks and Persians Cyprus was frequently the
                    scene of hostilities; and after the peace of Antalcidas (387 B.C.), Evagoras,
                    king of Salamis, succeeded in extending his authority over the greater part of
                    the island, as well as in rendering himself independent of the Persian monarch.
                    This state of things, however, did not last long; and after the death of
                    Nicocles, the son and successor of Evagoras, the island again became tributary
                    to the Persian empire. But after the battle of Issus, when Alexander advanced
                    into Phoenicia, all the cities of Cyprus declared in his favour, and sént their
                    fleets to assist him in the siege of Tyre.</p>
                <p>During this period, though the island was subject, with brief intervals, to
                    Persia, the several cities enjoyed the privilege of local self-government. Their
                    institutions, however, presented one marked difference from those of other Greek
                    cities, that they were always governed by kings, of whom there were not less
                    than nine in the island. The cities which were the seats of these petty
                    monarchies were :—1. Salamis, on the east coast, the most important of the Greek
                    colonies, which often held a kind of supremacy over the whole island; 2. Citium,
                    on the same site as the modern Larnaca, originally a Phoenician settlement, and
                    which always retained a predominant Phoenician character, and became only
                    partially Hellenized; 3. Amathus, on the south coast, near Limasol, also a
                    Phoenician colony; 4. Curium, some miles further west, at a spot now called
                    Episkopi; 5. Paphos, at the south-west angle of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n784/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0784-0749"/> island, sometimes called New Paphos, in order to
                    distinguish it from the more ancient Phoenician city of the name, called in the
                    days of Strabo Palae Paphos, which was one of the principal seats of the worship
                    of Astarte, the Phoenician Venus; 6. Marium, afterwards called Arsinoë, on the
                    north coast, at a short distance from the promontory of Acamas; 7. Soli, on the
                    same coast, further east; 8. Kerynea, which still retains its ancient site and
                    name as Tzerinia; 9. Lapathus, or Lapethus, on the same coast, intermediate
                    between the two cities last mentioned. Others, however, assign this ninth place
                    to Chytri, a town of the interior, on the road from Salamis to Kerynea, and it
                    is likely that the sovereign cities were not always the same. Several other
                    towns are mentioned by Strabo and Ptolemy, which were apparently in earlier
                    times subject to those above enumerated. Idalium and Golgos, the names of which
                    are celebrated from their connection with the worship of Venus, seem to have
                    been merely sanctuaries or holy places, which had grown up around the temples of
                    the goddess, and, in Greek times at least, were never towns o‡ importance.</p>
                <p>After the death of Alexander, the possession of Cyprus, so important from its
                    position and on account of its inexhaustible forests, became an object of
                    contention among his successors. After various vicissitudes it passed into the
                    hands of Ptolemy, king of· Egypt; but in 306 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> a
                    great effort to recover it was made by Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, who
                    reduced the whole of the rest of the island and laid siege to the capital city
                    of Salamis. The attempt of Ptolemy, who arrived with a great fleet, to raise the
                    siege, led to one of the most memorable naval battles in all antiquity, in which
                    Ptolemy was utterly defeated; and Salamis, with all the rest of Cyprus, passed
                    into the power of Demetrius. He did not, however, long retain his new
                    acquisition; the island was recovered by Ptolemy in 295 B.C., and continued
                    thenceforth to form one of the most valuable possessions of the Greek monarchs
                    of Egypt. It was generally placed under the government of a man of the highest
                    rank, who was often a kinsman of the Egyptian king; and, during the dissensions
                    of the royal family which marked the declining period of the Ptolemaic dynasty,
                    Cyprus was more than once held by one of the rival candidates as an independent
                    sovereignty. In this manner it was governed as a separate kingdom by Ptolemy
                    Lathyrus for not less than 18 years (from 107 to 89 B.C.), and it was held by a
                    younger brother of Ptolemy Auletes, in 58 B.C., when it was determined by the
                    Romans to dispossess him,—an act of shameless aggression, which was proposed by
                    the tribune Clodius, and reluctantly carried into effect by Cato. From this time
                    Cyprus became a Roman province; it was at first united with Cilicia, but
                    afterwards was constituted as a separate government.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable event in the history of Cyprus, while it was under the Roman
                    empire, was a great revolt of the Jews, who had established themselves there in
                    large numbers, in which they are said to have destroyed not less than 240,000 of
                    the other inhabitants (117 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> Christianity, which
                    had been introduced into the island by St Paul, quickly rose to a flourishing
                    condition, and not less than thirteen bishoprics were established in the island.
                    After the division of the Roman empire Cyprus naturally passed, with all the
                    neighbouring countries, into the hands of the Eastern or Byzantine emperors, to
                    whom it continued subject, with brief intervals, for more than seven centuries.
                    In 646 the Arabs under the caliph Othman made themselves masters of the island,
                    and destroyed the city of Salamis, which had until that time continued to be the
                    capital. But it was recovered by the Greek emperors two years afterwards; and,
                    though again conquered by the Arabs under the reign of Haroun el. Raschid (802),
                    it did not long remain in their hands, and lapsed again into the power of the
                    Byzantine empire. In 1184 Isaac Comnenus, the nephew of the reigning emperor,
                    established himself in possession of Cyprus as an independent sovereignty; but
                    during the third crusade (1195) it was wrested from his hands by Richard I.,
                    king of England, who bestowed it upon Guy de Lusignan, the titular king of
                    Jerusalem, as some compensation for the loss of the holy city.</p>
                <p>From this time Cyprus was governed for nearly three centuries by a succession of
                    kings of the same dynasty, who introduced into the island the feudal system and
                    the other institutions of Western Europe. During the latter part of this period,
                    indeed, the Genoese made themselves masters of Famagosta—which had risen in
                    place of Salamis to be the chief commercial city in the island—and retained
                    possession of it for a considerable time; but it was recovered by King James
                    II., and the whole island was reunited under his rule. His marriage with
                    Catherine Cornaro, a Venetian lady of rank, was designed to secure the support
                    of the powerful republic of Venice, but had the effect after a few years, in
                    consequence of his own death and that of his son James III., of transferring the
                    sovereignty of the island to his new allies. Catherine, feeling herself unable
                    to contend alone with the increasing power of the Turks, was induced to abdicate
                    the sovereign power in favour of the Venetian republic, which at once entered
                    into full possession of the island (1487).</p>
                <p>The Venetians retained their acquisition for about eighty years, notwithstanding
                    the neighbourhood of the Turks. It was not till 1570 that the latter, under
                    Selim II., made a serious attempt to conquer the island, in which they landed an
                    army of 60,000 men. The greater part of the island was reduced with little
                    difficulty; Nicosia, the capital, was taken after a siege of 45 days, and 20,000
                    of its inhabitants put to the sword, famagosta alone made a gallant and
                    protracted resistance, and did not capitulate till after a siege of nearly a
                    year’s duration (August 1571). The terms of the capitulation were shamefully
                    violated by the Turks, who put to death the governor Bragadino with the most
                    cruel torments. Since that time Cyprus has remained in the hands of the Turks,
                    and its history has been almost a blank. A serious insurrection broke out in
                    1764, but was speedily suppressed; another in 1823 became the occasion of a
                    frightful massacre of the Greek population. Meanwhile the prosperity of the
                    island was continually declining, it is only of late years that the increasing
                    commerce of the western nations of Europe with the Levant has given some
                    stimulus to trade, and encouraged the cultivation of the natural productions of
                    an island which, under more favourable circumstances, might be one of the
                    richest in the Mediterranean.</p>

                    ancient authorities concerning the geography, history, and mythology of the
                    island, but was not based upon any original researches. Its geology and natural
                    history are still very imperfectly known, and its antiquities had, until lately,
                    been almost entirely neglected. But within the last few years extensive
                    excavations have been carried on in different parts of the island—especially at
                    Golgos, Idalium, and Curium—by Mr Lang and General de Cesnola, which have
                    brought to light a vast number of statues and other works <pb break="no"

                    on the religion and mythology of the inhabitants—which appear to have always
                    presented a singular mixture of the Hellenic and Oriental elements—as well as
                    displaying a peculiar style of art, in some degree intermediate between that of
                    Assyria and continental Asia on the one hand and the early Greek sculptures on
                    the other. Unfortunately these collections have been removed to New York, while
                    no detailed description of them has yet been published. It is, however,
                    announced that General de Cesnola is engaged in a comprehensive work giving an
                    account of his researches and their results, which will doubtless throw much
                    light on the ancient geography and history of Cyprus.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> In 1868 Mr R. H. Lang discovered the site of
                    a temple at Idalium (1 ali), containing a large number of statues in calcareous
                    stone, of which a selection was acquired by the British Museum along with a
                    bilingual inscription—in Phoenician and Cypriote—-.found there also. From this
                    inscription Mr George Smith obtained the key to the Cypriote language, which had
                    not previously been deciphered, and which now proves to be a dialect of Greek
                    written in a local character. With this key Dr Birch has published a reading of
                    the Due de Luynes tablet, known as the “tablet of Dali” in the <hi rend="italic"

                    sites of Cyprus by the American consul, General de Cesnola, and were continued
                    up to 1876, the result being the discovery of an enormous quantity of sculpture,
                    inscriptions, pottery, gold ornaments, gems, and other articles of treasure
                    stored up in temples or in tombs. Those antiquities have been acquired by the
                    Museum of New York. The most interesting part of his discovery was the treasure
                    from the underground chamber of a temple at Curium, including a pair of solid
                    gold armlets inscribed in Cypriote with the name of a King Eteandros, whose date
