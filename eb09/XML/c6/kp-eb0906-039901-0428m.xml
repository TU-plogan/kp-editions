                    the Pauline epistles. They are remarkable as being in their primary aspect
                    historical rather than doctrinal, while, at the same time, all the fundamental
                    doctrines of Christianity, as connected with the miraculous facts on which they
                    rest, are suggestively implied. These epistles, too, together with those to the
                    Galatians and to the Romans, have been admitted as genuine writings of St Paul,
                    even by the most audacious critical assailants of the New Testament canon. The
                    external testimony to them is early and complete, and the internal evidence of
                    authorship and age nakes it impossible to doubt the genuineness and authenticity
                    of these remarkable documents. There are, perhaps, no other epistles in the New
                    Testament in which there is so much of “local colouring,” or so many temporal
                    and local allusions. These letters throw great light both upon the early
                    circumstances of the Christian church and upon the character of the great
                    missionary to the Gentiles: and whilst they are very full of what was due to the
                    special occasions on which they were written, the universal applicability of the
                    Christian principles laid down in them must be patent to every thoughtful
                    student. Stier speaks of the Epistles to the Corinthians as being “a pathology
                    and <hi rend="italic">materia</hi><hi rend="italic">medica</hi> for all that are
                    designed to be physicians of the church in a larger or Dsser circle;” and Bleek
                    remarks on the first epistle, that it “serves as a type and pattern in dealing
                    with the multifarious tendencies, relations, and disorders of the Christian
                    church, almost all of which have their counterpart in the Corinthian Church, and
                    are continually repeated with various modifications at various times.”</p>
                <p>The history of the two epistles seems to be this. Paul’s first visit to Corinth
                    and his long and eventful sojourn there are mentioned in Acts xviii. 1-18. After
                    his departure from the rich and luxurious capital of Achaia, evils which, we can
                    perceive, were very likely to spring up in such a place began to appear in the
                    Christian community. The Hellenic tendency to philosophical speculation and to
                    factious partisanship, and the sensuality and licentiousness which had made the
                    word <hi rend="italic">corinthianize</hi> a synonym for selfindulgence and
                    wantonness, became roots of bitterness, strife, and immorality. The presence of
                    Apollos (Acts xviii. 27, 28) was doubtless advantageous, and St Paul evidently
                    alludes to a successful prosecution of evangelistic work by the learned
                    Alexandrian, when he says “I planted, Apollos watered” (1 Cor. iii. 6). Yet it
                    would seem that invidious comparisons had been made between the simpler
                    preaching of the Apostle Paul and the probably more philosophical and refined
                    style of Apollos, so that some of the Corinthian Christians began to regard
                    Apollos as their leader, rather than Paul, who had first preached the gospel
                    unto them. The reluctance of Apollos to return to Corinth, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n429/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0429-0400"/> at the time when Paul wrote what we know as the
                    first epistle (1 Cor. xvi. 12), can best be accounted for by a consciousness on
                    his part of the rivalry which had arisen between the two factious; and the
                    manner in which Paul urged, and Apollos declined, the mission of the latter to
                    Corinth may be viewed as equally creditable to the magnanimity of the older
                    teacher and to the modesty and prudence of the younger. But a far more dangerous
                    division of the church existed than that between those who favoured Paul and
                    those who preferred Apollos. In the Epistles to the Corinthians we have
                    indications of the antagonism and envy of a Judaizing section, who may have been
                    encouraged by emissaries from Palestine, like those complained of in Calat, ii.
                    4 (comp. Acts xv. 1, 24). These Judaizers would make much of the fact that Paul
                    was not one of the original twelve apostles; and they seem to have endeavoured
                    to undermine his authority, by depre ciating his position as a teacher, and by
                    deriding his personal qualifications. Nor were dissensions and tendencies to
                    split up into parties the only evils that infested the Corinthian Churches.
                    Paul, when at Ephesus on his third missionary journey, heard of these
                    “contentions” from the members of a Christian household, who were either
                    resident at Corinth or connected with the place (1 Cor. i. 11); but he heard of
                    something worse still, and more glaringly inconsistent with the Christian
                    profession. Licentiousness was common among them, and a grievous case of incest
                    had taken place (1 Cor. v. 1, &amp;c.), which called for the severest censure
                    and punishment. That the apostle had been awake to the peculiar dangers of the
                    Corinthian Christians in respect of the licentiousness and luxury for which
                    Corinth was noted, appears from the fact that he had previously written a letter
                    which has not come down to us (1 Cor. v. 9), exhorting the Christians to avoid
                    intercourse with fornicators. Alford conjectures that this letter may have also
                    contained some instructions as to the collection (1 Cor. xvi. 1), and an
                    announcement of an intended plan of visiting them, which he afterwards
                    abandoned, perhaps on purpose to see what effect would be produced by the letter
                    known to us as the first epistle, which was in reality a second one.</p>
                <p>A good opportunity was presented for communicating with the Corinthians by the
                    arrival of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus (1 Cor. xvi. 17), who probably
                    brought a letter from Corinth (1 Cor. vii. 1, <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>
                    fcc.), requesting instructions on divers points to which St Paul replies in the
                    first of our two epistles. This letter from Corinth (as Paley points out) seems
                    to have made little or no mention of the disorders and divisions which the
                    apostle rebukes. These came to the apostle’s ears by private report and not in
                    an official communication. We have here a satisfactory explanation of the varied
                    contents of our first epistle. After an introduction which is graceful,
                    conciliatory, and affectionate (1 Cor. i. 1-9), the writer alludes to the
                    indications of party spirit and dissension which had been reported to him, and,
                    while he very earnestly vindicates the claim of the gospel to be a revelation of
                    divine wisdom, deprecates the tendency to overrate human eloquence and intellect
                    (i. 10-iv, 16.) He tells them that he is sending Timotheus to remind them of his
                    teaching, and that he intends himself to come soon (iv. 17-21). He then rebukes
                    their licentiousness and their litigiousness (v., vi.), and afterwards proceeds
                    to answer the several inquiries which had been put before him by the Corinthian
                    letter, viz., questions concerning marriage, questions concerning meat offered
                    to idols, and questions concerning spiritual gifts (vii.-xiv.), With his replies
                    to particular points he blends a spirited defence of his own authority and
                    conduct (ix.), and serious exhortations as to the behaviour of women in the
                    Christian assemblies, and the manner in which</p>
                <p>Christians should partake of the Lord’s Supper (x., xi.) One doctrinal subject is
                    treated of directly in the epistle. Some among the Corinthians had denied the
                    resurrection of the dead. The apostle shows that the fact of the resurrection of
                    Jesus Christ from the dead is the basis of Christian teaching and the spring of
                    Christian hope (xv.) He then makes reference to the collection which he was
                    making for the brethren at Jerusalem, speaks of his own plans, sends greetings
                    from the churches of Asia, and concludes with solemnity and tenderness
                    (xvi.)</p>
                <p>The subscribed note to this epistle, which asserts that it was written from
                    Philippi, is a palpable error, possibly grounded upon a misapprehension of xvi.
                    5. The letter was evidently written from Ephesus, some time before Pentecost,
                    and after winter (xvi. 6, 8), and, not improbably, near the season of the Jewish
                    feast of the Passover (v. 7, 8), in the year 57 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    Whether Timothy was the bearer of the letter or not seems doubtful (xvi. 10);
                    and it is more probable that the three messengers from Corinth, already
                    mentioned as having brought a letter for St Paul, returned with his reply. But
                    Timothy and Erastus were sent together into Macedonia, and Erastus (comp. Rom.
                    xvi. 23 and 2 Tim. iv. 20) may have been returning to his home in Corinth. Then
                    occurred the notable disturbance at Ephesus recorded in Acts xix. 23, &amp;c.
                    Paul left Asia for Macedonia (Acts xx. 1), and our second epistle to the
                    Corinthians may have been written either at Philippi or at Thessalonica, at a
                    time when Timothy had rejoined him (2 Cor. i. 1).</p>
                <p>It has been a frequent remark of commentators that there is no letter among those
                    written by St Paul so full of personal feeling as the Second Epistle to the
                    Corinthians. The “tumultuous conflict of feeling,” “the labyrinth of conflicting
                    emotions,” by which the writer was agitated, is reflected in the rapid
                    transitions and confused eagerness, as we may term it, of his style. We can
                    trace a twofold current of emotion,—one, of relief and gratitude because he had
                    heard from Titus (2 Cor. vii. 7) better tidings than he had expected of the
                    effect produced by his former letter, and the other, of righteous indignation
                    against those persons at Corinth, who were trying to undermine his influence and
                    misrepresent his work. We may also perceive indications of mental dejection, and
                    references to bodily suffering which add much to the personal interest of the
                    letter. It has been conjectured that, besides “the trouble in Asia” (i. 8) and
                    his daily anxieties about “all the churches” for which he felt himself
                    responsible (xi. 28), the apostle was suffering about this time from an attack
                    of that painful and chronic malady which he calls “a stake in the flesh” (xii.
                    7). Titus had been sent to Corinth as a special messenger some time after the
                    despatch of the letter from Ephesus, and was expected by Γaul at Troas, but did
                    not rejoin him until he had come into Macedonia. The news that the greater part
                    of the Corinthian Church was loyal to their old teacher, and had attended to his
                    injunctions in the matter of the offender mentioned in 1 Cor. v., and had
                    “sorrowed unto repentance” (2 Cor. vii. 10,11), was very consolatory to him; but
                    it is plain that Titus must have also informed Paul of very distinct and
                    virulent opposition to him on the part of certain teachers and a faction of the
                    Corinthians attached to them. Hence the indignant strain which especially
                    appears in the latter part of the epistle, wh¢re irony and remonstrance and
                    pathos are so wonderfully blended, and where the desire to vindicate his
                    authority, to substantiate his personal claims to the respect and affection of
                    the church, and to expose the mischief which was being done by the false
                    teachers, causes him to review his own toils and infirmities in the touching
                    picture of his work which we have in xi. 21-xii. 21. The epistle (so far as it
                    admits of analysis) may be roughly divided <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n430/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0430-0401"/> into three portions, viz. :—(1) a very earnest
                    description of his own interest in and relation to the Corinthian churches, and
                    of the impression produced on his mind by what Titus reported (i.-vii.), (2)
                    some exhortations to liberality in respect of the collection which was going on
                    in Macedonia and Achaia for the brethren at Jerusalem (viii., ix.); (3) a
                    vindication of his apostolic authority against the calumnies and
                    misrepresentations of those who were endeavouring to subvert it (x.-xiii.) The
                    epistle was taken to Corinth by Titus, who was quite ready to undertake a second
                    journey (viii. 17), and with him went two other brethren <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fib.</hi> 18, 22), who were selected “messengers of the churches,” in charge
                    of the contributions to the collection already mentioned. It has been noticed
                    that this letter was “addressed not to Corinth only but to all the churches in
                    the whole province of Achaia, including Athens and Cenchreae, and perhaps also
                    Sicyon, Argos, Megara, Patrae, and other neighbouring towns, all of which
                    probably shared more or Jess in the agitation which affected the Christian
                    community at Corinth” (Howson).</p>
                <p>We may here mention the conjecture of Bleek that between our 1 Corinthians and 2
                    Corinthians another letter intervened, which Titus took with him on his first
                    mission, and that this is the letter which is referred to in 2 Cor. ii. 3, vii.
                    8 as one of unusual severity If this conjecture, which is a plausible one, be
                    admitted, there must have been four letters from the Apostle Paul to the
                    Corinthians, two of which have not been preserved. At any rate our 2d epistle is
                    one in which all the affection and eagerness of the apostle culminate, and it
                    gives to us, more than any other of his letters which have come down to us, an
                    idea of the intensity of the zeal and sympathy with which he laboured in the
                    cause of the gospel. “What an admirable epistle,” wrote George Herbert, “is the
                    second to the Corinthians! how full of affections; he joys, he sorrows, he
                    grieves, and he glories; never was there such care of a flock expressed save in
                    the great Shepherd of the fold, who first shed tears over Jerusalem, and then
                    blood.”</p>
                <p>There are three special points in connection with the Epistles to the Corinthians
                    on which a few further remarks must be made. One is the question whether a visit
                    to Corinth, which is not mentioned in the Acts, yet seems alluded to in several
                    passages of the epistles (2 Cor. xii 14, xiii. 1, 2, and comp. ii. 1, xii. 21),
                    took place. The opponents of this view rely principally on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >argumentum</hi><hi rend="italic">a silentio</hi> (which in this case, however,
                    is a very weak one, when we consider the evidently compendious nature of St
                    Luke’s narrative in the Acts), and on the expression “a <hi rend="italic"
                    >second</hi> benefit,” in 2 Cor. i. 15, 16. But this expression seems to refer
                    to St Paul’s intention to pay a double visit to Corinth, one in going to, and a
                    second in returning from, Macedonia. The advocates of the unrecorded visit urge,
                    first, that the language about the “third” visit cannot reasonably be explained
                    by saying that it was the third time St Paul <hi rend="italic">intended</hi> to
                    come; and, secondly, that it is very natural to suppose that the apostle would
                    have found some opportunity for at least a short visit during his three years’
                    residence at Ephesus. This visit appears to have been a very painful one, during
                    which St Paul must have had sad forebodings of the evils which he rebukes in our
                    first epistle; but it must have been a brief one, and the language of 1 Cor.
                    xvi. 7 might possibly allude to the hurried nature of a former visit.</p>
                <p>Another disputed point, and one which it is perhaps impossible to determine, is,
                    What was the nature of the “Christine” party at Corinth? Were they a separate
                    faction at all? if so, were they a Judaizing faction or a philosophizing one?
                    Some hold that 1 Cor. i. 12 does not oblige us to believe in the existence of
                    distinct parties or factions in the church, but only of certain tendencies. The
                    indications throughout the epistles are, at any rate, sufficient to show that a
                    strong antagonism existed between a Judaizing faction and a more liberal, less
                    formal, and less scrupulous body of professed Christians, some of whom adhered
                    to Paul as their recognized leader, while others preferred Apollos. We can quite
                    understand how the Judaizing party would seize on the name and position of
                    Peter, or Cephas (and it is noticeable that the Hebrew designation is
                    preferred), as a rallying point, where they could oppose the claims of Paul and
                    Apollos. But who were those who boasted that they were peculiarly Christ’s ì
                    Some (as Howson, Alford, Stanley) think it probable they were an extreme section
                    of the Judaizers. Others (as Neander and Olshausen) consider that they may have
                    been “philosophical” Greeks who, “with arrogant self-will,” professed to belong
                    to no party, and renounced all “apostolic” intervention, perhaps modelling for
                    themselves a peculiar form of Christian doctrine by means of some collection of
                    memorable sayings and actions of Christ.</p>
                <p>A third point which calls for brief notice is the “gift of tongues,” of which so
                    much is said in the first of our two epistles. It is quite what we should expect
                    that a gift which ministered rather to individual notoriety than to general
                    edification should have been abused and overrated in a Greek community like that
                    at Corinth. It does not seem probable, nor is there evidence forthcoming to
                    show, that the “gift of tongues” was used for purposes of instruction. It was a
                    mystical condition rather than a linguistic faculty,—an ecstatic utterance
                    connected with a peculiar state of religious emotion. Stanley compares Montanist
                    utterances, the prophets of Cevennes, Wesleyan paroxysms, and Irvingite
                    manifestations as phenomena which, “however inferior to the manifestations of
                    Apostolic times, have their origin in the same mysterious phase of human life
                    and human nature.”</p>
                <p>The evidential value of the epistles to the Corinthians is very great. For we
                    have in them indisputable historical and biographical <hi rend="italic"
                    >data</hi> which in various ways imply and establish all the fundamental facts
                    which concern the origin of the Christian church, and indicate the process, of
                    which we have a more direct narrative in the Acts whereby Christianity was
                    extended beyond the range of Jewish influences and prejudices, and its
                    principles brought into contact with “the culture and vices of the ancient
                    classical world.”</p>
                <p>There are not many special writers on these epistles. Among the Germans may be
                    mentioned Osiander, Heydenreich, Billroth. But the book in which English readers
                    will find the most complete and specific treatment of the subject is that by
                    Dean Stanley. He divides the epistles into sections, and appends paraphrases of
                    their contents. There are important notes on the allusions to the Eucharist in 1
                    Cor., on the miracles and organization of the apostolic age, and on the gifts of
                    tongues and of prophecy. He adds a short dissertation on the relation of the
                    epistles to the gospel history. In Conybeare and Howson's <hi rend="italic">Life
                    and Epistles of St Paul</hi> there is a very instructive review of the condition
                    of the primitive church, with special reference to spiritual gifts, ordinances,
                    divisions, &amp;c. (ch. xiii ), and the whole history of the period during which
                    the Epistles to the Corinthians were written is admirably treated. The Armenian
                    epistles from the Corinthians to St Paul, and from St Paul to the Corinthians,
                    are apocryphal. They may be seen in Stanley’s book. Paley’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Horae Paulinae</hi> and Birks’s <hi rend="italic">Horae Apostolicce</hi>
                    contain interesting examples of undesigned coincidences between the epistles and
                    the narrative in the Acts. Birks thinks that the Sosthenes mentioned in 1 Cor.
                    i. 1, whose name never occurs in the other epistles, may be identified with the
                    ruler of the synagogue mentioned in Acts xviii- 17. A full discussion on “the
                    thorn in the flesh ’’ will be found in an interesting note of Professor
                    Lightfoot on Gal. iv. 13. (W, S. S.)</p>
