                    North Britain for the last three centuries at least, and down till our own day
                    been practised chiefly by natives of that country, it may correctly be spoken of
                    as a Scottish .pastime. Some writers, looking to the name and technical terms of
                    the game, trace its invention to the Low Countries: thus “curl” may have been
                    derived from the German <hi rend="italic">kurz weil,</hi> a game; “tee” from the
                    Teutonic <hi rend="italic">tighen,</hi> to point out; “bonspiel,” a district
                    curling competition, from the Belgic <hi rend="italic">bonne,</hi> a district,
                    and <hi rend="italic">spel,</hi> play; though the supposition that “rink” is
                    just a modification of the Saxon <hi rend="italic">hrink,</hi> a strong man,
                    seems scarcely tenable. Then, it is further stated that, as curling is called
                    “kuting” in some parts of Lanarkshire and Ayrshire, and very much resembles
                    quoiting on the ice, the name may have some connection with the Dutch <hi
                    rend="italic">coete,</hi> a quoit; vhile Kilian in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teutcnic Dictionary</hi> represents the teιm <hi rend="italic">lleuyten</hi> to
                    mean a pastime in which large globes of stone are thrown upon ice like the quoit
                    or discus. Possibly enough some of the Flemish merchants who settled in Scotland
                    towards the close of the 16th century may have brought the game to the country.
                    Unfortunately, however, for the theory that assigns to it a far-away origin, we
                    find no early mention of it in the literature of the Continent; while Camden,
                    when describing the Orkney Islands in 1607, tells us that one of them supplies
                    “plenty of excellent stones for the game called curling;” and incidental
                    references to it as a game plaj cd in Scotland are made by several authors
                    during the first half of the same century. If the game be not indigenous to
                    Scotland it certainly owes its development to that country, and in the course of
                    time it has come to be nearly as much the national sport of the Caledonians as
                    “the rough bur thistle” their heraldic emblem.</p>
                <p>With very rude engines it was played at first,—random whin boulders fashioned by
                    the finger of nature alone, or misshapen granite blocks, bored through to let in
                    the thumb of the player, having been the channel-stones used by the primitive
                    curlers of the country. Even before Bannockburn was fought the ice of the
                    Scottish lochs may have been employed as the arena of a bloodless strife; though
                    it is only as a piece of pardonable witticism that Ossian has been quoted as
                    follows to show that curling was practised by his sòmewhat mythical heroes—“Fly,
                    son of Morven, fly; amid the circle of stones Swaran, bends at the stone of
                    might.” In course of years the rough block of the game was superseded by
                    asymmetrical object usually made of whinstone or granite, beautifully rounded,
                    brilliantly polished, and supplied with a convenient handle; so that the curling
                    stone now used is as great an improvement on its remote predecessor as the
                    Martini rifle is on the old matchlock which figured at Marston Moor and
                    Culloden. It is circular in form, its weight from 35 to 50 B&gt;, its
                    circumference from 30 to 36 inches, and the height is about one-eighth of the
                    girth. With engines of such shape and bulk, costing with handles from <hi
                    rend="italic">£2</hi> to <hi rend="italic">£2,</hi> 10s. per pair, all the
                    societies, 472 in number, connected with the Royal Caledonian Curling Club play
                    their spiels when “cauld cauld frosty weather” supplies the required arena. Most
                    of these societies are located in the Land of Cakes and Curlers; but many of
                    them are transatlantic, no few er than 37 belonging to the Ontario province
                    branch alone; while there are many hundreds of independent curling fraternities
                    north of the Tweed, who play for their own hand, under arrangements of their
                    own, though the rules and usages of the Caledonian Curling Club form a code
                    which largely regulates “the roaring game,” as Burns calls it, all over the
                    world.</p>
                <p>On a rink 42 yards long, or so, with a tee at each end, the stone is hurled, the
                    hurler, or curler, when delivering it standing on one side of the goal or tee.
                    so as to <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n748/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0748-0713"/> bring the stone over the tee when delivering it;
                    or, according to another arrangement, he occupies a small circle a foot in
                    diameter behind a ring of 7 feet radius drawn round the tee. To cover this goal
                    or lie close to it is the player’s chief object; but often when he has realized
                    his aim, a rival stone “up the rink like Jehu roars,” driving his stone nowhere,
                    settling down in its pride of place, but only to be served perhaps in a similar
                    way itself before the match is at an end. No stones that lie outside the large
                    circles of 7 feet radius round the tee are allowed to count, and all laggard
                    stones that manifest a piglike indolence, and do not pass the well-named hog
                    score, which is drawn at a distance of one-sixth the rink from each tee, are
                    removed as obstructive cumberers of the channel. Games can be played by two
                    persons, but usually matches are arranged for with numerous competitors formed
                    into rinks of four players a side, two stones being used by each player. It is
                    customary for the parish clubs of a district, marshalled by their respective
                    skips, or captains, to try their skill against each other once a year or so;
                    while annually (when weather permits) a great contest, which is at least
                    semi-national, is waged between the curlers north and south of the River
                    Forth.</p>
                <p>At first the game is remarkably simple, the leader, as we have said, endeavouring
                    to top or closely neighbour the tee, and his immediate opponent having a similar
                    object in view. When, during the progress of the game, one, two, or more stones
                    have been well planted, the supporters of those who placed them there are
                    usually directed by their skip rather to guard the winning stones than venture
                    too near them at the risk of injuring their position. On the other hand the
                    tactics of the opposing party will consist in efforts to knock off the guards,
                    dislodge the well-planted stones, or get their own still better placed where
                    that is possible. It sometimes happens that the stone nearest the tee—the
                    winner, as it is called—is so well protected that it cannot be touched directly,
                    and defies removal unless it be assailed by an ingenious master-stroke
                    technically termed <hi rend="italic">wicking</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >inringing,</hi> whereby a stone is sent in an oblique direction so as haply to
                    hit the winner; and, if it not only does that, but becomes the winner in its
                    stead, the man who throws it is sure to be hailed by his exulting comrades as a
                    prince among curlers, if not “the king o’ a’ the core.” “Wicking, or inringing,”
                    says the late Sir Richard Broun, Bart., in his admirable work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memorabilia Curliana</hi> (publishedin 1830), “the prettiest and most
                    scientific point in the game by far, is to take the shot and leave yourself
                    behind the rampart of your adversary’s barricade, when to all appearance their
                    winner was impregnable;” and this is done “by taking an inner angle off a side
                    shot in such a manner as to change and direct the course of your stone upon the
                    one to be projected.” When, however, science fails, and the ice is so blocked up
                    as almost to hide the tee, an effort of strength and hazard is resorted to in
                    the hope of some benefit “turning up.” This, by the curlers of the south of
                    Scotland, is called “rebutting.” The player in such cases is usually told by his
                    skip to “put plenty of powder in the horn,” and the stone is delivered with
                    tremendous force, so as to go crashing through guards and double guards,
                    sometimes doing more harm than good, and sometimes also changing in a moment the
                    whole fortunes of the game.</p>
                <p>Many fine songs have been written about curling, from which lines might be quoted
                    descriptive of all its leading points, its implements, “channel stones, crampets
                    (flat pieces of iron with spikes below fastened on the sole of the shoe to keep
                    the player from slipping), and besoms so green,” with which the rink is swept;
                    also in praise of the game as a promoter of mental enjoyment, bodily health, and
                    the best of good-fellowship. The late Dr Henry Duncan’s song on the subject has
                    never been excelled; and he succeeds in packing into a single stanza some of its
                    chief characteristics :—</p>
                <p>“There draw a shot; there lay a guard;</p>
                <p>And here beside him lie, man;</p>
                <p>Now let him feel a gamester’s hand;</p>
                <p>Now in this bosom die, man.</p>
                <p>There fill the port, and block the ice;</p>
                <p>We sit upon the tee, man!</p>
                <p>Now take this in-ring sharp and neat, And make this winner flee, man.”</p>
                <p>Ths Ettrick Shepherd also ranks among the laureates oi the rink.</p>
                <p>The following rules of the game are abridged from the <hi rend="italic">Annual of
                    the Royal Caledonian Curling Club :—</hi></p>
                <p>1. The tees shall be set down 40 yards apart; and in an exact alignment with the
                    tees aline shall be drawn on the rink. Seven feet behind each tee a circle 6
                    inches in diameter shall be also drawn on the ice on the left-hand side of said
                    line (looking to the tee to be played to), the inner side of which shall be
                    distant from said line 6 inches. Upon this circle, and as near as may upon the
                    centre of it, eveiy player, whether standing on the ice or on a board or other
                    rest, shall, in the delivery of his stone, place, or in stepping out, put down
                    his left or fore foot, if he be a right hand player. For a lefthand player,
                    another such circle shall be placed in like manner, and for the like purpose on
                    the right hand side of said line. And in the event of a hack, hatch, trigger,
                    &amp;c., being used, it shall be right behind said circle, and not less distant
                    therefrom than 2 feet, nor greater in length than 12 inches.</p>
                <p>A circle of 7 feet radius to be described from each tee as a centre, and every
                    stone to count which is either within, or resting on, this circle. All played
                    stones passing the tee, and going beyond the 7 feet radius, shall be put off the
                    ice. The hog-score to be distant from each tee one-sixth part of the length of
                    the whole rink played on. Every stone to be a hog which does not clear this
                    score; but no stone to be such which has struck another stone lying over the
                    hog-score. A line shall be drawn on the ice, at a right angle to the rink,
                    half-way betwixt the tees, called “the middle line." In no case shall the rink
                    be less than 32 yards.</p>
                <p>2. All matches to be of a certain number of heads, to be agreed on by the clubs,
                    or fixed by the umpire, before commencement; or otherwise, by time, or shots, if
                    mutually agreed on.</p>
                <p>3. Every rink to be composed of four players a side, each using two stones. The
                    rotation of play observed during the first head of a match shall not be
                    changed.</p>
                <p>4. The skips opposing each other shall settle by lot. or in any other way they
                    may agree upon, which party shall lead at the first head, after which the
                    winning party shall do so.</p>
                <p>5. All curling stones shall be of a circular shape. No stone shall be of a
                    greater weight than 50 lb imperial, or of greater circumference than 36 inches,
                    or of less height than one-eighth part of its greatest circumference.</p>
                <p>6. No stone, or side of a stone, shall be changed after a match has been begun,
                    or during its continuance, unless by consent.</p>
                <p>7. Should a stone happen to be broken, the largest fragment shall be considered
                    in the game for that end—the player being entitled afterwards to use another
                    stone, or another pair.</p>
                <p>8. If a played stone rolls over, or stops, on its side or top, it shall be put
                    off the ice. Should the handle quit the stðne in delivery, the player must keep
                    hold of it, otherwise he shall not be entitled to replay the shot. <hi
                    rend="subscript"> φ</hi></p>
                <p>9. Players, during the course of each end, to be arranged along the sides of the
                    rink, anywhere skips may direct; and no party, except when sweeping according to
                    rule, shall go upon the middle of the rink, or cross it, under any pretence
                    whatever. Skips alone to stand at or about the tee—that of the playing party
                    having the choice of place, and not to be obstructed by the other.</p>
                <p>10. If a player should play out of turn, the stone so played may be stopped in
                    its progress, and returned to the player. Should the mistake not be discovered
                    till the stone be at rest, or has struck another stone, the opposite skip shall
                    have the option of adding one to his score, allowing the game to proceed, or
                    declaring the end null and void. But if a stone bo played before the mistake has
                    been discovered, the head must be finished as if it had been properly played
                    from the beginning.</p>
                <p>11. The sweeping shall be under the direction and control of the skips. The
                    player’s party may sweep the ice anywhere from the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n749/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0749-0714"/> centre line to the tee, and behind it,—the
                    adverse party having liberty to sweep behind the tee, and in front of any of
                    their own stones when moved by another, and till at rest. Skips to have full
                    liberty to clean and sweep the ice behind the tee at any time, except when a
                    player is being directed by his skip.</p>
                <p>12. If in sweeping or otherwise, a <hi rend="italic">running</hi> stone he marred
                    by any of the party to which it belongs, it may, at the option of the opposite
                    skip, be put off the ice; if by any of the adverse party, it may be placed where
                    the skip of the party to which it belongs shall direct. If otherwise marred, it
                    shall be replayed.</p>
                <p>13. Every player to be ready to play when his turn comes, and not to take more
                    than a reasonable time to play. Should he play a wrong stone, any of the players
                    may stop it while running; but if not stopped till at rest, the one which ought
                    to have been played shall be placed instead, to the satisfaction of the opposing
                    skip.</p>
                <p>14. No measuring of shots allowable previous to the termination of the end.
                    Disputed shots to be determined by the skips, or, if they disagree, by the
                    umpire, or, when there is no umpire, by some neutral person chosen by the skips.
                    All measurements to be taken from the centre of the tee, to that part of the
                    stone which is nearest it. No stone shall be considered without a circle, or
                    over a line, unless it clear it;—and in every case, this is to be determined by
                    placing a square on the ice, at the circle or line.</p>
                <p>15. Skips shall have the exclusive regulation and direction of the game for their
                    respective parties, and may play last stone, or in what part of it they please;
                    and, when their turn to play comes, they may name one of their party to take
                    charge for them.</p>
                <p>16. If any player shall speak to, taunt, or interrupt another, not being of his
                    own party, while in the act of delivering his stone, one shot shall be added to
                    the score of the party so interrupted.</p>
                <p>17. If from any change of weather after a match has been begun, or from any other
                    reasonable cause, one party shall desire to shorten the rink, or to change to
                    another one, and, if the two skips cannot agree, the umpire shall, after seeing
                    one end played, determine whether the rink shall be shortened, and how much or
                    whether it shall be changed, and his decision shall be final. (W. Μ ‘D. )</p>
