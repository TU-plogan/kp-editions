                    Greek κpvτrτω, I hide), a vault or subterranean chamber, especially under
                    churches. In classical phraseology “crypta” was employed for any vaulted
                    building, either paιtially or entirely below the level of the ground. It is used
                    for a sewer <hi rend="italic">(crypta</hi><hi rend="italic">Sulurae,</hi>
                    Juvenal, <hi rend="italic">Sat.</hi> v. 106); for the “carceres,” or vaulted
                    stalls for the horses and chariots in a circus (Sidon. Apoll., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cairn.</hi> xxiii. 319); for the close porticoes or arcades, more fully known
                    as “cryptoporticus,” attached by the Romans to their suburban villas for the
                    sake of coolness, and to the theatres as places of exercise or rehearsal for the
                    perfoιmers (Plin., <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> ii. 15, v. 6, vii. 21; Sueton.,
                    <hi rend="italic">Calig.</hi> 58; Sidon. A poll., lib. ii. epist. 2); and for
                    underground receptacles for agricultural produce (Vitruv, vi. 8, Varro <hi
                    rend="italic">de re Rust.</hi> i. 57). Tunnels, or galleries excavated in the
                    living rock, were also called <hi rend="italic">cryptae.</hi> Thus the tunnel to
                    the north of Naples, through which the road passes to Puteoli, familiar to
                    tourists as the “Grotto of Posilipo,” was originally designated <hi
                    rend="italic">crypta Neapolitana</hi> (Seneca, <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi>
                    57). In early Christian times <hi rend="italic">crypta</hi> was appropriately
                    employed for the galleries of a catacomb, or for the catacomb itself. Jerome
                    calls them by this name when describing his visits to th¢m as a schoolboy, and
                    the term is used by Prudentius <hi rend="smallcaps">(Catacombs).</hi></p>
                <p>A crypt, as a portion of a church, had its origin in the subterranean chapels
                    known as “confessiones,” erected around the tomb of a martyr, or the place of
                    his martyrdc m. This is the origin of the spacious crypts, some of which may be
                    called subterranean churches, of theRc man churches of St Prisca, St Prassede,
                    St Martino ai Monti, St Lorenzo ſuori le Mura, and above all of St Peter’s,—the
                    crypt being thus the germ of the church or basilica subsequently erected above
                    the hallowed spot. When the martyr’s tomb was sunk in the surface of the ground,
                    and not placed in a catacomb chapel, the original memorial-shrine would be only
                    partially below the surface, and consequently the part of the church erected
                    over it, which was always that containing the altar, would be elevatedsome
                    height above the ground, and be approached by flights of steps. This fashion of
                    raising the chancel cr altar end of a church on a crypt was widely imitated long
                    after the reason for adopting it ceased, and even where it never existed. The
                    crypt under the altar at the basilica of St Maria Maggiore in Rome is merely
                    imitative, and the same may be said of many of the crypts of our early churches
                    in England. The original Saxon cathedral of Canterbury had a crypt beneath the
                    eastern apse, containing the so-called body of St Dunstan, and other relics,
                    “fabricated,” according to Eadmer, “in the likeness of the confessionary of St
                    Peter at Rome” <hi rend="smallcaps">(Basilica).</hi> St Wilfrid constructed
                    crypts still existing beneath the churches erected by him at the latter part of
                    the 7th century at Hexham <pb break="no"

                    their similarity in form and arrangement to the catacomb chapels with which
                    Wilfrid must have become familiar during his residence in Rome. The cathedral,
                    begun by Aethelwold and finished by Elphege at Winchester, at the end of the
                    10th century, had spacious crypts “supporting the holy altar and the venerable
                    relics of the saints” (Wulstan, <hi rend="italic">Life of St Aethelwold),</hi>
                    and they appear to have been common in the earlier churches in England. The
                    arrangement was adopted by the Norman builders of the 11 th and 12th centuries,
                    and. though far from universal is found in many of the cathedrals of that date.
                    The object of the construction of these crypts was twofold,—to give the altar
                    sufficient elevation to enable those below to witness the sacred mysteries, and
                    to provide a place of burial for those holy men whose relics were the church’s
                    most precious possession. But the crypt was “a foreign fashion,” derived, as has
                    been said, from Rome, “which failed to take root in England, and indeed
                    elsewhere barely outlasted the Romanesque period” <hi rend="italic">(Essays on
                    Cathedrals,</hi> p. 331). Of the crypts beneath our Norman cathedrals, that
                    under the choir of Canterbury is by far the largest and most elaborate in its
                    arrangements. It is, in fact, a subterranean church of vast size and
                    considerable altitude, and in consequence of the elevation of the floor of the
                    upper church is scarcely, if at all, below the level of the soil, and is
                    therefore fairly well lighted. The whole crypt was dedicated to the Virgin Mary,
                    and contained two chapels especially dedicated to her,—the central one beneath
                    the high altar, enclosed with rich Gothic screenwork, and one under the south
                    transept. Thislatterchapel was appropriated by Queen Elizabeth to the use of the
                    French Huguenot refugees who had settled at Canterbury in the time of Edward VI.
                    There were also in this crypt a large number of altars and chapels of other
                    saints, some of whose hallowed bodies were buried here. At the extreme east end,
                    beneath the Trinity Chapel, the body of St Thomas (Becket) was buried the day
                    after his martyrdom, and lay there till his translation, July 7, 1220. The
                    cathedrals of Winchester, Worcester, and Gloucester have crypts of slightly
                    earlier date (they may all be placed between 1080 and 1100), but of similar
                    character, though less elaborate. They all contain piscinas and other evidences
                    of the existence of altars in considerable numbers. They are all apsidal. The
                    most picturesque is that of Worcester, the work of Bishop Wulstan (1084), which
                    is remarkable for the multiplicity of small pillars supporting its radiating
                    vaults. Instead of having the air of a sepul . chral vault like those of
                    Winchester and Gloucester, this crypt is, in Professor Willis’s words, “a
                    complex and beautiful temple.” Archbishop Roger’s crypt at York, belonging to
                    the next century (1154-1181), was filled up with earth when the present choir
                    was built at the end of the 14th century, and its existence forgotten till its
                    disinterment after the fire of 1829. The choir and presbytery at Rochester are
                    supported by an extensive crypt, of which the western portion is Gundulf’s work
                    (1076-1107), but the eastern part, which displays slender cylindrical and
                    octagonal shafts, with light vaulting springing from them, is of the same period
                    as the superstructure, the first years of the l3th century. This crypt, and that
                    beneath the Early English Lady Chapel at Hereford, are the latest of our
                    existing cathedral crypts. That at Hereford was rendered necessary by the fall
                    of the ground, and is an exceptional case. Later than any of these crypts was
                    that of St Paul’s, London. This was a really large and magnificent church of
                    Decorated date, with a vaulted roof of rich and intricate character resting on a
                    forest of clustered columns. Part of it served as the parish church of St Faith.
                    A still more exquisite work of the Decorated period is the crypt of St Stephen’s
                    chapel at Westminster, than which it is difficult to conceive anything more
                    perfect in design or mj- <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> e elaborate in
                    ornamentation. Having happily escaped the conflagration of the Houses of
                    Parliament in 1834—before which it was degraded to the purpose of the Speaker’s
                    state dining-room—it has been restored to its former sumptuous-néss of
                    decoration, and is now one of the most beautiful architectural gems in
                    England.</p>
                <p>Of Scottish cathedrals the only one that possesses a crypt is the cathedral of
                    Glasgow, rendered celebrated by Sir Walter Scott in his novel of <hi
                    rend="italic">Rob Roy</hi> (ch. xx.). At the supposed date of the tale,
                    and,indeed till a comparatively recent period, this crypt was used as a place of
                    worship by one of the three congregations among which the cathedral was
                    partitioned, and was known as “the Laigh or Barony Kirk.” It extends beneath the
                    choir transepts and chapter-house; in consequence of the steep declivity on
                    which the cathedral stands it is of unusual height and lightsomeness. It belongs
                    to the 13th century, its style corresponding to our Early English, and is simply
                    constructional, the building being adapted to the locality. In architectural
                    beauty it is quite unequalled by any crypt in the United Kingdom, and can hardly
                    anywhere be surpassed. It is an unusually rich example of the style, the
                    clustered piers and groining being exquisite in design and admirable in
                    execution. The bosses of the roof and capitals of the piers are very elaborate,
                    and the doors are much enriched with foliage. “There is a solidity in its
                    architecture, a richness Jn its vaulting, and a variety of perspective in the
                    spacing of its pillars, which make it one of the most perfect pieces of
                    architecture in these kingdoms” (Fergusson). The care that is taken of this
                    beautiful architectural gem, and the lavish outlay with which its windows have
                    been decorated with stained glass, are a gratifying proof that the citizens of
                    Glasgow fully appreciate the treasure they possess. In the centre of the main
                    alley stands the mutilated effigy of St Mungo, the patron saint of Glasgow, and
                    at the south-east corner is a well called after the same saint.</p>
                <p>Crypts under parish churches are not very uncommon in England, but they are
                    usually small and not characterized by any architectural beauty. A few of the
                    earlier'crypts, however, deserve notice. One of the earliest and most remarkable
                    is that of the church of Lastingham near Pickering in Yorkshire, on the site of
                    the monastery founded in 648 by Cedd, bishop of the East Anglians. The existing
                    crypt, though exceedingly rude in structure, is of considerably later date than
                    Bishop Cedd, forming part of the church erected by Abbot Stephen of Whitby in
                    1080, when he had been driven inland by the incursions of the northern pirates.
                    This crypt is remarkable from its extending under the nave as well as the
                    chancel of the upper church, the plan of which it accurately reproduces, with
                    the exception of the westernmost bay. It forms a nave with side aisles of three
                    bays, and an apsidal chancel, lighted by narrow deeply splayed slits. The roof
                    of quadripartite vaulting is supported by four very dwarf thick cylindrical
                    columns, the capitals of which and of the responds are clumsy imitations of
                    classical work with rude volutes. Still more curious is the crypt beneath the
                    chancel of the church of Repton in Derbyshire. This also consists of a centre
                    and side aisles, divided by three arches on either side. The architectural
                    character, however, is very different from that at Lastingham, and is in some
                    respects almost unique, the piers being slender, and some of them of a singular
                    spiral form, with a bead running in the sunken part of the spiral. Another very
                    extensive and curious Norman crypt is that beneath the chancel of St
                    Peter’s-inthe-East at Oxford. This is five bays in length, the quadripartite
                    vaulting being supported by eight low, somewhat slender, cylindrical columns
                    with capitals bearing grotesque animal and human subjects. Its dimensions are
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n702/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0702-0669"/> 36 by 20 feet and 10 feet in height. This crypt
                    has been commonly attributed to Grymboldt in the 9th century; but it is really
                    not very early Norman. Under the church of St Mary-le-Bow in London there is an
                    interesting Norman crypt not very dissimilar in character to that last
                    described. Of a later date is the remarkably fine Early English crypt groined in
                    stone, beneath the chancel of Hythe in Kent, containing a remarkable collection
                    of skulls and bones, the history of which is quite uncertain. There is also a
                    Decorated crypt beneath the chancel at Wimborne Minster, and one of the same
                    date beneath the southern chancel aisle at Grantham.</p>
                <p>Among the more remarkable French crypts may be mentioned those of the cathedrals
                    of Auxerre, said to date from the original foundation in 1085; of Bayeux,
                    attributed to Odo, bishop of that see, uterine brother of William the Conqueror,
                    where twelve columns with rude capitals support a vaulted roof <hi rend="italic"
                    >; of</hi> Chartres, running under the choir and its aisles, frequently assigned
                    to Bishop Fulbert in 1029, but more probably coeval with the superstructure; and
                    of Bourges, where the crypt is in the Pointed style, extending beneath the
                    choir. The church of the Holy Trinity attached to Queen Matilda’s foundation—the
                    “Abbaye aux Dames” at Caen—has a Norman crypt where the thirty-four pillars are
                    as closely set as those at Worcester. The church of St Eutropius at Saintes has
                    also a crypt of tho 11th century, of very large dimensions, which deserves
                    special notice; the capitals of the columns exhibit very curious carvings.
                    Earlier than any already mentioned is that of St Gervase of Rouen, considered by
                    Mr E. A. Freeman “the oldest ecclesiastical work to be seen north of the Alps.”
                    It is apsidal, and in its walls are layers of Roman brick. It is said to contain
                    the remains of two of the earliest apostles of Gaul—St Mellon and St
                    Avitianus.</p>
                <p>Space forbids our particularizing the numerous crypts of Germany. One at
                    Göttingen may be mentioned, where cylindrical shafts with capitals of singular
                    design support “vaulting of great elegance and lightness” (Fergusson), the
                    curves being those of a horseshoe arch. The crypts of the cathedrals or churches
                    at Halberstadt, Hildersheim, and Naumburg, also deserve to be noticed; that of
                    Lubeck may be rather called a lower choir. It is 20 feet high and vaulted.</p>
                <p>The Italian crypts, when found, as a rule reproduce tho “confessio” of the
                    primitive churches. That beneath the chancel of St Michele at Pavia is an
                    excellent typical example, probably dating from the 10th century. It is apsidal
                    and vaulted, and is seven bays in length. That at St Zeno at Verona (c. 1138) is
                    still more remarkable; its vaulted roof is upborne by forty columns, with
                    curiously carved capitals. It is approached from the west by a double flight of
                    steps, and contains many ancient monuments. St Miniato at Florence, begun in
                    1013, has a very spacious crypt at the east end, forming virtually a second
                    choir. It is seven bays in length and vaulted. The most remarkable crypt in
                    Italy, however, is perhaps that of St Mark’s, Venice. The plan of this is almost
                    a Greek cross. Four rows of nine columns each run from end to end, and two rows
                    of three each occupy the arms of the cross, supporting low stunted arches on
                    which rests the pavement of the church above. This also constitutes a lower
                    church, containing a <hi rend="italic">chorus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cantorum</hi> formed by a low stone screen, not unlike that of St Clement at
                    Rome (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Basilica,</hi> vol. iii. p. 417), inclosing a
                    massive stone altar with four low columns. This crypt is reasonably supposed to
                    belong to the church founded by the doge P. Orseolo in 977. There are also
                    crypts deserving notice at the cathedrals of Brescia, Fiesole, and Modena, and
                    the churches of St Ambrogio and St Eustorgio at Milan. The former was
                    unfortunately modernized by St Charles Borromeo. The crypt at Assisi is really a
                    second church at a lower level, and being built on the steep side of a hill is
                    well lighted. The whole fabric is a beautiful specimen of Italian Gothic, and
                    both the lower and upper churches are covered with rich frescoes. The crypts at
                    Rome have been already mentioned.</p>
                <p>Domestic crypts are of frequent occurrence. Mediaeval houses had as a rule their
                    chief rooms raised above the level of the ground upon vaulted substructures,
                    which were used as cellars and storerooms. These were sometimes partially
                    underground, sometimes entirely above it. The underground vaults often remain
                    when all the superstructure has been swept away, and from their Gothic character
                    are frequently mistaken for ecclesiastical buildings. All our older towns are
                    full of crypts of this character, now used as cellars. They occur in Oxford and
                    Rochester, are very abundant in the older parts of Bristol, and, according to Mr
                    Parker, “nearly the whole city of Chester is built upon a series of them with
                    the Rows or passages made on the top of the vaults” <hi rend="italic">(Domestic
                    Architecture,</hi> iii, p. 91). The crypt of Gerard’s Hall in London, destroyed
                    in the construction of New Cannon Street, figured by Mr Parker <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dorn. Arch.,</hi> ii. 185), was a very beautiful example of the lower story of
                    the residence of a wealthy merchant of the time of Edward I. It was divided down
                    the middle by a row of four slender cylindrical columns supporting a very
                    graceful vault. The finest example of a secular crypt now remaining in England
                    is that beneath the Guildhall of London. Th. date of this is early in the 15th
                    century, 1411. It is a large and lofty apartment, divided into four alleys by
                    two rows of clustered shafts supporting a rich lierne vault with ribs of
                    considerable intricacy. There is a fine vaulted crypt of the same date and of
                    similar character beneath St Mary’s Hall, the Guildhall of the city of Coventry.
