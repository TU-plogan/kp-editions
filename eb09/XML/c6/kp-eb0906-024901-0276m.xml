                    rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> No. 11; and in 1810 he joined the well-known
                    Taylor family in the little volume called the <hi rend="italic">Associate
                    Minstrels.</hi> From 1811, when his father retired, till 1819, he carried on the
                    business on his own account; but in the latter year he determined to adopt
                    literature as a profession, and thenceforward till his death his pen was never
                    idle. As editor of the <hi rend="italic">Eclectic Review,</hi> which had been
                    published under his name since 1814, he was regarded as the literary
                    representative of evangelical nonconformity; andin 1832 he became still more
                    publicly and completely associated with the interests of the party as the editor
                    of the newly established organ called the <hi rend="italic">Patriot.</hi>
                    Besides contributing voluminously to both these periodicals, he published work
                    after work on religious, political, and miscellaneous subjects; but in too many
                    cases these owed their origin merely to the necessity of producing something
                    that had a market value. That he frequently put forth mere paste and scissors
                    work he makes no shame to confess,—conscious that if his labour was somewhat
                    ignoble it was at least performed with scrupulous honesty. His whole literary
                    activity was influenced by his religious convictions, and it was not only as
                    editor of the <hi rend="italic">Eclectic</hi> that he endeavoured to “reconcile
                    those long divorced parties—religion and literature.” His most popular work was
                    his <hi rend="italic">Modern Traveller,</hi> a series of thirty volumes
                    descriptive of the various countries of the globe; but he will probably be
                    longest remembered as the author of a few hymns not unworthy to rank with the
                    best examples of nonconformist psalmody. He died on December 27, J 855. His life
                    has been written by his son, Eustace R. Conder.</p>

                    Nonconformity,</hi><hi rend="italic">2</hi> vols., 1818; <hi rend="italic">The
