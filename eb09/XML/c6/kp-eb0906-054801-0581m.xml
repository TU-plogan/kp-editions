                    (1489-1556), archbishop of Canterbury, was born at Aslacton in Nottinghamshire
                    on the 2d July 1489. The second son of Thomas Cranmer and of his wife Anne
                    Hatfield, he belonged to a family that had been settled in Nottinghamshire from
                    the time of the Norman Conquest. He received his early education, according to
                    Morice his secretary, from “a marvellous severe and cruel schoolmaster,” whose
                    discipline must have been severe indeed to deserve this special mention in an
                    age when no schoolmaster bore the rod in vain. The same authority tells us that
                    he was initiated by his father in those field sports, such as hunting and
                    hawking, which formed one of his recreations in after life. To early training he
                    also owed the skilful horsemanship for which he was conspicuous. At the age of
                    fourteen he was sent by his mother, who had recently become a widow, to
                    Cambridge, where he entered at Jesus College. Little is known with certainty of
                    his university career beyond the facts that he became a fellow of his college in
                    1510 or 1511, that he had soon after to vacate his fellowship, owing to his
                    marriage to “Black Joan,” a relative of the landlady of the Dolphin Inn, and
                    that he was reinstated in it on the death of his wife, which occurred in
                    childbirth before the lapse of the year of grace allowed by the statutes. During
                    the brief period of his married life he held the appointment of lecturer at
                    Buckingham Hall, now Magdalene College. The fact of his marrying would seem to
                    show that he did not at the time intend to enter the church, and there are
                    indications that the profession of his choice was the law. It has been
                    conjectured with some plausibility that tho death of his wife caused him to
                    change his intention and qualify himself for holy orders. He was ordained in
                    1523, and soon after he took his doctor’s degree in divinity. According to
                    Strype, he was invited about this time to become a fellow of the college founded
                    by Cardinal Wolsey at Oxford; but Dean Hook shows that there is some reason to
                    doubt this. If the offer was made it was declined, and Cranmer continued at
                    Cambridge filling the offices of lecturer in divinity at his own college and of
                    public examiner in divinity to the university. It is interesting, in view of his
                    later efforts to spread the knowledge of the Bible among the people, to know
                    that in tho capacity of examiner he insisted on a thorough acquaintance with the
                    Holy Scriptures, and rejected several candidates who were deficient in this
                    qualification.</p>
                <p>It was a somewhat curious concurrence of circumstances that transferred Cranmer,
                    almost at one step, from the quiet seclusion of the university to the din and
                    bustle of the court. In 1528 the plague known as the sweating sickness, which
                    prevailed throughout the country, was specially severe at Cambridge, and all who
                    had it in their power forsook the town for the country. Cranmer went with two of
                    his pupils named Cressy, related to him through their mother, to their father’s
                    house at Waltham in Essex. The king (Henry VIII.) happened at the time to be
                    residing in the immediate neighbourhood, and two of his chief counsellors,
                    Gardyuer, secretary of starte, afterwards bishop of Winchester, and Fox. the
                    lord high almoner, afterwards bishop of Hereford, were lodged at Cressy’s house.
                    Meeting with Cranmer, they were naturally led to discuss what was the absorbing
                    question of the day, the king’s meditated divorce from Catherine of Aragon. The
                    opinion of the future archbishop was given with the modesty that befitted an
                    unknown man. He professed not to have studied the cause as the others had done;
                    but it seemed to him that if the canonists and the universities should decide
                    that marriage with a deceased brother’s widow was illegal, and if it were proved
                    that Catherine had been married to Prince Arthur, her marriage to Henry could be
                    declared null and void by the ordinary ecclesiastical courts. The necessity of
                    an appeal to Rome was thus dispensed with, and this point was at once seen by
                    the king, who, when Cranmer’s opinion was reported to him, ordered him to be
                    summoned in these terms :—“I will speak to him. Let him be sent for out of hand.
                    This man, I trow, has got the right sow by the ear.”</p>
                <p>At their first interview Cranmer was commanded by the king to lay aside all other
                    pursuits and to devote himself to the question of the divorce. He was to draw up
                    a written treatise, stating the course he proposed, and defending it by
                    arguments from scripture, the fathers, and the decrees of general councils.
                    There is reason to believe that he entered upon the task somewhat reluctantly,
                    but in the reign of Henry VIII. it was emphatically true that the king’s will
                    was law, and no refusal was possible. His material interests certainly did not
                    suffer by compliance. He was commended to the hospitality of Anne Boleyn’s
                    father, the earl of Wiltshire, in whose house at Durham Place he resided for
                    some time; the king appointed him archdeacon of Taunton and one of his
                    chaplains; and he also held a parochial benefice, the name of which is unknown.
                    When the treatise was finished Cranmer was called upon to defend its argument
                    before the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which he visited, accompanied
                    by Fox and Gardyner. Immediately afterwards he was sent to plead the cause
                    before a more powerful if not a higher tribunal. An embassy, with the earl of
                    Wiltshire at its head, was despatched to Rome in 1530, that “the matter of the
                    divorce should be disputed and ventilated,” and Cranmer was an important member
                    of it. He was received by the Pope with marked courtesy, and was appointed
                    “Grand Penitentiary of England;” but his argument, if he ever had the
                    opportunity of stating it, did not lead to any practical decision of the
                    question. Returning home through France and Germany, he had interviews in the
                    latter country with the elector of Saxony and other Protestant princes.</p>
                <p>It is usual to attribute to the influence of this Continental visit a further
                    recoil in Cranmer’s mind from Roman Catholicism and an advance to what is now
                    known as Protestantism. Now there are, it is true, indications that he was
                    dissatisfied with much that he saw at Rome, and it is a probable conjecture that
                    his intercourse with the German princes had some effect in modifying his
                    doctrinal views. But it must be remembered that the modern idea of Protestantism
                    and Roman Catholicism as two broadly marked, clearly divided, and antagonistic
                    systems was only forming in Germany, and was all but unknown in England in
                    Cranmer’s day. It would be unnecessary to state so obvious a truth, were it not
                    for the seemingly ineradicable tendency of hasty thinkers to throw back familiar
                    distinctions in religion and politics to a period when suc∙lι distinctions had
                    not come into existence. The fact that Cranmer is persistently described as the
                    “first Protestant archbishop of Canterbury,” which, if true at all, is true only
                    in a very modified sense, shows the necessity for this caution.</p>
                <p>Cranmer had only been a few months in England when he received a second
                    commission from the king appointing him “Conciliarius Regius et ad Caesarem
                    Orator.” In the summer of 1531 he accordingly proceeded to Germany as sole
                    ambassador to the emperor, with the design of furthering <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n582/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0582-0549"/> the divorce. His mission was fruitless, but he
                    did not at once return to England. At Nuremberg he had become acquainted with
                    Osiander, whose somewhat isolated theological position he probably found to be
                    in many points analogous to his own. Both were convinced that the old order must
                    change; neither saw clearly what the new order should be to which it was to give
                    place. They had frequent interviews, which had doubtless an important influence
                    on Cranmer’s opinions. But Osiander’s house had another attraction of a
                    different kind from theological sympathy. His niece Margaret won the heart of
                    Cranmer, and early in 1532 they were married. In the case of a strong character
                    like Luther, marriage implied an express practical rejection of the authority of
                    Rome to impose celibacy upon priests; no such inference can safely be made in
                    the case of Cranmer, whose character was weak and whose action was generally
                    determined by the influences of the moment. Hook finds in the fact of the
                    marriage corroboration of Cranmer’s statement that he never expected or desired
                    the primacy; and it seems probable enough that, if he had foreseen how soon tha
                    primacy was to be forced upon him, he would have avoided a disqualification
                    which it was difficult to conceal and dangerous to disclose.</p>
                <p>Expected or not, the primacy was forced upon him within a very few months of his
                    marriage. In August 1532 Archbishop Warham died, and the king almost immediately
                    afterwards intimated to Cranmer, who was still in Germany, his nomination to the
                    vacant see. Cranmer’s conduct was certainly consistent with his profession that
                    he did not desire, as he had not expected, the dangerous promotion. He sent his
                    wife to England, but delayed his own return in the vain hope that another
                    appointment might be made. How long he ventured to wait is uncertain, but when
                    he arrived in England he found the arrangements matured for his consecration,
                    his nolo episcopari” being unavailing against the king’s command. The papal
                    bulls of confirmation were dated February and March 1533, and the consecration
                    took place on the 30th March. One peculiarity of the ceremony has occasioned
                    considerable discussion. It was the custom for the archbishop elect to take two
                    oaths, the first of episcopal allegiance to tha Pope, and the second in
                    recognition of the royal supremacy. The latter was so wide in its scope that it
                    might fairly be held to supersede the former in so far as the two were
                    inconsistent. Cranmer, however, was not satisfied with this. He had a special
                    protest recorded, in which he formally declared that he swore allegiance to the
                    Pope only in so far as that was consistent with his supreme duty to the king.
                    The morality of this course has been much canvassed, though it seems really to
                    involve nothing more than an express declaration of what the two oaths implied.
                    It was the course that would readily suggest itself to a man of timid nature who
                    wished to secure himself against such a fate as Wolsey’s. It showed weakness,
                    but it added nothing to whatever immorality there might be in successively
                    taking two incompatible caths.</p>
                <p>In the last as in the first step of Cranmer’s promotion Henry had been actuated
                    by one and the same motive. The business of the divorce had now become very
                    urgent, and in tha new archbishop he had an agent who might be expected to
                    forward it with the needful haste. The celerity and skill with which Cranmer did
                    the work intrusted to him must have fully satisfied his master. During the first
                    week of April Convocation sat almost from day to day to determine questions of
                    fact and law in relation to Catherine’s marriage with Henry as affected by her
                    previous marriage with his brother Arthur. Decisions favourable to the object of
                    the king were given on these questions, though even the despotism of the most
                    despotic of the Tudors failed to secure absolute unanimity. The next step was
                    taken by Cranmer, who wrote a letter to the king, praying to be allowed to
                    remove the anxiety of loyal subjects as to a possible case of disputed
                    succession, by finally determining the validity of the marriage in his
                    archiépiscopal court. There is evidence that the request was prompted by the
                    king, and his consent was given as a matter of course. Queen Catherine was
                    residing at Ampthill in Bedfordshire, and to suit her convenience the court was
                    held at the priory of Dunstable in the immediate neighbourhood. Declining to
                    appear she was declared contumacious, and on the 23d May the archbishop gave
                    judgment declaring the marriage null and void from the first, and so leaving the
                    king free to marry whom he pleased. In the whole proceeding, which had as much
                    of the form as it had little of the spirit of justice, the archbishop’s
                    subserviency was pitiful, and it is difficult to acquit him of the graver charge
                    of knowingly pronouncing an unrighteous sentence.</p>
                <p>The coronation of the new queen, Anne Boleyn, at which Cranmer officiated, took
                    place on the lst June, little m*□re than a week after the sentence which
                    deprived her predecessor of her rights. During that interval it is asserted by
                    some authorities that the king and Anne were publicly married by the archbishop.
                    This, however, seems unlikely. A private marriage had taken place in the
                    previous November, or more probably in January. Hook conjectures that the later
                    ceremony was not a repetition of the marriage, but merely an official and public
                    recognition of it.</p>
                <p>The splendid pageantry of the coronation made the marriage popular for a few days
                    with the citizens of London, but a deeper current of feeling in the opposite
                    direction soon set in. The deliberate judgment of the country was undoubtedly
                    one of indignant disapproval, and it speedily found utterance through the
                    pulpit—the chief organ of public opinion in the days when there was no press. So
                    outspoken were the preachers in their denunciation of the king’s conduct that it
                    was deemed necessary to silence them by an arbitrary exercise of authority.
                    Cranmer’s very first act of episcopal jurisdiction was to prohibit all preaching
                    within his own diocese, and to arrange for its restriction by the other bishops
                    of his province. His conduct in this can, of course, only be fairly judged by
                    the standard of his own time, but the forcible suppression of all preaching was
                    a curiously inconsistent measure to be adopted, even from motives of political
                    urgency, by the “first Protestant archbishop of Canterbury.”</p>
                <p>Cranmer was little at court during the three years of Anne Boleyn’s ascendency
                    there. The period was eventful, and he found abundant occupation in his
                    ecclesiastical and parliamentary duties. He was an active promoter of the
                    measures which led to the final breach with Rome. These included the appointment
                    of bishops by the king alone without bulls or licences from the Pope, tho
                    prohibition of the payment of Peter’s pence or other contributions to Rome, and
                    the renunciation by the archbishop of the title of legate. The independence of
                    the Church of England was finally asserted by the two Houses of Convocation in
                    the declaration that “the bishop of Rome has no greater jurisdiction given him
                    in this realm of England than any other foreign bishop,” and this statement may
                    be held to embody the general result of Cranmer’s ecclesiastical policy as shown
                    in the details just mentioned. It is to be noted to his credit that he pled for
                    More and Fisher even after he had failed to persuade them to admit the royal
                    supremacy.</p>
                <p>Cranmer’s share in the divorce of Anne Boleyn in 1536 is perhaps less obscure
                    than most things connected with that very mysterious transaction. When the king
                    had made up his mind, the archbishop was summoned from <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n583/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0583-0550"/> Kent to Lambeth, where he was kept a virtual
                    prisoner until he had indicated that he would be compliant. In a letter to Henry
                    he pled generously for the queen, but the plea was robbed of whatever force it
                    might have had by a closing sentence in which he stated his willingness to obey
                    the king’s commands. The proceedings were gone through with the same
                    hypocritical show of judicial formality as in the case of Queen Catherine, and
                    on the 10th June 1536 the archbishop fulfilled his promise of obedience by
                    declaring the marriage he had himself sanctioned to have been null and void from
                    the first. It is urged in his favour that before doing so he had received from
                    Anne a confession of some impediment existing before her marriage with the king
                    which rendered the marriage invalid, but it does not appear in what the
                    impediment consisted, and the plea can scarcely be accepted. Even if it could,
                    few would be inclined to question the judgment of Hook that “of Cranmer’s
                    conduct in the affair the less that his admirers say, the greater will be their
                    discretion.” And this was not the last time in Henry’s reign that the archbishop
                    stooped to act the same degrading part. In 1540 he presided over the Convocation
                    that disannulled tho marriage with Anne of Cleves, which he had celebrated
                    almost immediately before. To his next an 1 last interposition in the
                    matrimonial affairs of the king no discredit attaches itself. When he was made
                    cognizant of the charges against Catherine Howard, his duty to communicate them
                    to the king was obvious, though painful; and his choice of the time and manner
                    of his fulfilling it was both delicate to his royal master and considerate to
                    the accused.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Cranmer was actively carrying out the policy which has associated his
                    name more closely, perhaps, than that of any other ecclesiastic with the
                    Reformation in England. Its most important feature on the theological as
                    distinct from the political side was the endeavour to promote the circulation of
                    the Bible in the vernacular, by encouraging translation and procuring an order
                    in 1538 that a copy of the Bible in English should be set up in every church in
                    a convenient place for reading, Only second in importance to this was the
                    re-adjustment of the creed and liturgy of the church, which formed Cranmer’s
                    principal work during the latter half of his life. The progress of the
                    archbishop’s opinion towards that middle Protestantism, if it may be so called,
                    which he did so much to impress on the formularies of the Church of England, was
                    gradual, as a brief enumeration of the successive steps in that progress will
                    show. In 1535 he corrected a second' edition of the book known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">King's Primer,</hi> the original composition of which has been
                    attributed to him, and which was in several points Protestant in doctrine. In
                    1538 au embassy of German divines visited England with the design, among other
                    things, of forming a common confession for the two countries. This proved
                    impracticable, but the frequent conferences Cranmer had with the theologians
                    composing the embassy had doubtless a great influence in modifying his views. He
                    had not strength of conviction enough, however, to oppose out and out the
                    reactionary statute of 1538, known as the Six Articles, or “whip with the six
                    strings.” Foxe and others following him have indeed asserted that he did so, but
                    Hook shows that the archbishop was present at the first and second readings of
                    the bill, and also when it received the royal assent, while the only method of
                    opposing it was to have absented himself. No doubt ho had and urged strong
                    objections to it, but these must have been overcome in the end by the arguments
                    or the authority of the king. During the period between 1540 and 1543 the
                    archbishop was engaged at the head of a commission in the revision of the
                    “Bishop’s Book,” or <hi rend="italic">Institution of a Christian Man,</hi> and
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Necessary Erudition,</hi> known as the
                    “King’s Book,” which was a modification of the former work in the direction of
                    Roman Catholic doctrine. In 1543 was issued his translation of the Litany, which
                    was substantially the same as that now in use, and shows his mastery of a
                    rhythmical English style. In 1547 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Homilies</hi>
                    prepared under his direction. Four of them are attributed to the archbishop
                    himself—those on Salvation, Faith, Good Works, and tho Reading of Scripture. His
                    translation of the German Catechism of Justus Jonas, known as Cranmer’s
                    Catechism, appeared in the following year. Important, as showing his views on a
                    cardinal doctrine, was the <hi rend="italic">Defence of the True and Catholic
                    Doctrine of the Sacrament,</hi> which he published in 1550. It was immediately
                    answered from the side of the “old learning” by Gardyner. From these and other
                    works which need not be mentioned it is not difficult to fix Cranmer’s
                    theological position. It may be best described in general terms as that of the
                    historical High Church party in the Church of England, of which indeed Cranmer
                    may be regarded as one of the chief founders. Transubstantiation was the
                    discriminating doctrine between Romanists and Protestants in England, just as
                    justification by faith was the discriminating doctrine in Germany; and it is to
                    be noted that Cranmer did not renounce the dogma until after the death of Henry
                    VIII. Ultimately, after much thought and controversy, he rested content with the
                    acceptance of the fact of real presence apart from any theory, whether of
                    transubstantiation or consubstantiation; and this course has proved satisfactory
                    to the most eminent theologians of his school in the Church of England down to
                    the present day. If it be added that, on the questions on which they differ from
                    the Roman see, he would have found himself in substantial harmony with the Old
                    Catholics of Germany, his views of ecclesiastical polity will be understood by
                    most readers.</p>
                <p>In what may be called the external work of the English Reformation, Cranmer’s
                    part was secondary, the principal agent being naturally Cromwell. The
                    dissolution of the monasteries was the work of the minister, not of the
                    archbishop; but the latter showed a laudable zeal in trying to secure as much as
                    possible of the confiscated monastic property for the benefit of religion and
                    learning. Although the relations of Cranmer with Cromwell had never been very
                    intimate, he was generous enough to intercede for the minister after his fall in
                    June 1540. But with his usual weakness he did not persist in his intercession
                    after he saw that the king was determined. In fact he was present in Parliament
                    when the bill of attainder was read, and so consented to it.</p>
                <p>The course taken by Cranmer in promoting the Reformation exposed him to the
                    bitter hostility of the reactionary party or “men of the old learning,” of whom
                    Gardyner and Bonner were leaders, and on two occasions— in 1543 and 1545
                    —conspiracies were formed in the council to effect his overthrow. The king,
                    however, remained true to him, and both conspiracies signally failed. It
                    illustrates a favourable trait in the archbishop’s character that he forgave all
                    the conspirators, though he might doubtless have secured their punishment
                    through his influence with the king. He was, as his secretary Morice testifies,
                    “a man that delighted not in revenging.”</p>
                <p>Cranmer was present with Henry VIII. when he died (1547), and did his duty as
                    spiritual adviser faithfully and kindly. By the will of the king he was
                    nominated head of a council of regency composed of sixteen persons, but ho
                    acquiesced in the arrangement by which Somerset became lord protector. He
                    officiated at the coronation of the boy king Edward VI., and instituted a
                    significant change in the order of the ceremony, by wſhich the right of the
                    monarch to reign was made to appear to depend upon inheritance alone, w ithout
                    the concurrent consent of the people. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n584/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0584-0551"/> fact deserves mention, as there are other
                    indications that the archbishop was a firm believer in the doctrine of the
                    “divine right.”</p>
                <p>During this reign the work of the Reformation made rapid progress, the sympathies
                    both of the protector and of the young king being decidedly Protestant. Cranmer
                    was therefore enabled without let or hindrance to complete the preparation of
                    the church formularies, on which he had been for some time engaged. The first
                    prayer-book of Edward VI. was finished in November 1548, and received legal
                    sanction in January 1549; the second was completed and sanctioned in April 1552.
                    The archbishop presided over the commissions that compiled them, and much of the
                    work was done by himself personally. The forty-two articles of Edward VI.
                    published in 1553 were based upon a German source, but they owe their form and
                    style almost entirely to the hand of Cranmer. The last great undertaking in
                    which he was employed was the revision of his codification of the canon law,
                    which had been all but completed before the death of Henry. The task was one
                    eminently well suited to his powers, and the execution of it was marked by great
                    skill in definition and arrangement, It never received any authoritative
                    sanction, Edward VI. dying before the proclamation establishing it could be
                    made, and it remained unpublished until 1571, when a Latin translation by Dr
                    Walter Haddon and Sir John Cheke appeared under the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reformatio Legum Ecclesiasticarum.</hi> That it was never authorized is matter
                    for satisfaction in view of the fact that it laid down the lawfulness and
                    necessity of persecution to the death for heresy in the most absolute terms.
                    That Cranmer in this matter practised what he preached, his conduct in the cases
                    of Frith, Hewat, and others sufficiently testifies. If, however, he was a
                    persecutor both in theory and practice, it must be remembered that no one of any
                    party in his day had grasped the principle of religious toleration.</p>
                <p>Cranmer stood by the dying bed of Edward as he had stood by that of his father,
                    and he there suffered himself to be persuaded to take a step against his own
                    convictions which may be said to have sealed his doom. He had pledged himself to
                    respect the testamentary disposition of Henry VIII. by which the succession
                    devolved upon Mary, and now he violated his oath by signing Edward’s “device” of
                    the crown to Lady Jane Grey. On grounds of policy and morality alike the act was
                    quite indefensible; but it is perhaps some palliation of his perjury that it was
                    committed to satisfy the last urgent wish of a dying man, and that he alone
                    remained true to the “twelfth day queen,” when the others who had with him
                    signed Edward’s device deserted her. On the accession of Mary he was summoned to
                    the council, reprimanded for his conduct, and ordered to confine himself to his
                    palace at Lambeth until the queen’s pleasure was known. With a firmness unusual
                    to his character he refused to follow the advice of his friends and avoid the
                    fate that was clearly impending over him by flight to the Continent, Any chance
                    of safety that lay in the friendliness of a strong party in the council was more
                    than nullified by the bitter personal enmity of the queen. On the 14th September
                    1553 he was sent to the Tower, where Ridley and Latimer were also confined. The
                    immediate occasion of his imprisonment was a strongly worded declaration he had
                    written a few days previously against the mass, the celebration of which, he
                    heard, had been re-established at Canterbury. He had not taken steps to publish
                    this, but by some unknown channel a copy reached the council, and it could not
                    be ignored. In March 1554 he and his two illustrious fellow-prisoners were
                    removed to Oxford, where they were confinedin the Bocardo or common prison.
                    Ridley and Latimer were unflinching, and suffered bravely at the stake on the
                    16th October 1555; it was fated that Cranmer was to reach the same end by a
                    longer and less honourable path. It is impossible to give all the details of the
                    intricate process against him, which at first involved the double charge of
                    treason and heresy. Against the former of these he emphatically protested, and
                    it was on the latter alone that he was ultimately condemned. The pontifical
                    authority having been restored in England his case was tried by a Papal
                    commission. At his first appearance before the court he protested against the
                    jurisdiction of the bishop of Rome, both by a formal declaration and by the
                    significant action of putting on his hat and standing upright before the Pope’s
                    commissioner, the bishop of Gloucester, after having bowed respectfully to the
                    representative of the queen. On the expiration of eighty days from the issue of
                    a summons to Rome, which of course it was not in his power to obey even had he
                    been willing, he was excommunicated by a Papal consistory, and a commission was
                    sent to England to degrade him from his office of archbishop. This was done with
                    the usual humiliating ceremonies in Christ Church, Oxford, on the 14th February
                    1556, and he was then handed over to the secular power. But before the secular
                    power did its last and worst, Cranmer was to inflict upon himself a degradation
                    deeper far than any that could be inflicted on him from without. The story of
                    his recantations is so notorious as to be known to many who know almost nothing
                    else of his life. Under the pressure of delusive promises by various agents, '
                    whose conduct cannot be too strongly condemned, he was induced to sign no less
                    than six of these, each ampler and more abject in its terms than that which had
                    gone before. The last was dated the 18th March. On the 20th Dr Cole, the provost
                    of Eton, visited Cranmer in his prison with the view of ascertaining whether he
                    remained steadfast in his new purpose, and he received what seemed a
                    satisfactory answer. Next day, Saturday, the 21st March, he was taken to St
                    Mary’s Church, and asked to repeat his recantation in the hearing of the people
                    as he had promised. To the surprise of all he declared with dignity and emphasis
                    that what he had recently done troubled him more than anything he ever didor
                    said in his whole life; that he renounced and refused all his recantations as
                    things written with his hand, contrary to the truth which he thought in his
                    heart; and that as his hand had offended, his hand should be first burned when
                    he came to the fire. If, as Hook is inclined to think, he made this statement in
                    the belief that his life would be spared if he persisted in his recantation, he
                    seems all but entitled to the crown of martyrdom <hi rend="italic">; if,</hi> as
                    Macaulay maintains, he made it after learning that he w as to die in any case,
                    and that a lie would therefore serve him as little as the truth, then, as
                    Macaulay says, he was no more a martyr than Dr Dodd. The question is important,
                    but there are no materials for settling it definitely.</p>
                <p>Immediately after his unexpected declaration he was led to the stake at the same
                    place where Ridley and Latimer had suffered a few months before. As he had said,
                    his right hand w as steadfastly exposed to the flames, and several times during
                    the burning he was heard to exclaim with a loud voice, “This hand hath
                    offended—this unworthy hand.” The calm cheerfulness and resolution with which he
                    met his fate show that he felt that he had cleared his conscience, and that his
                    recantation of his recantations was a repentance that needed not to be repented
                    of.</p>
                <p>It was a noble end to what, in spite of its besetting sin of infirmity of moral
                    purpose, was a not ignoble life. He was often pitiably, sometimes criminally,
                    weak, and never so much both as in his last days. The key to his character is
                    well given in what Hooper said of him in a letter to Bullinger, that he was “too
                    fearful about what might <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n585/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0585-0552"/> happen to him.” This weakness macle him the tool
                    of Henry in the most scandalous transactions of his reign, and the tool of
                    Edward in what he knew to be an unjust alteration of the succession, aiîd it
                    robs him of his undisputed claim to rank among the noble army of martyrs. But
                    while one may not admit that claim, there is a grandeur in the circumstances of
                    his death, and especially in the incident of the voluntary burning of the right
                    hand, which the popular instinct has not failed to appreciate as all but
                    redeeming him from disgrace. It is only, however, a hero in life who can be in
                    the true sense a martyr in death; and the archbishop was as little the one as
                    tho other. And so it is that brave old Latimer wears the crown, while the timid
                    Cranmer passed through the same fiery gates into the city without the martyr’s
                    glory, though also without the apostate’s shame.</p>
