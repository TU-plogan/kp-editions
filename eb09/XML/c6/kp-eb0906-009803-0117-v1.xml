                    (1712-1794), justly celebrated for having written one of the most exquisite of
                    Scottish ballads, the “Flowers of the Forest,”<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There are two versions of this song,—the
                            one by Mrs Cockburn, the other by Miss Jean Elliot of Minto. Both were
                            founded on the remains of an ancient Border ballad. It is believed by
                            the descendants of her family that Mrs Cockburn composed her
                            version—that beginning “I’ve seen the smiling of fortune
                            beguiling”—before her marriage in 1’31. Anyhow, it was composed many
                            years before Jean Elliot’s sister verses, beginning, “I’ve heard them
                            lilting at our ewe-milking.” These were written in 1756, and printed
                            soon afterwards. Mrs Cockburn’s song, however, was not published until
                            1765, when Jean Elliot's was already popular.</p></note> w as the
                    daughter of a border laird, Robert Rutherfurd of Fairnalee, and was bom in the
                    heart of the Southern Highlands in the autumn of 1712. Her education was slight.
                    She spent her youth in rambling and riding about the countryside, and in paying
                    visits to an aged minister iu the neighbourhood, of whose “heavenly affection”
                    for her she wrote enthusiastically in after years. She was a graceful dancer,
                    spent two winter seasons in Edinburgh, and was one of the Edinburgh belles of
                    her time. Different causes have been assigned for the composition of the
                    “Flowers of the Forest.” Mr Chambers states that it was written on the occasion
                    of a great commercial disaster which ruined the fortunes of some Selkirkshire
                    lairds. Her later biographers, however, think it more probable that it was
                    written on the departure to London of a certain John Aikman, between whom and
                    Alison there appears to have been an early attachment. In 1731 Alison Rutherfurd
                    was married to Patrick Cockburn of Ormiston, one of a family of stanch Whigs and
                    Presbyterians, and an advocate at the Scottish bar. After her marriage she knew
                    all the intellectual and aristocratic celebrities of her day. In the memorable
                    year 1745 she vented herWhiggism in a squib upon Prince Charlie, and narrowly
                    escaped being taken by the Highland guard as she was driving through Edinburgh
                    in the family coach of the Keiths of Ravelston, with the parody in her pocket
                    Mrs Cockburn was an indefatigable letter-writer and a composer of parodies,
                    squibs, toasts, and “character-sketches”·—then a favourite form of
                    composition—like other wits of her day; but the “Flowers of the Forest” is the
                    only thing she wrote that possesses great literary merit. She survived her
                    husband forty-one years, living to the age of eighty-two, and to the last she
                    maintained her social popularity. At her house on Castle-hill, and afterwards in
                    Crighton Street, she received many illustrious friends, among whom were
                    Mackenzie, Robertson, Hume, Home, Monboddo, the Keiths of Ravelston, the
                    Balcarres family, and Lady Anne Barnard, the authoress of “Auld Robin Gray.” She
                    was in Edinburgh when Dr Johnson visited that city, towed thither by the
                    triomphant Boswell. She saw and commented upon Burns’s short, bright Edinburgh
                    career. As a Rπtherfurd she w as a connection of Sir Walter Scott’s mother, and

                    written by Mrs Cockburn in 1777, describing the precocious conduct of little
                    Walter Scott, then scarcely six years old, during a visit which she paid to his
                    mother. It was Mrs Cockburn also who wrote the character-sketch of Scott’s
                    father, which, when it was given as a toast, was so true as to be immediately
                    recognized. Scott himself spent pleasant evenings at Mrs Cockburn’s house when
                    she was a very old lady and he a young advocate. Mrs Cockburn died in 1794,
                    having survived her only child, Captain Adam Cockburn, fourteen years.</p>
