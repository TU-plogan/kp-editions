                    wives, had a son by his concubine Zoe, his attempt to legitimize his wife and
                    his son was inflexibly resisted by the Patriarch Nicholas, and his will was only
                    carried out at the expense of excommunication. These circumstances were probably
                    the reason why the name <hi rend="italic">Porplιyrogenitus,</hi> “born in the
                    purple,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in the purple chamber in which the
                    empresses were confined, was, while applicable to all the emperors, emphatically
                    applied to Constantine VII. When Constantine was only six years old Leo died,
                    leaving him under the guardianship of his uncle Alexander; but Alexander also
                    died in the next year; and Romanus Lecapenus, the chief admiral, supported by
                    Zoe, was appointed colleague to Constantine, and held all real power till 944,
                    when he was forced by his sons to entera monastery.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile Constantine, though powerless, had been well treated, and had married
                    Helena, the daughter of Romanus. On the deposition of his colleague, the people
                    gave willing aid to Constantine’s cause; and having banished his
                    brothcrs-in-law, he became emperor in reality. Though wanting in strength of
                    will, Constantine had intelligence and many other good qualities, and his reign
                    on the whole was not unsatisfactory. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Greek
                    Empire.)</hi> He was poisoned by his son Romanus in 959. Constantine was a
                    painter and a patron of art, a literary man and a patron of literature; and
                    herein consists his real importance. Unable as he was to sift out the really
                    important from the unimportant, and the credible from the incredible, it is yet
                    from his pages that we gain the only knowledge of any extent which we possess of
                    his time. He is the author of several works of considerable size :—1. ∏∈pi <hi
                    rend="italic">τωv θeμfiτωv,</hi> an account of the provinces <hi rend="italic"
                    >(themata)</hi> of the empire; 2. <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Administrando Imperio,</hi> an account of the condition of the empire, and an
                    exposition of the author’s view of government, written for the use of his son
                    Romanus; it also contains most valuable information as to the condition and
                    history of various foreign nations with which the Eastern empire had been
                    brought into connection,—as tho Arabs, Iberians, Armenians, and the tribes north
                    of tho Danube—the Russians, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Chazars, and Patzinacitae;
                    3. <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> Eκ0∈σιs rýs <hi rend="italic">βaσιXeiov</hi>
                    τ&lt;⅛∈ως, which describes the customs of tho Eastern Church and court; 4. A
                    life of Basilius I., his grandfather; 5. Two treatises on warfare, of which his
                    father Leo was perhaps part or sole author. The Γ∈ωτroiΙκ&lt;z, a treatise on
                    agriculture with which his namo is connected, is generally supposed to have been
                    executed at his command by Bassus Cassianus; and under his patronage many other
                    works— including collections of the ancient historians (of which fragments are
                    extant), lives of saints, and treatises on medicine—were compiled. Several Latin
                    translations of the works of Constantine have been made, and his complete works
                    were published at Leyden, 1617, and Paris, 1711.</p>
