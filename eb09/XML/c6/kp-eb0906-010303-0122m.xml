                    well-known speciesof <hi rend="italic">Gadidae,</hi> a family of Anacauthine
                    Fishes, possessing, in common with the other members of the genus, three dorsal
                    and two anal fins, and a single barbel at the chin. It is a widely distributed
                    species, being found throughout the northern and temperate seas of Europe, Asia,
                    and America, extending as far south as Gibraltar, but not entering the
                    Mediterranean, and inhabits water from 25 to 59 fathoms deep, where it always
                    feeds close to the bottom. It is exceedingly voracious, feeding on the smaller
                    denizens of the ocean—fish, crustaceans, worms, and mollusks, and greedily
                    taking almost any bait the fisherman chooses to employ. The cod spawns in
                    February, and is exceedingly prolific, the roe of a single female having been
                    known to contain upwards of eight millions of ova, and to form more than half
                    the weight of the entire fish. Only a small proportion of these get fertilized,
                    and still fewer ever emerge from the egg. The number of cod is still further
                    reduced by the trade carried on in roe, large quantities of which are used in
                    France as ground-bait in the sardine fishery, while it also forms an article of
                    human food. The young are about an inch in length by the end of spring, but are
                    not fit for the market till the second year, and it has been stated thut <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0123-0104"/> they do not reach maturity, as shown by the power
                    of reproduction, till the end of their third year. They usually measure about 3
                    feet in length, and weigh from 12 to 20 lb, but specimens have been taken from
                    50 to 70 lb in weight. As an article of food the cod-fish is in gre west
                    perfection during the three months preceding Christmas. It is caught on all
                    parts of the British and Irish coasts· but the Dogger Bank, and Rockall, off the
                    Outer Hebrides, have been specially noted for their cod-fisheries. Until
                    recently, the London market was in great part supplied from the former of these;
                    but now the fishery is chiefly carried on along the coast of Norfolk and
                    Suffolk, where great quantities of the fish are caught with hook and line, and
                    conveyed to market alive in “well-boats” specially built for this traffic. Such
                    boats have been in use since the beginning of the 18th century. The most
                    important codfishery iu the world is that which has been prosecuted for
                    centuries on the Newfoundland banks, where it is not uncommon for a single
                    fisherman to take over 500 of these fish in 10 or 11 hours. The fish have lately
                    been decreasing in that well-worn locality, but that the yield is still enormous
                    is seen from recently published returns, from which it appears that the quantity
                    of cod obtained by the Canadian fishery alone in 1875 weighed over 31,000 tons,
                    while in 1874 it reached 31,500 tons. These, salted and dried, are exported to
                    all parts of the world, and form, when taken in connection with the enormous
                    quantity of fresh cod consumed, a valuable addition to the food resources of the
                    human race. The swimming bladder of this fish furnishes isinglass, little, if at
                    all, inferior to that obtained from the sturgeon, while from the liver is
                    obtained cod-liver oil, now lιrgely used in medicine as a remedy in scrofulous
                    complaints and pulmonary consumption. “The Norwegians,” says Cuvier, “give cod
                    heads with marine plants to their cows for the purpose of producing a greater
                    proportion of milk. The vertebrae, the ribs, and the bones iu general, are given
                    to their cattle by the Icelanders, and by the Kamtchatdιles to their dogs. These
                    same parts, properly dried, are also employed as fuel in the desolate steppes of
                    the Icy Sea.” At Port Logan in Wigtonshire cod-fish are kept in a large
                    reservoir, scooped out of the solid rock by the action of the sea, egress from
                    which is prevented by a barrier of stones, which does not prevent the free
                    access of the water. These cod are fed chiefly on mussels, and when the keeper
                    approaches to feed them they may be seen rising to the surface in hundreds and
                    eagerly seeking the edge. They have become comparatively tame and familiar.
                    Frank Buckland, who some years ago visited the place, states that after a little
                    while they allowed him to take hold of them, scratch them on the back, and play
                    with them in various ways. Their flavour is considered superior to that of the
                    cod taken in the open sea.</p>
