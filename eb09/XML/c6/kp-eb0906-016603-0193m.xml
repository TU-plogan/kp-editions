                    manhood as a factor in Spain, with which country his family was long connected
                    commercially, and whence, by means of a trade in wines and oil, great part of
                    his own vast fortune was to come. On his return he seems to have settled in
                    London, and to have bent himself resolutely to the task of making money. In
                    1681, the date of his father’s decease, he appears as a governor of Christ’s
                    Hospital, to which noble foundation he afterwards gave frequently and largely.
                    In the same year be probably began to take an active interest in the affairs of
                    Bristol, where he is found about this time embarked in a sugar refinery; and
                    during the remainder of his life he seems to have divided his attention pretty
                    equally between the city of his birth and that of his adoption. In 1682 he
                    appears in the records of the great western port as advancing a sum of £1800 to
                    its needy corporation; in 1683 as “a free burgess and <hi rend="italic"
                    >meire</hi> (St Kitts) merchant” he was made a member of the Merchant’s Hall;
                    and in 1684 he was appointed one of a committee for managing the affairs of
                    Clifton. In 1685 he again appears as the city’s creditor for about £2000,
                    repayment of which he is found insisting on in 1686. In 1689 he was chosen
                    auditor by the Vestry at Mortlake, where he was residing in an old house once
                    the abode of lieton and Cromwell. In 1691, on St Michael’s Hill, Bristol, at a
                    cost of £8000, he founded an almshouse for the reception of 24 poor men and
                    women, and endowed with accommodation for “Six Saylors,” at a cost of £600, the
                    Merchant’s Almshouses in King Street. In 1696, at a cost of £8000, he endowed a
                    foundation for clothing and teaching 40 boys (the books employed w ere to have
                    in them “no tincture of Whiggism ”); and six years afterwards he expended a
                    further sum of £1500 in rebuilding the schoolhouse. In 1708, at a cost of
                    £41,200, he built and endowed his great foundation on Saint Augustine’s Back,
                    for the instruction, clothing, maintaining, and apprenticing of 100 boys; and in
                    time of scarcity, during this and next year, he transmitted “by a private hand”
                    some £20,000 to the London committee. In 1710, after a poll of ſour days, he was
                    sent to Parliament, to represent, on strictest Tory principles, his native city
                    of Bristol; andin 1713, after three years of silent political life, he resigned
                    this charge. He died in 1721, having nearly completed his eighty-fifth year; his
                    remains were conveyed, with all the funereal magnificence his own solemn
                    fastidiousness could suggest, from his house at Mortlake to Bristol, where he
                    was buried in All Saints’ Church. Colston, who was in the habit of bestowing
                    large sums yearly for the release of poor debtors and the relief of indigent age
                    and sickness, and who gave (1711) no less than £6000 to increase Queen Anne’s
                    Bounty Fund for the augmentation of small livings, was always keenly interested
                    in the organization and management of his foundations; the rules and regulations
                    were all drawn up by his hand, and the minutest details of their constitution
                    and economy were dictated by him. A high churchman and Tory, with a genuine
                    intolerance of dissent and dissenters, his name and example have served as
                    excuses for the formation of several politic benevolent societies—the “Anchor,”
                    the “Dolphin,” the “Grateful,”— whose rivalry has been perhaps as instrumental
                    in keeping their patron’s memory green as have the splendid charities with which
                    he enriched his native city. See Garrard, <hi rend="italic">Edward Colston,
