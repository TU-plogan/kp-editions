                    degree of Μ.A. in 1639, was soon after chosen fellow, and became so eminent as a
                    tutor as to have at one time twenty-eight pup <hi rend="superscript">;</hi> ls.
                    He was next presented to the rectory of North Cadbury in his native county,
                    andin 1642 he published a <hi rend="italic">Discourse concerning the true Notion
                    of the Lord’s Supper,</hi> and a treatise entitled, <hi rend="italic">The Union
                    of Christ and the Church, in a Shadow.</hi> In 1644 he took the degree of B.D.,
                    and in the same year was chosen master of Clare Hall. In the following year he
                    was appointed professor of Hebrew, and for some time devoted himself with
                    special zeal to the study of Jewish antiquities. Two years after (March 31,
                    1647) he preached before the House of Commons on 1 John ii. 3, 4, and his
                    discourse on this occasion was published along with another sermon following out
                    the theme. For some time it appeared as if the insufficiency of his income would
                    force him to leave Cambridge, but this loss to the university was averted by his
                    appointment to the mastership of Christ’s College in 1654. He was one of the
                    persons named by a committee of Parliament in 1657 for the revision of the
                    English translation of the Bible. Through his intimacy with Tlιurloe, the
                    secretary of state for Cromwell and his son Richard, he was confidentially
                    consulted on various occasions by the Protectors in regard to university and
                    Government appointments. In 1659 we find him engaged with discourses in defence
                    of Christianity against Judaism. Like so many others, hα published Latin verses
                    on the restoration of King Charles II. in 1660. He was presented to the rectory
                    of Ashwell in Herefordshire in 1662, and installed prebendary of Gloucester in
                    1678. He had a design in 1665 to publish a treatise concerning moral good and
                    evil, and as he had been encouraged to do so by Dr Henry More, the latter’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Enchiridion</hi><hi rend="italic">Ethicum,</hi> appears to have
                    almost occasioned a rupture of friendly relations between them. Cudworth’s <hi
                    rend="italic">magnum opus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">True Intellectual System
                    of the Universe, wherein all the Reason and Philosophy of Atheism is refuted,
                    and its Impossibility demonstrated,</hi> appeared in 1678. This marvellously
                    learned work, bulky as it is, is merely a fragment, the first of three
                    parts,—the <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Eternal and Immutable Morality,</hi>
                    published in 1731 by Bishop Chandler, and a <hi rend="italic">Discourse on
                    Liberty and Necessity,</hi> belonging to tho same whole. Its publication had
                    been delayed for seven years, owing to the opposition of some parties at court,
                    probably admirers of Hobbes. It was flatteringly received in the learned world,
                    but offended the narrowly orthodox as well as the sceptics against whom it was
                    written. Some persons were even so thoughtless or malicious as to construe the
                    candour with which its author stated the arguments of atheists as a device to
                    lead his readers to believe that the atheist bad the best of the reasoning. If
                    Warburton may be credited, misrepresentations of this kind deterred Cudworth, a
                    peaceable man, averse to theological polemics, from publishing the rest of his
                    work. He died at Cambridge on the 26th of June 1688, and was buried in the
                    chapel of Christ’s College. He left behind him a daughter, Damaris, a lady of
                    considerable genius, known, under the name of Lady Masham, as the intimate and
                    valued friend of John Locke. Several of Cudworth’s MSS. are preserved in the
                    British Museum. It is not to the national credit that, with the exception of <hi
                    rend="italic">A Treatise of Freewill,</hi> edited by the Rev. Mr Allen in 1838,
                    they have not only not been published, but no adequate account or summary has
                    been given of them.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">True Intellectual System,</hi> to justify its general title
                    and fulfil its author’s plan, should have contained two other parts, each on the
                    same scale as the part which we possess. There appeared to Cudworth to be three
                    systems which deny liberty and involve necessity,—three sorts of fatalism. The
                    first is materialistic fatalism, which suppresses with the idea of liberty every
                    idea of God and spirit, and explains all phenomena, even those of thought and
                    feeling, by mechanical laws, and the formation of all beings by the combination
                    and concourse of atoms; the second is a theological or religious fatalism,
                    advocated by various scholastic and later divines, which makes good and evil,
                    right and wrong, the creation of the will of God, and thus destroys liberty by
                    destroying its condition and its law; and the third is Stoical fatalism, which,
                    although not denying the Divine existence or the rectitude of the Divine nature,
                    affirms that all that happens is determined by an eternal and unchangeable
                    necessity. These are the three chief false systems of the universe, according to
                    Cudworth, and he would oppose to them three great principles, the fundamentals
                    or essentials of religion —to the first the existence of God and of a spiritual
                    world; to the second, the eternal and immutable distinction of right and wrong;
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n723/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0723-0690"/> and to the third the freedom and responsibility
                    of man. The proof of these three truths with the refutation of the opposite
                    errors seemed to him to be the establishment of a system of the universe
                    entitled to be called, in opposition to those refuted, <hi rend="italic"
                    >true,</hi> and, in distinction from physical systems, like the Ptolemaic,
                    Tychonic, and Copernican, <hi rend="italic">intellectual.</hi> The first of
                    these forms of fatalism is the only one with which his principal work deals. It
                    includes four species of materialistic atheism, namely,—the atomic, adopted by
                    Democritus, Epicurus, and Hobbes, which recognizes no other substances than
                    material atoms and no other forces than their movements; the hylopathic,
                    maintained by Anaximander, which makes infinite matter, devoid of understanding
                    and life, form all things by “a secretion or segregation” which takes place
                    according to inherent law; the hylozoic, asserted by Strato of Lampsacus, which
                    explains everything by the supposition of an inward, selforganizing, plastic
                    life in matter; and the cosmoplastic, perhaps held by Seneca and the younger
                    Pliny, which represents the universe as an organized being, like a plant, with a
                    spontaneous and necessary but unconscious and un-reflective development. They
                    are, however, reducible to two—the atomic and hylozoic,—the one best represented
                    by Democritus, the other by Strato; the one explaining everything by matter and
                    movement, the other everything by matter endowed with life; the one mechanical,
                    the other dynamical.</p>
                <p>The history of the atomic philosophy is narrated by Cudworth at great length and
                    with vast erudition, but no one will now be found to accept the view which he
                    gives of its development as even in the main accurate. Like his friend, Henry
                    More, he derives the atomic theory, in so far as it is a purely physical
                    speculation, from Moses, and his conclusions as to its transmission are in many
                    respects not less untrustworthy. He would make it out to have been taught by
                    Pythagoras, Empedocles, and, in fact, nearly all the ancient philosophers, and
                    only to have been mutilated and perverted by Leucippus and Democritus. He had
                    the merit, however, of seeing very clearly that the atomic theory in itself, or
                    what he calls the atomic physiology, had no natural or even necessary connection
                    with the atomic atheism. He contends that “so far from being either the mother
                    or nurse of atheism, or any ways favourable thereto (as is vulgarly supposed),
                    it is indeed the most opposite to it of any, and the greatest defence against
                    the same.” He States with great fulness and fairness the arguments which have
                    been urged in support both of the atomic and hylozoic atheism. He refutes them,
                    although in a cumbrous and discursive manner, with 'great strength of reason. It
                    is in connection with the refutation of hylozoic atheism that he brings forward
                    the celebrated hypothesis, which he held in common with More, of a plastic
                    nature,—a substance intermediate between matter and spirit,—a power which
                    prosecutes certain ends but not freely or intelligently,:—an instrument by which
                    laws are able to act without the immediate agency of God. He argues that to
                    refer the life and motion of the universe immediately to God renders Divine
                    Providence “operose, solicitous, and distractions,” implies that all things are
                    done miraculously and none of them by an inward principle of their own, and is
                    inconsistent with the slow and gradual development of nature and with its
                    “errors and bungles.” It is not wonderful that few should have been convinced by
                    such arguments. Nothing can be toilsome to omnipotence or perplexing to
                    omniscience. It is not more difficult to believe the life and motions of the
                    universe due to the immediate action of God than the life and motions of the
                    secondary agent which Cudworth imagined to animate nature and “drudgingly to
                    execute a part of the work of Providence.” An unconscious and “necessitated
                    plastic power” cannot remove from the creator of it the blame of any “errors or
                    bungles” it may commit. Cudworth’s hypothesis became in 1703-4 the subject of an
                    interesting controversy between Bayle and Leclerc,—the former maintaining, and
                    the latter denying, that it was favourable to the atheistical inference. It has
                    been recently reproduced by Joseph John Murphy in his work on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Habit and Intelligence.</hi> What Cudworth designated “plastic nature” is
                    almost identical with what Murphy calls “unconscious intelligence.” It was
                    descended from the <hi rend="italic">anima</hi><hi rend="italic">mundi</hi> of
                    Plato, and is still represented in the <hi rend="italic">Unbewusste</hi> of Von
                    Hartmann.</p>
                <p>After the three chapters which describe and refute atomic and hylozoic atheism,
                    there comes a fourth which “swells,” as Cudworth himself says, “into a
                    disproportionate bigness.” Its aim is to prove that the belief in one supreme
                    God has been generally entertained even throughout the pagan world; that only a
                    few men, darkened in mind and depraved in heart, have discarded and denied it;
                    and that polytheism was the worship of many gods subordinate to the One God, of
                    the One God under many names, and of the One God and subordinate gods in images
                    and symbols, but not the exclusion of the worship of “one sovereign and
                    omnipotent Deity from which all their other gods were generated or created.”
                    Nowhere does our author show more learning nor more elevation and breadth of
                    thought than in the survey of religions which this discussion involves. He
                    carefully searches in the heathen religions which he reviews for features of
                    truth, traces of the presence of God, evidences of His having never left himself
                    without a witness in human hearts. At the same time, his reasoning is, on the
                    whole, far from satisfactory. It is at many points perverted by the unconscious
                    desire to establish a foregone conclusion; and the testimonies brought forward
                    have as often meanings imposed on them as educed from them. The lengthened
                    discussion of the Platonic and Christian Trinities contained in this chapter
                    gave great dissatisfaction to various persons. Cudworth was accused by some, in
                    consequence of it, with being a Tritheist, and by others of being an Arian. He
                    could not possibly be both; he undoubtedly meant to be neither. He wished to be
                    orthodox, and believed that he was so. He erred chiefly by representing Plato as
                    having come far nearer to the Christian doctrine than he really did.</p>
                <p>What is of most interest, perhaps, in the last chapter is the attempt at a
                    positive demonstration of the existence of God. This, he explains, cannot be
                    accomplished <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> as if from anything antecedent to
                    the Divine existence, but may nevertheless be necessarily inferred from
                    undeniable principles of reason. He refutes the assertion of Descartes that we
                    can be certain of nothing, not even of mathematical reasoning and truth, till
                    certain that there is a God, good and holy, who cannot and will not deceive us.
                    He shows that although this hypothesis bears a resemblance of piety it really
                    leads to universal scepticism. He then adduces three metaphysical proofs of the
                    Divine existence. The first is substantially that of Anselm and Descartes, drawn
                    from the idea of an absolutely perfect being. Cudworth modifies it, however, in
                    the same way which Leibnitz soon afterwards also did. He does not, that is to
                    say, conclude at once the Divine existence from the idea of a perfect being, but
                    shows before doing so that this idea is accordant with reason, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> involves in it no contradiction. The second proof, instead of thus
                    proceeding from the idea of perfection to that of necessary existence, proceeds
                    from the idea of existence to that of perfection. Theists and atheists,
                    materialists and spiritualists, agree that something certainly existed of itself
                    from all eternity. They differ only as to whether that something be a perfect or
                    an imperfect Being. But that which existed from all eternity must have done so
                    naturally and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n724/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0724-0691"/> necessarily, including necessary and eternal
                    self-existence in its own nature. There is nothing, however, it is argued, which
                    contains necessary eternal existence in its own nature or essence, but only an
                    absolutely perfect Being,— all imperfect things being in their nature
                    contingently possible, either to be or not to be. Hence a perfect Being, or God,
                    existed of himself from eternity. The third argument is founded on the very
                    nature of knowledge. It is that knowledge is possible only through ideas which
                    must have their source in an eternal reason. Sense is not only not the whole of
                    knowledge, but is in itself not at all knowledge; it is wholly relative and
                    individual, and not knowledge until the mind adds to it what is absolute and
                    universal. Knowledge does not begin with what is individual but with what is
                    universal. The individual is known by being brought under a universal instead of
                    the universal being gathered from a multitude of individuals. And these
                    universals, <hi rend="italic">voýµsna,</hi> or i aeas, which underlie all the
                    knowledge of all men, which originate it, and do not originate in it, have
                    existed eternally in the only mode in which truths can be said to be eternal, in
                    an eternal mind. They come to us from an Eternal Mind, which is their proper
                    home, and of which human reason is an emanation. “From whence it cometh to pass,
                    that all minds, in the several places and ages of the world, have ideas or
                    notions of things exactly alike, and truths indivisibly the same. Truths are not
                    multiplied by the diversity of minds that apprehend them; because they are all
                    but ectypal participations of one and the same original or archetypal mind and
                    truth. As the same face may be reflected in several glasses, and the image of
                    the same sun may be in a thousand eyes at once beholding it, and one and the
                    same voice may be in a thousand ears listening to it, so when innumerable
                    created minds have the same ideas of things, and understand the same truths, it
                    is but one and the same eternal light that is reflected in them all (‘ that
                    light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world ’), or the same
                    voice of that one everlasting Word, that is never silent, re-echoed by them.” In
                    different forms and with different references this argument is to be found in
                    Plato, Augustine, Aquinas, Malebranche, Bossuet, Fenelon, Cousin, and
                    Ferrier.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Treatise concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality</hi>
                    deals with the second form of fatalism. Over against the assertion that <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> moral good and evil π arbitrary and factitious, not by
                    nature but by law, there is placed the directly contradictory proposition,
                    nothing is morally good or evil by mere will without nature. Whatever is at all
                    must be what it is not by will but by nature. Omnipotence itself cannot set
                    aside this condition, cannot do what is contradictory; and contradictory it is
                    that things should be what they are not, should be indifferently anything,
                    either this or that, round or square, white or black, according to mere will and
                    pleasure. And “things may as well be made white or black by mere will without
                    whiteness or blackness, equal and unequal without equality and inequality, as
                    morally good and evil, just and unjust, honest and dishonest, by mere will,
                    without any nature of goodness, justice, honesty.” The existence of merely
                    positive duties,— the fact that certain commands carry with them an obligatory
                    force, and that it iα often wrong to do a thing which has been forbidden
                    although it would have been otherwise quite legitimate,—is argued to be no
                    exception to this truth, since in all such cases the obligation springs not from
                    mere will but from a deeper source, from an underlying natural justice or
                    equity, which is the true foundation both of the right in a superior to command
                    and of obligation in an inferior to obey. Cudworth is thus led to dis criminate
                    precisely natural from positive right. Things naturally good are those which the
                    reason obliges us to immediately, absolutely, and perpetually, and on no
                    condition of any voluntary act that may be done or omitted intervening; things
                    positively good are those which the reason obliges to only through the
                    intervention of some such act bringing them under some rule of natural justice.
                    But even the things which thus pass from being indifferent to being positively
                    right or wrong are strictly speaking only brought into a new relation to us, and
                    have not a new nature bestowed on themselves. They remain in themselves what
                    they were,—indifferent, neither good nor evil. And any moral character which may
                    be ascribed to the doing of them consists not in what is done, but in a regard
                    to the natural right which dictates fidelity to engagements and submission to
                    just authorities. Will thus carries with it no creative moral force,—as mere
                    will, indeed, no moral force whatever. Cudworth completes his proof of this
                    position by a refutation of the opinion that rectitude, although not dependent
                    on the will of the creature, depends on the mere wi∏ of the Creator. He argues
                    that it represents what is really a contradiction to be the object of divine
                    power. He further insists that there is in God a wisdom superior to His will and
                    a goodness superior to His wisdom; that the perfection of will is to be thus
                    twice determined, first by wisdom and then by goodness, first by truth and then
                    by righteousness. That moral distinctions are arbitrary, grounded not in reality
                    but in will, Cudworth saw was the necessary consequence of a belief that all
                    cognizable distinctions are arbitrary, that all being and knowledge are
                    relative, having no real existence in themselves but only an existence of
                    appearance relative to something else. He perceived with perfect clearness that
                    unless there is an absolute in knowledge there can be no absolute in morals. The
                    larger portion of his treatise is, in consequence, an examination into the
                    nature of sense and knowledge, designed to prove that sense is not knowledge;
                    that sense is a confused perception obtruded on the soul from without, whereas
                    knowledge is an inw’ard native energy of the mind, not arising from things
                    acting from without; that even simple corporeal things, passively perceived by
                    sense, are known or understood only by the active power of the mind; that some
                    ideas of the mind proceed not from outward sensible things, but arise from the
                    inward activity of the mind itself; that the intelligible notions of things,
                    though existing only in the mind, are not figments of tho mind, but have an
                    immutable nature; that science or knowledge is the only firm thing in the
                    universe. Among the ideas not drawn from sense but imposed by reason on
                    particular acts, Cudworth places the conceptions of moral good and evil. These,
                    like other noemata, are necessary, eternal, and immutable. They are not created
                    by reason but essential to reason. Reason does not find them, but brings them
                    with it. Reason, however, and not sense or feeling of any kind, is their
                    organon. Sense apprehends in the imperfect way it does only through the working
                    of reason; feeling is ever varying and individual. Sense is altogether blind to
                    whatever partakes of the necessary; feeling is in no direct contact with what
                    really and absolutely is. Adam Smith and many others have pronounced this
                    conclusion absurd and unintelligible, without attending to the circumstance that
                    Cudworth has at least endeavoured, and laboriously endeavoured, to show by his
                    examination of sense and knowledge that what is really altogether absurd and
                    unintelligible is that mere sense should give us any knowledge whatever,—that
                    sense should ever rise to the rank of perception until reason has brought its
                    object under some universal category.</p>
                <p>In the tractate on free-will he endeavours to establish that man possesses a
                    contingent or fortuitous liberty of self-determination when there is a perfect
                    equality of objects.</p>

                <p>He rests this conclusion on two arguments :—first, that otherwise were a ⅛econd
                    world created exactly like the present it would have an exactly similar history;
                    and, secondly, that otherwise the mind could make no choice in the many cases
                    where several objects precisely alike were presented to it. He sees clearly, at
                    the same time, that this power is not the free-will which is the condition of
                    praise and blame. In every conceivable case where two objects of choice
                    perfectly equal are presented to the mind, praise or blame for the preference of
                    the one to the other is unreasonable. It is only the preference of the better to
                    the worse that is praiseworthy; only the preference of the worse to the better
                    that is blameworthy. Accordingly he argues that man has also a power of
                    determining himself better or worse. In the prosecution of this argument he
                    finds it requisite to maintain that there are not two separate faculties in the
                    soul, the one confined to will and the other to understanding, but that there is
                    a soul which wills understandingly and understands willingly. Its first motive
                    principle is the desire of good in general. Its freewill is distinctive of a
                    rational imperfect being. A perfect being, essentially good and wise, cannot
                    have such a power, it being impossible it should ever improve, much less impair
                    itself. He endeavours to refute not only the arguments designed to show freedom
                    impossible, but those intended to prove it confined to Deity.</p>
                <p>Vast erudition was combined in Cudworth with remarkable speculative power. The
                    extent and obtrusiveness of his erudition and his discursiveness in
                    argumentation have caused him to get much less credit for philosophical ability
                    than he deserves. It is only the real student of his writings who can be
                    expected to recognize it; and, although he may be often consulted, he is
                    probably now seldom studied.</p>

                    In all respects the best view of Cudworth, as a man and a philosopher, is that
