                    province of Munster, bounded on the S. by the Atlantic, E. by Waterford and
                    Tipperary, N. by Limerick, and W. by Kerry. It is the largest county in Ireland,
                    and contains an area of 1,849,686 acres, or 2890 square miles. The outline of
                    the county is irregular; its sea margin is for the most part bold and rocky, and
                    is intersected by the Bays of Bantry, Dunmanus, and Roaring Water. The southern
                    part of the coast projects several headlands into the ocean, and its
                    south-eastern side is indented by Cork Harbour, and Ballycotton and Youghal
                    Bays.</p>
                <p>The surface of the country is undulating. It consists of low rounded ridges, with
                    corresponding valleys, running east and west, except in the western portion of
                    the count}', which is more mountainous. Those valleys are drained by the
                    Blackwater, the Lee, and the Bandon River. The most elevated part of the county
                    is in connection with the Boghra Mountains, the highest of which, Cahorbanaghor,
                    reaches 2239 feet. North of the Blackwater the county is <pb break="no"

                    plain which occupies a large part of the centre of Ireland. Of the principal
                    rivers the Blackwater has its source in the county of Limerick. The Lee
                    originates in Goughanbarra Lake, and the Bandon River rises in the Cullinagh
                    Lake. There are also some smaller streams which flow directly into the sea, the
                    more important of these being in the southwest portion of the county. No lakes
                    of any magnitude occur, the largest being Iuchigeelagh, which is an expansion of
                    the River Lee between Macroom and its source. Of the total area 14,368 acres are
                    covered with water. The scenery of the western parts of the county is bold and
                    rugged. In the central and eastern parts, especially in the valleys, it is green
                    and sheltered, and in some spots well wooded.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Minerals.—</hi> With reference to the geology of
                    the county, the hills are principally composed of Old Red Sandstone, which is
                    the lowest formation that occurs. In the western and mountainous districts these
                    rocks consist of purple and green-coloured sandstones and grits— “Glengarriff
                    grits”—which are several thousand feet thick. In the central and eastern
                    districts the same rocks occur in the form of brownish purple sandstone and
                    shales—∙ “brounstones.” The veins are highly contorted, and form anticlinal
                    axes, and they exhibit change in various degrees. They are locally extensively
                    used as building stones, and are usually split along their cleavage planes.
                    These Old Red Sandstones have afforded no traces of fossils in this county. Upon
                    the “brounstones,” the highest member of the Old Red Sandstones, the “Yellow
                    Sandstones” occur. They have a thickness of about 800 feet, and afford fossil
                    plants, shells, and crustaceans. To the Yellow Sandstone succeeds the base of
                    the Carboniferous group. These consist of black slaty rock—“Carboniferous
                    slabs.” In the eastern parts of the county these strata rise about 900 feet
                    thick ∙ westwards they increase greatly, being at the Old Head of Kinsale about
                    6500 feet in thickness. They have at their base grey gritty beds of varying
                    thickness—the “Coomhola grits.” Both members of the series are fossiliferous,
                    and the Carboniferous slates have been extensively worked in many localities for
                    roofing. They are, however, much inferior to the Bangor slates.</p>
                <p>The principal valleys in the county of Cork, except in the case of the Bandon
                    River, are in their lower parts occupied by Carboniferous limestone, overlying
                    the Carboniferous slate and occurring at synclinal troughs. The limestones are
                    commonly light grey in colour and of great thickness. For the most part they are
                    very pure carbonate of lime, thick-bedded and compact. Some are used as marbles,
                    but their most extensive application is as building stones, which are durable
                    and of good colour. In the neighbourhood of the city of Cork (Little Island),
                    near the centre of the synclinal trough, a brecciated red limestone is worked,
                    being polished as a marble. It is known as “Red Cork Marble.” In some localities
                    near the city of Cork the limestone is dolomitic, and is extensively quarried
                    for the manufacture of magnesia. Some portions of the limestones are very
                    fossiliferous. Near Mallow it is thin-bedded and contains nodules of schist.
                    Succeeding the limestone, which represents the scar limestone and Yoredale
                    series of England, are shales and flags, equivalents of the millstone grits, on
                    which lie the coal measures south of Kanturk. The coal is anthracitic, very
                    irregular in thickness, and highly inclined. The strata are much contorted and
                    crushed, the coal frequently occurring in “pockets.” Several seams are known,
                    some of which are worked. These coals have only a local sale, being used
                    principally for lime-burning.</p>
                <p>In the south-west part of the county igneous rocks are partially developed.
                    Copper pyrites was formerly extensively mined in the south-west of the county,
                    especially at Berehaven or Allihies,—the rocks more prolific in copper being the
                    Yellow Sandstone series. Little is now being done at those or other copper mines
                    in the county.</p>
                <p>Lead also occurs in small veins, but not in sufficient quantity to be worked.
                    Near Glandore manganese, mostly in the form of psilomelane, has been largely
                    worked, but is now abandoned.</p>
                <p>Clay which is used for brick-making occurs near Youghal, where there are
                    extensive potteries. Bricks are also made from the silty clay deposited by the
                    River Lee on small islands in the Douglas Channel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate is moist and warm, the prevailing
                    winds being from the west and southwest. The rainfall in the city is about 40
                    inches <hi rend="italic">per annum,—</hi> that of the whole county being
                    somewhat higher, about 44 inches. The mean average annual temperature is about
                    52° Fahr. The snow-fall during the winter is usually slight, and snow rarely
                    remains long on the ground except in sheltered places. The thermal spring of
                    Mallow was formerly in considerable repute; it is situated in a basin on the
                    banks of the Blackwater, rising from the base of a limestone hill. It has been
                    long celebrated for the cure of pulmonary, chlorotic, stomach, and urinary
                    complaints, in the cure of which its waters are said to be very efficacious. The
                    temperature of the water, 72° Fahr., is nearly invariable. The climate of Mallow
                    is soft and agreeable. The chief places for seabathing are Blackrock, Passage,
                    Monkstown, and Queenstown in the vicinity of Cork; Kinsale, Ballycotton, and
                    Youghal are also much frequented by invalids during the summer months.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fisheries.—</hi> The Kinsale fishery, now established about
                    fifteen years, promises to be the most remunerative of the industrial resources
                    of the south of Ireland. The mackerelfishery in 1875 commenced as usual about
                    the middle of March, and lasted to the second week in June, at which time over
                    £185,000 worth of fish was caught and purchased from the fishermen. In 1876
                    there were engaged in the trade 383 boats from Cornwall, the Isle of Man, Howth,
                    Arklow, and Kinsale, the proportion from the last-named place numbering 60.
                    There were also twenty-two hulks in the harbour used as icehouses, on the deck
                    of which the fish was packed for the English markets. Eight Norwegian barks
                    laden with ice arrived. These, with eleven steamers especially chartered for the
                    fish trade, fifteen Jersey trading cutters for conveying fish, and three Cork
                    tugs, comprised the staff of the local trade. The fishing boats are supplied
                    with trains of nets, 2^ miles in length and 8 feet in depth. They start early in
                    the morning for the fishing grounds, and at sunset let down the nets. They are
                    floated with small pieces of cork, and the bottom of the nets is sunk by heavy
                    ropes. They are allowed to drift all night, and the mackerel are caught by
                    running their heads into the meshes of the net. They are purchased by the
                    fish-buyers, packed in boxes containing 120 each, and immediately forwarded per
                    steamer to Bristol, Milford, and Holyhead, for Birmingham, London, Manchester,
                    and Liverpool. The fishery extends from Cape Clear nearly to Cork Harbour. Hake,
                    cod, and haddock, which were formerly taken in great abundance here, seem to
                    have in a great measure left the coast.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The soils of the county exhibit no great
                    variety. They may be reduced in number to four :—the calcareous in the limestone
                    districts; the deep mellow loams found in districts remote from limestone, and
                    generally occurring in the less elevated parts of the grey and red sandstone
                    districts; the light shallow soils, and the moorland or peat soils, the usual
                    substratum of which is coarse retentive clay.</p>
                <p>In a district of such extent and variety of surface, the state of agriculture
                    must be liable to much variation. The more populous parts near the sea, and in
                    the vicinity of <pb break="no"

                    favourable specimens of agricultural improvement.</p>
                <p>No advancement has recently been made in the extent of land placed under tillage,
                    and the principal crops raised are oats, potatoes, and turnips. In 1876 the
                    total area under tillage amounted to 430,541 acres, of which 157,365 were under
                    corn crops, 127,206 under green crops, and 145,370 grass under rotation. The
                    corn and green crops were thus distributed in the two years 1873 and 1876
                    respectively</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The county is divided into east and west
                    ridings (the county of the city is in the east riding); it is subdivided into 33
                    baronies, containing 251 parishes, which form the diocese of Cork, Cloyne, Ross,
                    and part of Ardfert. Since the disestablishment of the Irish Church, that body
                    has under the diocesan scheme reduced the number of parishes by amalgamation to
                    ninety-five.</p>
                <p>The Cork military district has barracks at Cork (headquarters), Kinsale, Fermoy,
                    Ballincollig, Queenstown, Spike Island, Camden and Carlisle Forts at the
                    entrance to the harbour (lately fortified with all the improvements of modern
                    science), Bandon, Youghal, and Buttevant. The constabulary force of the county
                    consists of 674 men in the east and west ridings, two inspectors, and seventeen
                    subinspectors; the officers have their headquarters at Cork and Bandon. The poor
                    law unions are Bandon, Bantry, Castletown, Clonakilty, Cork, Dunmanway, Fermoy,
                    Kanturk, Kinsale, Macroom, Mallow, Midleton, Millstreet, Mitchelstown,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The number of inhabitants in this county has
                    greatly decreased within the last thirty years. At the last census (1871) there
                    was a population of -517,076 persons (males, 256,062; females, 261,014); in 1861
                    it was 544,818 and in 1851, 649,308, showing a decrease between 1851 and 1871 of
                    about 20 per cent., while that of all Munster was 25 per cent. The estimated
                    population of the county for 1875 was 507,016. The principal towns are Cork,
                    population 102,526; Queenstown, 10,340; Fermoy, 7388; Kinsale, 7050; Bandon,
                    6131; Youghal, 6081; Mallow, 4165; Skibbereen, 3695; and Midleton, 3603.</p>
                <p>During the five years ending 18 5, the average number of emigrants per annum
                    amounted to 7110, and the total number from 1851 was 301,573, the largest
                    proportion of any Irish county. Of late years, however, the exodus has
                    considerably abated.</p>
                <p>The prevailing religion of the inhabitants is the Roman Catholic. In 1871 there
                    were 517,076 Catholics to 49,455 Protestants (40,493 Episcopalians, and 8962 of
                    various denominations)—the proportion of Protestants to the whole population
                    amounting to little more than 9⅛ per cent., while that of all Munster was
                    6⅜.</p>
                <p>The number of persons in 1871 of five years and upwards who could read and write
                    was 219,074; 49,091 could read but could not write, and 183,114 could neither
                    read nor write; 11,628 were returned as able to speak Erse only.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Representation.—</hi> Previous to the Union the county returned
                    twenty-six members to the Irish Parliament. At that time, however, the
                    representation was reduced to eight—two for the county, two for Cork city, and
                    one each for the boroughs of Mallow, Bandon, Youghal, and Kinsale.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> According to Ptolemy, the districts now known by
                    the names of the county of Cork and. Desmond were anciently inhabited by the
                    Coriondi, Udiae or Vodii, Velabori, and Uterni, which Dr Smith considers to be a
                    corruption of the name Iberi. Before the arrival of Strongbow Cork was a kingdom
                    of itself, governed by the MacCarthys; butin 1172 Dermod MacCarthy, who had
                    sworn fealty to Henry 11., threw off his allegiance, and attacked the English
                    under Raymond le Gros, thereby forfeiting the crown. What formed his kingdom was
                    granted by Henry II. to Robert Fitzstephen and Milo de Cogan, with the
                    exceptions of the city of Cork and the adjoining cantred belonging to the Ostmen
                    of the same city, which were retained by the king. It was made shire ground by
                    King John in 1210, who appointed sheriffs and other local officers for its
                    government. For many years, however, the royal writs were of little efficacy in
                    many parts of it, as the great families still virtually commanded the allegiance
                    of the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Fitzstephen’s share of the grant descended through the female line to the Barrys
                    and Roches, whilst that of De Cogan became vested in Maurice Fitzgerald, growing
                    into an extent of territory and consequent power far exceeding any ever
                    possessed by the MacCarthys. Whilst making a show of attachment to the English,
                    the Fitzgeralds intrigued with the foreign Roman Catholic powers (who projected
                    the conquest of Ireland during the reign of Queen Elizabeth), and ultimately
                    broke out into open rebellion. After being utterly defeated, Gerald, the
                    fifteenth and last earl of Desmond, when a fugitive in the wilds of Kerry, was
                    slain by an obscure individual named Kelly. Against this earl of Desmond an act
                    of attainder was passed in 1583, and the Fitzgeralds of Desmond, after having
                    maintained their power and possessions for upwards of 300 years, were reduced to
                    utter ruin; their strong castles were seized, and their vast estates, to the
                    extent of no less than 574,628 acres, confiscated by the Crown. These were again
                    transferred to English settlers, called undertakers or planters, who were bound
                    not to convey any part of the lands to the native Irish, or to intermarry with
                    or maintain any of them. Sir Walter Raleigh obtained 40,000 acres, which
                    afterwards passed to the family of Boyle, earl of Cork; Arthur Robins, 18,000;
                    Hugh Worth, 12,000; Fane Beecher, 12,000; Arthur Hyde, 12,000; Sir Warham St
                    Leger, 6000; Sir Thomas Norris, 6000; Hugh Cufie, 6000; Thomas Say, 5800; Sir
                    Richard Beacon, 1600; and Edmund Spenser, the poet, 3028. This attempt toset
                    aside or extirpate the native population failed. The Irish outbade the English
                    settlers, and were therefore, at least for a time, found to be more profitable
                    tenants, so that ultimately they re-occupied nearly all the lands as tenants
                    under the English undertakers. In 1602 a large portion of the estates of Sir
                    Walter Raleigh and Fane Beecher were purchased by the earl of Cork, who had them
                    colonized with English settlers; and by founding or rebuilding the towns of
                    Bandon, Clonakilty, Baltimore, Youghal, and afterwards those of Midleton,
                    Castlemartyr, Charleville, and Doneraile, which were incorporated and made
                    parliamentary boroughs, the family of Boyle became possessed of nearly the
                    entire political power of the county. In 1641 and the following years the sons
                    of the earl of Cork, more especially Lord Broghill, rendered good service to the
                    Parliamentary cause, and obtained considerable military renown. The course of
                    events led to the forfeiture of the estates of Lords Muskerry and Roche, and
                    afterwards of those ofthe earl of Clanearty, Viscount Kenmare, Sir Richard
                    Nagle, and others, to the extent of 250,000 acres. Since that period no events
                    of equal importance have occurred in this county.</p>

                    circles, druids’ altars, “raths" or circular mounds of earth, and stone pillars.
                    There are two so-called druids’ altars, the most perfect at Castleιnary near
                    Cloyne, and certain pillar stones scattered through the county, with straight
                    marks cut on the edges called Ogham inscriptions, the interpretation of which is
                    still a subject of much controversy·</p>
                <p>The remains of the old ecclesiastical buildings are in a very ruinous condition,
                    being used as burial-places by the county people. The principal is Kilcrea,
                    founded by Cormack Μ ‘Carthy about 1465, some of the tombs of whose descendants
                    are still in the chancel; the steeple is still nearly perfect, and
                    chapter-house, cloister, dormitory, and kitchen can be seen. Timoleague,
                    situated on a romantic spot on a rising ground at the extreιneend of
                    Courtmacsherry Bay, contains some tombs of interest, and is still in fair
                    condition. Buttevant Abbey contains some tombs of the Barrys and other
                    distinguished families. All these were the propertyofthe Franciscans. There
                    aretwo round towers in the county, one in a fine state of preservation opposite
                    Cloyne Cathedral, the other at Kinneigh. From the chapter seal of Ross, which is
                    dated 1661, and seems to have been a copy of a much earlier one, there is a good
                    representation of a round tower and stone roofed church, with St Fachnan, to
                    whom the church is dedicated, standing by, with a book in one hand and a cross
                    in the other. Of Mourne Abbey, near Mallow, once a preceptory of the Knights
                    Templars, and Tracton Abbey, which once sent a prior to Parliament, the very
                    ruins have perished.</p>
                <p>Of the castles, Lohort, built in the reign of king John, is by far the oldest,
                    and in its architectural features the most interesting; it is still quite
                    perfect and kept in excellent repair by the owner, the earl of Egmont. Blarney
                    Castle, built by Cormack M ’ Carthy about 1449, has a world-wide reputation, to
                    which Millikin's song, “The Groves of Blarney," in no small degree contributed;
                    it is also bound up with the civil history of the county and the war of the
                    great rebellion. Castles Mahon and Macroom have been incorporated into the
                    residences of the earls of Bandon and Bantry. The walls of Mallow Castle attest
                    its former strength and extent, as also the castle of Kilbolane. The castles of
                    Kilcrea and Dripsy are still in good condition. (R.C.)</p>

                    W. long. Until lately it ranked as the second city in Ireland, but of late
                    Belfast has far surpassed it in population, wealth, and commerce. The original
                    site of the city seems to have been located in the vicinity of the cathedral,
                    which was founded by St Fin-Barre about 622. In the 9th century this place w as
                    frequently pillaged by the Northmen or Danes. According to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annals of the Four Masters,</hi> a fleet burned Cork in 821; in 846 the Danes
                    appear to have been in possession of the city, for a hosting was made to
                    demolish their fortress; and in 1012 a great fleet of foreigners burned Cork.
                    The Danes then appear to have founded the new city on the banks of the River Lee
                    for the purpose of trade. The city was anciently surrounded with a wall, and we
                    find in the city council book an order for its reparation so late as the year
                    1748. In the beginning of the 18th century the ground on which the principal
                    part of the present city is built consisted of numerous islands intersected by
                    canals or connected by drawbridges, through which small vessels could pass at
                    high tide. The river now consists of the north and south branches. Both are
                    lined with fine quays of cut limestone, the north spanned by four and the south
                    by as many more bridges. The principal streets are St Patrick Street, Grand
                    Parade, South Mall, and Great George Street. There are 517 streets, roads,
                    lanes, and public passages in the borough, measuring 54¾ miles. St Patrick’s
                    Bridge is an elegant structure, commenced in 1859.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Churches.—</hi> There are eight Protestant parish churches,
                    including the cathedral. St Luke’s has lately been separated from St Ann de
                    Shandon. There are three Roman Catholic parish churches, and the church of St
                    Patrick. The Franciscan, Dominican, Augustinian, Carmelite, and St Vincent de
                    Paul orders have also their respective churches; there are besides three
                    convents and two monasteries. The’ principal church is the new Protestant
                    cathedral, the foundation stone of which was laid, 12th January 1865. It
                    succeeds a rather mean building, the foundation stone of which was laid in 1735
                    on the site of a very ancient cathedral which suffered during the siege of Cork
                    in September 1689-90. This building is in the Early French style, and when
                    completed will cost near £100,000. The tower and spires now being erected are
                    the gift of two merchant princes of Cork—Mr William Crawford and Mr Francis
                    Wise—and will cost £30,000. The entire cathedral is due to the indefatigable
                    exertions and munificence of Dr John Gregg, bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross The
                    other Protestant churches are extremely poor externally, except St Nicholas and
                    St Luke’s; the latter is a neat structure on the high ground north-east of the
                    city. The Roman Catholic cathedral is being restored to suit the fine Gothic
                    steeple which adjoins it. The other Roman Catholic churches, St Mary, St Peter
                    and Paul, St Patrick, Holy Trinity, and St Vincent de Paul are magnificent
                    structures, and rank amongst the finest modern ecclesiastical edifices in
                    Ireland. There are also the Presbyterian, a Baptist, an Independent, and two
                    Wesleyan Methodist places of worship, as well as a Friends’ meeting house.</p>

                    structure with a Corinthian portico about 30 feet in height. The Corn Exchange,
                    Savings Bank, Provincial Bank, and Bank of Ireland are handsome buildings of cut
                    limestone. The custom-house is built at the juncture of the two branches of the
                    River Lee, and commands the river. The Commercial Buildings, Chamber of

                    and hospitals have been established and supported by private benevolence for
                    almost every form of human suffering. The Cork District Lunatic Asylum occupies
                    a fine position on the brow of a hill in the western suburb. It contains a daily
                    average of 730 patients; the recoveries are computed at about 43 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 3 per cent. The Cork Union Workhouse contains a daily
                    average of 2000 inmates, about one-half of whom are daily under hospital
                    treatment. The buildings, out-offices, &amp;c., occupy about 18 acres of land;
                    the annual income from taxation is £40,000.</p>
                <p>The city water-works were erected under local Acts of 1852-56 at a cost of
                    £100,000. They supply the city with 5,000,000 gallons of water daily, also 625
                    hydrants and 166 public fountains; the extent of main pipes is 59 miles, of
                    service pipes, about 66. Since the passing of the Intramural Burial Act the
                    corporation of Cork has established a new cemetery (St Fin-Barre’s) about α mile
                    west of the city, at a cost of £12,000. It is already adorned with some handsome
                    and costly monuments. St Joseph’s cemetery, founded by Father Matthew in 1830 on
                    the site of the old Botanic Gardens of the Cork Institution, is also beautifully
                    planted and much used.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trade.—</hi> The Cork Butter Exchange may be considered as the
                    centre of the most important branch of manufacture not only in the county but in
                    the entire province of Munster. Stafford in his letters mentions the exportation
                    of corn and butter from Cork in 1633 to Spain. The present market dates from
                    1769, from which time there exists an unbroken series of accounts. The largest
                    number of firkins of butter on record that passed through the market was that of
                    the year ending 14th April 1876. The number amounted to 431,796 firkins,
                    representing a marketable value of nearly £1,700,000. The season 1859-60
                    approached it very closely (431,462), which was accounted for by the gold fever
                    then at its height in Australia, Cork being the only market capable of meeting
                    the demand, supplying a kind of butter suited to bear a long voyage; its
                    preparation is a <hi rend="italic">spécialité,</hi> the system of classification
                    by branding being carried out under the inspection of an expert. Each firkin
                    contains on an average 74 ft&gt;. Wheat and corn are extensively imported into
                    Cork, the facilities for discharging vessels of great burden being lately
                    increased by deepening the channels of the river and erecting jetties along the
                    Marina. For the year ending 31st December 1875 there were 620,240 quarters of
                    wheat and 289,275 quarters of corn discharged in the port of Cork (a quarter is
                    about 480 lb). There are three distilleries and four breweries in the city,
                    which manufacture largely for home consumption and exportation. The tanning
                    trade is also extensively carried on. An extensive flax-mill has been lately
                    established, and a manufactory for chemical manure, which produces about 10,000
                    tons annually. A large traffic is also carried on in the exportation of cattle
                    (for which special steamers are sometimes run twice a week), eggs, feathers, and
                    fish, particularly salmon, for which the River Lee is celebrated. The registered
                    tonnage of vessels at the ρortinl876 was 34,801. The number and tonnage of
                    vessels entering the port, employed in the cross channel and coasting trade,
                    reached 2644 vessels and 667,316 tons; in the British colonial trade, 62 vessels
                    of 27,641 tons; in the foreign trade, 637 vessels, tonnage 161,739. The custom
                    duties of the port average about £288,641.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">-</hi><hi rend="italic">Municipality.—</hi> The city, which is
                    represented in Parliament by two members, is presided over by a mayor, a high
                    sheriff, fourteen aidermen, and forty-one town councillors. It has from time to
                    time received several charters; the oldest, a copy of which only remains, is
                    preserved in the Library of the British Museum <hi rend="italic">(Harl.,</hi>
                    No. 441). The principal charter is that of James I. The council books of the
                    corporation from 1610 to 1800 have just been published. Cork holds a conspicuous
                    place in the annals of Ireland, as will be seen by reference to the calendar of
                    state papers, lately published under the master of the rolls. On 28th September
                    1689-90, the city surrendered to the earl of Marlborough after five days’ siege,
                    when the duke of Grafton was mortally wounded. The Irish were in possession of
                    the city and Elizabeth Fort adjoining, which capitulated after being attacked
                    with the muskets of a few soldiers, who fired into it from the steeple of the
                    cathedral of Cork, which was directly opposite. The principal subsequent events
                    of any moment will be found recorded in the council books above mentioned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The decrease in the population of the county
                    has not extended to the city in the same proportion. In 1851 the inhabitants of
                    the municipal borough, within an area of 2266 acres, numbered 85,745; in 1861,
                    80,121, and in 1871, 78,642 (males, 36,847; females, 41,795), showing a decrease
                    within twenty years of about 8¾ per cent., that of the county being 20 per cent.
                    The Parliamentary borough, which has an area extending to 46,086 acres,
                    contained 102,526 inhabitants in 1871. Of the population in the municipal
                    borough 66,716 were Catholics and 11,926 Protestants. The proportion of
                    Protestants, of whom 9196 were Presbyterians and 1028 Episcopalians, is equal to
                    15¾ per cent, of the whole population, considerably higher than in the county.
