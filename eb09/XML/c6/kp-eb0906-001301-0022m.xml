                <p>Notwithstanding the statements by many writers that clocks, <hi rend="italic"
                    >horologia,</hi> were in use so early as the 9th century, and that they were
                    then invented by an archdeacon of Verona, named Pacificus, there appears to be
                    no clear evidence that they were machines at all resembling those which have
                    been in use for the last five or six centuries. But it may be inferred from
                    various allusions to <hi rend="italic">horologia,</hi> and to their striking
                    spontaneously, in the 12th century, that genuine clocks existed then, though
                    there is no surviving description of any one until the 13th century, when it
                    appears that a horologium was sent by the sultan of Egypt in 1232 to the Emperor
                    Frederick II. “It resembled a celestial globe, in which the sun, moon, and
                    planets moved, being impelled by weights and wheels, so that they pointed out
                    the hour, day, and night with certainty.” A clock was put up in a former clock
                    tower at Westminster with some great bells in 1288, out of a fine imposed on a
                    corrupt chief-justice, and the motto <hi rend="italic">Discite justitiam,
                    moniti,</hi> inscribed upon it. The bells were sold or rather, it is said,
                    gambled away, by Henry VIII. In</p>
                <p>1292 one is mentioned in Canterbury Cathedral as costing £30. And another at St
                    Albans, by R. Wallingford the abbot in 1326, is said to have been such as there
                    was not in all Europe, showing various astronomical phenomena. A description of
                    one in Dover Castle with the date 1348 on it was published by the late Admiral
                    Smyth, P.R.A.S., in 1851, and the clock itself was exhibited going, in the
                    Scientific Exhibition of 1876. In the early editions of this <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopaedia</hi> there was a picture of a very similar one, made by De Vick
                    for the French king Charles V. about the same time, much like our common clocks
                    of the last century, ex&lt;*ept that it had a vibrating balance, but no spring,
                    instead of a pendulum, for pendulums were not invented till three centuries
                    after that.</p>
                <p>The general construction of the going part of all clocks, except large or turret
                    clocks, which we shall treat separately, is substantially the same, and fig. 1
                    is a section of any ordinary house clock. B is the barrel with the rope coiled
                    round it, generally 16 times for the 8 days; the barrel is fixed to its arbor K,
                    which is prolonged into the winding square coming up to the face or dial of the
                    clock; the dial is here shown as fixed either by small screws <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,</hi> or by a socket and pin z, to the prolonged pillars <hi rend="italic">p,
                    p,</hi> which (4 or 5 in number) connect the plates or frame of the clock
                    together, though the dial is commonly, but for no good reason, set on to the
                    front plate by another set of pillars of its own. The great wheel G rides on the
                    arbor, and is connected with the barrel by the ratchet R, the action of which is
                    shown more fully in fig 14. The intermediate wheel <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in
                    this drawing is for a purpose which will be described hereafter, and for the
                    present it may be considered as omitted, and the click of the ratchet R as fixed
                    to the great wheel. The great wheel drives the pinion <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    which is called the centre pinion, on the arbor of the <hi rend="italic">centre
                    wheel</hi> C, which goes through to the dial, and carries the long, or
                    minute-hand; this wheel always turns in an hour, and the great wheel generally
                    in 12 hours, by having 12 times as many teeth as the centre pinion. The centre
                    wheel drives the “second wheel” D by its pinion <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and
                    that again drives the scape-wheel E by its pinion <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> If
                    the pinions <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> have each 8
                    teeth or <hi rend="italic">leaves</hi> (as the teeth of pinions are usually
                    called), C will have 64 teeth and D 60, in a clock of which the scape-wheel
                    turns in a minute, so that the seconds hand may be set on its arbor prolonged to
                    the dial. A represents the pallets of the escapement, which will be described
                    presently, and their arbor <hi rend="italic">a goes</hi> through a large hole in
                    the back plate near F, and its back pivot turns in a cock OFQ screwed on to the
                    back plate. From the pallet arbor at F descends the <hi rend="italic"
                    >crutch</hi> F∕, ending in the∕orl∙∕, which embraces the pendulum P, so that as
                    the pendulum vibrates, the crutch and the pallets necessarily vibrate with it.
                    The pendulum is hung by a thin spring S from the cock Q, so that the bending
                    point of the spring may be just opposite the end of the pallet arbor, and the
                    edge of the spring as close to the end of that arbor as possible—a point too
                    frequently neglected.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n23/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0023-0014"/>
                <p>We may now go to the front (or left hand) of the clock, and describe the dial or
                    “motion-work.” The minute hand fits on to a squared end of a brass socket, which
                    is fixed to the wheel Μ, and fits close, but not tight, on the prolonged arbor
                    of the centre wheel. Behind this wheel is a bent spring which is (or ought to
                    be) set on the same arbor with a square hole (not a round one as it sometimes
                    is) in the middle, so that it must turn with the arbor; the wheel is pressed up
                    against this spring, and kept there, by a cap and a small pin through the end of
                    the arbor. . The consequence is, that there is friction enough between the
                    spring .and the wheel to carry the hand round, but not enough to resist a
                    moderate push with the finger for the purpose of altering the time indicated.
                    This wheel Μ, which is sometimes called the minute-wheel, but is better called
                    the <hi rend="italic">hour-wheel</hi> as it turns in an hour, drives another
                    wheel N^, of the same number of teeth, which has a pinion attached to it; and
                    that pinion drives the <hi rend="italic">twelve-hour wheel</hi> H, which is also
                    attached to a large socket or pipe carrying the hour hand, and riding on the
                    former socket, or rather (in order to relieve the centre arbor of that extra
                    weight) on an intermediate socket fixed to the <hi rend="italic">bridge</hi> L,
                    which is screwed to the front plate over the hour-wheel Μ. The weight W, which
                    drives the train and gives the impulse to the pendulum through the escapement,
                    is generally hung by a catgut line passing through a pulley attached to the
                    weight, the other end of the cord being tied to some convenient place in the
                    clock frame or <hi rend="italic">seat-board,</hi> to which it is fixed by screws
                    through the lower pillars. It has usually been the practice to make the case of
                    house clocks and astronomical clocks not less than 6 feet high; but that is a
                    very unnecessary waste of space änd materials; for by either diminishing the
                    size of the barrel, or the number of its turns, by increasing the size of the
                    great wheel by one-half, or hanging the weights by a treble instead of a double
                    line; a case just long enough for the pendulum will also be long enough for the
                    fall of the weights in 7J or 8 days. Of course the weights have to be increased
                    in the same ratio, and indeed rather more, to overcome the increased friction;
                    but that is of no consequence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pendulum.</hi></p>
                <p>The claim to the invention of the pendulum, like the claim to most inventions, is
                    disputed; and we have no intention of trying to settle it. It was, like many
                    other discoveries and inventions, probably made by various persons
                    independently, and almost simultaneously, when the state of science had become
                    ripe for it. The discovery of that peculiarly valuable property of the pendulum
                    called <hi rend="italic">isochronism,</hi> or the disposition to vibrate
                    different arcs in very nearly the same time (provided the arcs are none of them
                    large), is commonly attributed to Galileo, in the well-known story of his being
                    struck with the isochronism of a chandelier hung by a long chain from the roof
                    of the church at Florence. And Galileo’s son appears as a rival of Avicenna,
                    Huyghens, Dr Hooke, and a London clockmaker named Harris, for the honour of
                    having first applied the pendulum to regulate the motion of a clock train, all
                    in the early part of the 17th century. Be this as it may, there seems little
                    doubt that Huyghens was the first who mathematically investigated, and therefore
                    really knew, the true nature of those properties of the pendulum which may now
                    be found explained in any mathematical book on mechanics. He discovered that if
                    a <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> pendulum (ι.e., a weight or <hi rend="italic"
                    >bob</hi> consisting of a single point, and hung by a rod or string of no
                    weight) can be made to describe, not a circle, but a cycloid of which the string
                    would be the radius of curvature at the lowest point, all its. vibrations,
                    however large, will'be performed in the same time. For a little distance near
                    the bottom, the circle very nearly coincides with the cycloid; and hence it is
                    that, for small arcs, a pendulum vibrating as usual in a circle is nearly enough
                    isochronous for the purposes of horology; more especially when contrivances are
                    introduced either to compensate for the variations of the arc, or, better still,
                    to destroy them altogether, by making the force on the pendulum so constant that
                    its arc may never sensibly vary.</p>
                <p>The difference between the time of any <hi rend="italic">small</hi> arc of the
                    circle and <hi rend="italic">any</hi> arc of the cycloid varies nearly as the
                    square of the circular arc; and again, the difference between the times of any
                    two small and nearly equal circular arcs of the same pendulum, varies nearly as
                    the arc itself. If <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the arc, is increased by a small
                    amount <hi rend="italic">da,</hi> the pendulum will lose <hi rend="italic"
                    >108Q0ada</hi> seconds a day, which is rather more than 1 second, if <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is 2° (from zero) and <hi rend="italic">da</hi> is 10',
                    since the numerical value of 2° is ’ 035. If the increase of arc is
                    considerable, it will not do to reckon thus by differentials, but we must take
                    the difference of time for the day as 5400 <hi rend="italic">(ap—</hi> α <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>), which will be just 8 seconds ifα = 2° and <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi>
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">0°.</hi> For many years it was thought of great importance
                    to obtain cycloidal vibrations of clock pendulums, and it was done by making the
                    suspension string or spring vibrate between <hi rend="italic">cycloidal
                    checks,</hi> as they were called. But it was in time discovered that all this is
                    a delusion,—first, because there is and can be no such thing in reality as a
                    simple pendulum, and cycloidal cheeks will only make a simple pendulum vibrate
                    isochronously; secondly, because a very slight error in the form of the cheeks
                    (as Huyghens himself discovered) would do more harm than the <hi rend="italic"
                    >circular error</hi> uncorrected, even for an arc of 10°, which is much larger
                    than the common pendulum arc; thirdly, because there was always some friction or
                    adhesion between the cheeks and the string; and fourthly (a reason which applies
                    equally to all the isochronous contrivances since invented), because a common
                    clock escapement itself generally tends to produce an error exactly opposite to
                    the circular error, or to make the pendulum vibrate quicker the farther it
                    swings; and therefore the circular error is actually useful for the purpose of
                    helping to counteract the error due to the escapement, and the clock goes better
                    than it would with a simple pendulum, describing the most perfect cycloid. At
                    the same time, the thin spring by which pendulums are always suspended, except
                    in some French clocks where a silk string is used (a very inferior plan), causes
                    the pendulum to deviate a little from circular and to approximate to cycloidal
                    motion, because the bend does not take place at one point, but is spread over
                    some length of the spring.</p>
                <p>The accurate performance of a clock depends so essentially on the pendulum, that
                    we shall go somewhat into detail respecting it. First then, the time of
                    vibration depends entirely on the length of the pendulum, the effect of the
                    spring being too small for consideration until we come to differences of a
                    higher order. But the time does not vary as the length, but only as the square
                    root of the length; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a pendulum to vibrate two
                    seconds must be four times as long as a seconds pendulum. The relation between
                    the time of vibration and the length of a pendulum is expressed thus :— <hi
                    rend="italic">t —</hi> n∙√-, where <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is the time in
                    seconds, ¶ the well-known symbol for 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 14159, the
                    ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
                    the length of the pendulum, and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> the force of gravity at
                    the latitude where it is intended to vibrate. This letter <hi rend="italic"
                    >g,</hi> in the latitude of London, is the symbol for 32 '2 feet, that being the
                    velocity (or number of feet per second) at which a body is found by experiment
                    to be moving at the end of the first second of its fall, being necessarily equal
                    to twice the actual number of feet it has fallen in that second. Consequently,
                    the length of a pendulum to beat seconds in London is 39'14 inches. But the same
                    pendulum carried to the equator, where the force of gravity is less, would lose
                    2∣ minutes a day.</p>
                <p>The seconds we are here speaking of are the seconds o£ a common clock indicating
                    <hi rend="italic">mean solar time.</hi> But as clocks are also required for
                    sidereal time, it may be as well to mention the proportions between a mean and a
                    sidereal pendulum. A sidereal day is the interval between two successive
                    transits over the meridian of a place by that imaginary point in the heavens
                    called T, the first point of Aries, at the intersection of the equator and the
                    ecliptic; and there is one more sidereal day than there are solar days in a
                    year, since the earth has to turn more than once round in space before the sun
                    can come a second time to the meridian, on account of the earth’s own motion in
                    its orbit during the day. A sidereal day or hour is shorter than a mean solar
                    one in the ratio of '99727, and consequently a sidereal pendulum must be shorter
                    than a mean time pendulum in the square of that ratio, or in the latitude of
                    London the sidereal seconds pendulum is 38 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 87
                    inches. As we have mentioned what is 0 or 24 o’clock by sidereal time, we may as
                    well add, that the mean day is also reckoned in astronomy by 24 hours, and not
                    from midnight as in civil reckoning, but from the following noon; thus, what we
                    call 11 A. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.</hi> May 1 in common life is 23 h. April 30
                    with astronomers.</p>
                <p>It must be remembered that the pendulums whose lengths we have been speaking of
                    are simple pendulums; and as that is a thing which can only exist in theory, the
                    reader may ask how the length of a real pendulum to vibrate in any required time
                    is ascertained. In every pendulum, that is to say, in every body hung so as to
                    be capable of vibrating freely, there is a certain point, always somewhere below
                    the centre of gravity, which possesses these remarkable properties—that if the
                    pendulum were turned upside down, and set vibrating about this point, it would
                    vibrate in the same time as before, and moreover, that the distance of this
                    point from the point of suspension is exactly the length of that imaginary
                    simple pendulum which would vibrate in the same time. This point is therefore

                    bodies of certain simple and regular forms; but they are fortunately not
                    requisite in practice, because in all clock pendulums the centre’of oscillation
                    is only a short distance below the centre of gravity of the whole pendulum, and
                    generally so near to the centre of gravity of the bob—in fact a little above
                    it—that there is no difficulty in making a pendulum for any given time of
                    vibration near enough to the proper length at once, and then adjusting it by
                    screwing the bob up or down until it is found to vibrate in the proper time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Revolving or Conical Pendulum.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus far we have been speaking of vibrating pendulums; but the notice of
                    pendulums would be incomplete without some allusion to revolving or <hi
                    rend="italic">conical</hi> pendulums, as they are called, because they describe
                    a cone in revolving. Such pendulums are used where a continuous instead of an
                    intermittent motion of the clock train is required, as in the clocks for keeping
                    an equatorial telescope directed to a star, by driving it the opposite way to
                    the motion of the earth, to whose axis the axis on which the telescope turns is
                    made parallel. Clocks with such pendulums may also be used in bedrooms by
                    persons who cannot bear the ticking of a common clock. The pendulum, instead of
                    being hung by a flat spring, is hung by a thin piece of piano-forte wire; and it
                    should be understood that it has no tendency to twist on its own axis, and so to
                    twist off the wire, as may be apprehended; in fact, it would require some extra
                    force to make it twist, if it were wanted to do so. The time of revolution of
                    such a pendulum may be easily ascertained as follows :—Let <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> be its length; <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the angle which it makes with
                    the vertical axis of the cone which it describes; ω the angular velocity; then
                    the centrifugal force <hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">ω</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">I</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic"
                    >a;</hi> and as this is the force which keeps the pendulum away from the
                    vertical, it must balance the force which draws it to the vertical, which is <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> tan. <hi rend="italic">a:</hi> and therefore — the angular
                    velocity, or the angle de scribed in a second of time; and the time of complete
                    revolution through the angle 360° or 2τr is— = 2π <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a/Í_££</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> s</hi><hi rend="italic">'fih</hi>;
                    that is to</p>
                <p>ω V <hi rend="italic">g</hi> say, the time of revolution of a pendulum of any
                    given length is less than the time of a double oscillation of the same pendulum,
                    in the proportion of the cosine of the angle which it makes with, the axis of
                    revolution to unity.</p>
                <p>A rotary pendulum is kept in motion by the train of the clock ending in a
                    horizontal wheel with a vertical axis, from which projects an arm pressing
                    against a spike at the bottom of the pendulum; and it has this disadvantage that
                    any inequality in the force of the train, arising from variations of friction or
                    any other cause, is immediately transmitted to the pendulum; whereas it will be
                    seen that in several kinds of escapements which can be applied to a Vibrating
                    pendulum, the variations of force can be rendered nearly or quite insensible.
                    And it is a mistake to imagine that there is any self-correcting power in a
                    conical pendulum analogous to that of the governor of a steam-engine; for that
                    apparatus, though it is a couple of conical pendulums, has also a communication
                    by a system of levers with the valve which supplies the steam. The governor
                    apparatus has itself been applied to telescope-driving clocks, with a lever
                    ending in a spring which acts by friction on some revolving plate in the clock,
                    increasing the friction, and so diminishing the force as the balls of the
                    governor fly out farther under any increase in the force. And with the addition
                    of some connection with the hand of the observer, by which the action can be
                    farther moderated, the motion can be made sufficiently uniform for that
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>Various other contrivances have been invented for producing a continuous
                    clock-motion. The great equatorial telescope at Greenwich is kept in motion by a
                    kind of water clock called in books on hydrostatics Barker’s Mi∏, in which two
                    horizontal pipes branching out from a vertical tubular axis have each a hole
                    near their ends on opposite sides, from which water flows, being poured
                    constantly into the tubular axis, which revolves on a pivot. The resistance of
                    the air to the water issuing from the holes drives the mill round, and there are
                    means of regulating it. Another plan is to connect a clock train having a
                    vibrating pendulum with another clock having a conical pendulum by one of the
                    lower wheels in the train, with a spring connection; the telescope is driven by
                    the revolving clock train, and the other pendulum keeps it sufficiently in
                    order, though allowing it to expatiate enough for each beat of the pendulum. The
                    more complicated plan of Wagner of Paris described in Sir E. Beckett’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Rudimentary Treatise on Clocksand Watches and Bells</hi> does not
                    appear to have ever come into use, and therefore it is now omitted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pendulum Suspension.</hi></p>
                <p>The suspension of the penduſum on what are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >knife-edges,</hi> like those of a scale-beam, has often been advocated. But
                    though it may do well enough for short experiments, in which the effects of the
                    elasticity of the spring are wanted to be eliminated, it fails altogether in
                    use, even if the knife-edges and the plates which carry them are made of the
                    hardest stones. The suspension which is now used universally, in all but some
                    inferior foreign clocks, which have strings instead, is a thin and short spring,
                    with one end let into the top of the pendulum, and the other screwed between two
                    <hi rend="italic">chops</hi> of metal with a pin through them, which rests
                    firmly in a nick in the cock which carries the pendulum as shown in fig. 2 a
                    little farther on; and the . steadiness of this cock, and its firm fixing to a
                    wall, are essential to the accurate performance of the clock. 1 he thinner the
                    spring the better; provided, of course, it is strong enough to carry the
                    pendulum without being bent beyon&lt;l its elasticity, or bent short; not that
                    there is much risk of that in practice. Pendulum springs are much oftener too
                    thick than too thin; and it is worth notice that, independently of their greab r
                    effect on the natural time of vibration of the pendulum, thick and narrow
                    springs are more liable to break than thin and broad ones of the same strength.
                    It is of great importance that the spring should be of uniform thickness
                    throughout its breadth; and the bottom of the chons which carry it should be
                    exactly horizontal; otherwise the pendulum will swing with a twist, as they may
                    be often seen to do in ill-made clocks. If the bottom of the chops is left
                    sharp, where they clip the spring, it is very likely to break there; and
                    therefore the sharp edges should be taken off.</p>
                <p>The bob of the pendulum used to be generally made in the shape of a lens, with a
                    view to its passing through the air with the least resistance. But after the
                    importance of making the bob heavy was discovered, it became almost necessary to
                    adopt a form of more solid content in proportion to its surface. A sphere has
                    beén occasionally used, but it is not a good shape, because a slight error in
                    the place of the hole for the rod may make a serious difference in the amount of
                    weight on each side, and give the pendulum a tendency to twist in motion. The
                    mercurial jar pendulum suggested the cylindrical form, which is now generally
                    adopted for astronomical clocks, and in the best turret clocks, with a round top
                    to prevent any bits of mortar or dirt falling and resting upon it, which would
                    alter the time; it also looks better than a flat-topped cylinder. There is no
                    rule to be given for the weight of pendulums. It will be shown hereafter that,
                    whatever escapement may be used, the errors due to any variation of force are
                    expressed in fractions which invariably have the weight and the length of the
                    pendulum in the denominator, though some kind of escapements require a heavy
                    pendulum to correct their errors much less than others. And as a heavy pendulum
                    requires very little more force to keep it in motion than a light one, being
                    less affected by the resistance of the air, we may almost say that the heavier
                    ana longer a pendulum can be made the better; at any rate, the only limit is one
                    of convenience; for instance, it would obviously be inconvenient to put a large
                    pen dulum of 100 lb weight in the case of an astronomical or common house clock.
                    It may perhaps be laid down as a rule, that no astronomical clock or <hi
                    rend="italic">regulator</hi> (as they are also called) will go as well as is now
                    expected of such clocks with a pendulum of less than 28 lb weight, and no turret
                    clock with less than 1 cwt. Long pendulums are generally made with heavier bobs
                    than short ones; and such a clock as that of the Houses of Parliament, with a
                    two-seconds pendulum of 6 cwt., ought to go 44 times as well as a small turret
                    clock with a one-second pendulum of 60 lb. Pendulums longer than 14 feet (2
                    seconds) are inconvenient, liable to be disturbed by wind, and expensive to
                    compensate, and they are now quite disused, and most or all of the old ones
                    removed, with their clocks, for better ones.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pendulum Regulation.</hi></p>
                <p>The regulation of pendulums, or their exact adjustment to the proper length, is
                    primarily effected by a nut on the end of the rod, by which the bob can be
                    screwed up or down. In the best clocks the rim of this nut is divided, with an
                    index over it; so the exact quantity of rise or fall, or the exact acceleration
                    or retardation, may be known, the amount due to one turn of the nut being
                    previously ascertained. By the calculation used below for compensation of
                    pendulums, it may be seen that if the length of the pendulum rod is <hi
                    rend="italic">I,</hi> and the breadth of one thread of the screw is called <hi
                    rend="italic">dl,</hi> then one turn of the nut will alter the rate of the clock
                    by 43200 y seconds a day; which would be just 30 seconds, if the pendulum rod is
                    45 inches long, and the screw has 32 threads in the inch. To accelerate the
                    clock the nut has always to be turned to the right, as it is called, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> But in astronomical and in large turret clocks,
                    it is desirable to avoid stopping, or in any way disturbing the pendulum; and
                    for the finer adjustments other methods of regulation are adopted. The best is
                    that of fixing a collar, as shown in fig 2, capable oí having very small weights
                    laid upon it, half-way down the pendulum, this being the place where the
                    addition of any small weigh produces the greatest effect, and where, it may be
                    added, any moving of that weight up or down on the rod produces the least <pb

                    that on a pendulum of 15 lb. weight (7000 gr. being = 1 lb.), or an ounce on a
                    pendulum of 6 cwt. In like manner if <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    accelerate the clock a second a day. The higher up the collar is the less risk
                    there is of disturbing the pendulum in putting on or taking off the regulating
                    weights. The weights should be made in a series, and marked ∣, ⅜, 1, 2,
                    according to the number of seconds a day by which they will accelerate; and the
                    pendulum adjusted at first to lose a little, perhaps a second a day, when there
                    are no weights on the collar, so that it may always have some weight on, which
                    can be diminished or increased from time to time with certainty, as the rate may
                    vary.</p>

                <p>Soon after pendulums began to be generally used in clocks, it was discovered that
                    they contained within themselves a source of error independent of the action of
                    the clock upon them, and that they lost time in the hot weather and gained in

                <p>Thus a common pendulum with an iron wire rod would lose 43200 × <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 00007 = 3 seconds a day for 10° of heat; and if
                    adjusted for the winter temperature it would lose about a minute a week in
                    summer, unless something in the clock happened to produce a counteracting
                    effect, as we shall see may be the case when we come to escapements. We want
                    therefore some contrivance which will always keep that point of the pendulum on
                    which· its time depends, viz., the <hi rend="italic">centre of oscillation,</hi>
                    at the same distance from the point of suspension. A vast number of such
                    contrivances have been made, but there are only three which can be said to be at
                    all in common use; and the old <hi rend="italic">gridiron pendulum,</hi> made of
                    9 alternate bars of brass and steel is not one of them, having been superseded
                    .by one of zinc and iron, exactly on the same principle, but requiring much
                    fewer bars on account of the greater expansion of zinc than brass. The centre of
                    oscillation so nearly coincides in most clock pendulums with the centre of the
                    <hi rend="italic">bob</hi> that we may practically say that the object of
                    compensation is to keep the bob always at the same height. For this purpose we
                    must hang the bob from the top of a column of some metal which has so much more
                    expansion than the rod that its expansion upwards will neutralize that of the
                    rod, and of the wires or tube by which the bob is hung, downwards. The complete
                    calculation, taking into account the weight of all the rods and tubes is too
                    long and complicated to be worth going through, especially as it must always be
                    finally adjusted by trial either of that very pendulum or of one exactly
                    similar. For practical purposes it is found sufficient to treat the expansion of
                    zinc as being '016 to steel <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 0064, instead of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 017 as it is really; and for large pendulums with
                    very heavy tubes even the ’ 016 is a little too much. Moreover the c.o. is
                    higher above the c.g. of the bob in such large pendulums than in small ones with
                    light rods and tubes. ...</p>
                <p>But neglecting these minutiae for the first approximation, and supposing the bob
                    either to be of iron, in which case it may be considered fixed anywhere to the
                    iron tube which hangs from the top of the zinc tube, or a lead bob attached at
                    its own centre, which obviates the slowness of the transmission of a change of
                    temperature through it, the following calculation will hold. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> be the length of the*steel rod and spring, <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> that of the zinc tube, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> half the
                    height of the bob; the length of the iron tube down the centre of the boo is <hi
                    rend="italic">x-b.</hi> If the iron tube is of steel for simplicity of
                    calculation, wβ</p>
                <p>2</p>
                <p>must evidently have ’ 064(r+z- <hi rend="italic">b)</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi>
                    16s ". z — g(r-δ). It is practically found that for a seconds pendulum with a
                    lead cylindrical bob 9 in. × 3 hung by its middle <hi rend="italic">r</hi> has
                    to be about 44 inches, and z nearly 27. At any rate it is safest to make it 27
                    at first, especially if the second tube is iron, which expands a little more
                    than steel; and the tube can be shortened after trial but not lengthened. The
                    rod of the standard sidereal pendulum at Greenwich (down to the bottom of the
                    bob, which is such as has been described and weighs 26 lb), is 43∣ and z is 26
                    inches, the descending wires being steel.</p>
                <p>A solar time pendulum is about ∣ inch longer, as stated above. If the bob were
                    fixed at its bottom to the steel tube the zinc would have to be 4‘88 longer.
                    Fig. 2 is a section of the great Westminster pendulum. The iron rod which runs
                    from top to bottom, ends in a screw, with a nut N, for adjusting the length of
                    the pendulum after it was made by calculation as near the right length as
                    possible. On this nut rests a collar Μ, which can slide up the rod a little, but
                    is prevented from turning by a pin through the rod. On a groove or annular
                    channel in the top of this collar stands a zinc tube 10 feet 6 inches long, and
                    nearly half an inch thick, made of three tubes all drawn together, so as to
                    become like one (for it should be observed that <hi rend="italic">cast</hi> zinc
                    cannot be depended on; it must be drawn). On the top of this tube or hollow
                    column fits another collar with an annulai groove much like the bottom one Μ.
                    The object of these grooves is to keep the ’.inc column in its place, not
                    touching the rod within it, as contact might produce friction, which would
                    interfere with their relative motion under expansion and contraction. Round the
                    collar C is screwed a large iron tube, also not touching the zinc, and its lower
                    end fits loosely on the collar Μ; and round its outside it has another collar D
                    of its own fixed to it, on which the bob rests. The iron tube has a number of
                    large holes in it down each side, to let the air get to the zinc tube; before
                    that was done, it was found that the compensation lagged a day or two behind the
                    changes of temperature, in consequence of the iron rod and tube being exposed,
                    while the zinc tube was enclosed without touching the iron. The bottom of the
                    bob is 14 feet 11 inches from the top of the spring A, and the bob itself is 18
                    inches high, with a domeshaped top, and twelve inches in diameter. As it is a
                    2-seconds pendulum, its centre of oscillation is 13 feet from the top A, which
                    is higher than usual above the centre of gravity of the bob, on account of the
                    great weight of the compensation tubes. The whole weighs very nearly 700 lb, and
                    is probably the heaviest pendulum in the world.</p>
                <p>The second kind of compensation pendulum in use is still more simple, but not so
                    effective or certain in its action; and that is merely a wooden rod with a long
                    lead bob resting on a nut at the bottom. According to the above table, it would
                    appear that this bob ought to be 14 inches high in a 1-second pendulum; but the
                    expansion of wood is so uncertain that this proportion is not found capable of
                    being depended on, and a somewhat shorter bob is said to be generally more
                    correct in point of compensatiom All persons who have tried wooden pendulums
                    severely have come to the same conclusion, that they are capricious in their
                    action, and consequently unfit for the highest class of clocks.</p>
                <p>The best of all the compensations was long thought to be the mercurial, which was
                    invented by Graham, a London clockmaker, above a century ago, who also invented
                    the well-known dead escapement for clocks, which will be hereafter explained,
                    and the horizontal or cylinder escapement for watches. And the best form of the
                    mercurial pendulum is that which was introduced by the late E. J. Dent, in which
                    the mercury is enclosed in a cast iron jar or cylinder, into the top of which
                    the steel rod is screwed, with its end plunged into the mercury itself. For by
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n26/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0026-0017"/> this means the mercury, the rod, and the jar all
                    acquire the new temperature at any change more simultaneously thalι when the
                    mercury is in a glass jar hung by a <hi rend="italic">stirrup</hi> (as it is
                    called) at the bottom of the rod; and moreover the pendulum is safe to carry
                    about, and the jar can be made perfectly cylindrical by turning, and also
                    air-tight, so as protect the mercury from oxidation; and, if necessary, it can
                    be heated in the jar so as to drive off any moisture, without the risk of
                    breaking. The height of mercury required in a cast-iron jar, 2 inches in
                    diameter, is about 6 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8 inches; for it must be
                    remembered, in calculating the rise of the mercury, that the jar itself expands
                    laterally, and that expansion has tobe deducted from that of the mercury in
                    bulk.</p>
                <p>The success of the Westminster clock pendulum, however, and of smaller zinc and
                    steel pendulums at Greenwich and elsewhere, has established the conclusion that
                    it is unnecessary to incur the expense of a heavy mercurial pendulum, which has
                    become more serious from the great rise in the price of mercury and the admitted
                    necessity for much heavier bobs than were once thought sufficient for
                    astronomical clocks. The complete calculation for a compensated pendulum in
                    which the rods and tubes form any considerable proportion of the whole weight,
                    as they must in a zinc pendulum, is too complicated to be worth undertaking
                    generally, especially as it is always necessary to adjust them finally by trial,
                    and for that purpose the tubes should be made at first a little longer than they
                    ought to be by calculation, except where one is exactly copying pendulums
                    nreviously tried.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Barometrical Error.</hi></p>
                <p>It has long been known that pendulums are affected by variations of density of
                    the air as well as of temperature, though in a much less degree,—in fact, so
                    little as to be immaterial, except in the best clocks, where all the other
                    errors are reduced to a minimum. An increase of density of the air is equivalent
                    to a diminution of the specific gravity of the pendulum, and that is equivalent
                    to diminution of the force of gravity while the inertia remains the same. And as
                    the velocity of the pendulum varies directly as the force of gravity and
                    inversely as the inertia, an increase of density must diminish the velocity or
                    increase the time. The late Francis Baily, P.R.A.S., also found from some
                    elaborate experiments (See <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans,</hi> of 1832) that
                    swinging pendulums carry so much air with them as to affect their specific
                    gravity much beyond that due to the mere difference of stationary weight, and
                    that this also varies with their shape,—a rod with a flat elliptical section
                    dragging more air with it than a thicker round one (which is not what one would
                    expect), though a lens-shaped bob was less affected than a spherical one of the
                    same diameter, which of course is much heavier. The frictional effect of the air
                    is necessarily greater with its increased density, and that diminishes the arc.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">R.A.S. Memoirs</hi> of 1853 Mr Bloxam remarked also
                    that the current produced in the descent of the pendulum goes along with it in
                    ascending, and therefore does not retard the ascent as much as it did the
                    descent, and therefore the two effects do not counteract each other as Baily
                    assumed that they did. He also found the circular error always less than its
                    theoretical value, and considered that this was due to the resistance of the
                    air. The conclusions which were arrived at by several eminent clockmakers as to
                    the effect of the pendulum spring on the circular error about 40 years ago were
                    evidently erroneous, and the effect due to other causes.</p>
                <p>It appears from further investigation of the subject in several papers in the <hi
                    rend="italic">R.A.S. Notices</hi> of 1872 and 1873, that the barometrical error
                    also varies with the nature of the escapement, and (as Baily had before
                    concluded from calculation) with the arc of the pendulum, so that it can hardly
                    be determined for any particular clock <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> except
                    by inference from a similar one. The barometrical error of an ordinary
                    astronomical clock with a dead escapement was said to be a loss of nearly a
                    second a day for an inch rise of barometer, but with a gravity escapement and a
                    very heavy pendulum not more than ’ 3 second. Dr Robinson of Armagh (see <hi
                    rend="italic">R.A.S. Mem.,</hi> vol. v.) suggested the addition of a pair of
                    barometer tubes to the sides of the pendulum, with a bulb at the bottom, and
                    such a diameter of tube as would allow a sufficient quantity of mercury to be
                    transposed to the top by the expansion under heat, to balance the direct effect
                    of the heat upon the pendulum. But it is not necessary to have two tubes. In a
                    paper in the <hi rend="italic">R.A.S. Notices</hi> of January 1873 Mr. Denison
                    (now Sir E. Beckett) gave the calculations requisite for the barometrical
                    compensation of pendulums of various lengths and weights, the principle of which
                    is just the same as that above given for regulating a pendulum by adding small
                    weights near the middle of its length. The formula is also given at p. 69 of the
                    sixth edition of his <hi rend="italic">Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks.</hi> A
                    barometrical correction of a different kind has been applied to the standard
                    clock at Greenwich. An independent barometer is made to raise or lower a magnet
                    so as to bring it into more or less action on the pendulum and so to accelerate
                    or retard it. But we do not see why that should be better than the barometer
                    tube attached to the pendulum. The necessity for this correction seems to be
                    obviated altogether by giving the pendulum a sufficient arc of vibration. Baily
                    calculated that if the arc (reckoned from 0) is about 2° 45' the barometrical
                    error will be self-corrected. And it is remarkable that the Westminster clock
                    pendulum, to which that large arc was given for other reasons, appears to be
                    free from any barometric error, after trying the results of the daily rate as
                    automatically recorded at Greenwich for the whole of the year 1872. We shall see
                    presently that all the escapement errors of clocks are represented by fractions
                    which have the square or the cube of the arc in the denominator, and therefore
                    if the arc can be increased and kept constant without any objectionable increase
                    of force and friction, this is an additional reason for preferring a large arc
                    to a small one, though that is contrary to the usual practice in astronomical
                    clocks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Escapements.</hi></p>
                <p>The escapement is that part of the clock in which the rotary motion of the wheels
                    is converted into the vibratory motion of the balance or pendulum, which by some
                    contrivance or other is made to let one tooth of the quickest wheel in the train
                    escape at each vibration; and hence that wheel is called the “scape wheel.” Fig.
                    3 shows the form of the earliest clock escapement, if it is held sideways, so
                    that the arms on which the two balls are set may vibrate on a horizontal plane.
                    In that case the arms and weights form a balance, and the farther out the
                    weights are set, the slower would be the vibrations. If we now turn it as it
                    stands here, and consider the upper weight left out, it becomes the earliest
                    form of the pendulum clock, with the <hi rend="italic">crownwheel</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">vertical</hi> escapement. CA and CB are two flat pieces of steel,
                    called <hi rend="italic">pallets,</hi> projecting from the axis about at right
                    angles to each other, one of them over the front of the wheel as it stands, and
                    the other over the back. The tooth D is just escaping from the front pallet CA,
                    and at the same time the tooth at the back of the wheel falls on the other
                    pallet CB, a little above its edge. But the pendulum which is now moving to the
                    right does not stop immediately, but swings a little further (otherwise the
                    least failure in the force of the train would stop the clock, as the escape
                    would not take place), and in so doing it is evident that the pallet B will
                    drive the wheel back a little, and produce what is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >recoil;</hi> which is visible enough in any common clock with a seconds-hand,
                    either with this escapement or the one which will be next described.</p>
                <p>It will be seen, on looking at figure 3, that the pallet B must turn through a
                    considerable angle before the tooth can escape; in other words, the crown-wheel
                    escapement requires a long vibration of the pendulum. This is objectionable on
                    several accounts,—first, because it requires a great force in the clock train,
                    and a great pressure, and therefore friction, on the pallets; and besides that,
                    any variation in a large arc, as was explained before, produces a much greater
                    variation of time due to the circular error than an equal variation of a small
                    arc. The crownwheel escapement may indeed be made so as to allow a more moderate
                    arc of the pendulum, though not so small as the 2° usually adopted in the best
                    clocks, by putting the pallet arbor a good deal higher above the scape-wheel,
                    and giving a small number of teeth to the wheel; and that also diminishes the
                    length of the run of the teeth, and consequently the friction, on the pallets,
                    though it makes the recoil very great and sudden; but, oddly enough, it never
                    appears to have been resorted to until long after the escapement had become
                    superseded by the “anchor” escapement, whicn we shall now <pb break="no"

                    by the celebrated Dr Hooke as early as the year 1656, very soon after the
                    invention of pendulums.</p>
                <p>In fig. 4 a tooth of the scape-wheel is just escaping from the left pallet, and
                    another tooth at the same time falls upon the right hand pallet at some distance
                    from its point. As the pendulum moves on in the same direction, the tooth slides
                    farther up the pallet, thus producing a recoil, as in the crown-wheel
                    escapement. The acting faces of the pallets should be convex, and not flat, as
                    they are generally made, much less concave, as they have sometimes been made,
                    with a view of checking the motion. of the pendulum, which is more likely to
                    injure the rate of the clock than to improve it. But when they are flat, and of
                    course still more when they are concave, the points of the teeth always wear a
                    hole in the pallets at the extremity of their usual swing, and the motion is
                    obviously easier and therefore better when the pallets are made convex; in fact
                    they then approach more nearly to the “dead” escapement, which will be described
                    presently. We have already alluded to the effect of some escapements in not only
                    counteracting the circular error, or the natural increase of the time of a
                    pendulum as the arc increases, but overbalancing it by an error of the contrary
                    kind. The recoil escapement does so; for it is almost invariably found that
                    whatever may be the shape of these pallets, the clock loses as the arc of the
                    pendulum falls off, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> It is unfortunately
                    impossible so to arrange the pallets that the circular error may be thus exactly
                    neutralized, because the escapement error depends, in a manner reducible to no
                    law, upon variations in friction of the pallets themselves and of the clock
                    train, which produce different eflects; and the result is that it is impossible
                    to obtain very accurate timekeeping from any clock of this construction.</p>
                <p>But before we pass on to the dead escapement, it may be proper to notice an
                    escapement of the recoiling class, which was invented for the purpose of doing
                    without oil, by the famous Harrison, who was at first a carpenter in
                    Lincolnshire, but afterwards obtained the first Government reward for the
                    improvement of chronometers. We shall not however stop to describe it, since it
                    never came into general use, and it is said that nobody but Harrison himself
                    could make it go at all. It was also objectionable on account of its being
                    directly affected by all variations in the force of the clock. It had the
                    peculiarity of being very nearly silent, though the recoil was very great. Those
                    who are curious about such things will find it described in the seventh edition
                    of this <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia.</hi> The recorded performance of one of
                    these clocks, which is given in some accounts of it, is evidently fabulous.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dead Escapements.</hi></p>
                <p>The escapement which has now for a century and a half been considered the best
                    practical clock escapement (though there have been constant attempts to invent
                    one free from the defects which it must be admitted to possess) is the <hi
                    rend="italic">dead escapement,</hi> or, as the French call it with equal
                    expressiveness, <hi rend="italic">l’échappement à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >repos,—</hi> because instead of the recoil of the tooth upon the pallet, which
                    took place in the previous escapements, it falls dead upon the pallet, and
                    reposes there until the pendulum returns and lets it off again. It is
                    represented in fig. 5. It will be observed that the teeth of-the scapewheel have
                    their points set the opposite way to those of the recoil escapement in fig. 4,
                    the wheels themselves both turning the same way; or (as our engraver has
                    represented it), <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> The tooth B is here also
                    represented in the act of dropping on to the right hand pallet as the tooth A
                    escapes from the left pallet. But instead of the pallet having a continuous face
                    as in the recoil escapement, it is divided into two, of which BE on the right
                    pallet, and FA on the left, are called the impulse faces, and BD, FG, the dead
                    faces. The dead faces are portions of circles (not necessarily of the same
                    circle), having the axis of the pallets C for their centre; and the consequence
                    evidently is, that as the pendulum goes on, carrying the pallet still nearer to
                    the wheel than the position in which a tooth falls on to the corner A or B of
                    the impulse and the dead faces, the tooth still rests on the dead faces without
                    any recoil, until the pendulum returns and lets the tooth slide down the impulse
                    face, giving the impulse to the pendulum as it goes.</p>
                <p>The great merit of this escapement is that a moderate variation in the force of
                    the clock train produces a very slight effect in the time of the pendulum. This
                    may be shown in a general way, wdthout resorting to mathematics, thus :—Since
                    tlιe tooth B drops on to the corner of the pallet (or ought to do so)
                    immediately after the tooth A has escaped, and since the impulse will begin at B
                    when the pendulum returns to the same point at which the impulse ceased on A, it
                    follows that the impulse received by the pendulum before and after its vertical
                    position is very nearly the same. N ow that part of the impulse which takes
                    place before zero, or while the pendulum is descending, tends to augment the
                    natural force of gravity on the pendulum, or to make it move faster; but in the
                    descending arc the impulse on the pallets acts against the gravity of the
                    pendulum, and prevents it from being stopped so soon; and so the two parts of
                    the impulse tend to neutralize each other’s disturbing effects on the times of
                    the pendulum, though they both concur in. increasing the arc, or (what is the
                    same thing) maintaining it against the loss from friction and resistance of the
                    air. However, on the whole, the effect of the impulse is to retard the pendulum
                    a little, because the tooth must fall, not exactly on the comer of the pallet,
                    but (for safety) a little above it; and the next impulse does not begin until
                    that same corner of the pallet has come as far as the point of the tooth; in
                    other words, the retarding part of the impulse, or that which takes place after
                    zero, acts rather longer than the accelerating part before zero. Again, the
                    friction on the dead part of the pallets tends to produce the same effect on the
                    time; the arc of course it tends to diminish. For in the descent of the pendulum
                    the friction acts against gravity, but in the ascent with gravity, and so
                    shortens the time; and there is rather less action on the dead part of the
                    pallets in the ascent than in the descent. For these reasons the time of
                    vibration of a pendulum driven by a dead escapement is a little greater than of
                    the same pendulum vibrating the same arc freely; and when you come to the next
                    difference, the variation of time of the same pendulum with the dead escapement,
                    under a moderate variation in the force, is very small indeed, which is not the
                    case in the recoil escapement, for there the impulse begins at each end of the
                    arc, and there is much more of it during the descent of the pendulum than during
                    the ascent from zero to the arc at which the escape takes place and the recoil
                    begins on the opposite tooth; and then the recoil itself acts on the pendulum in
                    its ascent in the same direction as gravity, and so shortens the time. And hence
                    it is that an increase of the arc of the pendulum with a recoil escapement is
                    always accompanied with a decrease of the time. Something more than this general
                    reasoning is requisite in order to compare the real value of the dead escapement
                    with others of equal or higher pretensions, or of the several contrivances that
                    have been suggested for remedying its defects. But we must refer to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks</hi> for details of the
                    mathematical calculations by which the numerical results are obtained, and the
                    relative value of the different kinds of escapements determined.</p>
                <p>It cannot be determined <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> whether cleaning and
                    oiling a dead escapement clock will accelerate or retard it, for reasons
                    explained in those calculations; but it may be said conclusively that the larger
                    the arc is for any given weight × the fall per day, the better the clock will
                    be; and in order to diminish the friction and the necessity for using oil as far
                    as possible, the best clocks are made with jewels (sapphires are the best for
                    the purpose) let into the pallets.</p>
                <p>The pallets are generally made to embrace about one-third of the circumference of
                    the wheel, and it is not at all desirable that they should embrace more; for the
                    longer they are, the longer is the run of the teeth upon them, and the greater
                    the friction. There is a good deal of difference in the practice of clockmakers
                    as to the length of the impulse, or the amount of the angle <hi rend="italic">∙y
                    + β</hi> if the impulse begins at <hi rend="italic">β</hi> before zero and at γ
                    after zero. Sometimes you see clocks in which the seconds hand moves very slowly
                    and rests a very short time, showing that <hi rend="italic">y+β</hi> is large in
                    proportion to 2α; and in others the contrary. The late Mr Dent was decidedly of
                    opinion that a short impulse was the best, probably because there is less of the
                    force of the impulse wasted in friction then. It is not to be forgotten that the
                    scape-wheel tooth does not overtake the face of the pallet immediately, on
                    account of the moment of inertia of the wheel. The wheels of astronomical
                    clocks, and indeed of all English house-clocks, are generally made too heavy,
                    especially the scape-wheel, which, by increasing the moment of inertia, requires
                    a larger force, and consequently has more friction. We shall see presently, from
                    another escapement, how much of the force is really wasted in friction in the
                    dead escapement.</p>
                <p>But before proceeding to other escapements, it is proper to notice a very useful
                    form of the dead escapement, which is adopted in many of the best turret clocks,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">pin-wheel escapement.</hi> Fig. 6 will sufficiently
                    explain its action and construction. Its advantages are—that it does not require
                    so much accuracy as the other; if a pin gets broken it is easily replaced,
                    whereas in the other the wheel is ruined if the point of a tooth is injured; a
                    wheel of given size will work with more pins than teeth, and therefore a <pb

                    sometimes amounts to a savin" of one wheel in the train, and a good deal of
                    friction; and the blow’ on both pallets being downwards, instead of one up and
                    the other down, the action is more steady; all which things are of more
                    consequence in the heavy and rough work of a turret clock than in an
                    astronomical one. The details of the construction are given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rudimentary Treatise.</hi> It has been found expedient to make the
                    dead faces not quite dead, but with a very slight recoil, which rather tends to
                    check the variations of arc, and also the general disposition to lose time if
                    the arc is increased; when so made the escapement is generally called
                    “halfdead.”</p>
                <p>Passing by the various other modifications of the dead escapement which have been
                    suggested and tried with little or no success, we proceed to describe one of an
                    entirely different form, which was patented in 1851 by Mr C. Macdowall, though
                    it appeared afterwards that one very similar had been tried before, but failed
                    from the proportions being badly arranged. It is represented in fig. 7. The
                    scape-wheel is only a small disc with a single pin in it, made of ruby, parallel
                    and very near to the arbor. The disc turns half round at every beat of the
                    pendulum, and the pin gives the impulse on the vertical faces of the pallets,
                    and the dead friction takes place on the horizontal faces. Its advantages
                    are—that the greatest part of the impulse is given directly across the line of
                    centres, and consequently with very little friction; and therefore also, the
                    friction on the dead faces is less than usual, and scarcely any oil is required;
                    moreover, it is very easy to make. But there must be two more wheels in the
                    train, consuming a good deal of the force of the clock-weight by their friction,
                    which rather more than makes up for the friction saved in the escapement. It was
                    applied successfully to watches, but the expense of the additional wheels
                    prevented their àdoption. In order to make the angle of escape not more than 1°,
                    the distance of the pin from the centre of the disc must not be more than ⅞⅛th
                    of the distance of centres of the disc and pallets.</p>
                <p>With the view of getting rid of one of these extra wheels in the train, and that
                    part of the impulse which is least effective and most oblique, Mr Denison
                    shortly afterwards invented the <hi rend="italic">three-legged dead
                    escapement;</hi> which, though afterwards superseded by his <hi rend="italic"
                    >three-legged gravity escapement,</hi> is still worth notice on account of the
                    exceedingly small force which it requires, thereby giving a practical proof of
                    the large proportion of the force which is wasted in friction in all the other
                    impulse escapements.</p>
                <p>In fig. 8, the three long teeth of the scape-wheel are only used for locking on
                    the dead pallets D and E, which are set on the front of the pallet plate; <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi> and B are impulse pallets, being hard bits of steel or
                    jewels set in the pallet plate, and they are acted upon by the three sharp-edged
                    pins which are set in the scape-wheel and point backwards. As soon as the
                    pendulum moves a little further to the left than is here shown, the long tooth
                    will slip past the dead pallet or stop D, and the pin at B will run after and
                    catch the corner of that impulse pallet and drive it until the wheel has turned
                    through 60°, and then it will escape; and by that time the uppermost tooth will
                    arrive at the stop E, and will slide along it as in the common dead escapement,
                    but with α pressure as much less than that which gives the impulse as the points
                    of the teeth are farther from the centre of the wheel than the impulse pins are.
                    But the impulse is here given with so little friction, that even where the
                    points oi the teeth were made identical with the pins, the clock-weight ιequιred
                    to keep the same pendulum with the same train (a common tunet-clock movement),
                    swinging to 2°, was only one-fifth of what had been required with the pin-wheel
                    escapement; and the seapewheel which kept the 6 cwt. pendulum of the Westminster
                    clock going tor half-a-year, until superseded by the gravity escapement, weighed
                    only a sixth of an ounce. It appears also that it would be possible so to adjust
                    the recoil of the half-dead pallets that the time would not be affected by any
                    small variation of the force and the arc; since it was found, that, when a
                    certain amount of recoil was given, the clock gíiiued instead of losing, under
                    an increase of arc due to an increase of clock-weight. And if the force were
                    kept constant by a train remontoire, such as will be described hereafter, there
                    would in fact be nothing capable of altering the arc or the time. But on account
                    of the small depth of intersection of the circles of the pins and the pallets,
                    on which its action depends, this escapement requires very careful adjustment of
                    the pallets, except where they are on a large scale; and considering the
                    superior qualities of the corresponding gravity escapement, it is not likely to
                    be used, except perhaps in clocks required to go a long time, in which economy
                    of force is a matter of consequence. The pallets should be connected with the
                    pendulum by a spring fork (which indeed is advisable in the common dead
                    escapement with a heavy pendulum, especially the pin-wheel escapement), to
                    prevent the risk of their driving backwards against the scape-wheel when it is
                    not in motion, as it will not clear itself. The distance of the centres should
                    be not less than 25 times the radius of the circle of the edges of the impulse
                    pins. «</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Detached Escapements.</hi></p>
                <p>In all the escapements hitherto described the pallets are never out of moving
                    contact with the scape-wheel, and there have been several contrivances for
                    keeping them detached except during the impulse and at the moment of passing a
                    click which is to release the wheel to give the impulse. This is an imitation of
                    the chronometer escapement in watches which is sometimes called the “detached.”
                    There are only two of such contrivances which appear worth special notice. One
                    was proposed by Sir G. Airy in vol. ii. of the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge
                    Transactions,</hi> but· not executed (so far as we know) till a few years ago in
                    the standard sidereal clock at Greenwich, which is reported to go extremely
                    well. Suppose a dead escapement consisting of a single pallet only, say the
                    right hand one of the pin-wheel escapement (fig. 6), for the Greenwich clock has
                    a pin escapement, and that the wheel is locked generally by a spring detent
                    hooking into any one of its teeth, and capable of being lifted or pushed aside
                    by the pendulum, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by a pin somewhere on the single
                    pallet as it passes to the right, but also capable of being passed without being
                    lifted as the pendulum goes to the left. We shall see afterwards how this is
                    done, in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Watches.</hi> Then as the pendulum
                    goes .to the right, it first lifts the detent at about l <hi rend="superscript">
                    0</hi> before zero, and then a tooth or a pin drops on to the pallet and gives
                    the impulse, exactly as in the dead pin-wheel escapement, and with exactly the
                    same amount of friction, substituting only for the dead friction the resistance
                    and friction of passing the detent one way and lifting it the other.</p>
                <p>A different escapement on the same principle but involving less friction was
                    adopted by Sir E. Beckett in a clock described in the later editions of his book
                    as having gone for above ten years very satisfactorily, except that, like all
                    direct impulse escapements, including Sir G. Airy’s, it must vary with the force
                    of the clock train, due to different states of the oil. The scape-wheel (fig. 9)
                    is fivelegged, and has five sharp-edged pins which give the impulse to the hard
                    steel pallet P whenever it passes to the right, provided the wheel is then free
                    to move. It is stopped by the detent DEF, which turns on a pivot F, not in the
                    pen lulum crutch, as it looks in the drawing, but on the clock-frame. When the
                    pendulum going to the right arrives at the position here drawn, the click CE on
                    the crutch pushes the detent aside and so unlocks the wheel, which then gives
                    the impulse, moving through 72° until another tooth arrives at the detent and is
                    stopped, the click having then got far beyond it. When the pendulum returns the
                    click lightly trips over the top of the detent. Here there is practically no
                    friction in giving the impulse, as it is directly across the line of centres, as
                    in the three-legged dead escapement, and the friction of passing <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n29/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0029-0020"/> and unlocking is as little as possible, for the
                    pressure on the locking teeth is less than half of that of the impulse pins</p>
                <p>In practice the pallet P is a separate bit of steel, screwed on, and therefore
                    adjustable. The locking teeth are about 6 inches long from the centre, and the
                    impulse pin-edges ⅛ in. from the centre, which is 7 in. below the top of the
                    pendulum and crutch, so that the impulse begins l <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>
                    before zero and ends l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> after, corresponding each
                    to 36° turn of the scape-wheel. If <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the distance of
                    the pins from the centre and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> the length of the crutch
                    down to the centre, rsin. 36° must=psin. 1°, if you want an impulse of 1° on
                    each side of 0; which makes ^ = 33∙7r. BB are eccentric beat pins for adjusting
                    the beat to whateveí position of the pendulum you please, f.e., you can make it
                    less than 1° before or after zero as you please. In some respects it would be
                    better to have no crutch, but it would be very difficult to make the
                    adjustments. This escapement should evidently be at the bottom of the
                    clock-frame instead of the top, as in the gravity escapements which will be
                    described presently. The back partof the scapewheel is earned by a long cock or
                    bridge within which the crutch also moves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Remontoire or Gravity Escapements.</hi></p>
                <p>A remontoire escapement is one in which the pendulum does not receive its impulse
                    from the scape-wheel, but from some small weight or spring which is lifted or
                    wound up by the scape-wheel at every beat, and the pendulum has nothing to do
                    with the scapewheel except unlocking it. When this impulse is received from a
                    weight the escapement is also called a <hi rend="italic">gravity
                    escapement;</hi> and inasmuch as all the remontoire clock escapements that are
                    worth notice have been gravity escapements, we may use that term for them at
                    once. The importance of getting the impulse given to the pendulum in this way
                    was recognized long before all the properties of the dead escapement, as above
                    investigated, were known. For it was soon discovered that, however superior to
                    the old recoil escapement, it was far from perfect, and that its success
                    depended on reducing the friction of the train and the pallets as far as
                    possible, which involves the necessity of high-numbered pinions and wheels,
                    small pivots, jewelled pallets, and a generally expensive style of workmanship.
                    Accordingly the invention of an escapement which will give a constant impulse to
                    the pendulum, and be nearly free from friction, has been for a century the great
                    problem of clockmaking. We can do no more than shortly notice a very few of the
                    attempts which have been made to solve it. The most simple form of gravity
                    escapement, and the one which will serve the best for investigating their
                    mathematical properties (though it fails in some essential mechanical
                    conditions), is that invented by Mudge. The tooth A of the scape-wheel in fig.
                    10 is resting against the stop or detent <hi rend="italic">a</hi> at the end of
                    the pallet OA, from the axis or arbor of which descends the half fork CP to
                    touch the pendulum. From the other pallet CB descends the other half fork CO.
                    The two arbors are set as near the point of suspension, or top of the pendulum
                    spring, as possible. The pendulum, as here represented, must be moving to the
                    right, and just leaving contact with the left pallet and going to take up the
                    right one; as soon as it has raised that pallet a little it will evidently
                    unlock the wheel and let it turn, and then the tooth B will raise the left
                    pallet until it is caught by the stop <hi rend="italic">b</hi> on that pallet,
                    and then it will stay until the pendulum returns and releases it by raising that
                    pallet still higher. Each pallet therefore descends with the pendulum to a lower
                    point than that where it is taken υp, and the difference between them is
                    supplied by the lifting of each pallet by the clock, which does not act on the
                    pendulum at all; so that the pendulum is independent of all variations of force
                    and friction in the train.</p>
                <p>Again referring to the <hi rend="italic">Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks</hi> for
                    the mathematical investigation of the errors of this class of escapements, or to
                    a paper by the late .T. Μ. Bloxam, in the <hi rend="italic">R.A.S. Memoirs</hi>
                    of 1853, we may say it is proved that though the time of a gravity escapement
                    pendulum differs from that of a free nendulum more than from that of a dead
                    escapement, yet the variations of that difference (which are the real variations
                    of the clock) may be made much less than in any kind of dead escapement.</p>
                <p>The difficulty which long prevented the success of gravity escapements was their
                    liability to what is called <hi rend="italic">tripping.</hi> Referring again to
                    fig. 10, it will be seen at once that if the scape-wheel should happen to move
                    too fast when it is released, the left pallet will not be raised gradually by
                    the tooth B, but be thrown up with a jerk, perhaps so high that the tooth slips
                    past the hook; and then not only will that tooth slip, but several more, and at
                    last when the wheel is stopped it will be running fast, and the points of some
                    of the teeth will probably be bent or broken by catching against the pallets.
                    And even if the pallet is not raised high enough for the tooth to get past or
                    completely trip, it may still be raised so high that the point of the tooth does
                    not rest on the hook exactly where the slope of the pallet ends, but lower, and
                    the friction between them is quite enough to keep the pallet there; and
                    consequently the pendulum does not begin to lift it at the proper angle γ, but
                    at some larger angle; and as the pallet always descends with the pendulum to the
                    same point, the duration of the impulse is increased, and the pendulum made to
                    swing farther. Sir E. Beckett called this <hi rend="italic">approximate
                    tripping,</hi> and though not so injurious to the clock as actual tripping, it
                    is obviously fatal to its accurate performance, though it appears never to have
                    been noticed before he pointed it out in 1851. Various contrivances have been
                    resorted to for preventing tripping. But on account of the delicacy required in
                    all of them, and other objections, none of them ever came into use until the
                    invention of the three-legged and four-legged escapements to be mentioned
                    presently. The only one wliich approached near enough to satisfying all the
                    requisite conditions to be worth description is Mr Bloxam’s, and we accordingly
                    give a sketch of it in fig. 11, which is copied (with a little alteration for
                    distinctness) from his own description of it, communicated in 1853 to the
                    Astronomical. Society, some years after he had had it in action in a clock of
                    his own. This drawing will enable any one conversant with these matters to
                    understand its action. He made the pallet arbors cranked, to embrace the
                    pendulum-spring, so that their centres of motion might coincide with that of the
                    pendulum as nearly as possible,—perhaps an unnecessary refinement; at least the
                    three-legged and four-legged gravity escapements ansiver very well with the
                    pallet arbors set on each side of the top of the spring. The size of the wheel
                    determines the length of the pallets, as they must be at such an angle to each
                    other that the radii of the wheel when in contact with each stop may be at right
                    angles to the pallet arm; and therefore, for a wheel of this size, the depth of
                    locking can only be very small. The pinion in Mr Bloxam’s clock only raises the
                    pallet through 40' at each beat; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the angle which we
                    called γ is only 20'; and probably, if it were increased to anything like AE,
                    the escapement would trip immediately. The</p>
                <p>V <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> δ</hi> two broad pins marked E, F. are the
                    fork-pins. The clock which Mr Bloxam had went very well; but it had an extremely
                    fine train, with pinions of 18; and nobody else appears to have been able to
                    make one to answer. In short Bloxam’s was not a practical solution of the
                    gravity escapement problem, any more than those of Captain Kater, or Hardy, or
                    various other inventors. A few clocks of Hardy’s alone still exist.</p>
                <p>The only gravity escapement or escapements that really have come into common use
                    are the “four-legged” andt]ιe “double three-legged” escapements of Sir E.
                    Beckett. They passed through various phases before settling into the present
                    form, ot which it is unnecessary to say more now than that the first was the
                    single three-legs described in the last edition of this <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopaedia,</hi> which was suggested by his three-legged dead escapement. A
                    five-legged one was also tried; but though it had some slight advantages they
                    are quite overbalanced by disadvantages, and it requires much more delicacy of
                    construction than either the double three-legs or the four-legs which we shall
                    now describe, remarking that the latter is the best for “regulators,” and the
                    formel in large clocks. Fig. 12 is a back view of the escapement part of an
                    astronomical clock with the four-legged wheel; seen from the front the wheel
                    would turn the other way. The long locking teeth are made about 2 inches long
                    from the centre, and the lifting pins, of which there are four pointing forwards
                    and the other four intermediate pointing backwards, are at not more than
                    one-30th of the distance between tb&lt;- <pb break="no"

                    is the top of the pendulum spring to which the pallets CS, CS' converge, though
                    their actual action are a little below C. It is not worth whue to crank them as
                    Mr Bloxam did, in order to make them coincide exactly with the top of the
                    pendulum, as the friction of the beat pins on the pendulum at P is
                    insignificant, and even then would not be quite destroyed. The pallets are not
                    in the same plane, but one is behind and the other in front of the wheel, with
                    one stop pointing backwards and the other forwards to receive the teeth
                    alternately,—it does not matter which; in this figure the stop S is behind and
                    the stop S' forward. The pendulum is now going to the right, and just beginning
                    to lift the right pallet and free the stop S'; then the wheel will begin to turn
                    and lift the other pallet by one of the pins which is now lowest, and which
                    moves through 45° across the line of centres, and therefore lifts with very
                    little friction. It goes on till the tooth now below S reaches S and is stopped
                    there. Meanwhile the pallet CS' goes on with the pendulum as far as it may go,
                    to the end of the arc which we have throughout called α, starting from 7; but it
                    falls with the pendulum again, not only to 7 but to - 7 on the other side of 0,
                    so that the impulse is due to the weight of each pallet alternately falling
                    through 27; and the magnitude of the impulse also depends on the obliqueness of
                    the pallet on the whole, í.¢., on the distance of its centre of gravity from the
                    vertical through C. The defect of the original three-legged escapement was that
                    the pallets were too nearly vertical.</p>
                <p>Another most material element of these escapements with very few teeth is that
                    they admit of a fly K.K. on the scape-wheel arbor to moderate its velocity,
                    which both obviates all risk of tripping, wholly or partially, and also prevents
                    the bang which goes all through the clock where there is no fly. The fly is set
                    on with a friction spring like the common striking-part fly, and should be as
                    long as there is room for, length being much more effective than width. For this
                    purpose the second wheel arbor is shortened and set in a cock fixed on the front
                    plate of the clock, which leaves room for a fly with vanes 2 inches long. The
                    back pivot of the scape-wheel is carried by a long cock behind the back plate,
                    so that the escapement is entirely behind it, close to the pendulum. The pallet
                    arbors are short, as they come just behind the centre wheel, which is here also
                    necessarily above the escapement, and the great wheel arbor on a level with it,
                    and at the left hand (from the front) or the string would be in the way of the
                    fly. No beat screws are required, as the pallets end in mere wires which are
                    easily bent. It is found better to make the tails of the pallets long, rather
                    than short as Mr Bloxam did. It is essential, too, that the angle CSE formed by
                    the tooth and the pallet which is struck upwards should not the least fall short
                    of a right angle, nor the other angle CS'E be the least obtuse, or the
                    escapement may very likely trip. Practically, therefore, it is safer to let CSE
                    be just greater than 90° and CS'E a little less, so that there may not be the
                    least tendency in the blow on the stops to drive the pallets outwards. For the
                    purpose of calculation, however, we must make them both 90° and then it follows
                    that, calling the length of the teeth <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and the distance
                    of centres <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and the length of the pallets from C down
                    to the stops <hi rend="italic">p,</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi> must = <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> sin. 22⅛° and <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >=</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> cos. 22⅜°. Therefore if <hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    is made 2 inches CE or <hi rend="italic">d</hi> will be 5 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> 22, say 5∣ inches, and <hi rend="italic">p —</hi> 4’82. The distance of
                    the lifting pins from the centre will be ⅜ of an inch to make the angle 7 = 1°.
                    It is certainly not desirable to make it more, and even that requires such light
                    pallets for a pendulum of 30 or 40 îb, that ⅛ inch distance from the centre is
                    more convenient as giving the smaller lift, assuming the scape-wheel to be from
                    2 to 2∣ inches in diameter.</p>
                <p>Gravity escapements require more weight than a direct impulse escapement with an
                    equally fine train; and they try the accuracy of the wheelcutting more severely.
                    If there is a weak place in the train of a common clock the scape-wheel only
                    follows the pendulum more weakly; but in a gravity escapement it always has to
                    raise the }&gt;allets, and ought to raise them quickly, and especially in clocks
                    or astronomical purposes where you take its exact time from the sound of the
                    beats, and so the lifting must not lag and sound uneven. Therefore although a
                    fine train of high numbers is not requisite it must be perfectly well cut. And
                    as the force of the weight does not reach the pendulum its increase is of no
                    consequence, within reasonable limits. It is worth while to put large friction
                    wheels under the arbor of the great wheel in all astronomical clocks, and it
                    makes a material difference in the friction on account of the necessary
                    thickness of the winding arbor. A variation of are in dead escapement clocks is
                    sometimes visible betweén the beginning and the end of the week according as the
                    string is nearest to the thick or the thin end of the great arbor, when there
                    are no friction wheels. </p>
                <p>The other form of the gravity escapement, which is now adopted for large clocks
                    by all the best makers, having been first used in the great Westminster clock,
                    is the double three-legged which is shown in fig. 13. The principle of it is the
                    same as of the four-legs; but instead of the pallets being one behind and the
                    other in front of the wheel, with two sets of lifting pins, there are two wheels
                    ABC, <hi rend="italic">dbc,</hi> with the three lifting pins and the two pallets
                    between them like a lantern pinion. One stop B points forward and the other A
                    backward. The two wheels have their teeth set intermediately or 60° apart,
                    though that is not essential, and the angle of 120° may be divided between them
                    in any other proportions, as 70° and 50°, and in that way the pallets may be
                    still more oblique than 30° from the vertical, which however is found enough to
                    prevent tripping even if the fly gets loose, which is more likely to happen from
                    carelessness in large clocks than in astronomical ones. The Westminster one was
                    once found to have been left with the spring loose for several days, and it had
                    not gained a second, and therefore had never trippéd. Tlιe two wheels must be
                    both squared on the arbor, or on a collar common to them both, and must not
                    depend upon the three pins or they will shake loose. If the wheels are set with
                    the teeth equidistant, their centre is evidently twice the length of the teeth
                    below C, the theoretical centre of the pallets. The pins should not be farther
                    from the centre than one-24th of the radius of the wheel; and they should be so
                    placed that the one which is going to lift next may be vertically over the one
                    which has just lifted, and is then holding up the other pallet. The third will
                    then be level with the centre; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> they will stand on
                    the radii which form the acting faces of the teeth of one of the wheels, and
                    half way between those of the other.</p>
                <p>Of course the fly for those escapements in large clocks, with weights heavy
                    enough to drive the hands in all weather, must be much larger than in small
                    ones. For average church clocks with 1∣ sec. pendulum the legs of the
                    scape-wheels are generally made 4 inches long and the fly from 6 to 7 inches
                    long in each vane by 1∣ or 1⅜ wide. For 1⅜ sec. pendulums the scape-wheels are
                    generally made 4⅛ radius. At Westminster they are 6 inches.</p>
                <p>Sir E. Beckett has come to the conclusion that these escapements act better,
                    especially in regulators, if the pallets do not fall quite on the lifting pins,
                    but on a banking, or stops at any convenient place, so as to leave the wheel
                    free at the moment of starting; just as the striking of a common house clock
                    will sometimes fail to start unless the wheel with the pins has a little run
                    before a pin begins to lift the hammer. The best way to manage the banking is to
                    make the beat-pins long enough to reach a little way behind the pendulum, and
                    let the banking be a thin plate of any metal screwed adjustably to the back of
                    the case. This plate cannot well be shown in the drawings together with the
                    pendulum, which, it may be added, should take up one pallet just when it leaves
                    the other.</p>
                <p>It is no longer doubtful that these two escapements are far the best of all for
                    large clocks, the three-legs for very large ones, while the four-legs does very
                    well for smaller turret clocks. And they cost no more to make, though rather
                    more is charged for them by some makers under the pretence that they do. It is
                    absolutely impossible for any large clock exposed to the variations of weather
                    and dust to keep as good time as an ordinary good house clock unless it has
                    either a gravity escapement, or a train remontoire, which last is much more
                    expensive, to intercept the variations of force before they reach the pendulum.
                    And though a detached escapement clock while kept clean and the oil in good
                    condition is as good as a gravity one and perhaps better, the gravity one is
                    less affected by variations of the oil, anJ its rate is altogether more
                    constant. They <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> seem also to have a smaller
                    barometric error.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Going Barrels.</hi></p>
                <p>A clock which is capable of going accurately must have some contrivance to keep
                    it going while you are winding it up. In the old-fashioned house clocks, which
                    were wound up by merely pulling one of the strings, and in which one such
                    winding served for both the going and striking parts, this was done by what is
                    called the end-Γess chain of Huyghens, which consists of a string or chain with
                    the ends joined together, and passing over two pulleys on the arbors of the
                    great wheels, with deep grooves and spikes in them, to prevent the chain from
                    slipping. In one of the two loops or festoons which hang from the upper pulleys
                    is a loose pulley without spikes, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n31/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0031-0022"/> carrving the clock-weight, and in the other a
                    small weight only heavy enough to keep the chain close to the upper pulleys.
                    Now, suppose one of those pulleys to be on the arbor of the great wheel of the
                    striking part, with a ratchet and click, and the other pulley fixed to the arbor
                    of the great wheel of the going part; then (whenever the clock is not striking)
                    you may pull up the weight by pulling down that part of the string which hangs
                    from the other side of the striking part; and vet the weight will be acting on
                    the going part all the time. And it would be just the same if you wound up the
                    striking part and its pulley with a key, instead of pulling the string, and also
                    the same, if there were no striking part at all, but the second pulley were put
                    on a blank arbor, except that in that case, the weight would take twice as long
                    to run down, supposing that the striking part generally requires the same weight
                    × fall as the going part.</p>
                <p>This kind of going barrel, however, is evidently not suited to the delicacy of an
                    astronomical clock; and Harrison’s going ratchet is now universally adopted in
                    such clocks, and also in chronometers and watches for keeping the action of the
                    train on the escapement during the winding. Fig. 14 (in which the same letters
                    are used as in the corresponding parts of fig. 1) shows its construction. The
                    click of the barrel-ratchet R is set upon another larger ratchet-wheel, withits
                    teeth pointing the opposite way, and its click <hi rend="italic">rT</hi> is set
                    in the clock-frame. That ratchet is connected with the great wheel by a spring
                    s√ pressing against the two pins <hi rend="italic">s</hi> in the ratchet and <hi
                    rend="italic">s'</hi> in the wheel. When you wind up the weight (which is
                    equivalent to taking it off), the click Tr prevents that ratchet from turning
                    back or to the right; and as the spring s√ is kept by the weight in a state of
                    tension equivalent to the weight itself it will drive the wheel to the left for
                    a short distance, when its end s is held fast, with the same force as if that
                    end was pulled forward by the weight; and as the great wheel has to move very
                    little during the short time the clock is winding, the spring will keep the
                    clock going long enough.</p>
                <p>In the commoner kind of turret clocks a more simple apparatus is used, which goes
                    by the name of the <hi rend="italic">bolt and shutter,</hi> because it consists
                    of a weighted lever with a broad end, which shuts up the winding-hole until you
                    lift it, and then a spring-bolt attached to the lever, or its arbor, runs into
                    the teeth of one of the wheels, and the weight of the lever keeps the train
                    going until the bolt has run itself out of gear. In the common construction of
                    this apparatus there is nothing to ensure its being raised high enough to keep
                    in gear the whole time of winding, if the man loiters over it. For this purpose
                    Sir E. Beckett has the arbor of the bolt and shutter made to <hi rend="italic"
                    >pump</hi> in and out of gear; and, instead of the shutter covering the
                    winding-hole, it ends in a circular arc advanced just far enough to prevent the
                    key or winder from being put on, by obstructing a ring set on the end of the
                    pipe. In order to get the winder on, you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> raise the
                    lever high enough for the arc to clear the ring. During the two or three minutes
                    which the clock may take to wind, the arc will be descending again behind the
                    ring, so that now you cannot get the winder off again without also pulling the
                    maintaining power out of gear; so that even if "it is constructed to keep in
                    action ten minutes, if required, still it will never remain in action longer
                    than the actual time of winding, j j circular arc must be thick enough, or have
                    a projecting flange added, to it deep enough, to prevent the winder being put on
                    by merely pushing back the maintaining power lever without lifting it.</p>
                <p>In large clocks with a train remontoire, or even with a gravity escapement, it is
                    hardly safe to use a spring going barrel, because it is very likely to be
                    exhausted too much to wind up the remontoire, or raise the gravity pallets,
                    before the winding is finished, if it takes more than two or three minutes;
                    whereas, with the common escapements, the wheel has only to escape, as the
                    pendulum will keep itself going for some time without any impulse.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Equation Clocks.</hi></p>
                <p>It would occupy too much space to describe the various contrivances for making
                    clocks show the variations of solar compared with mean time (called equation
                    clocks), the days of the month, periods of the moon, and other phenomena. The
                    old day of the month clocks required setting at the end of every month which has
                    not 31 days, and have long been obsolete. Clocks are now made even to provide
                    for leap year. But we doubt whether practically anybody ever takes his day of
                    the month from a clock face, especially as the figures are too small to be seen
                    except quite near. Several persons have taken patents for methods of exhibiting
                    the time by figures appearing through a hole in the dial, on the principle of
                    the “numbering machine.” But they do not reflect that no such figures, on any
                    practicable scale, are as conspicuous as a pair of hands; and that nobody really
                    reads the figures on a dial, but judges of the time in a moment from the
                    position of the hands; for which reason the minute hand should be straight and
                    plain, while the hour hand has a “heart” near the end; 12 large marks and 48
                    small ones make a more distinguishable dial than one with figures; and the
                    smaller the figures are the better, as they only tend to obscure the hands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Striking Clocks.</hi></p>
                <p>There are two kinds of striking work used in clocks. The older of them, which is
                    still used in most foreign clocks, and in turret clocks in England also, will
                    not allow the striking of any hour to be either omitted or repeated, without
                    making the next hour strike wrong; whereas, in that which is used in all English
                    house clocks, the number of blows to be struck depends merely on the position of
                    a wheel attached to the going part; and therefore the striking of any hour may
                    be omitted or repeated without deranging the following ones. In turret clocks
                    there is no occasion for the repeating movement; and for the purpose of
                    describing the other, which is called the <hi rend="italic">locking-plate</hi>
                    movement, we may as well refer to fig. 22, which is the front view of a large
                    clock, striking both hours and quarters on this plan. In the hour part (on the
                    left), you observe a bent lever BAH, called the “lifting-piece,” of which the
                    end H has just been left off by the snail on the hour-wheel 40 of the going
                    part; and at the other end there are two stops on the back side of the lever,
                    one behind, and rather below the other; and against the upper one a pin in the
                    end of a short lever 9 B, which is fixed to the arbor of the fly, is now
                    resting, and thereby the train is stopped from running, and the clock from
                    striking any more. The stops are shown on the quarter lifting-piece in the
                    figure (27) of the Westminster clock. We omit the description of the action of
                    the wheels, because it is evident enough. At D may be seen a piece projecting
                    from the lever AB, and dropping into a notch in the wheel 78. That wheel is the
                    locking-wheel or locking-plate; and it has in reality notches such as D all
                    round it, at distances 2, 3, up to 12, from any given point in the
                    circumference, which may be considered as marked off into 78 spaces, that being
                    the number of blows struck in 12 hours. These notches are shown in the
                    locking-plate of the quarter part in fig. 22, but not in the hour part, for want
                    of size to show them distinctly.</p>
                <p>When the arm AB of the lifting-piece is raised by the snail depressing the other
                    end H, a few minutes before the hour, the fly-pin slips past the first of the
                    stops at B, but is stopped by the second and lower one, until the lever is
                    dropped again exactly at the hour. Thus the pin can pass, and would go once
                    round, allowing the train to go on a little; but before it has got once round, A
                    B has been lifted again high enough to carry both stops out of the way of the
                    fly-pin, by means of the cylinder with two slices taken off it, which is set on
                    the arbor of the wheel 90, and on which the end of the lifting-piece rests, with
                    a small roller to diminish the friction. If the clock has only to strike one,
                    the lifting-piece will then drop again, and the fly-pin will be caught by the
                    first stop, having made (according to the numbers of the teeth given in fig. 22)
                    5 turns. But if it has to strike more, the locking-wheel comes into action. That
                    wheel turns with the train, being either driven by pinion 20 on the arbor of the
                    great wheel, or by a gathering pallet on the arbor of the second wheel, like G
                    in fig. 15; and when once the liftingpiece is lifted out of a notch in the
                    locking-plate, it cannot fall again until another notch has come under the bit
                    D; «nd as the distance of the notches is proportioned to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n32/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0032-0023"/> hours, the locking-plate thus determines the
                    number of blows struck. It may occur to the reader, that the cylinder 10 and
                    roller are not really wanted, and that the locking-plate would do as well
                    without; and sometimes clocks are so made, but it is not safe, for the motion of
                    the locking-plate is so slow, that unless everything is very carefully adjusted
                    and no <hi rend="italic">shake</hi> left, the corner of the notch may not have
                    got fairly under the bit D before the fly has got once round, and then the
                    lifting-piece will drop before the clock can strike at all <hi rend="italic">;
                    or</hi> it may hold on too long and strike 13, as St Paul’s clock did once at
                    midnight, when it was heard at Windsor by a sentinel.</p>
                <p>Small French clocks, which generally have the striking part made in this way,
                    very commonly strike the half hours also, by having a wide slit, like that for
                    one o’clock, in the locking-plate at every hour. But such clocks are unfit for
                    any place except a room, as they strike one three times between 12 and 2, and
                    accordingly turret clocks, or even large house clocks, are never made so. Sir E.
                    Beckett has lately introduced the plan of making turret clocks strike one at all
                    the half hours except 12⅛ and 1J, so that any striking of one that is heard
                    between 11 ⅜ and 2∣ must needs be one o’clock. This is done by having a 12-hour
                    wheel driven by the going part, either continuously or by a gathering pallet
                    moving that wheel only once an hour, and it has two high steps which come under
                    another piece like D in the lifting detent a little before 12 J and 1⅜ so as to
                    prevent it falling when let off by the snail. In the English or rack striking
                    movement, to be presently described, the same thing may be done by a kind of
                    star wheel with flat ends to the rays, attached to the 12-hour snail, which will
                    let the rack fall enough to strike one at every half hour, but with two longer
                    rays to prevent it falling at all at 12J and 1⅜; or it would be better to let
                    those rays, by means of an intervening lever, prevent the lifting piece from
                    falling, as that would involve less friction of the tail of the rack.</p>
                <p>In all cases the locking-plate must be considered as divided into as many parts
                    as the number of blows to be struck in 12 hours, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    78, 90, or 88, accordingas half hours are or are not struck; and it must have
                    the same number of teeth, driven by a pinion on the striking wheel arbor of as
                    many teeth as the striking cams, or in the same ratio.</p>
                <p>Fig. 15 is a front view of a common English house clock with the face taken off,
                    showing the repeating or rack striking movement. Here, as in fig. 1, Μ is the
                    hour-wheel, on the pipe of which the minute-hand is set, N the reversed
                    hour-wheel, and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> its pinion, driving the 12-hour wheel
                    H, on whose socket is fixed what is called the snail Y, which belongs to the
                    striking work exclusively. The hammer is raised by the eight pins in the rim of
                    the second wheel in the striking train, in the manner which is obvious.</p>
                <p>The hammer does not quite touch the bell, as it would jar in striking if it did,
                    and prevent the full sound; and if you observe the form of the hammer-shank at
                    the arbor where the spring S acts upon it, you will see that the spring both
                    drives the hammer against the bell when the tail T is raised, and also checks it
                    just before it reaches the bell, and so the blow on the bell is given by the
                    hammer having acquired momentum enough to go a little farther than its place of
                    rest. Sometimes two springs are used, one for impelling the hammer, and the
                    other for checking it. A piece of vulcanized India-rubber, tied round the pillar
                    just where the hammer-shank nearly touches it, forms as good a check spring as
                    anything. But nothing will check the chattering of a heavy hammer, except making
                    it lean forward so as to act, partially at least, by its weight. The pinion of
                    the striking-wheel generally has eight leaves, the same number as the pins; and
                    as a clock strikes 78 blows in 12 hours, the great wheel will turn in that time
                    if it has 78 teeth instead of 96, which the great wheel of the going part has
                    for a centre pinion of eight. The striking-wheel drives the wheel above it once
                    round for each blow, and that wheel drives a fourth (in which you observe a
                    single pin P). six, or any other integral number of turns, for one turn of its
                    own, and that drives a fan-fly to moderate the velocity of the train by the
                    resistance of the air, an expedient at least as old as De Vick’s clock in
                    1370.</p>
                <p>The wheel N is so adjusted that, within a few minutes of the hour, the pin in it
                    raises the <hi rend="italic">lifting-piece</hi> LONF so far that that piece
                    lifts the click C out of the teeth of the <hi rend="italic">rack</hi> BKRV,
                    which immediately falls back (helped by a spring near the bottom) as far as its
                    tail V can go by reason of the snail Y, against which it falls; and it is so
                    arranged that the number of teeth which pass the click is proportionate to the
                    depth of the snail; and as there is one step in the snail for each hour, and it
                    goes round with the hour-hand, the rack always drops just as many teeth as the
                    number of the hour to be struck. This drop makes the noise of “giving warning.”
                    But the clock is not yet ready to strike till the lifting piece has fallen
                    again; for, as soon as the rack was let off the tail of the thing called the <hi
                    rend="italic">gathering pallet</hi> G, on the prolonged arbor of the third
                    wheel, was enabled to pass the pin K of the rack o* which it was pressing
                    before, and the striking train began to move; but before the fourth wheel had
                    got half round, its pin P was caught by the end of the lifting-piece, which is
                    bent back and goes through a hole in the plate, and when raised stands in the
                    way of the pin P, so that the train cannot go on till the lifting-piece drops,
                    which it does exactly at the hour, by the pin N then slipping past it. Then the
                    train is free; the striking wheel begins to lift the hammer, and the gathering
                    pallet gathers up the rack, a tooth for each blow, until it has returned to the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n33/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0033-0024"/> place at which the pallet is stopped by the pin K
                    coming under it. In this figure the lifting-piece is prolonged to F, where there
                    is a string hung to it, as this is the proper place for such a string when it is
                    wanted for the purpose of learning the hour in the dark, and not (as it is
                    generally put) on the click C; for if it is put there and you hold the string a
                    little too long, the clock will strike too many; and if the string accidentally
                    sticks in the case, it will go on striking till it is run down; neither of which
                    things can happen when the string is put on the lifting-piece.</p>
                <p>The snail is sometimes set on a separate stud with the apparatus called a <hi
                    rend="italic">star-wheel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">jumper;</hi> but as this
                    only increases the cost without any advantage that we can see, we omit any
                    further reference to it. On the left side of the frame we have placed a lever
                    <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> with the letters <hi rend="italic">st</hi> below it,
                    and <hi rend="italic">si</hi> above. If it is pushed up to <hi rend="italic"
                    >si,</hi> the other end will come against a pin in the rack, and prevent it from
                    falling, and will thus make the clock silent; and this is much more simple than
                    the old-fashioned “strike and silent” apparatus, which we shall therefore not
                    describe, especially as it is seldom used now.</p>
                <p>If the clock is required to strike quarters, a third “part” or train uf wheels is
                    added on the right hand of the going part; and its general construction is the
                    same as the hour-striking part; only there are two more bells, and two hammers
                    so placed that one is raised a little after the other. If there are more
                    quarter-bells than two, the hammers are generally raised by a chime-barrel,
                    which is merely a cylinder set on the arbor of the striking-wheel (in that case
                    generally the third in the train), with short pins stuck into it in the proper
                    places to raise the hammers in the order required for the tune of the chimes.
                    The quarters are usually made to let off the hour, and this connection may be
                    made in two ways. If the chimes are different in tune for each quarter, and not
                    merely the same tune repeated two, three, and four times, the repetition
                    movement must not be used for them, as it would throw the tunes into confusion,
                    but the old locking-plate movement, as in turret clocks; and therefore, if we
                    conceive the hour lifting-piece connected with the quarter lockingplate, as it
                    is with the wheel N, in fig. 15, it is evident that the pin will discharge the
                    hour striking part as the fourth quarter finishes.</p>
                <p>But where the repetition movement is required for the quarters, the matter is not
                    quite so simple. The principle of it may shortly be described thus. The quarters
                    them selves have a rack and snail, &amp;c., just like the hours, except that the
                    snail is fixed on one of the hour-wheels Μ or N, instead of on the twelve-hour
                    wheel, and has only four steps in it. Now suppose the quarter-rack to be so
                    placed that when it falls for the fourth quarter (its greatest drop), it falls
                    against the hour lifting-piece some where between O and N, so as to raise it and
                    the click C. Then the pin Q will be caught by the click Q7, and so the
                    lifting-piece will remain up until all the teeth of the quar ter-rack are
                    gathered up; and as that is done, it may be made to disengage the click Qy, and
                    so complete the letting off the hour striking part. This click Qç has no
                    existence except where there are quarters.</p>
                <p>These quarter clocks are sometimes made so as only to strike the quarters at the
                    time when a string is pulled as by a person in bed, just like repeating watches,
                    which are rarely made now, on account of the difficulty of keeping in order such
                    a complicated machine in such a small space. In this case, the act of pulling
                    the string to make the clock strike winds up the quarter-barrel, which is that
                    of a spring clock (not yet described), as far as it is allowed to be wound up by
                    the position of a snail on the hour wheel against which a lever is pulled, just
                    as the tail of the common striking-rack falls against the snail on the
                    twelve-hour wheel; and it is easy to see that the number of blows struck by the
                    two quarter hammers may thus be made to depend upon the extent to which the
                    spring that drives the train is wound up; and it may even be made to indicate
                    half-quarters; for instance, if the snail has eight steps in it, the seventh of
                    them may be just deep enough to let the two hammers strike three times, and the
                    first of them once more, which would indicate 7∣ minutes to the hour. It is
                    generally so arranged that the hour is struck first, and the quarters
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alarums.</hi></p>
                <p>In connection with these bedroom clocks we ought to mention <hi rend="italic"
                    >alarums.</hi> Perhaps the best illustration of the mode of striking an alarum
                    is to refer to either of the recoil escapements (figs. 3 and 4). If you suppose
                    a short hammer instead of a long pendulum attached to the axis of the pallets,
                    and the wheel to be driven with sufficient force, it will evidently swing the
                    hammer rapidly backwards and forwards; and the position and length of the hammer
                    head may be so adjusted as to strike a bell inside, first on one side and then
                    on the other. Then as to the mode of letting off the alarum at the time
                    required; if it was always to be let off at the same time, you would only have
                    to set a pin in the twelve-hour wheel at the proper place to raise the
                    lifting-piece which lets off the alarum at that time. But as you want it to be
                    capable of alteration, this discharging pin must beset in another wheel (without
                    teeth), which rides with a friction-spring on the socket of the twelve-hour
                    wheel, with a small movable dial attached to it, having figures so arranged with
                    reference to the pin that whatever figure is made to come to a small pointer set
                    as a tail to the hour hand, the alarum shall be let off at that hour. The
                    letting off does not require the same apparatus as a common striking part,
                    because an alarum has not to strike a definite number of blows, but to go on
                    till it is run down; and therefore the lifting-piece is nothing but a lever with
                    a stop or hook upon it, which, when it is dropped, takes hold of one of the
                    alarum wheels, and lets them go while it is raised high enough to disengage it.
                    You must of course not wind up an alarum till within twelve hours of the time
                    when it is wanted to go off.</p>

                    and awake all the night; it is a clock with a set of spikes, generally 48 or 96,
                    sticking out all round the dial, and a handle somewhere in the case, by pulling
                    which you can press in that one of the spikes which is opposite to it, or to
                    some lever connected with it, for a few minutes; and it will be observed, that
                    this wheel of spikes is carried round with the hour-hand, which in these clocks
                    is generally a twenty-four hour one. It is evident that every spike which is
                    seen still sticking out in the morning indicates that at the particular time to
                    which that spike belongs the watchman was not there to push it in—or at any
                    rate, that he did not; and hence its name. At some other part of their circuit,
                    the inner ends of the pins are carried over a roller or an inclined plane which
                    pushes them out again ready for business the next night.</p>

                <p>Hitherto we have supposed all clocks to be kept going by a weight. But, as is
                    well known, many of them are driven by a spring coiled up in a barrel. In this
                    respect they differ nothing from watches, and therefore for consideration of the
                    construction of parts belonging to the spring reference is made to the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Watches.</hi> It mav.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0034-0025"/>
                <p>however, ho mentioned here that the earliest form in which a spring seems to have
                    been used was not that of a spiral ribbon of steel rolled up, but a straight
                    stiff spring held fast to the clock frame at one end, and a string from the
                    other end going round the barrel, which was wound up; but such a spring would
                    have a very small range. Spring clocks are generally resorted to for the purpose
                    of saving length; for as clocks are generally made in England, it is impossible
                    to make a weight-clock capable of going a week, without either a case nearly 4
                    feet high, or else the weights so heavy as to produce a great pressure and
                    friction on the arbor of the great wheel. But this arises from nothing but the
                    heaviness of the wheels and the badness of the pinions used in most English
                    clocks, as is amply proved by the fact that the American and Austrian clocks go
                    a week with smaller weights and much less fall for them than the English ones,
                    and the American ones with no assistance from fine workmanship for the purpose
                    of diminishing friction, as they are remarkable for their want of what is called
                    “finish” in the machinery, on which so much time and money is wasted in English
                    clock-work.</p>
                <p>All the ornamental French clocks, and all the short “dials,” as those clocks are
                    called which look no larger than the dial, or very little, and many of the
                    American clocks, are made with springs. Indeed we might omit the word “French”
                    after “ornamental;” for the manufacture of ornamental clocks has practically
                    ceased in England, and we are losing more of all branches of the horological
                    trade yearly, as we are unable, <hi rend="italic">iae.,</hi> our workmen do not
                    choose, to compete with the cheaper labour of the· Continent, or with the miιcll
                    more systematic manufacture of clocks and watches by machinery in America than
                    exists here, though labour there is much dearer. It is true that most of the
                    American clocks are very bad, indeed no better than the old-fashioned Dutch
                    clocks (really German) made most ingeniously of wood and wire, besides the
                    wheels. But some better American ones are also made now, and they will no doubt
                    improve as their machine made watches have done. Though this has been going on
                    now for 30 years and more, no steps appear to have been taken to establish
                    anything of the kind in this country, except that watch “movements,” which means
                    only the wheels set in the frame, are to a certain extent made by machinery in
                    Lancashire and Coventry for the trade, who finish them in London and elsewhere.
                    That is the real meaning of the advertisements of “machine-made watches”
                    here.</p>
                <p>The French clocks have also been greatly improved within the same time, and are
                    now, at least some, of them, quite different both in construction and execution
                    from the old-fashioned French drawing-room clock which generally goes worse than
                    the cheapest “Dutchman,” and is nearly always striking wrong, because they have
                    the locking-plate striking work, which if once let to strike wrong, either by
                    altering the hands or letting it run down, cannot be set right again except by
                    striking the hours all round, which few people know how to do, even if they can
                    get their fingers in behind the clock to do it, .The Americans have a slight
                    wire hanging down a little below the dial which you can push up and so make the
                    clock strike. All lockingplate clocks ought to have a similar provision.</p>
                <p>There is not much use in having clocks to go more than a little over eight days
                    (to allow the possible forgetting of a day), as a week is the easiest period to
                    remember. The French spring-clocks generally go a fortnight, but most people
                    wind them up weekly. Occasionally English clocks are made to go a month by
                    adding another wheel; and even a year by adding two. But in the latter case it
                    is better to have two barrels and great wheels acting on opposite sides of a
                    very strong pinion between them, as it both reduces the strain on the teeth and
                    the friction of the pivot of that pinion. Such clocks sometimes have a 5 feet or
                    l¾ sec. pendulum, as the case must be a tall one. The great thing is to make the
                    scape-wheel light, and even then you can never get more than a small arc of
                    vibration, which is undesirable for the reason given above, and such a long
                    train is peculiarly sensitive to friction.</p>
                <p>In the American clocks the pinions are all of the kind called <hi rend="italic"
                    >lantern pinions,</hi> which have their leaves made only of bits of wire set
                    round the axis in two collars; and, oddly enough, they are the oldest form of
                    pinion, as well as the best, acting with the least friction, and requiring the
                    least accuracy in the wheels, but now universally disused in all English and
                    French house clocks. The American clocks prove that they are not too expensive
                    to be used with advantage when properly made; although, so long as there are no
                    <hi rend="italic">manufactories</hi> of clocks here as there are in America, it
                    may be cheaper to make pinions in the slovenly way of cutting off all the ribs
                    of a piece of pinion wire, so as to reduce it to a pinion a quarter of an inch
                    wide, and an arbor 2 or 3 inches long. On the whole, the common English house
                    clocks, so far from having improved with the general progress of machinery, are
                    worse than they were fifty years ago, and at the same time are of such a price
                    that they are being fast driven out of the market by the American plain clocks
                    and by the French and German ornamental ones.</p>
                <p>Clocks have been contrived to wind themselves up by the alternate expansion and
                    contraction of mercury and other fluids, under variations of temperature.
                    Wind-mill clocks might be made still more easily, the wind winding up a weight
                    occasionally. Water-clocks have also been made,— not on the clepsydra principle,
                    where the flow of the water determined the time very inaccurately; but the water
                    is merely the weight, flowing from a tap into a hollow horizontal axis, and
                    thence by branches into buckets, which empty themselves as they pass the lowest
                    point of the circle in which they move, or flowing directly into buckets, so
                    emptying themselves. But the slopping of the water, and the rusting of any parts
                    made of iron, and the cost of the water itself always running, destroy all
                    chance of such things coming into use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Electrical Clocks.</hi></p>
                <p>It should be understood that under this term two, or wo may say three, very
                    different things are comprehended. The first is a mere clock movement, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the works of a clock without either weight or pendulum,
                    which is kept going by electrical connection with some other clock of any kind
                    (these ought to be called <hi rend="italic">electrical dials,</hi> not clocks);
                    the second is a clock with a weight, but with the escapement worked by
                    electrical connection with another clock instead of by a pendulum; and the third
                    alone are truly <hi rend="italic">electrical clocks,</hi> the motive power being
                    electricity instead of gravity; for although they have a pendulum, which of
                    course swings by the action of gravity, yet the requisite impulse for
                    maintaining its vibrations against friction and resistance of the air is
                    supplied by a galvanic battery, instead of by the winding up of a weight.</p>
                <p>If you take the weight off a common recoil escapement clock, and work the pallets
                    backward and forwards by hand, you will drive the hands round, only the wrong
                    way; cônsequently, if the escapement is reversed, and the pallets are driven by
                    magnets alternatively made and unmade, by the well-known method of sending an
                    electrical current through a wire coil set round a bar of soft iron, the contact
                    being made at every beat of the pendulum of a standard clock, the clock without
                    the weight will evidently keep exact time with the standard clock; and the only
                    question is as to the best mode of making the contact, which is not <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n35/mode/1up"

                    various plans apparently succeeded for a time, and were mechanically perfect,
                    not one has succeeded permanently; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the contact
                    sometimes fails to produce the current of sufficient strength to lift the weight
                    or spring on which the driving of the subordinate clock depends. It is therefore
                    unnecessary to repeat the description of the various contrivances for this
                    purpose by Wheatstone and others.</p>
                <p>The first person who succeeded in making one clock regulate or govern others by
                    electricity, Mr R. L. Jones,'accordingly abandoned the idea of electrical
                    driving of one clock by another; and instead of making the electrical connection
                    with a standard clock (whether itself an electrical one or not) drive the
                    others, he makes it simply let the pallets or the pendulum of the subordinate
                    clock, driven by a weight or spring, be influenced by attraction at every beat
                    of the standard clock; and, by way of helping it, the pallets are made what we
                    called half-dead in describing the dead escapement, except that they have no
                    impulse faces, but the dead faces have just so much slope that they would
                    overcome their own friction, and escape of themselves under the pressure of the
                    clock train, except while they are held by the magnet, which is formed at every
                    beat of the standard clock, or at every half-minute contact, if it is intended
                    to work the dials by half-minute jumps. This plan has been extensively used for
                    regulating distant clocks from Greenwich Observatory.</p>
                <p>The first electrical <hi rend="italic">clocks,</hi> in the proper sense of the
                    term, were invented by Mr Bain in 1840, who availed himself of the discovery of
                    Oersted that a coil of insulated wire in the form of a hollow cylinder is
                    attracted in one direction or the other by a permanent magnet within the coil,
                    not touching it, when the ends of the coil are connected with the poles of a
                    battery; and if the connection is reversed, or the poles changed, so that the
                    current at one time goes one way through the coil from the - or copper plate to
                    the + or zinc plate, and at other times the other way, the direction of the
                    attraction is reversed. Mr Bain made the bob of his pendulum of such a coil
                    enclosed in a brass case so that it looked like a hollow brass cylinder lying
                    horizontal and moving in the direction of its own axis, and in that axis stood
                    the ends of two permanent magnets with the north poles pointed at each other and
                    nearly touching, as in the right hand part of fig. 16. The pendulum pushed a
                    small sliding bar backwards and forwards so as to reverse the current through
                    the coil as the pendulum passed the middle of the arc, and so caused each magnet
                    in turn to attract the bob. But this also failed practically, and especially in
                    time-keeping, as might have been expected, from the friction and varying
                    resistance of the bar to the motion of the pendulum, and in the attractions.</p>
                <p>Mr Ritchie of Edinburgh, however, has combined the principle of Bain’s and
                    Jones’s clocks in a manner which is testified to be completely successful in
                    enabling one standard clock to control and keep going any number of subordinate
                    ones, which do not require winding up as Jones’s do, but are driven entirely by
                    their pendulums. This differs from Wheatstone’s plan in this, that his
                    subordinate clocks had no pendulum swinging naturally and only wanting its
                    vibrations helping a little, but the pallets had to be made to vibrate solely by
                    the electrical force. Thefigures are taken from Mr Ritchie’s paper read before
                    the Royal Scottish Society of Arts in 1873. The controlled pendulum P is that
                    just now described as Bain’s (seen in fig. 17 the other way, across the plane of
                    vibration); the rod and spring are double, and the wire <hi rend="italic"
                    >cd</hi> is connected with one spring and rod (say the front one) and the wire
                    <hi rend="italic">d'e</hi> with the other; so that the current has to pass down
                    one spring and one rod and through the coil in the bob and up the other spring.
                    The other pendulum O of the normal or standard clock is a common one, except
                    that it touches two slight contact springs <hi rend="italic">a, b</hi>
                    alternately, and so closes the circuit on one side and leaves it broken on the
                    other. When that pendulum touches <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the B battery does
                    nothing, and the - current from the battery A passes by <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    to <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and down the <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> spring and rod and up through <hi rend="italic">d'</hi> to
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and back again to + of A. But when the standard
                    pendulum O touches <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the A battery does nothing, and the
                    current from - to + of the B battery goes the other way, through the controlled
                    pendulum and its coil. The two fixed magnets SN, NS consequently attract the
                    coil and bob each way alternately. And even if the current is occasionally weak,
                    the natural swing of the pendulum will keep it going for a short time with force
                    enough to drive its clock through a reversed escapement; and further, if that
                    pendulum is naturally a little too fast or too slow the attraction from the
                    standard pendulums will retard or accelerate it. In practice, however, it is
                    found better not to make the contact by springs, which, however light, disturb
                    the pendulum a little, but by a wheel in the train making and breaking contact
                    at every beat; and if the clock has a gravity escapement there is no danger of
                    this friction affecting the pendulum at all.</p>
                <p>In order to get the machinery into a smaller compass than a 39 inches pendulum
                    requires, Mr Ritchie uses a short and slow pendulum with two bobs, one above and
                    the other below the suspension, as shown in fig. 17. Such a pendulum, like a
                    common scale-beam, may be made to vibrate as slow as you like by bringing <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n36/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0036-0027"/> the suspension nearer to the centre of gravity of
                    the whole mass. But they are quite unfit for independent clock pendulums, having
                    very little regulating power, or what we may call force of vibration. He applies
                    magnets to both the bobs, so as to double the electrical force. Fig. 17 is the
                    section across the plane of vibration.</p>
                <p>Fig. 18 shows the kind of reversed escapement, or “propelment,” used with these
                    short and slow pendulums. The pendulum here is returning from the extreme right,
                    and has just deposited the right hand pallet BCD with its end D pressing on a
                    tooth of the scape-wheel, but unable to turn it because another tooth is held by
                    the stop G on the left pallet. As soon as the pendulum lifts that pallet the
                    weight of the other pallet turns the wheel, until a tooth falls against the stop
                    C. When the pendulum returns from the left the left pallet presses on a tooth at
                    E but cannot turn the wheel because it is yet held by C, until that is released.
                    In order to prevent the hands being driven back by wind where they are exposed
                    to it, a click is added to the teeth. The wind cannot drive the hands forward by
                    reason of the stops C, G.</p>

                <p>Seeing that a clock—at least the going part of it—is a machine in which the only
                    work to be done is the overcoming of its own friction and the resistance of the
                    air, it is evident, that when the friction and resistance are much increased, it
                    may become necessary to resort to expedients for neutralizing their effects
                    which are not required in a smaller machine with less friction. In a turret
                    clock the friction is enormously increased by the great weight of all the parts;
                    and the resistance of the wind, and sometimes snow, to the motion of the hands,
                    further aggravates the difficulty of maintaining a constant force on the
                    pendulum; and besides that, there is the exposure of the clock to the dirt and
                    dust which are always found in towers, and of the oil to a temperature which
                    nearly or quitô freezes it all through the usual cold of winter. This last
                    circumstance alone will generally make the arc of the pendulum at least half a
                    degree more in summer than in winter; and inasmuch as the time is materially
                    affected by the force which arrives at the pendulum, as well as the friction on
                    the pallets when it does arrive there, it is evidently impossible for any turret
                    clock of the ordinary construction, especially with large dials, to keep any
                    constant rate through the various changes of temperature, weather, and dirt, to
                    which it is exposed.</p>
                <p>Within the last twenty years all the best clockmakers have accordingly adopted
                    the four-legged or three-legged gravity escapement for turret clocks above the
                    smallest size; though inferior ones still persist in using the dead escapement,
                    which is incapable of maintaining a constant rate under a variable state of
                    friction, as has been shown before. When the Astronomer Royal in 1844 laid down
                    the condition for the Westminster clock that it was not to vary more than a
                    second a day, the London Company of Clockmakers pronounced it impossible, and
                    the late Mr Vulliamy, who had been for many years the best maker of large
                    clocks, refused to tender for it at those terms. The introduction of the gravity
                    escapement enabled the largest and coarsest looking clocks with cast-iron wheels
                    and pinions to go for long periods with a variation much nearer a second a week
                    than a second a day. And the consequence was that the price for large clocks was
                    reduced to about one-third of what it used to be for an article inferior in
                    performance though more showy in appearance.</p>
                <p>Another great alteration, made by the French clockmakers before ours, was in the
                    shape and construction of the frame. The old form of turret clock-frame was that
                    of a large iron cage, of which some of the vertical bars take off, and are
                    fitted with brass bushes for the pivots of the wheels to run in; and the wheels
                    of each train, <hi rend="italic">iae.,</hi> the striking, the going, and the
                    quarter trains, have their pivots all in the vertical bar belonging to that
                    part. Occasionally they advanced so far as to make the bushes movable, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> fixed with screws instead of rivetted in, so that one
                    wheel may be taken out without the others. This cage generally stood upon a
                    wooden stool on the floor of the clock room. The French clock makers long ago
                    saw the objections to this kind of arrangement, and adopted the plan of a
                    horizontal frame or bed, cast all in one piece, and with such smaller frames or
                    cocks set upon it as might be required for such of the wheels as could not be
                    conveniently got on the same level. The accompanying sketch (fig. 19) of the
                    clock of Meanwood church, near Leeds, one of the first on that plan, will
                    sufficiently explain it. All the wheels of the going part, except the great
                    wheel, are set in a separate frame called the movement frame, which is complete
                    in itself, and light enough to take off and carry away entire, so that any
                    cleaning or repairs required in the most delicate part of the work can be done
                    in the clock factory, and the great wheel, barrel, and rope need never be
                    disturbed at all. Even this movement frame is now dispensed with; but we will
                    reserve the description of the still more simple kind of frame in which <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> the wheels lie on or under the great horizontal bed,
                    until we have described train remontoires.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Train Remontoires.</hi></p>
                <p>Although, the importance of these is lessened by the invention of an effective
                    gravity escapement, they are still occasionally used, and are an essential part
                    of the theory of clockmaking. It was long ago perceived that all the variations
                    of force, except friction of the pallets, might be cut off by making the force
                    of the scape-wheel depend on a small weight or spring wound up at short
                    intervals by the great clock weight and the train of wheels.</p>
                <p>This also has the advantage of giving a sudden and visible motion to the minute
                    hand at those intervals, say of half a minute, when the remontoire work is let
                    off, so that time may be taken from the minute hand of a large public clock as
                    exactly as from the seconds hand of an astronomical clock; and besides that,
                    greater accuracy may be obtained in the letting off of the striking part. We
                    believe the first maker of a large clock with a train remontoire was Mr Thomas
                    Reid of Edinburgh, who wrote the article on clocks in the first edition of this
                    <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia,</hi> which was afterwards expanded into a
                    well-known book, in which his remontoire was described. The scape-wheel was
                    driven by a small weight hung by a Huyghens’s endless chain, of which one of the
                    pulleys was fixed to the arbor, and the other rode upon the arbor, with the
                    pinion attached to it, and the pinion was driven and the weight wound, up by the
                    wheel below (which we will call the third wheel), as follows. Assuming the
                    scape-wheel to turn in a minute, its arbor has a notch cut half through it on
                    opposite sides in two places near to each other; on the arbor of the wheel,
                    .which turns in ten minutes, suppose, there is another wheel with 20 spikes
                    sticking out of its rim, but alternately in two different planes, so that one
                    set of spikes can only pass through one of the notches in the scape-wheel arbor,
                    and the other set only through the other. Whenever then the scape-wheel
                    completes a half turn, one spike <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n37/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0037-0028"/> is let go, and the third wheel is able to move,
                    and with it the whole clock-train and the hands, until the next spike of the
                    other set is stopped by the scape-wheel arbor; at the same time the pinion on
                    that arbor is turned half round, winding up the remontoire weight, but without
                    taking its pressure off the scape-wheel. Reid says that, so long as this
                    apparatus was kept in good order, the clock went better than it did after it was
                    removed in consequence of its getting out of order from the constant banging of
                    the spikes against the</p>
                <p>The Royal Exchange clock was at first made in 1844 on the same principle, except
                    that, instead of the endless chain, an internal wheel was used, with the spikes
                    set on it externally, which is one of the modes by which an occasional secondary
                    motion may be given to a wheel without disturbing its primary and regular
                    motion. A drawing of the original Exchange clock remontoire is given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks;</hi> but for the reasons which
                    will appear presently, it need not be repeated here, especially as the following
                    is a more simple arrangement of a gravity train remontoire, much more frequently
                    used in principle. Let E in fig. 20 be the scape-wheel turning in a minute, and
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> its pinion, which is driven by the wheel D having a
                    pinion <hi rend="italic">d</hi> driven by the wheel C, which we may suppose to
                    turn in an hour. The arbors of the scape-wheel and hour-wheel are distinct,
                    their pivots meeting in a bush fixed somewhere between the wheels. The pivots of
                    the wheel D are set in the frame AP, which rides on the arbors of the
                    hour-wheeland scape-wheel, or on another short arbor between them. The
                    hour-wheel also drives another wheel G, which again drives the pinion <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> on the arbor which carries the two arms/ A,/B; and on the
                    same arbor is set a fly with a ratchet, like a common striking fly, and the
                    numbers of the teeth are so arranged that the fly will turn once for each turn
                    of the scapewheel. The ends of the remontoire arms <hi rend="italic">f L,f</hi>
                    B are capable of alternately passing the notches cut half through the arbor of
                    the scape-wheel, as those notches successively come into the proper position at
                    the end of every half minute; as soon as that happens the hour-wheel raises the
                    movable wheel D and its frame through a small angle; but nevertheless, that
                    wheel keeps pressing on the scape-wheel as if it were not moving, the point of
                    contact of the wheel C and the pinion <hi rend="italic">d</hi> being the fulcrum
                    or centre of motion of the lever A ¢í P. It will be observed that the remontoire
                    arms/A, ∕ B have springs set on them to diminish the blow on the scapewheel
                    arbor, as it is desirable not to have the fly so large as to make the morion of
                    the train, and consequently of the hands, too slow to be distinct. For the same
                    reason it is not desirable to drive the fly by an endless screw, as was done in
                    most of the French clocks ’ on this principle in the 1851 Exhibition. There is
                    also an enormous loss of force by friction in driving an endless screw, and
                    consequently considerable, risk of the clock stopping either from cold or from
                    wasting of tne oil.</p>
                <p>Another kind of remontoire is on the principle of one Revelled wheel lying
                    between two others at right angles to it. The first of the bevelled wheels is
                    driven by the train, and the third is fixed to the arbor of the scape-wheel; and
                    the intermediate bevelled wheel, of any size, rides on its arbor at right angles
                    to the other two arbors which are in the same line The scape-wheel will
                    evidently turn with the same average velocity as the first bevelled wheel,
                    though the intermediate one may move up and down at intervals. The transverse
                    arbor which carries it is let off and lifted a little at half-minute intervals,
                    as in the remontoire just now described; and it gradually works down as the
                    scape-wheel turns under its pressure, until it is freed again and lifted by the
                    clock train.</p>
                <p>In all these gravity remontoires, however, it must have been observed that we
                    only get rid of the friction of the heavy parts of ’ he train and the dial-work,
                    and that the scape-wheel is still subject to the friction of the remontoire
                    wheels, which, though much less than the other, is still something considerable.
                    And° accordingly, attempts have frequently been made to drive the scape-wheel by
                    a spiral spring, like the mainspring of a watch. One of these was described in
                    the 7th edition of this <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia;</hi> and Sir G. Aſry, a
                    few years ago, invented another on the same principle, of which two or three
                    specimens were made. But it was found, and indeed it ought to have been
                    foreseen, that these contrivances were all defective in the mode of attaching
                    the spring, by making another wheel or pinion ride on the arbor of the
                    scape-wheel, which produced a very mischievous friction, and so only increased
                    the expense of the dock without any corresponding advantage; and the consequence
                    was that spring remontoires, and remontoires in general, had come to be regarded
                    as a mere delusion. It has however now been fully proved that they are not so;
                    for, by a very simple alteration of the previous plans, a spiral spring
                    remontoire may be made to act with absolutely no friction, except that of the
                    scape-wheel pivots, and the letting-off springs A, B, in the last drawing. The
                    Meanwood clock (fig. 17) was the first of this kind; but it will be necessary to
                    give a separate view of the remontoire work.</p>
                <p>In the next figure (21), A, B, D, E, <hi rend="italic">e,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> are the same things as in fig. 20. But <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> the
                    scape-wheel pinion, is no longer fixed to the arbor, nor does it ride on the
                    arbor, as had been the case in all the previous spring remontoires, thereby
                    producing probably more friction than was saved in other respects; but it rides
                    on a stud <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> which is set in the clock-frame. On the face
                    of the pinion is a plate, of which the only use is to carry a pin <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> (and consequently its shape is immaterial), and in front of
                    the plate is set a bush <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> with a hole through it, of
                    which half is occupied by the end of the stud <hi rend="italic">k</hi> to which
                    the bush is fixed by a small pin, and the other half is the pivot-hole for the
                    scape-wheel arbor. Un the arbor is set the remontoire spring s (a moderate-sized
                    musical-box spring is generally used) of which the outer end is bent into a loop
                    to take hold of the pin <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> In fact, there are two pins at
                    <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> one a little behind the other, to keep the coils of
                    the spring from touching each other. Now, it is evident vhat the spring may be
                    wound up half or a quarter of a turn at the proper intervals without taking the
                    force off the scape-wheel, and also without affecting it by any friction
                    whatever. When the scape-wheel turns in a minute, the le"tting-off would be done
                    as before described, by a couple of notches in the scape-wheel arbor, through
                    which the spikes A, B, as in fig. 20, would pass alternately. But in clocks with
                    only three wheels in the train it is best to make the scape-wheel turn in two
                    minutes, and consequently you would want four notches and four remontoire arms,
                    and the fly would only make a quarter of a turn. And therefore Sir E. Beckett,
                    who invented this remontoire, made the following provision for diminishing the
                    friction of the letting-off work. The fly pinion ∕ has only half the number of
                    teeth of the scape-wheel pinion, being a lantern pinion of 7 or 8, while the
                    other is a leaved pinion of 14 or 16, and therefore the same wheel D will
                    properly drive both, as will be seen hereafter. The scape-wheel arbor ends in a
                    cylinder about ⅛ inch in diameter, with two notches at right angles cut in its
                    face, one of them narrow and deep, and the other broad and shallow, so that a
                    long and thin pin B can pass only through one, and a broad and short pin A
                    through the other. Consequently, at each quarter of a turn of the scape-wheel,
                    the remontoire fly, on which the pins A, B are set on springs, as in fig. 20,
                    can turn half round. It is set on its arbor /by a square ratchet and click,
                    which enables you to adjust the spring to the requisite tension to obtain the
                    proper vibration of the pendulum. A better construction, afterwards introduced,
                    is to make the fly separate from the letting-off arms, whereby the blow on the
                    cylinder is diminished, the fly being allowed to go on as in the gravity
                    escapement. The performance of this is so much more satisfactory than that of
                    the gravity remontoires, that Mr Dent altered that of the Royal Exchange to a
                    spring one in 1854, which had the effect of reducing the clock-weight by
                    one-third, besides improving the rate of going. It should be observed, however,
                    that even a spring remontoire requires a larger weight than the same clock
                    without one; but as none of that additional force reaches the pendulum, that is
                    of no <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n38/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0038-0029"/> consequence. The variation of force of the
                    remontoire spring from temperature, as it only affects the pendulum through the
                    medium of the dead escapement, is far too small to produce any appreciable
                    effect; and it is found that clocks of this kind, with a compensated pendulum 8
                    feet long, and of about 2 cwt., will not vary above a second a month, if the
                    pallets are kept clean and well oiled. No turret clock without either a train
                    remontoire or a gravity escapement will approach that decree of accuracy. The
                    King's Cross clock, which was the first of this kind, went with a variation of
                    about a second in three weeks in the 1851 Exhibition, and has sometimes gone for
                    two months without any discoverable error, though it wants the jewelled pallets
                    which the Exchange clock has. But these clocks require more care than gravity
                    escapement ones, and are certain to be spoilt as soon as they get into ignorant
                    or careless hands; and consequently the gravity ones have superseded them.</p>
                <p>The introduction of this remontoire led to another very important alteration in
                    the construction of large clocks. Hitherto it had always been considered
                    necessary, with a view to diminish the friction ns far as possible, to make the
                    wheels of brass or gun-metal, with the teeth cut in an engine. The French
                    clockmakers had begun to use cast-iron striking parts, and cast-iron wheels had
                    been occasionally used in the going part of inferior clocks for the sake of
                    cheapness; but they had never been used in any clock making pretensions to
                    accuracy before the one just mentioned. In consequence of the success of that,
                    it was determined by the astronomer royal and Mr Denison, who were jointly
                    consulted by the Board of Works about the great Westminster clock in 1852, to
                    alter the original requisition for gun-metal wheels there to cast-iron. Some
                    persons expressed their apprehension of iron wheels rusting; but nothing can be
                    more unfounded, for the non-acting surfaces are always painted, and the acting
                    surfaces oiled. A remarkable proof of the folly of the clockmakers’
                    denunciations of the cast-iron wheels was afforded at the Royal Exchange the
                    next year. In consequence of the bad ventilation of the clock-room, together
                    with the effects of the London atmosphere, some thin parts of the brass work had
                    become so much corroded that they had to be renewed, and some of it was replaced
                    with iron; for all the polished iron and brass work had become as rough as if it
                    had never been polished at all; the only parts of the clock which had not
                    suffered from the damp and the bad air were the painted iron work. The room was
                    also ventilated, with a draught through it, and all the iron work, except acting
                    surfaces, painted. Even in the most favourable positions brass or gun-metal
                    loses its surface long before cast-iron wants repainting.</p>
                <p>There is, however, a curious point to be attended to in using castiron wheels.
                    They must drive cast-iron pinions, for they will wear out steel. The smaller
                    wheels of the going part may be of brass driving steel pinions; but the whole of
                    the striking wheels and pinions may be of iron. A great deal of nonsense is
                    talked about gun-metal, as if it was necessarily superior to brass. The best
                    gunmetal may be, and is, for wheels which are too thick to hammer; but there is
                    great variety in the quality of gun-metal; it is often unsound, and has. hard
                    and soft places; and on the whole, it has no advantage over good brass, when not
                    too thick to be hammered. In clocks made under the pressure of competing
                    tenders, if the brass is likely not to be hammered, the gun metal is quite as
                    likely to be the cheapest and the worst possible, like everything else which is
                    always specified to be “best,” as the clockmakers know very well that it is a
                    hundred to one if anybody sees their work that can tell the difference between
                    the best and the worst.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Turret Clocks with Gravity Escapement.</hi></p>
                <p>Fig. 22 is a front view of a large quarter clock of Sir E. Beckett’s design, with
                    all t⅛e wheels on the great horizontal bed, a gravity escapement, and a
                    compensated pendulum. They are made in two sizes, one with the great striking
                    wheels 18 inches wide, and the other 14. The striking is done by cams cast on
                    the great wheels, about 1J inch broad in the large-sized clocks, which are
                    strong enough for an hour bell of thirty cwt., and corresponding quarters. Wire
                    ropes are used, not only because they last longer, if kept greased, but because
                    a sufficient number of coils will go on a barrel of less than half the length
                    that would be required for hemp ropes of the same strength, without overlapping,
                    which it is as well to avoid, if possible, though it is not so injurious to wire
                    ropes as it is to hemp ones. By this means also the striking cams can be put on
                    the great wheel, instead of the second wheel, which saves more in friction than
                    could be imagined by any .ne who had not tried both. In clocks of the common
                    construction two-thirds of the power is often wasted in friction and in. the.
                    bad arrangement of the hammer work, and the clock is wearing itself out in doing
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>The same number of cams are given here to the quarter as to the hour-striking
                    wheel, rather for the purpose of suggesting the expediency of omittingthe 4th
                    quarter, as has been done inmany clocksmade from this design. It is of no use to
                    strike <hi rend="italic">ding-dong</hi> quarters at the hour, and it nearly
                    doubles the work to be done; and if it is omitted it allows the bells to be
                    larger, and therefore louder, because the 1st quarter bell ought to be an octave
                    above the hour bell, if they are struck at the hour; whereas, if they are not
                    heard together the quarters may be on the 4th and 7th of a peal of eight
                    bells.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the repetition of the four <hi rend="italic">ding-dongs</hi> can give
                    no musical pk-asure to any one.</p>
                <p>The case is different with the Cambridge and Westminster quarter chimes on 4
                    bells, and the chime at the hour is the most complete and pleasing of all. It is
                    singular that those beautiful chimes (which are partly attributed to Handel) had
                    been heard by thousands of men scattered all over England for 70 years before
                    any one thought of copying them, but since they were introduced by Sir E.
                    Beckett in the great Westminster clock, on a much larger scale and with a slight
                    difference in the intervals, they have been copied very extensively, and are
                    already almost as numerous in new clocks as the old-fashioned ding-dong
                    quarters. Properly, as at Cambridge and Westminster, the hour bell should be an
                    octave below the third (or largest but one) quarter bell; but as the interval
                    between the quarters and hour is always considerable, it is practically found
                    that the ear is not offended by a less interval. At Worcester cathedral the
                    great 4⅜ ton hour bell is only 1⅜ notes below the 50 cwt. tenor bell of the
                    peal, which is made the fourth quarter bell; and at some other places the
                    quarters are the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 7th of a peal of 8, and the hour bell the 8th.
                    Thereby you get more powerful and <pb break="no"

                    bells are the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 6th of a peal of 6−independent of the hour bell;
                    and the following is their arrangement :—</p>

                </table>
                <p>The interval between each successive chime of four should be two or at most two
                    and a half times that between the successive blows. At Cambridge it is three
                    times,—decidedly too slow; at Westminster twice, which is rather too fast; at
                    Worcester cathedral and most of the later large clocks 2⅜ times, which sounds
                    the best.</p>
                <p>At Cambridge the chimes are set on a barrel which turns twice in the hour, as
                    this table indicates, and which is driven by the great wheel with a great waste
                    of power; the clock is wound up every day. An eight-day clock would require a
                    very heavy weight, and a very much greater strain on the wheels, and they are
                    altogether inexpedient for these quarters on any large scale of bells.</p>
                <p>Indeed there is some reason for doubting whether the modern introduction of
                    eight-day clocks is an improvement, where they have to strike at all on large
                    bells. Such clocks hardly ever bring the full sound out of the bells; because,
                    in order to do so, the weights would have to be so heavy, and the clock so
                    large, as to increase the price considerably. A good bell, even of the ordinary
                    thickness, which is less than in the Westminster bells, requires a hammer of not
                    less than <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th of its weight, rising 8 or 9 inches
                    from the bell, to bring out the full sound; and therefore, allowing for the loss
                    by friction, a bell of 30 cwt., which is not an uncommon tenor for a large peal,
                    would require a clock weight of 15 cwt., with a clear fall of 40 feet; and
                    either the Cambridge quarters on a peal of ten, or the Doncaster ones on the 2d,
                    3d, 4th, and 7th bells of a peal of eight, will require above a ton, according
                    to the usual scale of bells in a ringing peal (which is thinner than the
                    Westminster clock bells). Very few clocks are adapted for such weights as these;
                    and without abundance of strength and great size in all the parts, it would be
                    unsafe to use them. But if the striking parts are made to wind up every day, of
                    course ∣th of these weights will do; and you may have a more powerful clock in
                    effect, and a safer one to manage, in half the compass, and for much less cost.
                    Churches with such bells as these have always a sexton or some other person
                    belonging to them, and in attendance every day, who can wind up the clock just
                    as well as a clockmaker’s man. The going part always requires a much lighter
                    weight, and may as well go a week, and be in the charge of a clockmaker, where
                    it is possible.</p>
                <p>There should be some provision for holding the hammers off the bells while
                    ringing, and at the same time a friction-spring or weight should be brought to
                    bear on the fly arbor, to compensate for the removal of the weight of the
                    hammers; otherwise there is a risk of the train running too fast and being
                    broken when it is stopped.</p>
                <p>No particular number of cams is required in the striking wheel; any number from
                    10 to 20 will do; but when four quarters on two bells are used, the
                    quarter-striking wheel should have half as many cams again as the hour-wheel;
                    for, if not, the rope will go a second time over half of the barrel, as there
                    are 120 blows on each quarter bell in the 12 hours to 78 of the hours, while
                    with the three quarters there are only 72. If the two quarter levers are on the
                    same arbor, there must be two sets of cams, one on each side of the wheel; but
                    one set will do, and the same wheel as the hour-wheel, if they are placed as in
                    fig. 23. The hour-striking lever, it will be seen, is differently shaped, so as
                    to diminish the pressure on its arbor by making it only the difference, instead
                    of the sum, of the pressures,at the two points of action. This can be done with
                    the two quarter levers, as shown in the <hi rend="italic">Rudimentary
                    Treatise;</hi> but the arrangement involves a good deal of extra work, and as
                    the quarter hammers are always lighter than the hour one, it is hardly worth
                    while to resort to it. The shape of the cams is a matter requiring some
                    attention, but it will be more properly considered when we come to the <hi
                    rend="italic">teeth of wheels.</hi> Γhe 4th quarter bell in the Cambridge and
                    Westminster quarters should have two hammers and sets of cams longer than the
                    others, acting alternately, on account of the quick repetition of the blows.</p>
                <p>The fly ratchets should not be made of cast-iron, as they sometimes are by
                    clockmakers who will not use cast-iron wheels on any account, because the teeth
                    get broken off by the click. This breaking may perhaps be avoided by making the
                    teeth rectangular, like a number of inverted V’s set round a circle, and the
                    click only reaching so far that the face of the tooth which it touches is at
                    right angles to the click; but, as before observed, cast-iron and steel do not
                    work well together.</p>
                <p>The hammer of a large clock ought to be left “on the lift,” when the clock has
                    done striking, if thefirst blow is to be struck exactly at the hour, as there
                    are always a good many seconds lost in the train getting into action and raising
                    the hammer. Moreover, when it stops on the lift, the pressure on the stops, and
                    on all the pinions above tue great wheel, is only that due to the excess of the
                    power of the clock over the weight of the hammer, and not the full force of the
                    weight, and it is therefore easier for the going part to discharge, and less
                    likely to break the stops.</p>
                <p>In fig. 22 the wheel marked 60 in each of the striking parts is a winding wheel
                    on the front end of the barrel, and the winding pinion is numbered 10; a larger
                    pinion will do where the hammer does not exceed 40 lb; and in small clocks no
                    auxiliary winding wheel is needed. But in that case the locking-plate must be
                    driven by a gathering pallet, or pinion with two teeth, on the arbor of the
                    second wheel, with a spring click to keep it steady. In all cases the hammer
                    shanks and tails should not be less than two feet long, if possible; for the
                    shorter they are, the more is lost by the change of inclination for any given
                    rise from the bell. In some clocks with fixed (not swinging) bells, the
                    hammer-head is set on a double shank embracing the bell, with the pivots, not
                    above it in the French way, which makes the hammer strike at a wrong angle, but
                    on each side of the bell, a little below the top. On this plan less of the rise
                    is lost than in the common mode of fixing. The Westminster clock hammers are all
                    fixed in this way.</p>
                <p>The first thing to remark in the going part of fig. 22 is that the hour-wheel
                    which carries the snails for letting off the quarters and striking, is not part
                    of the train leading up to the scape-wheel, but independent, so that the train
                    from the great wheel to the scapewheel, is one of three wheels only. If it were
                    a dead escapement, instead of a gravity escapement clock, the wheel numbered 96
                    would be the scape-wheel; and as it turns in 90 seconds, it would require 36
                    teeth or pins for a l‡ sec. pendulum which most of these gravity-escapement
                    clocks have; it is about 6 feet long to the bottom of the bob, which, if sunk
                    just below the floor, brings the clock-frame to a very convenient height. The
                    hour-wheel rides loose on its arbor, or rather the arbor can turn within it,
                    carrying the snails and the regulating hand and the bevelled wheel which drives
                    all the dials, and it is fixed to the hour-wheel by means oí clamping screws on
                    the edge of a round plate on the arbor just behind it, which turn by hand. In a
                    gravity escapement clock this adjusting work is not really necessary; because
                    you can set the clock by merely lifting the pallets off the scape-wheel, and
                    letting the train run till the hands point right. The regulating hand, you
                    observe, in fig. 22 turns the wrong way; because, where the dial is opposite to
                    the back of the clock, no bevelled wheels are wanted, and the arbor leads
                    straight off to the dial. It used to be the fashion to put clocks in the middle
                    of the room, so that the leading-off rod might go straight up to the horizontal
                    bevelled wheel in the middle, which drove all the dials. But the clock can be
                    set much more firmly on stone corbels, or on cast-iron brackets built into the
                    wall; and it is not at all necessary for the leading-off rod to be vertical.
                    Provided it is only in a vertical plane parallel to the wall, or the teeth of
                    the bevelled wheels adapted to the inclination, the rod may stand as obliquely
                    as you please; and when it does, it ought on no account to be made, as it
                    generally is, with universal joints, but the pivots should go into oblique
                    pivot-holes at the top and bottom. The joints increase the friction
                    considerably, and are of no use whatever, except where the rod is too long to
                    keep itself straight. Where the rod does happen to be in the middle of the room,
                    and there are three or four dials, the two horizontal bevelled wheels at each
                    end of it must be a little larger than all the others— both the one in the clock
                    and those of the dial-work; for otherwise the three or four wheels in the middle
                    will meet each other and stick fast.</p>
                <p>when the pendulum is very long and heavy, it should be suspended from the wall,
                    unless the clock-frame has some strong support near the middle; but a six-feet
                    pendulum, of not more than two cwt., may be suspended from the clock-frame,
                    provided it is as strong as it ought to be for the general construction of the
                    clock, and supported on corbels or iron beams. It has generally been the
                    practice to hang the pendulum behind the clock-frame; but inasmuch as the rope
                    of the going part may always be thinner than that of the striking part, and that
                    part requires less depth in other respects, a different and more compact plan is
                    adopted in the clocks we are describing. The back pivots of the going wheels run
                    in bushes in an intermediate bar, three or four inches from the back of the
                    frame, joining the two cross bars, of which the ends are dotted in the drawing.
                    The pendulum cock is set on the back frame, and the pendulum hangs within it.
                    And in the gravity escapement clocks there is yet another thin bar—about half
                    way between the back frame and the bar on which the bushes of the wheels are
                    set— the only use of which is to carry the bush of the scape-wheel, which is set
                    behind the fly; the wheel, the fly, and the pallets, or gravity-arms, stand
                    between these two intermediate bars; and the palletarbors are set in a brass
                    cock screwed to the top of the pendulum-cock. The beat-pins should be of brass,
                    not steel, and no oil put to them, or they are sure to stick. The escapement in
                    fig. 22 is not drawn rightly for the present form of them, which is given in
                    fig. 13.</p>
                <p>The same general arrangement will serve for a dead escapement <pb break="no"

                    the pendulum will not stand so high, and the front end of the pallet arbor must
                    be set in a cock like those of the striking flies, on the front bar of the
                    frame. And for a dead escapement, if there are large dials and no remontoire,
                    the pendulum should be longer and heavier than that which is quite sufficient
                    for a gravity escapement. The rod of a wooden pendulum should be as thin as it
                    can conveniently be made, and varnished, to prevent its absorbing moisture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dials and Hands.</hi></p>
                <p>The old established form of dial for turret clocks is a sheet of copper made
                    convex, to preserve its shape; and this is just the worst form which could have
                    been contrived for it. For, in the first place, the minute-hand, being
                    necessarily outside of the hour-hand, is thrown still farther off the minutes to
                    which it has to point, by the convexity of the dial; and consequently, when it
                    is in any position except nearly vertical, it is impossible to see accurately
                    where it is pointing; and if it is bent enough to avoid this effect of parallax,
                    it looks very ill. Secondly, a convex dial at a considerable height from the
                    ground looks even more convex than it really is, because the lines of sight from
                    the middle and the top of the dial make a smaller angle with the eye than the
                    lines from the middle and the bottom, in proportion to the degree of convexity.
                    The obvious remedy for these defects, is simply to make the dial concave instead
                    of convex. As convex dials look more curved than they are, concave ones look
                    less curved than they are, and in fact might easily be taken for flat ones,
                    though the curvature is exactly the same as usual. Old convex dials are easily
                    altered to concave, and the improvement is very striking where it has been done.
                    There is no reason why the same form should not be adopted in stone, cement,
                    slate, or cast-iron, of which materials dials are sometimes and properly enough
                    made, with the middle part countersunk for the hour hand, so that the
                    minute-hand may go close to the figures and avoid parallax. When dials are
                    large, copper, or even iron or slate, is quite a useless expense, if the
                    stonework is moderately smooth, as most kinds of stone take and retain paint
                    very well, and the gilding will stand upon it better than it often does on
                    copper or iron.</p>
                <p>The figures are generally made much too large. People have a pattem dial painted;
                    and if the figures are not as long as one-third of the radius, and therefore
                    occupying, with the minutes, about two-thirds of the whole area of the dial,
                    they fancy they are not large enough to be read at a distance; whereas the fact
                    is, the more the dial is occupied by the figures, the less distinct they are,
                    and the more difficult it is to distinguish the position of the hands, which is
                    what people really want to see, and not to read the figures, which may very well
                    be replaced by twelve large spots. The figures, after all, do not mean what they
                    say, as you read “twenty minutes to” something, when the minute-hand points to
                    vιιτ. The rule which has been adopted, after various experiments, as the best
                    for the proportions of the dial, is this. Divide the radius into three, and
                    leave the inner two-thirds clear and flat, and of some colour forming a strong
                    contrast to the colour of the hands, black or dark blue if they are gilt, and
                    white if they are black. The figures, if there are any, should occupy the next
                    two-thirds of the remaining third, and the minutes be set in the remainder, near
                    the edge, and with every fifth minute more strongly marked than the rest; and
                    there should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be a rim round the dial of the same
                    colour or gilding as the figures. The worst kind of dial of all are the things
                    called skeleton-dials, which either have no middle except the stonework, forming
                    no contrast to the hands, or else taking special trouble to perplex the
                    spectator by filling up the middle with radiating bars. Where a dial cannot be
                    put without interfering with the architecture, it is much better to have none,
                    as is the case in many cathedrals and large churches, leaving the information to
                    be given by the striking of the hours and quarters. This also will save
                    something, perhaps a good deal, in the size and cost of the clock, and if it is
                    one without a train remontoire or gravity escapement, will enable it to go
                    better. The size of public dials is often very inadequate to their height and
                    the distance at which they are intended to be seen. They ought to be at least 1
                    foot in diameter for every 10 feet of height above the ground, and more whenever
                    the dial will be seen far off; and this rule ought to be enforced on architects,
                    as they are often not aware of it; and indeed they seldom make proper provisions
                    for the clock or the weights in building a tower, or, in short, know anything
                    about the matter.</p>
                <p>The art of illuminating dials cannot be said to be in a satisfactory state. Where
                    there happens to be, as there seldom is, a projecting roof at some little
                    distance below the dial, it may be illuminated by reflection, like that at the
                    Horse Guards—about the only merit which that superstition sly venerated and bad
                    clock has; and the same thing may be done in some places by movable lamp
                    reflectors, like those put before shop windows at night, to be turned back
                    against the wall during the day. It has also been proposed to sink the dial
                    within the wall, and illuminate it by jets of gas pointing inwards from a kind
                    of projecting rim, like what is called in church windows a “hood-moulding,”
                    carried all round. But it is a great objection to sunk dials, even of less depth
                    than would be required here, that they do not receive light enough by day, and
                    do not get their faces washed by the rain. The common mode of illumination is by
                    making the dials either entirely, or all except the figures and minutes and a
                    ring to carry them, of glass, either ground or lined in the inside with linen
                    (paint loses its colour from the gas). The gas is kept always alight, but the
                    clock is madeto turn it nearly oñ and full on at the proper times by a 24-hour
                    wheel, with pins set in it by hand as the length of the day varies. Self-acting
                    apparatus has been applied, but it is somewhat complicated, and an unnecessary
                    expense. But these dials always look very ill by day; and it seems often to be
                    forgotten that dials are wanted much more by day than by night; and also, that
                    the annual expense of lighting 3 or 4 dials far exceeds the interest of the
                    entire cost of any ordinary clock. Sometimes it exceeds the whole cost of the
                    clock annually. The use of white opaque glass with black figures is very
                    superior to the common method. It is used in the great Westminster clock dials.
                    It is somewhat of an objection to illuminating large dials from the inside, that
                    it makes it impossible to counterpoise the hands outside, except with very
                    short, and therefore very heavy, counterpoises. And if hands are only
                    counterpoised inside, there is no counterpoise at all to the force of the wind,
                    which is then constantly tending to loosen them on the arbor, and that tendency
                    is aggravated by the hand itself pressing on the arbor one way as it ascends,
                    and the other way as it descends; and if a large hand once gets in the smallest
                    degree loose, it becomes rapidly worse by the constant shaking. It is mentioned
                    in Reid’s book that the minute-hand of St Paul’s cathedral, which is above 8
                    feet long, used to fall over above a minute as it passed from the left to the
                    right side of XII, before it was counterpoised outside. In the conditions to be
                    followed in the Westminster clock it was expressly required that “the hands be
                    counterpoised externally, for wind as well as weight.” The long hand should be
                    straight and plain, to distinguish it as much as possible from the hour hand,
                    which should end in a “heart” or swell. Many clockmakers and architects, on the
                    contrary, seem to aim at making the hands as like each other as they can; and it
                    is not uncommon to see even the counterpoises gilt, probably with the same
                    object of producing apparent symmetry and the same result of producing real
                    confusion.</p>
                <p>The old fashion of having chimes or tunes played by machinery on church bells at
                    certain hours of the day has greatly revived in the last few years, and it has
                    extended to town halls, as also that of having very large clock bells, which had
                    almost become extinct until the making of the Westminster clock. The old kind of
                    chime machinery consisted merely of a large wooden barrel about 2 feet in
                    diameter with pins stuck in it like those of a musical box, which pulled down
                    levers that lifted hammers on the bells. Generally there were several tunes
                    “pricked” on the barrel, which had an endway motion acting automatically, so as
                    to make a shift after each tune, and with a special adjustment by hand to make
                    it play a psalm tune on Sundays. But though these tunes were very pleasing and
                    popular in the places where such chimes existed they were generally feeble and
                    irregular, because the pins and levers were not strong enough to lift hammers of
                    sufficient weight for the large bells, and there were no means of regulating the
                    time of dropping off the levers. Probably the last large chime work of this kind
                    was that put up by Dent to play on 16 bells at the Royal Exchange in 1845, with
                    the improvement of a cast-iron barrel and stronger pins than in the old wooden
                    barrels.</p>
                <p>A much improved chime machine has been introduced since, at first by an inventor
                    named Imhoff, who sold his patent, or the right to use it, to Messrs Gillett and
                    Bland of Croydon, and also to Messrs Lund and Blockley of Pall Mall, who have
                    both added further improvements of their own. The principle of it is this:
                    instead of the hammers being lifted by the pins which let them off, they are
                    lifted whenever they are down by an independent set of cam wheels of ample
                    strength; and all that the pins on the barrel have to do is to trip them up by a
                    set of comparatively light levers or detents. Consequently the pins are as small
                    as those of a barrel organ, and many more tunes can be set on the same barrel
                    than in the old plan, and besides that, any number of barrels can be kept, and
                    put in from time to time as you please; so that you may have as many tunes as
                    the" peal of bells will admit. There are various provisions for regulating and
                    adjusting the time, and the machinery is altogether of a very perfect kind for
                    its purpose, but it must bo seen to be understood.</p>
                <p>It is always necessary in chimes to have at least two hammers to each bell to
                    enable a note to be repeated quickly. Some ambitious musicians determined to try
                    “chords” or double notes struck at once, in spite of warning that they could not
                    be made to strike quite simultaneously, and so it turned out, and it is useless
                    to attempt them. The largest peals and chimes yet made have been at Worcester
                    cathedral, and the town halls of Bradford and Rochdale, and a still larger one
                    is now making for Manchester, all by Gillett and Bland. The clock at Worcester,
                    which as yet ranks next to Westminster, was made by Mr Joyce of Whitchurch; the
                    others are by Gillett an&lt;i Bland. At Boston church they have chimes in
                    imita-tíon<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n41/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0041-0032"/> of some of the foreign ones on above 40 small
                    bells, which were added for that purpose to the eight of the peal; but they are
                    not successful, and it is stated in Sir E. Beckett’s book on clocks and bells,
                    that he warned them that the large and small bells would not harmonize, though
                    either might be used separately. Other persons have attempted chimes on
                    hemispherical bells, like those of house clocks; but they also are a failure for
                    external bells to be heard at a distance. This however belongs rather to the
                    subject of bells; and we must refer to that book for all practical information
                    about them.</p>

                <p>Before explaining the construction of the largest clock in the world it is
                    necessary to consider the shape of wheel teeth suitable foi different purposes,
                    and also of the cams requisite to raise heavy hammers, which had been too much
                    neglected by clockmakers previously. At the same time we are not going to write
                    a treatise on all the branches of the important subject of wheel-cutting; but,
                    assuming a knowledge of the general principles of it, to apply them to the
                    points chiefly involved in clock-making. The most comprehensive mathematical
                    view of it is perhaps to be found in a paper by the astronomer royal in the <hi

                    >odontograph,</hi> which seem to give not less but more trouble than the
                    mathematical, and are only approximate after all, and also do not explain
                    themselves, or convey any knowledge of the principle to those who use them.</p>
                <p>For all wheels that are to work together, the first thing to do is to fix the <hi
                    rend="italic">geometrical,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">primit ive,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">pitch circles</hi> of the two wheels <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>
                    ι.e., τhe two circles which, if they rolled perfectly together, would give the
                    velocity-ratio you want. Draw a straight line joining the two centres; then the
                    action which takes place between any two teeth as they are approaching that
                    line, is said to be before the line of centres; and the action while they are
                    separating is said to be after the line of centres. Now, with a view to reduce
                    the friction, it is essential to have as little action before the line of
                    centres as you can; foi if you make any rude sketch, on a large scale, of a pair
                    of wheels acting together, and <hi rend="italic">serrate</hi> the edges of the
                    teeth (which is an exaggeration of the roughness which produces friction), you
                    will see that the further the contact begins before the line of centres, the
                    more the serration will interfere with the motion, and that at a certain
                    distance no force whatever could drive the wheels, but would only jam the teeth
                    faster; and you will see also that this cannot happen after the line of centres.
                    But with pinions of the numbers generally used in clocks you cannot always get
                    rid of action before the line of centres; for it may be proved (but the proof is
                    too long to give here), that if a pinion has less than 11 leaves, no wheel of
                    any number of teeth can drive it without some action before the line of centres.
                    And generally it may be stated that the greater the number of teeth the less
                    friction there will be, as indeed is evident enough from considering that if the
                    teeth were infinite in number, and infinitesimal in size, there would be no
                    friction at all, but simple rolling of one pitch circle on the other. And since
                    in clock-work the wheels always drive the pinions, except the hour pinion in the
                    dial work, and the winding pinions in large clocks, it has long been recognized
                    as important to have high numbered pinions, except where there is a train
                    remontoire, or a gravity escapement, to obviate that necessity.</p>
                <p>And with regard to this matter, the art of clock-making has in one sense
                    retrograded; for the pinions which are now almost universally used in English
                    and French clocks are of a worse form than those of several centuries ago, to
                    which we have several times alluded under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >lantern</hi> pinions, so called from their resembling a lantern with upright
                    ribs. A sketch of one, with a cross section on a large scale, is given at fig.
                    24. Now it is a property of these pinions, that when they are driven, the action
                    begins just when the centre of the pin is on the line of centres, however few
                    the pins may be; and thus the action of a lantern pinion of 6 is about equal to
                    that of a leaved pinion of 10; and indeed, for some reason or other, it appears
                    in practice to be even better, possibly from the teeth of the wheel not
                    requiring to be cut so accurately, and from the pinion never getting clogged
                    with dirt. Certainly the running of the American clocks, which all have these
                    pinions, is remarkably smooth, and they require a much smaller going weight than
                    English clocks; and the same may be said of the common “Dutch,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> German clocks. It should be understood, however, that
                    as the action upon these pinions is all after the line of centres when they are
                    driven, it will be all before the line of centres if they drive, and therefore
                    they are not suitable for that purpose. In some of the French clocks in the 1851
                    Exhibition they were wrongly used, not only for the train, but for winding
                    pinions; and some of them also had the pins not fixed in the lantern, but
                    rolling,—a very useless refinement, and considerably diminishing the strength of
                    the pinion. For it is one of the advantages of lantern pinions with fixed pins,
                    that they are very strong, and there is no risk of their being broken in
                    hardening, as there is with common pinions.</p>
                <p>The fundamental rule for the tracing of teeth, though very simple, is not so well
                    known as it ought to be, and therefore we will give it, premisingthatsomuch of a
                    tooth as lies within the pitch circle of the wheel is called its <hi
                    rend="italic">root</hi> or <hi rend="italic">flank,</hi> and the part beyond the
                    pitch circle is called the <hi rend="italic">point,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">curve,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">addendum;</hi> and moreover,
                    that before the line of centres the action is always between the flanks of the
                    driver and the points of the driven wheel or <hi rend="italic">runner</hi> (as
                    it may be called, more appropriately than the usual term <hi rend="italic"
                    >follower)</hi>; and after the line of centres, the action is always between the
                    points of the driver and the flanks of the runner. Consequently, if there is no
                    action before the line of centres, no points are required· for the teeth of the
                    runner.</p>
                <p>In fig. 23, let AQX be the pitch circle of the runner, and ARY that of the
                    driver; and let GAP be any curve whatever of smaller curvature than AQX (of
                    course a circle is always the kind of curvo used); and QP the curve wldch is
                    traced out by any point P in the generating circle GAP, as it rolls <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi> the pitch circle AQX; and again let RP be the curve traced
                    by the point P, as the generating circle GAP is rolled <hi rend="italic">on</hi>
                    the pitch circle ARY; then RP will be the form of the point of a tooth on the
                    driver ARY, which will drive with uniform and proper motion the flank QP of the
                    runner; though hot without some friction, because that can only be done with <hi
                    rend="italic">involute</hi> teeth, which are traced in a different way, and are
                    subject to other conditions, rendering them practically useless for machinery,
                    as'may be seen in Professor Willis’s book. If the motion is reversed, so that
                    the runner becomes the driver, then the flank QP is of the proper form to drive
                    the point RP, if any action has to take place before the line of centres.</p>
                <p>And again, any generating curve, not even necessarily the same as before, may be
                    used to trace the flanks of the driver and the points of the runner, by being
                    rolled within the circle ARY, and on the circle AQX.</p>
                <p>Now then, to apply this rule to particular cases. Suppose the generating circle
                    is the same as the pitch circle of the driven pinion itself, it evidently cannot
                    roll at all; and the tooth of the pinion is represented by the mere point P on
                    the circumference of the pitch circle; and the tooth to drive it will be simply
                    an <hi rend="italic">epicycloid</hi> traced by rolling the pitch circle of the
                    pinion on that of the wheel. And we know that in that case there is no action
                    before the line of centres, and no necessity for any flanks on the teeth of the
                    driver. But inasmuch as the pins of a lantern pinion must have some thickness,
                    and cannot be mere lines, a further process is necessary to get the exact form
                    of the teeth; thus if RP, fig. 24, is the tooth that would drive a pinion with
                    pins of no sensible thickness, the tooth to drive a pin of the thickness 2 <hi
                    rend="italic">Pp</hi> must have the width Pp or Rr gauged off it all round.
                    This, in fact, brings it very nearly to a smaller tooth traced with the same
                    generating circle; and therefore in practice this mode of construction is not
                    much adhered to, and the teeth are made of the same shape, only thinner, as if
                    the pins of the pinion had no thickness. Of course they should be thin enough to
                    allow a little shake, or “back-lash,” but in clock-work the backs of the teeth
                    never come in contact at all. .</p>
                <p>Next suppose the generating circle to be half the size of the pitch circle of the
                    pinion. The curve, or <hi rend="italic">hypocycloid,</hi> traced by rolling this
                    within the pinion, is no other than the diameter of the pinion; and consequently
                    the flanks of the pinion teeth will be merely radii of it, and such teeth or
                    leaves are called radial teeth; and they are far the most common; indeed, no
                    others are ever made (except lanterns) for clock-work. The corresponding
                    epicycloidal points of <pb break="no"

                    less pointed arc, than those required for a lantern pinion of the same size and
                    number. The teeth in fig. 25 are made of a different form on the opposite sides

                <p>illustration of this. In y. 25</p>
                <p>both the striking parts the great wheel of the train and the great winding-wheel
                    on the other end of the barrel are about the same size; but in the train the
                    wheel drives, and in winding the pinion drives. And therefore in the train the
                    pinion-teeth have their points cut off, and wheel-teeth have their points on, as
                    on the right side of fig. 25, and in the winding-wheels the converse; and thus
                    in both cases the action is made to take place in the way in which there is the
                    least friction. Willis gives the following table, “derived organically” (i.e.,
                    by actual trial with large models), of the least numbers which will work
                    together without any action before the line of centres, provided there are no
                    points to the teeth of the runner, assuming them to be radial teeth, as usual

                <p>In practice it is hardly safe to leave the driven teeth without points, unless
                    the numbers slightly exceed these; because, if there is any irregularity in
                    them, the square edges of those teeth would not work smoothly with the teeth of
                    the driver. Sometimes it happens that the same wheel has to drive two pinions of
                    different numbers. It is evident that, if both are lanterns, or both pinions
                    with radial teeth, they cannot properly be driven by the same wheel, because
                    they would require teeth of a different shape. It is true that on account of the
                    greater indifference of lantern pinions to the accuracy of the teeth which are
                    to drive them, the same wheel will drive two pinions of that kind, differing in
                    the numbers in the ratio of even 2 to 1, with hardly any sensible shake; but
                    that would not be so with radial pinions, and of course it is not correct.
                    Accordingly, in clocks with the spring remontoire, as in fig. 21, where the
                    scape-wheel or remontoire pinion is double the size of the fly pinion, the
                    larger one is made with radial teeth and the smaller a lantern, which makes the
                    same wheel teeth exactly right for both. In clocks of the same construction as
                    fig. 22, and in the Westminster clock, there is a case of a different kind,
                    which cannot be so accommodated; for there the great wheel has to drive both the
                    second wheel’s pinion of 10 or 12, and the hour-wheel of 40 or 48; the teeth of
                    the great wheel were therefore made to suit the lantern pinion, and those of the
                    hour-wheel <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> their flanks) then depend on those of
                    the great wheel, and they were accordingly traced by rolling a generating circle
                    of the size of the lantern pinion on the inside of the pitch circle of the
                    hour-wheel; the result is a tooth thicker at the bottom than usual. These are by
                    no means unnecessary refinements; for if the teeth of a set of wheels are not
                    properly shaped so as to work smoothly and regularly into each other, it
                    increases their tendency to wear out in proportion to their inaccuracy, besides
                    increasing the inequalities of force in the train. Sometimes turret clocks are
                    worn out in a few years from the defects in their teeth, especially when they
                    are made of brass or soft gun-metal.</p>
                <p>In the construction of clocks which have to raise heavy hammers it is important
                    to obtain the best form for the cams, as pins are quite unfit for the purpose.
                    The conditions which are most important are—that the action should begin at the
                    greatest advantage, and therefore at the end of the lever, that when it ceases
                    the face of the lever should be a tangent to the cam at both their points, and
                    that in no part of the motion should the end of the lever scrape on the cam. In
                    the common construction of clocks the first condition is deviated from as far as
                    possible, by the striking pins beginning to act at some distance from the end of
                    the lever; and consequently, at the time when the most force is required to lift
                    the hammer there is the least given, and a great deal is wasted afterwards.</p>
                <p>The construction of curve for the cams, which is the most perfect mathematically,
                    is that which is described in mathematical books under the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tractrix.</hi> But there are such practical difficulties in
                    describing it that it is of no use. It should be observed that, in a well-known
                    book with an appropriate name <hi rend="italic">(Camus on the Teeth of
                    Wheels'),</hi> a rule for drawing cams has been inserted by some translator,
                    which is quite wrong. It may be proved that epicycloidal cams described as
                    follows are so nearly of the proper mathematical form that they may be used
                    without any sensible error. Let <hi rend="italic">r</hi> be the radius of the
                    circle or barrel on which the cams are to be set theoretically, ι.e., allowing
                    nothing for the clearance which must be cut out afterwards, for fear the lever
                    should scrape the back of the cams in falling; in other words, <hi rend="italic"

                    circle from the cams will be 0'9 inch. The advantage of cams of this kind is
                    that they waste as little force as possible in the lift, and keep the lever
                    acting upon them as a tangent at its point the whole way; and the cams
                    themselves may be of any length according to the angle through which you want
                    the lever to move.</p>
                <p>Most people however prefer dealing with circles, when they can, instead of
                    epicycloids; and drawing by compasses is safer than calculating in most hands.
                    We therefore give another rule, suggested by Mr E. J. Lawrence, a member of the
                    horological jury in the 1851 Exhibition, which is easier to work, and satisfies
                    the principal conditions stated just now, though it wastes rather more in lift
                    than the epicycloidal curve; and the cams must not have their points cut off, as
                    epicycloidal ones may, to make the lever drop off sooner; because a short cam
                    has to be drawn with a different radius from a long one, to work a lever of any
                    given length. But, on the other hand, the same curve for the cams will suit a
                    lever of any length, whereas with epicycloidal cams you must take care to put
                    the centre or axis of the lever at the exact distance from the centre of the
                    wheel for which the curve was calculated—an easy enough thing to do, of course,
                    but for the usual disposition of workmen to deviate from your plans, apparently
                    for the mere pleasure of doing wrong. It is astonishing how, by continually
                    making one machine after another, with a little deviation each time, the thing
                    gradually assumes a form in which you can hardly recognise your original design
                    at all. The prevention of this kind of blundering is one of the many advantages
                    of making machines by machinery, for which no machine offers more facilities
                    than clocks, and yet there is none to which it is less applied.</p>
                <p>In fig. 26 let CA be a radius of the wheel, L in the same straight line the
                    centre of the. lever, and AB the space of one cam on the pitch circle of the
                    cams, A being a little below the line of centres; AP is the arc of the lever.
                    Draw a tangent to the two circles at A, and a tangent to the cam circle at B;
                    then T, their point of intersection, will be the centre of the circle which is
                    the face of thecam BP; and TB also =TA, which is a convenient test of the
                    tangents being rightly drawn. The action begins at the point of the lever, and
                    advances a little way up, but recedes again to the point, and ends with the
                    lever as a tangent to the cam at P. The backs of the cams must be cut out rather
                    deeper than the circle AP, but retaining the point P, to allow enough for
                    clearance of the lever, which should fall against some fixed stop or banking on
                    the clock-frame, before the next cam reaches it. The point of the lever must not
                    be left quite sharp, for if it is, it will in time cut off the points of the
                    cast-iron cams.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Oil for Clocks.</hi></p>
                <p>We will add a few words on the subject of oil for clocks. Oliveoil is most
                    commonly used, sometimes purified in various ways, and sometimes not purified at
                    all. We believe, however, that purified animal oil is better than any of the
                    vegetable oils, as some of them are too thin, while others soon get thick and
                    viscid. For turret clocks and common house clocks, good sperm oil is fine
                    enough, and is probably the best. For finer work the oil requires some
                    purification. Even common neat’s foot oil may be made fine and clear by the
                    following method. Mix it with about the same quantity of water, and shake it in
                    a large bottle, not full, until it becomes like a white soup; then let it stand
                    till fine oil appears at the top, which maybe skimmed off; it will take several
                    months before it has all separated—into water at the bottom, dirt in the middle,
                    and fine oil at the top. And it should be done in cold weather, because heat
                    makes some oil come out as fine, which in cold would remain among the dirty oil
                    in the middle, and in cold weather that fine oil of hot weather will become
                    muddy. There are various vegetable oils sold at tool-shops as oil for watches,
                    including some for which a prize medal was awarded in the Exhibition, but not by
                    any of the mechanical juries; we have no information as to the test which was

                    considerable time would be of much value.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Westminster Clock.</hi></p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to repeat the account of the long dispute between the
                    Government, the architect of the House of Parliament, the astronomer royal, Sir
                    E. Beckett, and some of the London clockmakers, which ended in the employment of
                    the late E. J. Dent and his successor F. Dent from the designs and under the
                    superintendence of Sir E. Beckett, as the inscription on it records The fullest
                    account of these was given in the 4th and 5th editions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treatise on Clocks,</hi> and we shall now only describe its construction.
                    Fi&lt;Λ 27 is a front elevation or section lengthwise of the clock. The frame is
                    16 feet long and 5⅛ wide, and it rests on two iron plates lying on the top of
                    the walls of the shaft near the middle of the tower, down which the weights
                    descend. That wall reaches up to the bell chamber, and those iron plates are
                    built right through it, and so is the great cock which carries the pendulum. The
                    clockroom is 28 feet × 19, the remaining 9 of the square being occupied by the
                    staircase and an air-shaft ibr ventilating the whole building.</p>
                <p>The going part of the clock, however, not requiring such a long barrel as the
                    striking parts, which have steel wire ropes '55 inch thick, is shorter than they
                    are, and is carried by an intermediate bar or frame bolted to the cross bars of
                    the principal frame. The back of them is about 2⅜ feet from the wall, to leave
                    room for a man behind, and the pendulum cock is so made as to let his head come
                    within it in order to look square at the escapement. The escapement is the
                    double three legs (fig. 13), and the length of the teeth or legs is 6 inches.
                    The drawing represents the wheels (except the hovelled wheels leading off to the
                    dials) as mere circles to prevent confusion. The numbers of teeth and the time
                    of revolution of th« principal ones are inserted and require no further notice.
                    Their siz&lt; can be taken from the scale; the great wheels of the striking
                    parti are 2⅜ and of the going part 2 inches thick, and all the wheels are oi
                    cast-iron except the smaller ones of the escapement, which are brass, but are
                    painted like the iron ones.</p>
                <p>The maintaining power for keeping the clock going while winding is peculiar and
                    probably unique. None of those already described could have kept in gear long
                    enough, maintaining sufficient fore« all the time, as that part takes 10 minutes
                    to wind, even if th« man does not loiter over it. This is managed without a
                    single extra wheel beyond the ordinary winding pinion of large clocks. Th¢
                    winding wheel on the end of the barrel is close to the great wheel, and you see
                    the pinion with the λvinding arbor in the oblique piece of the front frame of
                    the clock. Consequently that arbor is about 6 feet long, and a little movement
                    of its back end makes no material obliquity in the two bushes; i.β., it may go a
                    little out of parallel with all the other arbors in the clock without any
                    impediment to its action. Its back pivot is carried, not in a fixed bush, but in
                    the lower end of a bar a little longer than the great wheel’s radius, banging
                    from the back of the great arbor; and that bar has a spring click upon it which
                    takes into ratchet teeth cast on the back of the great wheel. When the great
                    wheel is turning, and you are not winding, the ratchets pass the click as usual,
                    but as soon as you begin to wind the back end of the winding arbor would rise
                    but for the click catching those teeth, and so the great wheel itself become the
                    fulcrum for winding for the time. After the winding has gone a few minutes a
                    long tooth projecting from the back of the arbor catches against a stop, because
                    that end of the hanging bar and pinion have all risen a little with the motion
                    of the great wheel.</p>
                <p>Then the man is obliged to turn the handle back a little, which lets down the
                    pinion, &amp;c., and the click takes up some lower teeth; and so if he chooses
                    to loiter an hour over the winding he can do no harm. The winding pinion “pumps”
                    into gear and out again as usual. The going part will go 8⅛ days, to provide for
                    the possible forgetting of a day in winding. The weight is about 160 ìb; but
                    only one-14th of the whole force of that weight is requisite to drive the
                    pendulum, as was found by trial; the rest goes in overcoming the friction of all
                    the machinery, including a ton and a half of hands and counterpoises, and in
                    providing force enough to drive them through all weathers, except heavy snows,
                    which occasionally accumulate thick enough on several minute hands at once, on
                    the left side of the dials, to stop the clock, those hands being 11 feet long.
                    For the dials are 22⅛ feet in diameter, or contain 400 square feet each, and
                    there are very few rooms where such a dial could be painted on the floor. They
                    are made of iron framing filled in with opal glass. Each minute is 14 inches
                    wide. The only larger dial in the world is in Mechlin church, which is 40 feet
                    wide; but it has no minute hand, which makes an enormous difference iu the force
                    required in the clock. They are completely walled off from the clock-room by a
                    passage all round, and there are a multitude of gas lights behind them, which
                    are lighted by hand, though provision was originally made in the clock for doing
                    it automatically. The hour hands go so slow that their weight is immaterial, and
                    were left as they were made of gun metal under the. architect’s direction ∙ but
                    it was impossible to have minute hands of that construction and weight without
                    injury to the clock, and so they were removed by Sir E. Beckett, and others made
                    of copper tubes, with a section composed of two circular arcs put together, and
                    are consequently very stiff, while weighing only 28 lb. The great weight is in
                    the wheels, tubes, and counterpoises. The minute hands are partly counterpoised
                    outside, making their total length 14 feet, to relieve the strain upon their
                    arbors. They all run on friction wheels imbedded in the larger tubes 5∣ inches
                    wide, which carry the hour hands, which themselves run on fixed friction
                    wheels.</p>
                <p>There is nothing peculiar in the quarter striking part except, its size, and
                    perhaps in the barrel turning in an hour and a half, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> in three repetitions of the five chimes already described. The cams
                    are of wrought iron with hard steel faces. Each bell has two hammers, which
                    enables the cams to be longer and the pressure on them less. The hour-striking
                    wheel has ten cams 2⅛ in. wide cast on it; but those cams have solid steel faces
                    screwed on them. All this work was made for a hammer of 7 cwt., lifted 13 inches
                    from the bell, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> about 9 inches of vertical lift. The
                    hammer was reduced to 4- cwt. after the partial cracking of the bell. The rod
                    from the lever to the hammer is made of the same wire rope as the weight ropes,,
                    and the result is that there is no noise in the room while the clock is
                    striking. The lever is 5 feet 4 inches long, and strikes against the buffer
                    spring shown in the drawing, to prevent concussion on the clock-frame, of which
                    you cannot feel the least. The quarter hammer levers have smaller springs for
                    the same purpose,, and the stops of the striking part are also set on springs
                    instead of rigid as usual. The flies, for which there was not room in the
                    drawing, are near the top of the room and are each 2 feet 4 inches square. They
                    make a considerable wind in the room when revolving. The only noise made in
                    striking is their running on over their ratchets when the striking stops. Each
                    striking weight is a ton and a half—or was before the great hammer was reduced.
                    They take 5 hours to wind up, and it has to be done twice a week, which was
                    thought better than making the parts larger and the teeth more numerous and the
                    weights twice as much, to go a week, and of course the winding must have taken
                    twice as long, as it λvas adapted to what a man can do continuously for some
                    hours. Con sequently it was necessary to contrive something to stop the mau.</p>

                <p>winding just before each time of striking. And that is done by a lever being
                    tipped over by the snail at that time, which at once stops the winding. When the
                    striking is done the man can put the lever up again and go on. The loose winding
                    wheels are not pumped in and out of gear as usual, being too heavy, but one end
                    of the arbor is pushed into gear by an eccentric bush turned by the oblique
                    handle or lever which you see near the upper corner of each striking part, and
                    they can be turned in a moment. They are held in their place for gear by a
                    spring catch to prevent any risk of slipping out. Moreover the ropes themselves
                    stop the winding when the weights came to the top, pretty much as they do in a
                    spring clock or a watch, though not exactly.</p>
                <p>The mode of lettiιm off the hour striking is peculiar, with a view to the first
                    blow of the hour being exactly at the 60 th second of the 60th minute. It was
                    found that this could not be depended on to a single beat of the pendulum, and
                    probably it never can in any clock, by a mere snail turning in an hour, unless
                    it was of a very inconvenient size. Therefore the common snail only lets it off
                    partially, and the striking stop still rests against a lever which is not
                    dropped but tipped up with a slight blow by another weighted lever resting on a
                    snail on the 15-minute wheel, which moves more exactly with the escapement than
                    the common snail lower in the train. The hammer is left on the lift, ready to
                    fall, and it always does fall within half a second after the last beat of the
                    pendulum at the hour. This is shown in fig. 28, where BE is the spring stop
                    noticed above, and P the ordinary first stop on the long lifting lever PQ (which
                    goes on far beyond the reach of this figure to the hour snail). The second or
                    warning stop is CD, and BAS is the extra lever with its heavy end at S on the
                    15-minute snail. When that falls the end B tips up CD with certainty by the
                    blow, and then the striking is free. The first, second, and third quarters bogin
                    at the proper times; but the fourth quarter chimes begin about 20 seconds before
                    the hour.</p>
                <p>The clock reports its own rate to Greenwich Observatory by galvanic action twice
                    a day, i.e., an electric circuit is made and broken by the pressing together of
                    certain springs at two given hours. And in this way the rate of the clock is
                    ascertained and recorded, and the general results published by the astronomer
                    royal in his annual report. This has been for some years so remarkably uniform,
                    that the error has only reached 3 seconds on 3 per cent, of the days in the
                    year, and is generally under two. He has also reported that “the rate of the
                    clock is certain to much less than a second a week ”—subject to abnormal
                    disturbances by thunder storms which sometimes amount to seven or eight seconds,
                    and other casualties, which are easily distinguishable from the spontaneous
                    variations.</p>
                <p>The original stipulation in 1845 was that the rate should not vary more than a
                    second a day—not a week; and this was pronounced impossible by Mr Vulliamy and
                    the London Company of Clockmakers, and it is true that up to that time no such
                    rate had ever been attained by any large clock. In 1851 it was by
                    the'above-mentioned clock, now at King’s Cross Station, by means of the train
                    remontoire, which was then intended to be used at Westminster, but was
                    superseded by the gravity escapement.</p>
                <p>The great hour Bell, of the note E, weighs 13⅜ tons and is 9 feet diameter and 9
                    inches thick. The quarter bells weigh respectively 78, 33⅜, 26, and 21 cwt.;
                    with diameters 6 feet, 4⅜, 4, and 3 feet 9 inches, and notes B, E, F sh. and G
                    sh. The hammers are on double levers embracing the bells, and turning on pivots
                    projecting from the iron collars which carry the mushroom shaped tops of the
                    bells. The bells, including £750 for recasting the first great bell, cost nearly
                    £6000, and the clock £4080. The bell frame, which is of wrought iron plates, and
                    the dials and hands, all provided by the architect, cost £11,934—a curious case
                    of the accessories costing more than the principals. (E. B. )</p>
