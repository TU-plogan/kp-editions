                            Porphyrogenitus</hi></label> (905-959), emperor of the East, author, and
                    patron of literature, born in 905 A.D., was the only son of Leo VI. The Eastern
                    Church sanctioned no marriage beyond the second, and when Leo, being childless
                    by three wives, had a son by his concubine Zoe, his attempt to legitimize his
                    wife and his son was inflexibly resisted by the Patriarch Nicholas, and his will
                    was only carried out at the expense of excommunication. These circumstances were
                    probably the reason why the name <hi rend="italic">Porplιyrogenitus,</hi> “born

                    applied to Constantine VII. When Constantine was only six years old Leo died,
                    leaving him under the guardianship of his uncle Alexander; but Alexander also
                    died in the next year; and Romanus Lecapenus, the chief admiral, supported by
                    Zoe, was appointed colleague to Constantine, and held all real power till 944,
                    when he was forced by his sons to entera monastery.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile Constantine, though powerless, had been well treated, and had married
                    Helena, the daughter of Romanus. On the deposition of his colleague, the people
                    gave willing aid to Constantine’s cause; and having banished his
                    brothcrs-in-law, he became emperor in reality. Though wanting in strength of
                    will, Constantine had intelligence and many other good qualities, and his reign
                    on the whole was not unsatisfactory. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Greek
                        Empire.)</hi> He was poisoned by his son Romanus in 959. Constantine was a
                    painter and a patron of art, a literary man and a patron of literature; and
                    herein consists his real importance. Unable as he was to sift out the really
                    important from the unimportant, and the credible from the incredible, it is yet
                    from his pages that we gain the only knowledge of any extent which we possess of
                    his time. He is the author of several works of considerable size :—1. ∏∈pi <hi
                        rend="italic">τωv θeμfiτωv,</hi> an account of the provinces <hi
                        rend="italic">(themata)</hi> of the empire; 2. <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Administrando Imperio,</hi> an account of the condition of the
                    empire, and an exposition of the author’s view of government, written for the
                    use of his son Romanus; it also contains most valuable information as to the
                    condition and history of various foreign nations with which the Eastern empire
                    had been brought into connection,—as tho Arabs, Iberians, Armenians, and the
                    tribes north of tho Danube—the Russians, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Chazars, and
                    Patzinacitae; 3. <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> Eκ0∈σιs rýs <hi rend="italic"
                        >βaσιXeiov</hi> τ&lt;⅛∈ως, which describes the customs of tho Eastern Church
                    and court; 4. A life of Basilius I., his grandfather; 5. Two treatises on
                    warfare, of which his father Leo was perhaps part or sole author. The
                    Γ∈ωτroiΙκ&lt;z, a treatise on agriculture with which his namo is connected, is
                    generally supposed to have been executed at his command by Bassus Cassianus; and
                    under his patronage many other works— including collections of the ancient
                    historians (of which fragments are extant), lives of saints, and treatises on
                    medicine—were compiled. Several Latin translations of the works of Constantine
                    have been made, and his complete works were published at Leyden, 1617, and
                    Paris, 1711.</p>
