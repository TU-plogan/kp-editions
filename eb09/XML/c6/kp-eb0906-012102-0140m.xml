                    (1619-1683), one of the greatest among the great statesmen of France, was born
                    on the 29th of August 1619, at Rheims, where his father and grandfather were
                    merchants. He claimed to be the descendant of a noble Scottish family, but those
                    who have investigated the matter have almost without exception decided against
                    the pretension. His youth is said to have been spent in a Jesuit college, in the
                    office of a Parisian banker, and in that of a Parisian notary, Chapelain, the
                    father of the poet. But the first fact on which we can rely with confidence is
                    that, when not yet twenty, he obtained a post in the war-office, by means of the
                    influence that he possessed through the marriage of one of his uncles to the
                    sister of Mic∙lιel Le Tellier, the secretary of state for war. During some years
                    he was employed in the inspection of troops and other work of the kind, but at
                    length his ability, his extraordinary energy, and his untiring laboriousness
                    induced Le Tellier to make him his private secretary. These qualities, combined,
                    it must be confessed, with a not over-delicate readiness to seize every
                    opportunity of advancement, soon brought Colbert both wealth and influence. In
                    1647 we find him receiving the confiscated goods of his uncle Pussort, in 1648
                    obtaining 40,000 crowns with his wife Marie Charron, in 1649 appointed
                    councillor of state.</p>
                <p>It was the period of the wars of the Fronde; and in 1651 the triumph of the Condé
                    family drove Cardinal Mazarin from Paris. Colbert, now aged thirty-two, was
                    engaged to keep him acquainted with what should happen in the capital during his
                    absence. At first Colbert’s position was far ſrom satisfactory; for the close
                    wary Italian treated him merely as an ordinary agent. On one occasion, for
                    example, he offered him 1000 crowns. The gift was refused somewhat indignantly;
                    and by giving proof of the immense value of his services, Colbert gained all
                    that he desired. His demands were not small; for, with an ambition mingled, as
                    his letters show, with strong family affection, he aimed at placing all his
                    relatives in positions of affluence and dignity; and many a rich benefice and
                    important public office was appropriated by him to that purpose. For these
                    favours, conferred upon him by his patron with no stinted hand, his thanks were
                    expressed in a most remarkable manner; he published a letter defending the
                    cardinal from the charge of ingratitude which was often -brought against him, by
                    enumerating the benefits that he and his family had received from him (April
                    1655). Colbert obtained, besides, the higher object of his ambition; the
                    confidence of Mazarin, so far as it was granted to any one, became his, and he
                    was intrusted with matters of the gravest importance. In 1659 he was giving
                    directions as to the suppression of the revolt of the gentry which threatened in
                    Normandy, Anjou, and Poitou, with characteristic decision arresting those whom
                    he suspected and arranging every detail of their trial, the immediate and
                    arbitrary destruction of their castles and woods, and the execution of their
                    chief, Boíinesson. In the same year we have evidence that he was already
                    planning his great attempt at financial refoim. His earliest tentative was the
                    drawing up of a <hi rend="italic">mémoire</hi> to Mazarin, showing that of the
                    taxes paid by the people not one-half reached the king. The paper also contained
                    an attack upon the superintendent, Fouquet, who, first recommended to Le Tellier
                    by Colbert himself, had since developed into the most shameless of extortioners;
                    and being opened by tl.c postmaster of Paris, who happened to be a spy of
                    Fouquet’s, it gave rise to a bitter quarrel, which, however, Mazarin repressed
                    during his lifetime.</p>
                <p>In 1661 the death of Mazarin allowed Colbert to take the first place in the
                    administration. It was some time before he assumed official dignities; but in
                    January 1664 he obtained the post of superintendent of buildings; in 1665 he was
                    made controller-general; in 1669 he became minister of the marine; and he was
                    also appointed minister of commerce, the colonies, and the king’s palace. In
                    short, he soon acquired power in every department except that of war.</p>
                <p>A great financial and fiscal reform at once claimed all his energies. This he saw
                    was the first step toward raising France to the lofty position he intended her
                    to occupy. The country was in economic chaos. Those who had the fiscal
                    administration in their hands, from the superintendent to the meanest of the
                    tax-farmers, robbed and misappropriated almost as they pleased. The Government
                    loans were arranged, not so as to be most advantageous to the state, but so as
                    most to aggrandize the individuals who were interested in them. Not only the
                    nobility, but many others who had no legal claim to exemption, paid no taxes;
                    the weight of the burden fell on the wretched country-folk. Colbert sternly and
                    fearlessly set about his task. Supported by the young king, Louis X1V., he aimed
                    the first blow at the greatest of the extortioners—the bold and powerful
                    superintendent, Fouqaet. He was accused of high treason, not without sufficient
                    grounds, for it was known that he had prepared to meet an arrest formerly
                    contemplated by an appeal to force. The most minutely careful precautions <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n141/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0141-0122"/> were taken by Colbert for his seizure, and he was
                    tried before a specially prepared chamber of justice. Nevertheless the trial was
                    protracted during three years, and the sentence passed was not death but
                    banishment. The Government, however, carried out its plans. The superintendent
                    was safely disposed of in the state prison of Pignerol; just disgrace fell upon
                    Councillor d’Ormesson and the other judges who had averted the punishment
                    Fouquet richly deserved; and many minor officials, convicted of peculation, were
                    treated with great severity, some being banished, some sent to the galleys, some
                    even hanged.</p>
                <p>The office of superintendent and many others dependent upon it being abolished
                    the supreme control of the finances was vested in a royal council. The sovereign
                    was its president; but Colbert, though for four years he only possessed the
                    title of intendant, was its ruling spirit, great personal authority being
                    conferred upon him by the king. The career on which Colbert now entered must not
                    be judged without constant remembrance of the utter rottenness of the previous
                    financial administration. His ruthlessness in this case, dangerous precedent as
                    it was, was perhaps necessary; individual interests could not be respected.
                    Guilty officials having been severely punished, the fraudulent creditors of the
                    Government remained to be dealt with. Colbert’s method was simple. Some of the
                    public loans were totally repudiated, and from others a percentage was cut off,
                    which varied, at first according to his own decision, and afterwards according
                    to that of the council which he established to examine all claims against the
                    state.</p>
                <p>Much more serious difficulties met his attempts to introduce equality in the
                    pressure of the taxes on the various classes. To diminish the number of the
                    privileged was impossible, but false claims to exemption were firmly resisted,
                    and the unjust direct taxation was lightened by an increase of the indirect
                    taxes, from which the privileged could not escape. The mode of collection was at
                    the same time immensely improved.</p>
                <p>Order and economy being thus introduced into the working of the government, the
                    country, according to Colbert’s vast yet detailed plan, was to be enriched by
                    commerce. Manufactures were fostered in every way he could devise. New
                    industries were established, inventors protected, workmen invited from foreign
                    countries, French workmen absolutely prohibited to emigrate. To maintain the
                    character of French goods in foreign markets, as well as to afford a guarantee
                    to the home consumer, the quality and measure of each article were fixed by law,
                    breach of the regulations being punished by public exposure of the delinquent
                    and destruction of the goods, and, on the third offence, by the pillory. But
                    whatever advantage resulted from this rule was more than compensated by the
                    disadvantages it entailed. The production of qualities which would have suited
                    many purposes of consumption was prohibited, and the odious supervision which
                    became necessary involved great waste of time and a stereotyped regularity which
                    resisted all improvements. And other parts of Colbert’s scheme deserve still
                    less equivocal condemnation. By his firm maintenance of the corporation system,
                    each industry remained in the hands of certain privileged bourgeois; in this
                    way, too, improvement was greatly discouraged; while to the lower classes
                    opportunities of advancement were closed. With regard to international commerce
                    Colbert was equally unfortunate in not being in advance of his age; the tariffs
                    he published were protective to an extreme. The interests of internal commerce
                    were, however, wisely consulted. Unable to abolish the duties on the passage of
                    goods from province to province, he did what he could to induce the provinces to
                    equalize them. The roads and canals were improved. The great canal of Languedoc
                    was planned and constructed by Biquet under his patronage. To encourage trade
                    with the Levant, Senegal, Guinea, and other places, privileges were granted to
                    companies; but, like the more important East India Company, all were
                    unsuccessful. The chief cause of this failure, as well as of the failure of the
                    colonies, on which he bestowed so much watchful care, was the narrowness and
                    rigidity of the Government regulations.</p>
                <p>-The greatest and most lasting of Colbert’s achievements was the establishment of
                    the French marine. The royal navy owed all to him, for the king thought only of
                    military exploits. For its use, Colbert reconstructed the works and arsenal of
                    Toulon, founded the port and arsenal of Rochefort, and the naval schools of
                    Rochefort, Dieppe, and Saint-Malo, and fortified, with some assistance from
                    Vauban (who, however, belonged to the party of his rival Luvois), among other
                    ports those of Calais, Dunkirk, Brest, and Havre. To supply it with recruits he
                    invented his famous system of classes, by which each seaman, according to the
                    class in which he was placed, gave six months’ service every three or four or
                    five years. For three months after his term of service he was to receive
                    half-pay; pensions were promised; and, in short, everything was done to make the
                    navy popular. There was one department, however, that was supplied with men on a
                    very different principle. Letters exist written by Colbert to the judges
                    requiring them to sentence to the oar as many criminals as possible, including
                    all those who had been condemned to death; and the convict once chained to the
                    bench, the expiration of his sentence was seldom allowed to bring him release.
                    Mendicants also, against whom no crime had been proved, contraband dealers,
                    those who had been engaged in insurrections, and others immeasurably superior to
                    the criminal class, nay, innocent men—Turkish, Russian, and negro slaves, and
                    poor Iroquois Indians, whom the Canadians were ordered to entrap—were pressed
                    into that terrible service. By these means the benches of the galleys were
                    filled, and Colbert took no thought of the long unrelieved agony borne by those
                    who filled them.</p>
                <p>Nor was the mercantile marine forgotten. Encouragement was given to the building
                    of ships in France by allowing a premium on those built at home, and imposing a
                    duty on those brought from abroad; and as French workmen were forbidden to
                    emigrate, so French seamen were forbidden to serve foreigners on pain of
                    death.</p>
                <p>Even ecclesiastical affairs, though with these he had no official concern, did
                    not altogether escape Colbert’s attention. He took a subordinate part iu the
                    struggle between the king and Rome as to the royal rights over vacant
                    bishoprics; and he seems to have sympathized with the proposal that was made to
                    seize part of the wealth of the clergy. In his hatred of idleness, he ventured
                    to suppress no less than seventeen fêtes, and he had a project for lessening the
                    number of those devoted to clerical and monastic life, by fixing the age for
                    taking the vows some years later than was then customary. With heresy he was at
                    first unwilling to interfere, for he was aware of the commercial value of the
                    Huguenots; but when the king, under the influence of Mme. de Maintenon, resolved
                    to make all France Catholic, he followed his Majesty, and urged his subordinates
                    to do all that they could to promote conversions.</p>
                <p>In art and literature Colbert took much interest. He possessed a remarkably fine
                    private library, which he delighted to fill with valuable manuscripts from every
                    part of Europe where France had placed a consul. He has the honour of having
                    founded the Academy of Sciences (now called the Institut de France), the
                    Observatory, which he employed Perrault to build and brought Cassini from Italy
                    to superintend, the Academies of Inscriptions and Medals, of Architecture, and
                    of Music, the French Academy at <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n142/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0142-0123"/> Rome, and Academies at Arles, Soissons, Nîmes,
                    and many other towns, and he reorganized the Academy of Painting and Sculpture
                    which Richelieu had established. He was a member of the French Academy; and one
                    very characteristic rule, recorded to have been proposed by him with the
                    intention of expediting the great Dictionary, in which he was much interested,
                    was that no one should be accounted present at any meeting unless he arrived
                    before the hour of commencement and remained till the hour for leaving. In 1673
                    he presided over the first exhibition of the works of living painters; and he
                    enriched the Louvre with hundreds of pictures and statues. He gave many pensions
                    to men of letters, among whom we find Molière, Corneille, Racine, Boileau, Huet,
                    and Varillas, and even foreigners, as Huyghens, Vossius the geographer, Carlo
                    Dati the Dellacruscan, and Heinsius the great Dutch scholar. There is evidence
                    to show that by this munificence he hoped to draw out praises of his sovereign
                    and himself; but this motive certainly is far from accounting for all the
                    splendid, if in some cases specious, services that he rendered to literature,
                    science, and art.</p>
                <p>Indeed to everything that concerned the interests of France Colbert devoted
                    unsparing thought and toil. Besides all that has been mentioned, he found time
                    to do something for the better administration of justice (the codification of
                    ordinances, the diminishing of the number of judges, the reduction of the
                    expense and length of trials), for the establishment of a superior system of
                    police, and even for the improvement of the breed of horses and the increase of
                    cattle. As superintendent of public buildings he enriched Paris with boulevards,
                    quays, and triumphal arches; he relaid the foundation-stone of the Louvre, and
                    brought Bernin from Rome to be its architect; and he erected its splendid
                    colonnade upon the plan of Claude Perrault, by whom Bernin had been replaced. He
                    was not permitted, however, to complete the work, being compelled to yield to
                    the king’s preference for residences outside Paris, and to devote himself to
                    Marly and Versailles.</p>
                <p>Amid all these public labours his private fortune was never neglected. While he
                    was reforming the finances of the nation, and organizing its navy, he always
                    found time to direct the management of his smallest farm. He died a millionaire,
                    and left fine estates all over France. For his eldest son, who was created
                    Marquis de Seignelay, he obtained the reversion of the office of minister of
                    marine; his second son became archbishop of Rouen; and a third son, the Marquis
                    d’ Ormoy, became superintendent of buildings.</p>
                <p>In estimating the value of Colbert’s ministry, two distinct questions must be
                    considered—What its results would have been in the absence of counteracting
                    influences, over which he had no control, and what they actually were. To the
                    first it may be answered that France, peace ful, enriched by a wide-spread
                    commerce, and freed from the weight of taxes, alikeheavy and
                    intrinsicallymischievous, would probably have developed powers that would have
                    enabled her to throw aside what was harmful in his policy, and possibly to
                    attain liberty without the frenzied struggle of the Revolution. To the second
                    question a very different reply must be given. What the great “ministre de la
                    paix” built up was torn down, even as he built it, to erect the unholy fabric of
                    his master’s military glory. The war department was in the hands of Colbert’s
                    great rival, Luvois; and to every appeal for peace Louis was deaf. He was deaf
                    also to all the appeals against the other forms of his boundless extravagance
                    which Colbert, with all his deference towards his sovereign, bravely ventured to
                    make.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See especially a

                <p>Thus it came about that, only a few years after he had commenced to free the
                    country from the weight of the loans and taxes which crushed her to the dust,
                    Colbert was forced to heap upon her a new load of loans and taxes more heavy
                    than the last. Henceforth his life was a hopeless struggle, and the financial
                    and fiscal reform which, with the great exception of the establishment of the
                    navy, was the most valuable service to France contemplated by him. came to
                    nought.</p>
                <p>Depressed by his failure, deeply wounded by the king’s favour for Luvois, and
                    worn out by overwork, Colbert’s strength gave way at a comparatively early age.
                    In 1680 he was the constant victim of severe fevers, from which he recovered for
                    a time through the use of quinine prescribed by an English physician. But in
                    1683, at the age of sixty-four, he was seized with a fatal illness, and on the
                    6th of September he expired. It was said that he died of a broken heart, and a
                    conversation with the king is reported in which Louis disparagingly compared the
                    buildings of Versailles, which Colbert was superintending, with the works
                    constructed by Luvois in Flanders. He took to bed,Jt is true, immediately
                    afterwards, refusing to receive all messages from the king; but his constitution
                    was utterly broken before, and a post-mortem examination proved that he had been
                    suffering from stone. His body was interred in the secrecy of night, for fear of
                    outrage from the Parisians, by whom his name was cordially detested.</p>
                <p>Colbert was a great statesman, who did much for France, and would have done
                    vastly more had it been possible. Yet his insight into political science was not
                    deeper than that of his age; nor did he possess that superiority in moral
                    qualities which would have inspired him to bring in a reign of purity and
                    righteousness. His rule was a very bad example of over-government. In popular
                    liberty he did not believe; the parliaments and the States-G eneral received no
                    support from him. The technicalities of justice he never allowed to interfere
                    with his plans; justice herself he sometimes commanded to stay her course, and
                    beware of crushing any friend of his who happened to lie in her way. He
                    trafficked in public offices for the profit of Mazarin and in his own behalf. He
                    caused the suffering of thousands in the galleys; he had no ear, it is said, for
                    the cry of the suppliant. There was indeed a more human side to his character,
                    as is shown in his letters, full of wise advice and affectionate care, to his
                    children, his brothers, his cousins even. Yet to all outside he was “the man of
                    marble.” To diplomacy he never pretended; persuasion and deceit were not the
                    weapons he employed; all his work was carried out by the iron hand of authority.
                    He was a great statesman in that he conceived a magnificent yet practicable
                    scheme for making France first among nations, and in that he possessed a
                    matchless faculty for work, neither shrinking from the vastest undertakings nor
                    scorning the most trivial details.</p>
