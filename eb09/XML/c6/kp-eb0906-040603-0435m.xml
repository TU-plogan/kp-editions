                    rank of lieutenant-general of the admiralty. In consequence of the suppression

                    of piquant and delicate poems. In 1810 he received from Napoleon I. the
                    appointment of auditor to the council of state; and after the restoration of the
                    Bourbons he became master of requests. During the period of his connection with
                    the council he devoted himself zealously to the study of administrative law, and
                    acquired those stores of exact knowledge which afterwards furnished the material
                    for his principal work as a jurist. He was selected to prepare <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0436-0407"/> some of the most important reports of the
                    council. Among his separate publications at this time are noted,— <hi
                    rend="italic">Du</hi><hi rend="italic">Conseil d’Etat</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >envisage coìnme</hi><hi rend="italic">conseil et comme juridiction dans notre
                    monarchie constitutionelle</hi> (1818), and <hi rend="italic">De la
                    responsabilité des agents du gouvernement.</hi> In the former he claimed, for
                    the protection of the rights of private persons in the administration of
                    justice, the institution of a special court whose members should be irremovable,
                    the right of oral defence, and publicity of trial. In 1822 appeared his <hi
                    rend="italic">Questions de droit</hi><hi rend="italic">administratif,</hi> in
                    which he for the first time brought together and gave scientific shape to the
                    scattered elements of administrative law. These he arranged and stated clearly
                    in the form of aphorisms, with logical deductions, establishing them by proofs
                    drawn from the archives of the council of state. This is recognized as his most
                    important work as a jurist, and has become the chief authority on its subject.
                    It has passed through five editions, the fifth, which was published in 1840,
                    being thoroughly revised. In 1828 Cormenin entered the Chamber of Deputies as
                    member for Orleans, took his seat in the Left Centre, and began a vigorous
                    opposition to the Government of Charles X. As he was not gifted with the
                    qualifications of the orator, he seldom appeared at. the tribune; but in the
                    various committees he defended all forms of popular liberties, and at the same
                    time delivered, in a series of powerful pamphlets, under the pseudonym of
                    “Timon,” the most formidable blows against tyranny and all political and
                    administrative abuses. The ministerialists named him “Γ homme du contentieux.”
                    After the revolution of July 1830, Cormenin was one of the 221 who signed the
                    protest against the elevation of the Orleans dynasty to the throne; and he
                    resigned both his office in the council of state and his seat in the chamber. He
                    was, however, soon re-elected deputy, and now voted with the extreme Left. The
                    discussions on the budget in 1831 gave rise to the publication of his famous
                    series of <hi rend="italic">Lettres sur la liste civile,</hi> which in ten years
                    ran through twenty-five editions. In the following year he had the distinction
                    of being elected by four arrondissements; he took his seat for Belley. In 1834
                    he was elected by two arrondissements, and sat for Joigny, which he represented
                    till 1846, In this year he lost his seat in consequence of the popular prejudice
                    aroused against him by his trenchant pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Oui et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">non</hi> (1845) against attacks on religious liberty, and a second
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Feu! Feu!</hi> (1846), written in reply to those who
                    demanded a retractation of the former. In this he re-asserted his principles
                    still more relentlessly. Sixty thousand copies were rapidly sold. One inevitable
                    penalty which he had to suffer for these incisive manifestoes was exclusion from
                    the French Academy and the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. Cormenin was
                    an earnest advocate of universal suffrage before the revolution of February
                    1848, and had remorselessly exposed the corrupt practices at elections in his
                    pamphlet— <hi rend="italic">Ordre du jour sur</hi><hi rend="italic">la
                    corruption</hi><hi rend="italic">électorale.</hi> After the revolution he was
                    elected by four departments to the constituent assembly, and became one of its
                    vice-presidents. He was also member and president of the constitutional
                    commission, and for some time took a leading part in drawing up the republican
                    constitution. But the disputes which broke out among the members led him to
                    resign the presidency. He was soon after named member of the council of state
                    and president of the <hi rend="italic">comité du contentieux,</hi> It was at
                    this period that he published two pamphlets— <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">V independence</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >V</hi><hi rend="italic">Italie.</hi> After the <hi rend="italic">coup
                    dfétat</hi> of December 2, 1851, Cormenin, who had undertaken the defence of
                    Prince Louis Napoleon after his attempt at Strasburg, accepted a place in the
                    new council of state of the empire. Four years later, by imperial ordinance, he
                    was made a member of the Institute. One of the most characteristic works of
                    Cormenin, not yet mentioned is the <hi rend="italic">Livre des orateurs,</hi> a
                    series of brilliant studies of the principal parliamentary orators of the
                    restoration and the monarchy of July, the first edition of which appeared in
                    1838, and the eighteenth in 1860. In 1846 he published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Entretiens</hi><hi rend="italic">de village,</hi> which procured him the
                    Montyon prize, and of which six editions were called for the same year. His last
                    work was <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">droit de tonnage</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">en Algérie</hi> (1860). Cormenin was distinguished also as a
                    practical philanthropist, and is said to have established more charitable
                    institutions than any layman of his time in France. He was admitted to the
                    Legion of Honour in 1821, and was promoted commander in 1865. He died at Paris,
                    May 6, 1868.</p>
