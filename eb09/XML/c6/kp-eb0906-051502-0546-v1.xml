                <p><label type="entry">COURSING</label> may be defined as the hunting of game by
                    dogs solely by means of the organs of sight. From time to time the sport has
                    been pursued by various nations against various animals, but the recognized
                    method has generally been the coursing of the hare by greyhounds. Such sport is
                    of great antiquity, and is fully described by Arrian in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cynegeticus</hi> about 150 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when the leading
                    features appear to have been much the same as in the present day,, Other Greek
                    and Latin authors refer to the sport; but during the Middle Ages it was but
                    little heard of. It may be divided into private and public coursing. The former
                    is more pursued for the sake of filling the pot with game than with the view of
                    affording the exhilarating sport furnished by the latter. The private sportsman
                    seldom possesses good strains of blood to breed his greyhounds from, or has such
                    opportunities of trying them as the public courser. The first known set of rules
                    in England for determining the merits of a course were drawn up by Thomas, duke
                    of Norfolk, in Queen Elizabeth’s reign; but no open trials were heard of until
                    half a century later, in the time of Charles I. The oldest regular coursing club
                    whereof any record exists is that of £waffham, in Norfolk, which was founded by
                    Lord Orford in 1776. During the next seventy years many other large and
                    influential societies sprang υp throughout England and Scotland, but the first
                    open champion meeting was held at Glasgow in 1835, and since then they have
                    spread rapidly throughout the country. The chief followers of the sport are to
                    be found amongst the yeoman» and middle classes, who prefer coursing to
                    horse-racing on account of its being more economical and devoid of the chicanery
                    connected with the latter. Several noblemen, however, keep large kennels of
                    greyhounds, are enthusiastic patrons of coursing, and further the sport by
                    preserving hares and providing coursing grounds. The season lasts about six
                    months, commencing at the end of September. During 1875-76 the value of the
                    stakes and other prizes coursed for in the United Kingdom was upwards of
                    £40,000. It was not until 1858 that a coursing parliament, so to speak, was
                    formed, and a universally accepted code of rules drawn up. In that year the
                    National Coursing Club was founded. It is composed of representatives from all
                    clubs in the United Kingdom of more than a year’s standing, and possessing more
                    than twenty-four members. Their rules govern meetings, and their committee
                    adjudicate on matters of dispute. It must be borne in mind that a comparative
                    trial of two dogs, and not the capture of the game pursued, is the great
                    distinctive trait of modern coursing. Clubs either rent grounds to course over
                    or are allowed the use of land by large proprietors who are supporters of the
                    sport; but in either case a good stock of strong hares must be maintained by
                    preserving or otherwise. The chief breeds of coursing greyhounds now in vogue
                    are the Newmarket, the Lancashire, and the Scotch. The breeding and training of
                    a successful kennel is a precarious matter; and the most unaccountable ups and
                    downs of fortune often occur in a courser’s career. A club meeting is managed by
                    the society’s own members, and an open or champion one by whoever may be
                    appointed secretary, assisted in both cases by a committee. An agreed on even
                    number of entries are made for each stake, and the ties drawn by lot. After the
                    first round the winner of the first tie is opposed to the winner of the second,
                    and so on until the last two dogs left in compete for victory. A staff of
                    beaters drive the hares out of their coverts or other hiding-places, whilst the
                    slipper has the pair of dogs in hand, and slips them simultaneously by an
                    arrangement of nooses, when they have both sighted a hare promising a good
                    course. The judge accompanies on horseback, and the six points whereby he
                    decides a course are—(1) speed; (2) the go-bye, or when a greyhound starts a
                    clear length behind his opponent, passes him in the straight run, and gets a
                    clear length in front; (3) the turn, where the hare turns at not less than a
                    right angle; (4) the wrench, where the hare turns at less than a right angle;
                    (5) the kill; (6) the trip, or unsuccessful effort to kill. He may return a “no
                    course,” as his verdict, if the dogs have not been fairly tried together, or an
                    “undecided course” if he considers their merits equal. The open Waterloo
                    meeting, held at Altcar near Liverpool, every spring, is now the recognized
                    fixture for the decision <pb break="no"

                <p>Rabbit coursing is much pursued in the suburbs of Lancashire manufacturing towns.
                    It is conducted more artificially than hare coursing, the rabbit being dropt by
                    hand some twenty yards in front of the dogs, and the victor being the first that
                    catches and holds the game.</p>
