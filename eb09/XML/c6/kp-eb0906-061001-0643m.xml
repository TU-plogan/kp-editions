                    denote an instrument for inflicting capital punishment, or a gibbet formed of
                    two pieces of wood fixed together cross-wise without any reference to their
                    relative proportions. Μetaphorically, the term cross implies death thus
                    inflicted, and so it becomes synonymous with crucifixion, and is often used to
                    denote any exceptionally severe pain or heavy trial. The manner in which Christ
                    suffered has caused the cross, as the instrument for crucifixion, either to be
                    associated directly or indirectly with His death, or to be regarded as having a
                    reference to that fundamental fact of Christian history. And the same fact may
                    be assumed to be symbolized by the cross in every modification of form and
                    variety of adornment in use. for whatsoever purpose, throughout Christendom.</p>
                <p>The ancient practice of execution by hanging criminals on trees apparently led to
                    the adoption of crosses constructed for a similar purpose. Hence, hanging from
                    some part of a tree and the being fixed to a cross appear to have conveyed to
                    the Romans the same import; accordingly the expressions <hi rend="italic"
                    >infelix</hi><hi rend="italic">arbor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">infelix</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lignum,</hi> each of which may consistently be rendered “the

                <p>The barbarous execution by crucifixion, of which traces are to be found from
                    remote times among the nations of the East and North, was carried into effect in
                    two forms —(1) when the sufferer was left to perish bound to a tree or an
                    upright stake, sometimes after being impaled; and (2) when by nails driven
                    through his hands and feet, his limbs also sometimes further secured by cords,
                    the sufferer was fixed with outstretched arms to a cross having a horizontal bar
                    as well as a vertical stake. The terms employed in the Gospel narratives render
                    it certain that Christ thus was crucified. According to Lipsius <hi
                    rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Cruce,</hi> i. 5-9) and Gretser <hi

                    generally believed to have died. This cross is a “Latin cross,” when the shaft
                    below the transverse bar is longer than that part which rises above the
                    transverse bar, as †; and when the four limbs are of equal length, as in +, it
                    is a “Greek cross.” The ×, or <hi rend="italic">crux</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >decussata</hi> is further distinguished as the “St Andrew’s cross,” in
                    consequence of the apostle Andrew, according to a tradition, having been
                    crucified on a cross of this form. The <hi rend="italic">crux</hi><hi

                    capital T; and in the Middle Ages it was distinguished as the “cross of St
                    Anthony.”</p>
                <p>The gratuitous barbarity of scourging as a prelude to crucifixion, and of
                    compelling the condemned sufferer to carry his cross, or one of the parts of it,
                    to the place of execution, were but too strictly in keeping with the cruel
                    character of the Romans. Crucifixion with the head downwards, of which Seneca
                    speaks <hi rend="italic">(Consolat,</hi><hi rend="italic">ad Marc.,</hi> c. XX.

                    ecclesiastical historians (Rufinus, i. 7; Socrates, i. 13; Theodoret, i. 18; and
                    Sozomen, ii. 1), who all wrote between 75 and 100 years after the incidents
                    related, and whose story was accepted and supported by Cyril of Jerusalem,
                    Ambrose, and Chrysostom (seealso Tillemont, <hi rend="italic">Mem.
                    Eccles,</hi>,the chapter on Helena, and Jortin’s <hi rend="italic">Remarks,</hi>
                    vol. iii.). The story is to the effect that the empress, when visiting the
                    scenes hallowed by the Saviour’s ministry and sufferings, in the seventy-ninth
                    year of her age (326), was guided to the site of Calvary by an aged Jew who had
                    treasured those local traditions which the anti-Christian animosity of the
                    heathen conquerors of Jerusalem had not been able to obliterate. On excavation
                    at a considerable depth three crosses were found; and with them was the title
                    placed by Pilate’s command on the cross of Christ, lying apart by itself. The
                    cross of Christ was identified by a miracle, one only of the three crosses found
                    having proved to be endowed with the power of instantaneous healing conveyed by
                    a touch. This test by miracle was applied at the suggestion of Macarius, bishop
                    of Jerusalem; and its result, of course, was held to be conclusive. Having built
                    a church over the site of the “Invention,” where she deposited the greater part
                    of the supposed real cross, Helena took the remainder to Byzantium, whence a
                    portion of it was sent by Constantine to Rome, where it was placed in the church
                    of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, built expressly to receive so precious a relic. A
                    festival to commemorate the discovery of this relic soon was established;
                    pilgrimages, undertaken in order to obtain a sight of it, next followed; then
                    fragments of the sacred wood were sold at high prices to wealthy votaries; and,
                    after a while, in order to meet the exigencies of the case, the Roman
                    ecclesiastical authorities assured the increasing crowds of anxious purchasers
                    that the wood, if no longer working miracles of healing, exercised a power of
                    miraculous self-multiplication, <hi rend="italic">ut detrimenta</hi><hi

                    to have been removed, during the reign of St Louis, to Paris, and to be still
                    preserved in the Sainte Chapelle.</p>
                <p>After the capture of Jerusalem by the Persians, in 614, the remains of the cross
                    were taken to his capital by Chosroes II.; but, having been recovered by
                    Heraclius (628), they were brought by him to Constantinople, and afterwards to
                    their former resting-place in Jerusalem, where their re-appearance was said to
                    be hailed with a miraculous welcome. In after times this restoration was
                    commemorated by the festival of the “Exaltation of the Cross,” held on the 14th
                    of September. The transient revival of the Christian power in Jerusalem was
                    speedily followed (637) by the conquest of the Holy City by the Saracens, by
                    whom the cross relic may be assumed to have been destroyed; at all events, after
                    the Saracen conquest nothing more is heard of that relic in connection with
                    Jerusalem. A subterranean chapel, however, said to have been built upon the site
                    of Helena’s church, and which bears the title of the “Chapel of the Invention of
                    the Cross,” still exists, and is connected by a flight of steps with the
                    so-called Church of the Holy Sepulchre.</p>
                <p>The piece of wood supposed to have been inscribed with the title placed upon the
                    cross of Christ, and found with the three crosses by Helena, and retaining
                    traces of Hebrew and Roman letters, is said to be still preserved at Rome,
                    whither it was sent by Constantine. After having been long lost to sight and
                    apparently to remembrance also, this relic—so goes its history—was accidentally
                    discovered in the leaden chest in which it had been deposited by Constantine;
                    and both the fact of its discovery and the genuineness of the relic itself were
                    attested by a Bull of Pope Alexander III. The earliest writers are silent as to
                    the kind of wood of which the title-board and also the three crosses were made;
                    but a tradition, which notwithstanding its extreme improbability may be traced
                    to a very early era, represents the true cross to have been formed either of
                    cypress, pine, and cedar, or of cedar, cypress, palm and olive. (See facsimile
                    reproduction, 1863, 4to, by J. P. Berjeau, of the <hi rend="italic">History of
                    the Holy Cross,</hi> originally printed by J. Veldeuer in 1483.)</p>
                <p>In connection with the discovery of the cross itself and its attendant title, the
                    nails used at the crucifixion, and asserted to have been included in the
                    “Invention” by Helena, have a legendary history of their own. One of the
                    original four is declared to have been thrown by the empress herself into the
                    Adriatic when agitated by a violent storm, with the effect of producing an
                    instantaneous calm. A second nail after having been placed either in his crown
                    or in his helm by Constantine, is said to have been found in a mutilated state
                    in the church of Santa Croce. The Duomo of Milan claims the possession of the
                    third nail, and Treves that of the fourth. It must be added that some early
                    traditions limit the number of the nails to three; while, on the other hand,
                    certain writers have raised the number of the nails as high as fourteen, for the
                    safe keeping of each one of which places have been found. In the illustrations
                    of the crucifixion given by Lady Eastlake <hi rend="italic">(History of our
                    Lord,</hi> vol. ii.), sometimes we find a single nail, and at other times two
                    nails, used for the feet. That accomplished lady seems to consider the
                    separation of the feet with a nail for each to be characteristic of the earlier
                    conceptions of the crucifixion, which present Christ after He had been nailed on
                    the cross as still “alive and erect, and apparently elate; His feet always
                    separate, and with two nails upon the footboard, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >suppedaneum</hi> (a Greek feature), to which they were attached; the arms at
                    right angles with the body, the hands straight, the eyes open.” The <hi
                    rend="italic">suppedaneum</hi> is supposed to have been a piece of wood
                    projecting slightly from the shaft of the cross beneath the feet of the
                    sufferer, with a view to afford some support to his body. It is in the later
                    representations that one of Christ’s feet appear placed over the other, the
                    ankles being crossed, when a single nail pierces both the feet, or both the
                    ankles. For many curious particulars concerning representations of the
                    crucifixion and its attendant incidents in early and mediaeval art, readers are
                    referred to Lady Eastlake’s volume; also to Mrs Jameson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Legends of the Madonna,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sacred and Legendary
                    Árt.</hi> Early writers all incline to the more probable opinion that Christ was
                    attached to the cross while it lay on the ground; Bonaventura, however (born
                    1221), states that he ascended a ladder, and was nailed to the cross standing,
                    after the cross itself had been erected and fixed in its position. “The impress
                    of each opinion is seen in art,” writes Lady Eastlake <hi rend="italic">(Hist,
                    of our Lord,</hi> ii. pp. 130-133), “that of our Lord ascending, the ladder on
                    the cross being the earliest, that of His extending himself on the ground being
                    the most frequent.” A remarkable example of the latter opinion occurs in the
                    sculpture of one of the bosses in the vaulting of the twelfth bay of the nave of
                    Norwich Cathedral, where the figure of Christ is further represented as having
                    the extremities of the limbs drawn by cords to the shaft and the ends of the
                    transverse beam of the cross, as a preliminary to the driving the nails. The
                    cross, when raised and fixed erect, doubtless elevated the sufferer to no
                    unnecessary height, his feet then probably being not more than 18 or 20 inches
                    above the surface of the ground. In comparatively late mediaeval heraldry the

                    and dice —were often blazoned on shields introduced in Gothic edifices and upon
                    monumental memorials, as “Symbols of the Passion.”</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">crucifix</hi> is applied to a Latin cross, in size
                    either small or large, to which a human figure, designed to represent the body
                    of Christ when suffering crucifixion, is affixed.</p>
                <p>As a symbol of the Christian faith at once pre-eminently characteristic and
                    significant, the cross in various modifications of its form would naturally be
                    adopted on very many occasions, and used in a diversity of ways throughout the
                    Christian world. Scarcely less natural also was it that from an early era
                    Christian writers should have treated the symbolism of the cross with fanciful
                    and even extravagant refinement, and endowed it with mysterious attributes;
                    while superstition, which as time advanced threw so baneful a shadow over
                    Christianity itself, would not fail to deal after its own fashion with the sign
                    of the cross. It is curious, on the other hand, that a cruciform device having
                    diverse significations should have occupied a prominent position among the many
                    sacred and mystic figures and symbols connected with the mythologies of heathen
                    antiquity. Such certainly was the case in Egypt, Assyria, Persia, and India, and
                    also among the Scandinavian races of the North. Possibly the cross figure
                    sometimes may have found its way among heathen symbols in early Christian times;
                    and, again, the presence of the great symbol of Christianity in such an alliance
                    on other occasions may have suggested an early Christian influence that never
                    had any real existence. In the Middle Ages the cross sign was universally held
                    to be the special and distinctive symbol of Christianity, as, to the present
                    day, the cross and the crescent are symbols which distinguish the faith of the
                    Christian from that of the Moslem.</p>
                <p>In the great art of Christian architecture, and throughout the entire range of
                    mediaeval decorative art, the cross sign has exercised a most powerful
                    influence. The ground on which the grandest churches, as well as many others of
                    a less aspiring order were erected, was made to assume a cruciform plan, so that
                    the very walls from their foundations upwards might carry with them, as they
                    rose, the image of the sacred sign, to receive its crowning figure displayed in
                    the ridge-lines of their roofs. Crosses, exhibiting an endless variety of form,
                    proportion, and adornment, surmounted the loftiest and most important
                    architectural members of cathedrals and churches; and here and there upon the
                    masonry they attested the consecration for Christian worship of the buildings
                    which bore them; five crosses, in like manner (their number determined by the
                    five wounds of the crucified Christ) gave similar witness to the consecration of
                    every altar slab; and monumental stones of every kind in the pavements of the
                    churches repeated the same great sign, to proclaim that each one of the dead who
                    rested there had died in the faith. With the triumph of Christianity, the cross
                    at once was recognized as a universal symbol of the highest dignity and honour.
                    It was made of the most precious materials, enriched with the most costly gems,
                    and adorned with most exquisite art. The cross became the proudest ensign upon
                    royal diadems; and it gave both their form and their name to the noblest
                    insignia of knightly rank. The cross crowned the sceptres of princes; and the
                    greatest warriors were proud to see the cross as well in the hilts of their
                    swords as in the banners under which they fought. In private life also the cross
                    was held in corresponding estimation; and, accordingly, the most beautiful and
                    most highly prized personal orna ments appeared in some cruciform type. Thus was
                    art taught to aid in realizing the enthusiastic sentiment of Justin Martyr, when
                    he said <hi rend="italic">(Apol.</hi> i. 72)—“The sign of the cross is impressed
                    upon the whole of nature. There is hardly a handicraftsman, also, but uses the
                    figure of it among the implements of his industry. It forms a part of man
                    himself, as may be seen when he raises his hands in prayer.”</p>
                <p>The simplest treatment of the plain rectangular cross (fig. 1), with a view to
                    its enrichment, may be assumed to have consisted either in expanding each limb
                    from the point of their common intersection, and so forming a “Maltese cross”
                    (fig. 2), or by giving some ornamentation to each limb at its extremity (fig.
                    3). The expanded cross, when of Greek proportions (fig. 2), would readily
                    suggest having its extremities bounded by curved lines, and then the inclosure
                    of such a cross within a circle would naturally follow (fig. 4). The next step
                    would be either to place a circular disc upon the cross, as at Iona (fig. 5), or
                    to extend the limbs of the cross beyond the circle, as in fig. 10, the west
                    gable cross of Washburn Church in Worcestershire, or in fig. 6, also at Iona. In
                    any of these cases the addition of a shaft would produce a Latin cross. The
                    circular band, again, thus associated with a cross would naturally lead to the
                    introduction of decorative accessories specially connected with itself, as in
                    fig. 11, from the gable cross of the nave of the church at Castle-acre, Norfolk.
                    The combination of an erect cross with a diagonal one would be another
                    modification, producing a cross of eight points, easy of attainment, and one
                    that in its turn would suggest and lead to a variety of further modifications of
                    construction, with many diversified enrichments. From known examples still in
                    existence, and in fair if not perfect preservation, it is evident that the
                    mediaeval artists delighted to expatiate in the wide field opened out before
                    them for designing the cross sign under fresh conditions of both form and
                    decoration. They wrought leaves and flowers into cruciform figures, and adorned
                    their crosses with foliage in every degree of richness. They made the cross both
                    simple and compound; they introduced it in combination with other figures and
                    devices; and they composed it from figures and devices, each one of them having
                    some definite motive or significance of its own.</p>

                    Upright architectural crosses of memðrial, erected with a view to their being
                    expressly associated with sepulchral commemoration, may be considered to form a
                    distinct class. Such are the beautiful and justly famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eleanor crosses,</hi> originally nine in number,—at Lincoln, Northampton, Stony
                    Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St Alban’s, Waltham, and Cheap and Charing in
                    London. From the accounts of the executors of Queen Eleanor it appears that the
                    whole of these crosses, designed to mark the places where the funeral procession
                    of the first Edward’s first consort halted for rest, were executed and erected
                    between 1291 and 1294. The cross at Geddington, generally considered one of the
                    “Eleanor” series, is not recorded in the roll; and of the nine therein specified
                    two only now are standing,—those at Northampton and Waltham.</p>

                    slabs, which in England first appear at the close of the 11 th century, and from
                    that period gradually become general, are executed either in low relief or by
                    incised lines; in some instances the two methods of treatment are combined.
                    Occasionally repeated in the same example, the cross sign, exhibiting a truly
                    wonderful variety of design, at first appears alone, the shaft or stem almost
                    always considerably elongated, and often enriched with sprouting foliage or some
                    other ornamentation. Fig. 13, from Strad-sett church, Norfolk, and fig. 14, from
                    Bosbury, Herefordshire, are characteristic examples of enriched monumental
                    crosses. When the elongated shaft of a cross on a slab rises from two or more
                    steps at its base, it is said to be a <hi rend="italic">Calvary cross.</hi>
                    After a while, a brief inscription is found to have been added. Then the further
                    addition appears to have been introduced of some device or figure, which might
                    symbolize the profession, occupation, rank, or office of the person
                    commemorated,— such as a pastoral staff for a prelate, a chalice for a priest, a
                    sword for a knight, a trumpet for a trumpeter, a bell for a bell-founder, a
                    hammer and pincers with a sword for an armourer, a horse-shoe and hammer for a
                    smith, &lt;fcc. In a few instances, a knightly sword placed erect in the centre
                    of a slab either acts as the shaft of a cross, or with its cruciform guard to
                    the hilt the figure of the weapon itself becomes the cross symbol. There are
                    also occasionally found early monumental stones, upon which both a cross and the
                    head or bust and the feet of a human figure are so treated as to form a single
                    composition. Kneeling figures, again, are sometimes introduced either at the
                    foot of a monumental cross, or on each side of the shaft of such a cross; and
                    full length figures, and sometimes half figures, in other examples appear placed
                    within the expanded floriated heads of monumental crosses. (See Walter s and

                <p>In the heraldry of the Middle Ages the cross, its form and enrichment treated in
                    many ways, as a charge is second to none in rank and estimation (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Heraldry).</hi> The English cross of St George is a plain red
                    cross set erect on a white ground; the Scottish cross of St Andrew is a plain
                    diagonal white cross on a blue ground; and the Irish cross of St Patrick is a
                    plain diagonal red cross on a white ground. The “Tau” cross, which occasionally
                    is found in English heraldry, is blazoned as in fig. 7. Another form of cross,
                    shown in fig. 8, bears the name of “Fylfot,” and is one of the most singular, as
                    it is one of the most ancient, of the many forms and modifications of this
                    symbol. Considered by some writers to be composed of four Greek capital “Gammas”
                    conjoined, this mystic figure, which was in high favour with early secret
                    societies, sometimes was called “Gammadion.” In the mythology of the North,
                    again, it was held to symbolize “Mjolnir,” the formidable cross-formed hammer of
                    Thor, and is accordingly known by the third title of “Thor’s hammer.” It occurs
                    in both Scandinavian and Roman relics; and it was in frequent use as a
                    decorative device in the Middle Ages, especially as a mark upon bells. On the
                    monument of Bishop Bronescomb, 1281, in Exeter Cathedral, the fylfot has its
                    limbs alternately yellow and red.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Initial crosses</hi> were placed in the Middle Ages at the
                    commencement of inscriptions, and occupied a similar position in written
                    documents of all kinds. The initial cross of the inscription to Abbot Thomas
                    Delamere, upon, his brass at St Alban’s (1360), is an interesting example, since
                    it is formed of a delicate erect cross floriated at its extremities, which
                    surmounts a bolder diagonal cross, or cross saltire, the armorial ensign of the
                    abbey of St Alban.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Knightly crosses.—</hi> The cross worn, as distinctive of their
                    order, by the Knights Templars, was a red cross of eight points (fig. 9) upon
                    white. The cross of the Knights Hospitallers, or Knights of St John, was of
                    similar form, but white and worn on a black ground; from the years 1278 and
                    1289, however, when engaged with military duties, the Knights of St John wore a
                    plain straight white cross upon red. (For the crosses of the monastic orders,

                    the Dannebrog (fig. 15), a white cross surmounting a red one, with the royal

                    Christian symbol in the insignia of the knighthood of the present day. In the
                    highest class of British insignia, the cross appears on the circlets only of the

                <p>A <hi rend="italic">pectoral cross,</hi> formed of rich and costly materials, was
                    worn at times by ecclesiastics of the highest rank. In the East pectoral crosses
                    were worn, suspended about the neck and resting on the breast, as both imperial
                    and episcopal ornaments. Characteristic examples of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pectorale</hi> occur in the effigies of Bishops Kilkenny, 1255, at Ely;
                    Giffard, 1301, at Worcester; and Langton, 1321, at Lichfield. This same term
                    “pectorale” may consistently be applied to all crosses, worn under similar
                    conditions by personages of exalted rank. Of such crosses a specimen of singular
                    interest and great beauty, now well known from fac-simile reproductions of it as
                    the “Dagmar cross” (fig. 16 shows both sides of it), was found about 1690 (when
                    her tomb was opened), lying on the breast of the remains of Dagmar, “the bright
                    day,” the queen of Waldemar II., king of Denmark, who died in 1213. This jewel,
                    certainly of Byzantine design and workmanship, is of gold, enamelled, having on
                    one side a crucifix, and on the other side portraits of Christ (in the centre),
                    of St Basil, St John Chrysostom, St Mary the Virgin, and St John the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Crosier</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Crozier</hi> is the title
                    given to the official staff of an archbishop, which has a cross-head, and so is
                    distinguished from the “pastoral staff”of bishops and abbots, the head of which
                    is curved and resembles that of a shepherd’s crook. Examples of the crosier
                    occur in the brasses to Archbishops de Waldeby, 1397, in Westminster Abbey, and
                    Cranley, 1417, in New College Chapel, Oxford; the latter example has a crucifix
                    for its head, which is the case also in a remarkable drawing of an archbishop in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lambeth Psalter</hi> (c. 1300) in the library at Lambeth.
                    The fine effigy of Archbishop Walter de Gray at York, 1255, has a crookhead
                    staff of great beauty; in his brass, too, at Chigwell, Essex, Archbishop
                    Harsnett, 1631, is represented, not with a crosier, but with a pastoral staff.
                    Instead of having crook-heads, the crosiers of the prelates of the Greek Church
                    have heads of the “Tau” form, and the extremities of the horizontal bar are
                    curved upwards. The staff of a patriarch has a double cross-head; and the head
                    of the pontifical staff of the Pope has a triple cross. Good examples of the
                    pastoral staves of bishops and abbots abound in their monumental effigies, of
                    which one of the most admirable is in the brass to Abbot Delamere (c. 1360), at
                    St Alban’s. The magnificent enamelled staff of Bishop William of Wykeham, as is
                    well known, is still preserved at New College, Oxford. (c. <hi rend="smallcaps"
