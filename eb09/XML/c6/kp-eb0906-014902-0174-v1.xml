                        Marie</hi></label> (1750-1796), a prominent actor in the French Revolution,
                    was a Parisian actor. After figuring for some years at the principal provincial
                    theatres of France and Holland, he became director of the playhouse at Geneva.
                    He had from the first a share in the revolutionary tumult; but it was not until
                    1791 that he became a figure of importance. Then, however, by the publication of
                        <hi rend="italic">L</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Almanach du Père</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Gérard,</hi> a tract designed to set forth, in hρmely style,
                    the advantages of a constitutional government, he suddenly acquired great
                    popularity. His renown was soon increased by his active interference on behalf
                    of the Swiss of the Château-Vieux Regiment, condemned to the galleys for mutiny
                    at Nancy. His efforts resulted in their liberation; he went himself to Brest in
                    search of them; and a civic feast was decreed on his behalf and theirs, which
                    gave occasion for one of the few poems published during his life by André
                    Chénier. He next endeavoured to obtain the office of minister of justice, but
                    was disappointed. The Tenth of August, however, placed him in the municipality
                    of Paris. There he attached himself to Billaud-Varenne, and had with him a large
                    share in bringing about the September Massacres. Having been elected a deputy
                    for Paris to the Convention, he was among the first to demand the abolition of
                    royalty; and from Nice, whither he had gone on an embassy, he voted the death of
                    Louis XVI.—“<hi rend="italic">sans sursis.”</hi> In the struggle between the
                    Mountain and the Girondists he displayed great energy; and after the <hi
                        rend="italic">coup d'etat</hi> of May 31 (1793) be made himself conspicuous
                    by his pitiless pursuit of the defeated party. In June he was made president of
                    the Convention; and in September, with Billaud-Varenne, he was admitted to the
                    Committee of Public Safety. He voted loudly and persistently for all the
                    bloodiest and sternest measures. In November, after the Lyonese insurrection, he
                    was sent with Fouché to punish the rebellious city, where, it is said, he had
                    once been hissed as an actor. This he effected by putting about 1500 persons to
                    death in one day. In May 1794 an attempt was made to assassinate Collot; but it
                    only increased his popularity. In the struggle for mastery between Robespierre
                    and Tallien, Collot took the part of the latter In spite, however, of his fierce
                    attack on Robespierre he was expelled from the Committee of Public Safety, and
                    was denounced in form by Lecointre. He defended himself, and was acquitted, but
                    only to be denounced anew by Merlin, and to be condemned, with Billaud-Varenne,
                    to transportation to Cayenne, where he died of fever a few months after his
                    arrival.</p>
