                    public indifference, and reaping at last a harvest of appreciation that
                    astonished himself. Besides, he dedicated his life to home scenery and its
                    atmospherical conditions exclusively, so that his productions are truly English,
                    while their artistic mastery, and their power to convey the impressions he
                    intended, are unsurpassed, perhaps unequalled, by the works of any of his
                    contemporaries, even those of higher genius and much more general culture. It
                    must be remembered also, that in Cox’s works <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0567-0536"/> we see our native art of water-colour painting in
                    its purest condition, expressing only a direct, general, and honest sentiment by
                    the simplest means, before the doctrine of “art for art’s sake” had made our
                    painters determined to show on their canvas more than they see in nature.</p>
                <p>In a small house attached to the forge of his father, a hardworking master smith,
                    in a mean suburb of Birmingham, Cox was born, 29th April 1783. Turning his hand
                    to what he could get to do, Joseph Cox, the father, was both blacksmith and
                    whitesmith, and when the war began took to the making of bayonets and horse
                    shoes, on wholesale commission, and immediately the boy David was thought able
                    to assist he was taken from the poor elementary school in the neighbourhood, and
                    set to the anvil. The attempt to turn the boy to this kind of labour had,
                    however, been made too early; it was too heavy for his strength, and he was sent
                    to what was called by the cyclops of Birmingham a “toy trade,” making lacquered
                    buckles, painted lockets, tin snuff boxes, and other “fancy” articles. Here
                    David very soon acquired some power of painting miniatures, and his talents
                    might have been misdirected had his master, Fieldler by name, not released him
                    from his apprenticeship by dying,—dying by his own hand; and David found an
                    opening as colour-grinder and scene-painter’s fag in the theatre then leased,
                    with several others, by the father of Macready, the tragedian.</p>
                <p>This obscure step, not one of promotion at the time, was really the most
                    important incident in the uneventful career of Cox. It may be remembered that
                    scene-painting has been to our landscape-painters what the goldsmith education
                    was to the masters of the Italian renaissance, and we are safe in saying that
                    the habits of hard work on a large scale, and the rough and ready self
                    dependence thus cultivated, can never be too much commended. The boy, who had
                    inherited a rather weakly body, and had been trained with care by a pious
                    mother, while intellectually negative and unable to cope with any kind of
                    learning whatever, had endless perseverance, great strength of application, and
                    all through life remained genial, gentle, simple-minded, and modest, his
                    penetration and self-reliance being wholly professional, inspired by his love of
                    nature and his knowledge of his subject. Not very quick, and with little
                    versatility, he went step by step in one line of study from the time he began to
                    get the smallest remuneration for his pictures to the age of seventy-five, when
                    he painted large in oil very much the same class of subjects he had of old
                    produced small in water-colours, with the same impressive and unaffectedly noble
                    sentiment, only increased by the mastery of almost infinite practice. He was
                    never led astray by fictitious splendour of any kind, except once indeed in
                    1825, when he imitated Turner, and produced a classic subject he called
                    Carthage, AEneas, and Achates. He never visited Venice or Egypt, or crossed the
                    Channel except for a week or two in Belgium and Paris, and never even went to
                    Scotland for painting purposes. Bettws-y-Coed and its neighbourhood was
                    everything to him, and characteristics most truly English were beloved by him
                    with a sort of filial instinct. So completely did he love the country, that even
                    London, where it was his interest to live, had few attractions, and did not
                    retain him long.</p>
                <p>This residence in the metropolis which began in 1804 was, however, of the most
                    essential educational advantage to him. The Water-Colour Society was established
                    the year after he arrived, and was mainly supported by landscape-painters. He
                    was not, of course, admitted at first into membership, not till 1813, before
                    which time an attempt to establish a rival exhibition had been made. In this Cox
                    joined, the result being very serious to him, an entire failure entailing the
                    seizure and forced sale of all tne pictures. At that time the tightest economy
                    was the rule with him, and to save the trifling cost of new strainers or
                    stretching boards, he covered up one picture by another. When these works were
                    prepared for re-sale, fifty years afterwards, some of them yielded picture after
                    picture, peeled off the boards like the waistcoats from the body of the
                    gravedigger in Hamlet!</p>
                <p>While lodging near Astley’s Circus he married his landlady’s daughter, and then
                    took a modest cottage at Dulwich, where he gradually left off scene-painting and
                    became teacher, giving lessons at ten shillings a lesson. This entailed walking
                    to the pupils’ homes, and the gift of the paintings done before the pupils.
                    These have since been frequently sold for 30 or 40 guineas, but his own price,
                    when lucky enough to sell his best works, was never over a few pounds, and more
                    frequently about fifteen shillings. Sometimes, indeed, he sold them in
                    quantities at two pounds a dozen to be resold to country teachers. By and by he
                    resisted the leaving of the work done to the pupil, but with little advantage to
                    himself, as he saw no end to the accumulation of his own productions, and
                    actually tore them up, and threw them into areas, or pushed them into drains
                    during his trudge homeward. A number of years after he pointed out a particular
                    drain to a friend, and said, “Many a work of mine has gone down that way to the
                    Thames !”</p>
                <p>Shortly after he had turned thirty, his stay in London suddenly ended. He was
                    offered the enormous sum of £100 per annum by a ladies’ college in Hereford, and
                    thither he went. This sum he supplemented by teaching in the Hereford grammar
                    school for many years, at six guineas a year, and in other schools at better
                    pay, but still, and up to his fortieth year, we find his prices for pictures
                    from eight to twenty-five shillings. Cox has no history apart from his
                    productions, and these particulars as to his remuneration possess an interest
                    almost dramatic when wθ contrast them with the enormous sums realized by his
                    later works, and with the “honours and observance, troops of friends,” that
                    accompanied old age with him, when settled down in his own home at Harborne,
                    near his native town, where he died on June 7, 1859, aged seventy-six.</p>
                <p>Cox’s second short residence in London, dating from 1835 to 1840, marks the
                    period of his highest powers. During those years, and for twelve years after,
                    his productiveness kept pace with his mastery, and it would be difficult to
                    overrate the impressiveness of effect, and high feeling, within the narrow range
                    of subject displayed by many of these works. He was now surrounded by dealers,
                    and wealth flowed in upon him. Still he remained the same, a man with few wants
                    and scarcely any enjoyments except those furnished by his brush and his colours.
                    The home at Harborne was a pleasant one, but the approach to the front was
                    useless as the door was kept fastened up, the only entrance being through the
                    garden at the back, and the principal room appropriated as his studio he was
                    content to reach by a narrow stair from the kitchen. Neither in it nor elsewhere
                    was there any luxury or even taste visible:—- no <hi rend="italic"
                    >bric-a-brac,</hi> no objects of interest, few or no books, no pictures except
                    landscapes by his friends. When in winter, after his wife’s death, the fire went
                    out, and the cold at last surprised him, he lifted his easel into the little
                    diningroom and began again. A union of his friends was formed in 1855 to procure
                    a portrait of him, which was painted by Sir J. Watson Gordon; and an exhibition
                    of his works was opened in London in 1858 and again another in 1859. This was
                    actually open when the news of his death arrived.</p>
                <p>The number of David Cox’s works, great and small, is enormous. He produced
                    hundreds annually for perhaps forty-five years. This being the case, it has been
                    the interest of dealers to force their price. Mr Flatou, himself an adept, used
                    to boast that it took six horse-dealers to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0568-0537"/> make one picture-dealer, so that it is difficult
                    to say what is their intrinsic or permanent value. Before his death and for ten
                    years thereafter, their prices were remarkable, as witness the following,
                    obtained at auction—Going to the Mill, £1575; Old Mill at Bettws-y-Coed, £1575;
                    Outskirts of a Wood, with Gipsies, £2305; Peace and War, £3430. (w. B. sc.)</p>
