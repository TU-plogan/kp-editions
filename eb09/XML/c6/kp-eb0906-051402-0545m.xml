                    estate of Méré in Touraine, to which he retired when, in consequence of a
                    serious quarrel with a duke, he was compelled to leave Paris. The son, still in
                    his childhood, imbibed a bitter aversion to the nobility, which seemed to
                    strengthen with time. He would never take the name “de Méré,” to which he was
                    entitled, lest he should be thought a nobleman. At the age of fifteen he was
                    sent to Paris to complete his education; and there he studied chiefly
                    mathematics and Greek. For Greek literature he had a passionate fondness, and
                    attained in it so remarkable a proficiency that he was complimented by German
                    scholars.</p>
                <p>Destined by his father for the army, he entered the school of artillery at
                    Chalons, and received his appointment as sublieutenant in September 1792. He
                    servedin various campaigns of the Revolutionary wars, especially in those of
                    Italy in 1798-1799 and 1806-1807, and in the German campaign of 1809. He
                    attained the rank of <hi rend="italic">chef</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">escadron</hi> in 1803.
                    Meanwhile, whenever circumstances left him at leisure, he devoted himself to his
                    favourite studies. He made his first appearance as an author in 1802, when he
                    contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Magasin Encyclopédique</hi> a critique on
                    Schweighäuser’s edition of Athenaeus. In the following year appeared his <hi
                    rend="italic">Eloge d’Hélène,</hi> a free imitation rather than a translation
                    from Isocrates, wſhich he had sketched in 1798. Courier quitted the army after
                    the battle of Wagram (1809), the savage independence of his nature rendering
                    subordination and obedience irksome and intolerable to him; while his superiors
                    found it hard to bear the chastisement of his satirical humour, wſhich he freely
                    indulged without respect of persons. After leaving the army he went to Florence,
                    and was fortunate enough to discover in the Laurentian Library a complete
                    manuscript of Longus’s <hi rend="italic">Daphnis</hi><hi rend="italic">and
                    Chloe,</hi> an edition of wſhich he published in 1810. In consequence of a
                    misadventure·—blotting the m.- uscript—he w as involved in a quarrel with the
                    librarian, and was compelled by the Government to leave Tuscany. He retired to
                    his estate at Veretz (Indre-et-Loire), but frequently visited Paris, and divided
                    his attention between literature and his farm. After the second restoration of
                    the Bourbons the career of Courier as political pamphleteer began. He had before
                    this time waged war against local wrongs in his ow n district, and had been the
                    adviser and helpful friend of his neighbours. He now carried the war into a
                    larger field, and by his letters and pamphlets made himself one of the most
                    dreaded opponents of the Government of the Restoration. In 1817 he was a
                    candidate for a vacant seat in the Institute; and failing, e took his revenge by
                    publishing a bitter <hi rend="italic">Lettre à</hi><hi rend="italic">Messieurs
                    de</hi><hi rend="italic">l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Académie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Inscriptions</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Belles-Lettres</hi> (1819). This was followed (1819-1820) by a series of
                    letters published in <hi rend="italic">Le Censeur,</hi> which by the
                    extraordinary power displayed in them gives him a place in literature only
                    second to the author of the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Provinciales.</hi> The
                    proposal, in 1821, to purchase the estate of Chambord for the duke of Bordeaux
                    called forth from Courier the <hi rend="italic">Simple</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Discours,</hi> one of his most powerful and successful pieces. For this he was
                    tried and condemned to suffer a short imprisonment and to pay a fine. Before he
                    went to prison he published a <hi rend="italic">Compte</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rendu</hi> of his trial, which had a still larger circulation than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Discours</hi> itself. In 1823 appeared the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Livret</hi><hi rend="italic">de Paul Louis,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Gazette
                    de Village,</hi> and other pieces, which were followed in 1824 by his famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Pamphlet des Pamphlets,</hi> called by his biographer, Armand
                    Carrel, his swan-:ong. Courier projected a translation of Herodotus, and
                    published a specimen, in wſhich he attempted to imitate archaic French; but he
                    did not live to carry out his plan. In the spring of 1825, on a Sunday afternoon
                    (April 10), Courier was found shot in a wood near his house. The murderers
                    remained undiscovered for five years. The w ritings of Courier, dealing with the
                    facts and events of his own time, are valuable sources of information as to the
                    condition of France before, during, and after the Revolution. Their literary
                    merits are thus set forth in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> (vol.
                    xlix.) :—</p>
                <p>“They abound in plain, strong, masculine sense, illustrated with classical
                    allusions, naturally and happily introduced, and seasoned with wit more
                    brilliant than is almost anywhere else to be foiínd; for it has the keen edge of
                    Swift’s satire, with a style of more pointed epigram, and the easy playfulness
                    of Voltaire, without his pertness and flippancy. His statements and narratives
                    are short, and so clear as to present a sudden and lively picture ∙ his
                    arguments are models of conciseness and force.” <pb break="no"
