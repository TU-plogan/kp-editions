                    tribe was divided by the constitution of Romulus. There being three tribes,
                    there were thirty curiae, a number which was not altered when the number of the
                    tribes was increased' to thirty-five. This division was a division of the
                    populus, to the exclusion of the plebs; and hence the assembly of the populus
                    was called the <hi rend="italic">comitia curiata.</hi> But when Servius Tullius
                    instituted the <hi rend="italic">comitia centuriata</hi> as the sovereign
                    assembly of the republic, the <hi rend="italic">comitia curiata</hi> lost almost
                    all power other than ecclesiastical, except that of conferring upon magistrates
                    the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> and the privilege of taking auspices; and
                    even this remnant of their political authority became a mere form, which was
                    sometimes neglected. But the curiae retained all their ecclesiastical functions;
                    each elected a chief priest, or <hi rend="italic">curio,</hi> and a subordinate
                    priest, called the <hi rend="italic">curialis flamen,</hi> while together they
                    elected the <hi rend="italic">curio</hi><hi rend="italic">maximus,</hi> who
                    presided over the <hi rend="italic">curiones.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">comitia
                    curiata</hi> alone could sanction <hi rend="italic">adrogatio,</hi> or the
                    adoption of a man who was <hi rend="italic">sui juris,</hi> or not under the
                    control of parents. The building in which a curia met was also called a <hi
                    rend="italic">curia;</hi> and the name was given, besides, to the buildings in
                    which a senate met, and even to a senate itself, though never to the senate of
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>Under the later empire the “curiales” exercised many important and very
                    diversified functions, which Jacobus Gothofredus gives a catalogue of under
                    twenty-two heads (see <hi rend="italic">Animad. in Cod.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theod.,</hi> lib. xii. tit. i.). Bingham speaks of these offices of the
                    “curiales” as synonymous <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n746/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0746-0711"/> with “municipal” offices. The holders of them
                    were by special ecclesiastical constitution made incapable of receiving holy
                    orders. And, on the other hand, clerks—or at least such as had no property of
                    their own apart from that derived from any ecclesiastical benefice—were exempted
                    from the duty of accepting the office of “curialis.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Papal Court.—</hi> At a later period, probably not earlier than
                    the 12 th century, the phrase <hi rend="italic">curia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Romana</hi> came to be synonymous with <hi rend="italic">corte Romana,</hi> and
                    was used tosignify the entire body of persons employed in attendance on the Pope
                    and in transacting the business of the Roman see. It seems indeed to have been
                    at that time occasionally used in a sense equivalent to the “Holy See,”
                    comprising, in the idea signified, the Pontiff himself.</p>
                <p>In process of time, however, a distinction seems to have established itself
                    between the “corte Romana” and the “curia Romana.” The former phrase is declared
                    by Lunadoro in his <hi rend="italic">Relazione della</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Corte</hi><hi rend="italic">di Roma,</hi> first published in 1641, to mean the
                    whole body of cardinals, bishops, and prelates of all ranks who hold office in
                    the Papal court and government; whereas at that period aħd for some time
                    previously the curia Romana had come to signify what we should call “the bar”
                    practising in the Papal courts of justice. But it is curious that the old wider
                    and less precise signification of the term is found surviving long afterwards in
                    the writings of Lutherans and Jansenists, who found its larger signification
                    convenient to them in attacking and satirizing the Roman Papal system. Thus in
                    modern writings the phrase “curia Romana” will be found very ordinarily to mean
                    different things, according to the sympathies and in some degree to the country
                    of the writer using it. In the mouth of a Lutheran, a Calvinist, a Jansenist, or
                    even perhaps of a Gallican, it will mean the whole ecclesiastical and
                    administrative system of Rome. In the mouth of the friends of the Papacy,
                    especially of the Italians, it will be found to signify the body of lawyers
                    practising in the Roman courts. The latter is of course, at all events in recent
                    times, the more correct use of the term; and it will probably be found that in
                    the mouth of a learned writer, even among Protestants, this will be the sense
                    attached to it. Thus Bingham, in a curious passage illustrating the change in
                    the signification of the word “curia,” where he is treating of the meaning of
                    the phrase “curiae tradi” as an ecclesiastical punishment <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Orig. Reel.,</hi> lib. 17, ch. 2, sec. 8), shows that the more accurate
                    significance of the word was an entirely legal one. The celebrated
                    controversialist Bergier, on the other hand, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theological Dictionary,</hi> defines “corte Romana” as “a phrase used in our
                    days by modern newfangled writers in contempt of the dogmatic constitutions and
                    pontifical briefs of the holy Roman apostolic see. If I remember rightly this
                    phrase was first used by Calvin and his followers.” Now all the writers thus
                    twitted by the French theologian would have used “curia” as synonymous with
                    “corte.” And modern anti-ecclesiastical Italian writers will be found using the
                    word similarly. But the proper present ecclesiastical sense of the term is most
                    accurately rendered in English by the “Roman bar ”—the body of those privileged
                    to practise in the different pontifical courts of justice.</p>
                <p>It will be seen, in short, that the use of the term has been shifting and
                    uncertain to a singular degree,—shifting both, as the meaning of other words
                    shifts, by lapse of time, and also not only according to the nationality but
                    according to the views and prejudices of the person using it.</p>
                <p>It may be added that the building now occupied by the Italian Chamber of
                    Deputies, was called the Curia Innocenziana, having been built by Innocent XII.
                    for the reuniting of the various “curiae” before existing in the city.</p>
                <p>For a detailed account of the officials who were at different times comprised in
                    the idea of the Curia, of the duties, orders, and hierarchical distinctions and
                    privileges of these, of the story of the pious confraternity into which they
                    formed themselves under the patronage of St Ivo the Briton, &amp;c., the curious
