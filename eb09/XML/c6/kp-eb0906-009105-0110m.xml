                <p>E. long. The state, which is of irregular shape, is bounded on the W., N., and E.
                    by the districts of South Malabar and Coimbatore, and for some distance on the
                    W. by the Indian Ocean; on the S. it is bounded by the state of Travancore.
                    Cochin contains a total area of 1361 square miles, and a population, according
                    to a census taken in 1875, of 598,353 souls, dwelling in 118,196 houses. The
                    state is divided into seven <hi rend="italic">táluks,</hi> or sub-districts,
                    viz. , Cochin, Cannanore, Mugundapuram, Trichur, Tallapalli, Chitur, and
                    Cranganore.</p>
                <p>Cochin consists for the most part of a maritime lowland hemmed in between the sea
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Gháts.</hi> It includes, however, the mountains which
                    thus wall it out from inner India, and the lower portion is copiously watered by
                    the torrents which pour down them. These torrents dwindle in the hot weather to
                    rivulets, but during the rains they swell into great cataracts, rising in one
                    instance at least 16 feet in twenty-four hours. On the lowlands, they unite as
                    elsewhere on the western coast into shallow lakes or “backwaters,” lying behind
                    the beach line and below its level. In the monsoon the Cochin backwaters are
                    broad navigable channels and lakes; in the hot weather they contract into
                    shallows in many places not 2 feet deep. The vegetation is luxuriant; rich crops
                    of rice are grown on the lowlands; the hills send down vast quantities of timber
                    by means of the torrents. The remains of once fine forests of teak are preserved
                    in the north-eastern corner of the state, and still form a considerable source
                    of wealth. Coffee has of late years received much attention and promises well.
                    The other products are the usual ones of an Indian state,—cotton, pepper, betel
                    nut, chillies, ginger, various spices, cardamoms, arrowroot, &amp;c. An
                    excellent account of Cochin will be found in Dr Day’s <hi rend="italic">Land of
                    the Permauls.</hi> The rájás of Cochin claim to hold the territory by descent
                    from Chermán Perumál, who governed the whole of the surrounding country,
                    including Travancore and Malabar, as viceroy of the Cfiolá kings, about the
                    beginning of the 9th century, and who afterwards established himself as an
                    independent rájá. In 1776 Cochin was subjugated by and became tributary to Hyder
                    Alí. In 1792 Tippu ceded the sovereignty to the British, who made over the
                    country to the hereditary rájá, subject to a tribute of Rs. 100,000. The state
                    is now in subsidiary alliance with the British Government, under a treaty dated
                    17 th October 1809. By this engagement, which was entered into on the
                    suppression of an insurrection on the part of the rájás of Cochin and Travancore
                    against the British power, the Cochin chief agreed to pay, in addition to the
                    tribute of Rs. 100,000, an annual sum, equal to the expense of maintaining a
                    battalion of native infantry, or Arcot Rs. 176,037, making an aggregate annual
                    payment of Rs. 276,037. In return for this payment, and certain engagements
                    entered into by the rájá, the East India Company undertook to defend the
                    integrity of the state territory against all enemies. Subsequently the annual
                    tribute to the British Government was reduced to Rs. 240,000, and again
                    afterwards to Rs. 200,000 (£20,000) at which it now stands. A British resident
                    represents the government of India in Cochin conjointly with Travancore. The
                    present rájá succeeded to the throne in March 1864.</p>
                <p>The total revenue of Cochin for the Malabar year 1049 (1873—74 A.D.), amounted to
                    £130,851, being the highest income recorded for any year; the principal
                    itemswere theland revenue, £61,764; customs, £11,035; and salt, £15,713. The
                    disbursements for the same year amounted to £111,858, leaving a surplus for the
                    year of £18,993. The state has now the sum of £200,000 invested in British
                    Government securities. A high school, with an average of 170 pupils, and 5
                    district schools are maintained by the state. Hospitals and dispensaries and a
                    post-office are also kept up, and a considerable sum, amounting to £13,669 in
                    1874, is annually spent in public works. The military force is a nominal one of
                    1 commissioned officer and 340 noncommissioned officers and men. The two trading
                    ports (exclusive of the British port of Cochin) are Malipuram and Narakel, at
                    which 31 vessels, a burden of 22,626 tons, arrived in 1873-74. The capabilities
                    of Narakel as a port of shelter during the S.W. monsoon have been satisfactorily
                    proved, and the mail-steamers of the British India Company touch there for four
                    or five months of the year, when the neighbouring English port of Cochin is
                    unapproachable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cochin,</hi> a town and port of British India, belonging to
                    the Malabar district of Madras, situated in 9° 58' <hi rend="italic">5"</hi> N.
                    lat. and 76° 13' <hi rend="italic">55"</hi> E. long. The town lies at the
                    northern extremity of a strip of land about twelve miles in length, but at few
                    places more than a mile in breadth, which is nearly insulated by inlets of the
                    sea and estuaries of streams flowing from the Western Gháts. These form the
                    Cochin backwater described in the article on the Cochin state. The town of
                    Cochin is about a mile in length by half a mile in breadth. Its first European
                    possessors were the Portuguese, from whom it was captured by the Dutch in 16 63.
                    Under the Dutch the town prospered, and about 1778 an English traveller
                    describes it as a place of great trade; “a harbour filled with ships, streets
                    crowded with merchants, and warehouses stored with goods from every part of Asia
                    and Europe, marked the industry, the commerce, and the wealth of the
                    inhabitants.” In 1796 Cochin was captured from the Dutch by the British, and in
                    1806 the fortifications and public buildings were blown up by order of the
                    authorities. The explosion destroyed much private property, and for a long time
                    seriously affected the prosperity of the town. Under Dutch rule Cochin was very
                    populous, containing Europeans, Moplás or Musalmáns, Hindus, Arabs, Persians,
                    and Christians of various sects, comprising natives, Armenians, Indo-Portuguese,
                    and those denominated Syrian Christians. The Jews have also a settlement here.
                    They are of two classes, the Fair or White J ews, of more recent arrival and
                    settlement in the country, and the Black Jews, who reside apart in a village
                    outside the town. According to the census of 1871, Cochin town contains 2731
                    houses and a population of 13,840 souls, classified as follows:—Hindus, 3883,
                    Muhammadans, 2174; Christians, 7783; and “Others,” 46. The town is constituted a
                    municipality, and in 1873-74 the municipal income (excluding balances) amounted
                    to £1573 10s., and the expenditure to £1560 10s. The entrance to the port of
                    Cochin is obstructed by a bar across the mouth of the river, and during the S.W.
                    monsoon, which lasts for four or five months, vessels can neither enter nor
                    depart from it in safety. Notwithstanding the difficulties of navigation,
                    however, the port has a considerable maritime trade. In 1873-74, 171 British
                    vessels of a burden of 108,579 tons, 27 foreign vessels of 7010 tons, and 1644
                    native craft of a total of 49,215 tons burden entered the port, and paid a total
                    of £1974 as port dues,—by far the greater part, £1520, being paid by the British
                    ships. The value of the exports in 1873-74 amounted to £755,796, and of the
                    imports to £547,252, paying a total customs duty of £5161. A lighthouse at the
                    south entrance of the harbour marks the entrance to the port, and is visible at
                    a distance of 15 miles.</p>
