                    belonging to very different families, there is in popular estimation some
                    connection between the two birds.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> It is owing to this interchange of their names that Yarrell
                    in his <hi rend="italic">British Birds</hi> refers Μ. Victor Hugo’s description

                    forming another parallel case.</p></note> The Coot breeds abundantly in many of
                    the larger inland waters of the northern parts of the Old World, in winter
                    commonly resorting, and often in great numbers, to the mouth of rivers or
                    shallow bays of the sea, where it becomes a general object of pursuit by gunners
                    whether for sport or gain. At other times of the year it is comparatively
                    unmolested, and being very prolific its abundance is easily understood. The nest
                    is a large mass of flags, reeds, or sedge, piled together among rushes in the
                    water or on the margin, and not unfrequently contains as many as ten eggs. The
                    young, when first hatched, are beautiful little creatures, clothed in jet-black
                    down, with their heads of a bright orange-scarlet, varied with purplish-blue.
                    This brilliant colouring is soon lost, and they begin to assume the almost
                    uniform sooty-black plumage which is worn for the rest of their life; but a
                    characteristic of the adult is a bare patch or callosity on the forehead, which
                    being nearly white gives rise to the epithet “bald” often prefixed to the bird’s
                    name. The Coot is about 18 inches in length, and will sometimes weigh over 2 lb.
                    Though its wings appear to be short in proportion to its size, and it seems to
                    rise with difficulty from the water, it is capable of long-sustained and rather
                    rapid flight, which is performed with the legs stretched out behind the stumpy
                    tail. It swims buoyantly, and looks a much larger bird in the water than it
                    really is. It dives with ease, and when wounded is said frequently to clutch the
                    weeds at the bottom with a grasp so firm as not even to be loosened by death. It
                    does not often come on dry land, but when there, marches leisurely and not
                    without a certain degree of grace. The feet of the Ccot are very <pb break="no"

                    membrane, which must be of considerable assistance in swimming as well as in
                    walking over the ooze—acting as they do like mud-boards.</p>
                <p>In England the sport of Coot-shooting is pursued to some extent on the broads and
                    back-waters of the eastern counties—in Southampton Water, Christchurch Bay, and
                    at Slapton Lay—and is often conducted battuefashion by a number of guns. But
                    even in these cases the numbers killed in a day seldom reach more than a few
                    hundreds, and come very short of those that fall in the officially-organized <hi
                    rend="italic">chasses</hi> of the lakes near the coast of Languedoc and
                    Provence, of which an excellent description is given by the Vicomte Louis de
                    Dax.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> “La Volée aux

                    food. To prepare the bird for the table, the feathers should be stripped, and
                    the down, which is very close, thick, and hard to pluck, be rubbed with powdered
                    resin; the body is then to be dipped in boiling water, which dissolving the
                    resin causes it to mix with the down, and then both can be removed together with
                    tolerable ease. After this the bird should be left to soak for the night in cold
                    spring-water, which will make it look as white and delicate as a chicken.
                    Without this process the skin after roasting is found to be very oily, with a
                    fishy flavour, and if the skin be taken off the flesh becomes dry and good for
                    nothing (Hawker’s <hi rend="italic">Instructions to Young Sportsmen;</hi> Hele’s

                <p>The Coot is found throughout the Palaearctic Region from Iceland to Japan, and in
                    most other parts of the world is represented by nearly allied species, having
                    almost the same habits. An African species <hi rend="italic">(F. cristata),</hi>
                    easily distinguished by a red caruncle on its forehead, is of rare appearance in
                    the south of Europe. The Australian and North American species <hi rend="italic"
                    >(F. australis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">F. americana)</hi> have very great
                    resemblance to our own bird; but in South America half-a-dozen or more
                    additional species are found which range to Patagonia, and vary much in size,
                    one <hi rend="italic">(F. gigantea)</hi> being of considerable magnitude. The
                    remains of a very large species <hi rend="italic">(F. newtoni)</hi> have been
                    discovered in Mauritius, where it must have been a contemporary of the Dodo, but
                    like that bird is now extinct. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
