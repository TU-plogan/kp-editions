                    (1641-1704), “the Dutch Vauban,” was of Swedish extraction, and was born at
                    Leeuwarden, in Friesland. He served in the campaign of 1667 against Turenne, and
                    later distinguished himself at the sieges, of Maestricht (1673) and Graave
                    (1674), aud at the battles of Senef (1674), Cassel (1677), and St Denis (1678).
                    The genius of Vauban had made a fine art of the attack and defence of fortified
                    places, and Coehorn, who had already invented the mortar, had imposed on himself
                    the task of meeting and beating that fine engineer on his own ground. But
                    William of Orange did not recognize the abilities of his young captain, and in
                    despair of success Coehorn had determined to transfer his services to France.
                    William, hearing of this, seized the person of the engineer, and by a mixture of
                    force and persuasion obliged him to renounce his design, and to accept a
                    colonelcy in the Dutch service, with the command of two of the Nassau-Friesland
                    battalions. The peace secured by the Treaty of Nimeguen (1678) gave Coehorn his
                    first great opportunity. He repaired and perfected the defences of many strong
                    places, and he rushed into polemics with a rival engineer, a certain Paen. His
                    criticism and rejoinder appeared at Leeuwarden in 1682 and 1683, and in 1685 he
                    gave to the world, in Dutch, his first great work, <hi rend="italic">The New
                    System of Fortification</hi> (Leeuwarden, folio), two French editions of which
                    appeared in 1706, while three others were issued from the Hague in 1711, 1714,
                    and 1741 respectively. From 1688 to 1691 Coehorn’s genius and activity answered
                    the innumerable demands that were made upon them. In 1692 Vaubau himself laid
                    siege to Namur, and Coehorn waited within the city. The town was reduced iu a
                    week; but the castle in its quintuple enceinte, manned by Coehorn and his own
                    regiment, seemed impregnable. The Dutch chief, however, was severely wounded,
                    and the castle capitulated, with the honours of war, eight days after the city.
                    The campaign of 1695 brought his revenge. He reduced the city, on which Vauban
                    in the meanwhile had expended all the resources of his art, and the castle fell
                    a month afterwards. The Peace of Ryswick (1697) sent Coehorn back to his task of
                    repairing and improving. He laid out the entrenchments round Zwoll and
                    Groningen, and built the fortifications round Nimeguen, Breda, Namur, and
                    Bergen-op-Zoom. In 1701, however, the war of the Spanish succession broke out,
                    and Coehorn went at once to the front. By the siege and capture in succession
                    of· Venloo, Stevensworth, Ruremond, and Liège, he rendered the allies masters in
                    a single campaign of the line of the Meuse from Holland to Huy. He followed up
                    these exploits by the investment and reduction of Bonn (1703), and passing
                    thence into Flanders, with Sparr, he forced the French lines in the Waes,
                    between the sea and the left bank of the Scheldt. Returning to the centre of
                    operations on the Meuse, he besieged and took Huy in the same year, under the
                    very eyes of Villeroi. Thence he went to the Hague to confer with Marlborough
                    concerning the next campaign, and was there cut off by apoplexy, March 17, 1704.
                    A monument to him was raised by his children at Wykel, and an historical eulogy
                    of him was published at Frankfort in 1771. For a description and critical
