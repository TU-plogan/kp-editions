                <p><label type="entry">CRAYON</label>, a coloured material for drawing, employed
                    generally in the form of pencils, but sometimes also as a powder, and consisting
                    of native earthy and stony friable substances, or of artificially prepared
                    mixtures of a base uf pipe or China clay with Prussian blue, orpiment vermilion,
                    umber, and other pigments. Calcined gypsum, talc, and compounds of magnesium,
                    bismuth, and lead are occasionally used as bases. The required shades of tints
                    are obtained by adding varying amounts of colouring matter to equal quantities
                    of the base. The ingredients of crayons or pastils are made into a paste with
                    gum, turpentine, or alcoholic solution of shellac, and pιdverized as finely as
                    possible in a mill, which subjects them repeatedly to the action of a revolving
                    cast-iron grinder. The paste is introduced into a copper cylinder, closed at one
                    end by a plate pierced with holes of the diameter of the. crayons to be made.
                    Through these it is forced by means of a piston, and the vermicular pieces
                    obtained are then cut into the required lengths, and dried in a furnace at a
                    gentle heat. Black crayons may be manufactured from a mixture of one part of
                    lamp-black with about two-thirds of its bulk of clay; red crayons from powdered
                    and elutriated haematite worked up into a paste with gum arabic and a little
                    soap. White crayons are commonly formed by sawing chalk of good quality into
                    convenient shapes. Mixtures of soap, wax, and lampblack are employed for
                    lithographic crayons or chalks. The late well-known zoological lithographer,
                    George Ford, employed chalks made after the following receipt :—</p>

                <p>The wax is gradually incorporated with the melted soap by heating, and as the
                    resultant mass begins to burn, the soda is added; afterwards the black is by
                    degrees stirred in. The melted tallow may be added at any stage in the

                <p>Crayons are valuable to the artist in enabling him to make groupings of colours
                    and to secure landscape and other effects with ease and rapidity. The outline as
                    well as the rest of the picture is drawn in crayon. The colours are softened off
                    and blended by the finger, with the assistance of a stump of leather or paper;
                    and shading is produced by cross-hatching and stippling. The paper employed is
                    of loose but not soft or spongy texture, and is of various tints, warm grey or
                    yellowish being generally preferred. For portraits pumice-paper and red or brown
                    crayons are considered most suitable. The colours are fixed by the process known
                    as transudation. The drawing is supported face downwards by its edges or
                    corners, and a solution of isinglass is applied to the back with a brush in
                    quantity sufficient to penetrate to the coloured surface of the paper, which may
                    then be turned upwards to dry. The fixing solution is prepared as
                    follows;—three-quarters of an ounce of isinglass is infused for a day in 2⅜
                    ounce of pure vinegar; a pint of hot water is added, and the solution of
                    isinρ∙bss is filtered and mixed with an equal volume of <pb break="no"

                    or pastils is supposed to have originated in Germany in the 17th century. By
                    Johann Alexander Thiele (1685-1752) it was carried to great perfection, and in
                    France it was early practised with much success. Amongst celebrated
                    crayon-painters may be mentioned Carriera Rosalba (1675-1757), W. Hoare
                    (1707-1792), F. Cotes (1726-1770), J. Russell (1744-1806), and the late Mr
