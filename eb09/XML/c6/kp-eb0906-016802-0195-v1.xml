                <p><label type="entry">COLUMBIA, <hi rend="smallcaps">District of</hi></label>, a
                    territory of the United States of America, originally erected under a law of
                    Congress of July 1790, for the establishment of a permanent seat of government.
                    This law authorized the acquisition by the United States of a territory not
                    exceeding ten miles square, at the confluence of the Potomac and its eastern
                    branch. A part of the territory thus designated was ceded to the United States
                    by Virginia, and included the city of Alexandria, and a part by Maryland
                    including the city of Georgetown. Outside of these cities the territory was
                    occupied by planters and farmers, as it had been from the latter part of the
                    17th century. By a law of Congress of July 1846, that portion of the district
                    which had been ceded to the United States by Virginia was ceded back to that
                    State. The present area of the district is 64 square miles. Under the law of
                    1790, three commissioners were appointed to receive the cession of the district,
                    and to. lay out the city of Washington and erect the public buildings for the
                    reception of the Federal Government. The cornerstone of the Capitol was laid by
                    Washington, September 18, 1793. On the first Monday of December 1800, the
                    removal of the Government from Philadelphia was effected.</p>
                <p>The surface of the district is diversified by hill and dale, is well wooded with
                    oak, maple, chestnut, hickory, and other trees, is productive when well
                    cultivated, and affords at several points extended and beautiful views of the
                    valley of the Potomac. The scenery of Rock Creek, an affluent of the Potomac, is
                    also celebrated for its romantic beauty. The climate is temperate and healthy.
                    In the autumn bilious fevers are sometimes prevalent on the low grounds. The
                    staple product before 1800 was tobacco, the culture of which has of late years
                    been abandoned for grain, Indian corn, hay, fruit, and vegetables, all of which
                    are produced in great abundance, and sold at remunerative prices in the markets
                    of Washington and Georgetown. The shad and herring fisheries of the Potomac
                    yield a large revenue.</p>

                <p>The native born population in 1870 was 115,446; the foreign-born, 16,254. The
                    number of dwellings was 23,308; persons to a dwelling, 5 <hi rend="superscript">
                        -</hi> 65; valuation of real and personal estate, $126,873,618; value of
                    farms, $3,800,000; of farm productions, $319,000. The number of manufacturing
                    establishments was 952; steam-engines, 51; water-wheels, 15; hands employed,
                    4685; capital, $5,021,925; products, $9,292,173,—consisti ng mainly of flour,
                    building materials, furniture, clothing, and iron. The debt of the district,
                    mainly incurred since 1872 in the construction of sewers and the paving of
                    streets in Washington and Georgetown, is about $25,000,000.</p>
                <p>The district is under the control of Congress, and its municipal affairs are
                    regulated by three commissioners appointed by the president and Senate, by
                    virtue of a law of 1874. The courts are constituted by Act of Congress, and the
                    judges appointed by the president and Senate. By the law of 1874, the
                    municipalities of Georgetown and Washington were abolished, and the elective
                    franchise throughout the district suppressed. It has no representative in
                    Congress.</p>
                <p>The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal connects Georgetown, the head of tide-water on the
                    Potomac, with Cumberland, the centre of the bituminous coal region of the State
                    of Maryland. It is 180 miles in length, and transports 1,000,000 tons of coal
                    per annum. The district is intersected by the Washington and Metropolitan
                    branches of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway, and by the Baltimore and Potomac
                    Railway, and is connected with the south by rail to Alexandria, the northern
                    terminus of the Virginia railway system. There are well-managed lines of
                    steamboats running to Norfolk, Baltimore, and New York, the last freighted
                    mainly with flour from the district mills. The coal tonnage of the Potomac
                    exceeds 600,000 tons annually from the port of Georgetown, which is the port of
                    entry for the district of Columbia.</p>
                <p>Since 1793 the United States Government has expended $60,000,000 in the erection
                    of public buildings and improvement of public grounds in the district. For each
                    of the years 1873, 1874, and 1875, Congress appropriated over $2,000,000 as its
                    share of the expenses of the district government. The free schools of the
                    district are maintained at an annual cost of $400,000. The Columbian university,
                    established by the Baptists in 1821, is a well-endowed and flourishing
                    institution. The Howard university, established for the education of the
                    freedmen, is also well patronized. There are 120 church edifices in the
                    district, of which the Baptists have 25, the Methodists 42, the Roman Catholics
                    14, the Episcopalians 20, the Presbyterians 14, and the Lutherans 8. The United
