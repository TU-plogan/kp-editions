                        Camille</hi></label> (1796-1875), French landscape painter, was born at
                    Paris in July 1796. He received an ordinary school education at Rouen, and was
                    then apprenticed to a Faris draper. From childhood it was evident that he was a
                    born artist; but prudential motives induced his father sternly to repress the
                    strivings and utterances of his genius. He continued therefore to drudge at the
                    draper’s counter till his twenty-sixth year. He then finally escaped from the
                    grip of trade, and his genius had its own way in the world. He entered the <hi
                        rend="italic">atelier</hi> of Michallon; and on the death of his master the
                    same year (1822) he passed to that of Victor Berlin. But he did not get on
                    happily with, or learn much from either of these teachers. At length he made his
                    escape from the town and the school with their oppressive conventionalities, and
                    took refuge with nature in the fields of Italy. Here he studied, dreamed, and
                    painted for several years. In 1827 he began to exhibit at the Salon, his first
                    works being Vue prise à Narni and La Campagne de Rome. The public passed them by
                    without much notice, but artists saw in them decisive proof that a new
                    poet-painter was among them. From this time he -worked on vigorously for nearly
                    fifty years, seldom failing to make his appearance at the Salon. Public
                    recognition and “golden joys” were very slow to come; nor was it till he vzas
                    nearly seventy that he became a wealthy man. He had obtained a medal of the
                    second class in 1833, and medals of the first class in 1848 and 1855. He
                    received the cross of the Legion of Honour in 1846, and was promoted officer in
                    1867. Corot was one of the most original of painters. He was almost exclusively
                    a landscape painter; for although in a very few cases his pictures bear
                    historical titles, landscape is even in these the predominant element. And with
                    him it was always the poetry of landscape, never the topography. He stood in
                    nature’s presence, reverent, loving, enthusiastic, watching for the most
                    delicate effects and changes of light, especially at early dawn and at dewy eve
                    and in still moonlight, on βloud and sky, on tree and stream,—seeing thus what

                    reproduce in his works his own impression of magical dreamy beauty. His works,
                    like those of Millet, are mostly touched with sadness; but while Millet is stern
                    and almost savage, Corot is always tender and delicate. In his chosen field he
                    stands almost alone and unrivalled. Among his works are—Vue d’Italie (1834);
                    Souvenir des environs de Florence (1839); La Danse des Nymphes; Soleil couchant
                    dans le Tyrol (1850); Effet de Matin; Dante et Virgile; Macbeth; Agar au Désert;
                    Soleil levant; Souvenir d’Italie; Le Repos; La Solitude (18G6); Un Matin à Ville
                    d’Avray (18G8); Une Danse Antique; and Le Bûcheron. The two last mentioned were
                    exhibited, after his death, at the Salon of 1875. In the social circle Corot was
                    one of the frankest and most genial of men. His favourite relaxation after a
                    long day’s work was the theatre, where to the last he is said to have followed
                    the performance with the fresh delight of a child. Naturally of a generous
                    disposition, he gave away with a large hand the wealth which flowed in on him in
                    his later years; and many a touching tale is told of distress relieved and sad
                    hearts comforted by his ministrations. The affectionate regard generally felt
                    towards him is shown in the designation “le Pere Corot” by which he was commonly
                    known. In 1871 he lost a beloved sister; and after this sharp blow he never
                    recovered his former gaiety of heart. One of his last acts was the gift of a
                    pension to the widow of his brother artist Millet, who had died not long before.
                    In December 1874 a gold medal designed for the occasion was presented to him by
                    many French artists in token of honour and esteem. Corot died at Paris, after a
                    long period of failing health, February 22, 1875.</p>
