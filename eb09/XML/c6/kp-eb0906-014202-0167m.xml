                    persons associated together by the possession of common functions,—a body of
                    colleagues. Its later meaning applied to any union of persons, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Collegium</hi> was the equivalent of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ixaipda.</hi> In many respects, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the distinction
                    between the responsibilities and rights of the society and those of individual
                    members thereof, the collegium was what we should now call a corporation (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Corporation).</hi> Collegia might exist for purposes of
                    trade like our guilds, or for religious purposes <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi>
                    the college of augurs, of pontifices,.&amp;c.), or ſor political purposes, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> tribunorum plebis collegia. By the Roman law a
                    collegium must have at least three members. The name is now usually applied to
                    educational corporations, the most important of which are the colleges of Oxford
                    and Cambridge. In the numerous statutes relating to colleges the colleges of
                    Winchester and Eton are usually associated with those of .Oxford and
                    Cambridge.</p>
                <p>These colleges are in the eye of the law eleemosynary corporations. In some of
                    the earlier statutes of Queen Elizabeth they are spoken of as having an
                    ecclesiastical character, but the doctrine of the common law since the
                    Reformation has been that they are purely lay corporations, notwithstanding that
                    most or all of their members may be persons in priest’s orders. This is said to
                    have been settled by Patrick’s case (see Raymond’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reports').</hi></p>
                <p>Colleges appear to have grown out of the voluntary association of students and
                    teachers at the university. According to some accounts these must at one time
                    have been numerous and flourishing beyond anything we are now acquainted with.
                    We are told, for example, of 300 halls or societies at Oxford, and 30,000
                    students. Into the truth of .these statements, or into the causes which led to
                    the reduction in the number of scholars, we need not now enter. In early times
                    there seems to have been a strong desire to confine the scholars to certain
                    licensed houses, beyond the influence of the townspeople. Men of wealth and
                    culture, and notably the political bishops and chancellors of England, obtained
                    charters from the Crown for the incorporation of societies of scholars, and
                    these in time became exclusively the places of abode for students attending the
                    university. At the same time the corporations thus founded were not necessarily
                    attached to the locality of the university. The early statutes of Merton
                    College, for example, allow the residence of the college to be shifted as
                    occasion required; and the foundations of Wolsey at Oxford and Ipswich seem to
                    have been the same in intention. In later times the university and the colleges
                    became coextensive; every member of the university had to attach himself to some
                    college or hall, and every person admitted to a college or hall was obliged to
                    matriculate himself in the university.</p>
                <p>In Ayliffe’s <hi rend="italic">Ancient and Present State of the University of
                    Oxford</hi> it is stated that a college must be “made up of three persons (at
                    least) joined in community. And the reason of this almost seems to speak its own
                    necessity, without the help of any express law to countenance it: because among
                    two persons only there cannot be, in fact, a major part; and then if any
                    disagreement should happen to arise between them it cannot be, in fact, brought
                    to a conclusion by such a number alone in case both the parties should firmly
                    adhere to their dissenting opinions; and thus it is declared by the civil law.
                    But by the canon law it is known to be otherwise; for by that law two persons in
                    number may make and constitute a college, forasmuch as according to this law two
                    persons make and constitute an assembly or congregation. The common law of
                    England, or rather the constant usage of our princes in erecting aggregate
                    bodies, which has established this rule among us as a law, has been herein
                    agreeable to the method and doctrine of the civil law, for that in all their
                    grants and charters of incorporation of colleges they have not framed any
                    aggregate body consisting of less than three iu number.” Another principle,
                    apparently derived from the civil law, is that a man cannot be a fellow in two
                    colleges at the same time. The law of England steadily resisted any attempt to
                    introduce the principle of inequality into colleges. An Act of Henry VIII. (33,
                    c. 27), reciting that divers founders of colleges have given in their statutes a
                    power of veto to individual members, enacts that every <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n168/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0168-0143"/> statute made by any such founder, whereby the
                    grant or election of the governor or ruler with the assent of the most part of
                    such corporation should be in any wise hindered by any one or more being the
                    lesser number (contrary to the common law), shall be void.</p>
                <p>The corporation consists of a head or master, fellows, and scholars. Students,
                    not being on the foundation, residing in the college, are not considered to be
                    members of the corporation. The governing body in all cases is the head and
                    fellows.</p>
                <p>It is considered essential to corporations of an ecclesiastical or educational
                    character that they should have a visitor whose duty it is to see that the
                    statutes of the founder are obeyed. The duties of this officer have been
                    ascertained by the courts of Jaw in a great variety of decided cases. Subject to
                    such restrictions as may be imposed on him by the statutes of the college, his
                    duties are generally to interpret the statutes of the college in disputed cases,
                    and to enforce them where they have been violated. For this purpose he is
                    empowered to “visit” the society—usually at certain stated intervals. In
                    questions within his jurisdiction his judgment is conclusive, but his
                    jurisdiction does not extend to any cases under the common laws of the country,
                    or to trusts attached to the college. Generally the visitorship resides in the
                    founder and his heirs unless he has otherwise appointed, and in default of him
                    in the Crown.</p>
                <p>The fellowships, scholarships, &lt;fcc., of colleges were until a comparatively
                    recent date subject to various restrictions. Birth in a particular county,
                    education at a particular school, relationship to the founder, and holy orders,
                    are amongst the most usual of the conditions giving a preferential or conclusive
                    claim to the emoluments. Most of these restrictions have been or are being swept
                    away. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Universities.</hi></p>
                <p>The colleges of the English universities are large landowners. A royal commission
                    in 187-t reported the external income of the colleges of Oxford to be £307,369,
                    17s. <hi rend="italic">2d.,</hi> and of Cambridge £264,256, l7s. 10^d. These
                    sums are mainly derived from landed property, and are exclusive of the revenues
                    of the universities. By several Acts of Parliament colleges are allowed to sell
                    their real property with the consent of the copyhold commissioners, who take
                    care that the purchase-money is laid out in other real property. In college and
                    other corporation property a system of letting land under beneficial leases— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> at less than the full yearly rent, and recoverable
                    every seven years on payment of a fine—has long prevailed, and is believed to be
                    responsible for the alleged inferior condition of land belonging to
                    corporations. The system is now being superseded by leases at rack-rent.</p>
                <p>At Oxford, in addition to the colleges, there are four or five halls, which
                    differ from colleges mainly in not being corporate bodies. Their property is
                    held in trust for them by the university.</p>
                <p>In England the colleges have through their tutors and lecturers supplied nearly
                    all the teaching of the universities—the lectures of the professors being either
                    supernumerary or merely ornamental. Of late years colleges have combined their
                    forces for the purpose of establishing common systems of lectures, and there has
                    been a strong desire to reconstitute the teaching power of the universities.
                    Commissions are now being proposed for Oxford and Cambridge, which will have to
                    settle these and other problems of the higher education.</p>
                <p>Most of the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge are old foundations—only a few
                    dating from times posterior to the Reformation. Among recent foundations are
                    Downing College at Cambridge, Keble College at Oxford (which is governed by a
                    board or council of trustees), and the restoration of Magdalen Hall at Oxford,
                    now endowed and incorporated under the name of Hertford College.</p>
                <p>Among educational corporations under the same title elsewhere, Phillimore <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ecclesiastical Law)</hi> mentions King’s College and University
                    College, London, Sion College, St Bees, St David’s, Lampeter, &amp;c. The
                    distinction between college and university is found also at St Andrews, and in
                    the more recently founded university of Durham and the Queen’s University in
                    Ireland.</p>
