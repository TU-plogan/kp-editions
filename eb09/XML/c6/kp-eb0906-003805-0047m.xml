                    such associations seem, as Addison has said, “to be a natural and necessary
                    offshoot of men’s gregarious and social nature.” In the infancy of national
                    existences, they are almost essential for purposes of mutual support and
                    protection, and to supply the shortcomings of a weak Government. But over and
                    above those fellowships which spring from the inalienable right of
                    selfpreservation, and which are founded either in the ties of kindred or
                    community of material interests, there are commonly found, even in matured and
                    well-organized states, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0048-0039"/> a number of secondary or accidental societies,
                    established for the promotion of some common object; and a wise and strong
                    Government usually protects and encourages them as a most important condition of
                    human progress. They may be roughly divided into four different classes,
                    according to their several objects; they may be either religious, political,
                    commercial, or merely social; and an attempt has been sometimes made to assign
                    these to different periods of national development. Such a distinction, however,
                    cannot be successfully maintained, since the various elements were often most
                    closely united in the same clubs, almost (or quite) from their very foundation.
                    Thus, the corporations in Rome whose foundation was attributed to Numa would
                    seem at first sight to have been merely for convenience of trade. But we are
                    told that they had also a social or political purpose, viz., to break down the
                    barriers which separated Romans from Sabines in the infant state. Moreover,
                    Plutarch introduces a religious element into them also, saying that Numa “fixed
                    certain times of meeting for these companies, and certain honours to the gods,
                    assigning to each what was suitable for them.” So again in Greece we have the
                    testimony of Aristotle that members of the same tribe or borough used to club
                    together, men following the same occupations, as soldiers or sailors, and others
                    again for mere social amusement; yet he immediately adds—“these meet together
                    for the sake of one another’s company, and to offer sacrifices; when they meet
                    they both pay certain honours to the gods, and at the same time take pleasurable
                    relaxation among themselves.” It is clear, then, that whatever may have been the
                    precise object with which each private club or association was originally formed
                    in pagan times, these distinctive marks were very soon blurred, and finally, in
                    the lapse of time, altogether obliterated.</p>
                <p>We need not say anything of the religious sodalities which were appointed in a
                    regular way both in Greece and Rome for the worship of the gods recognized by
                    the state. It is the history of secret confraternities for the exercise of
                    foreign religious rites unknown to the state and strictly forbidden that is more
                    curious and attractive. In Athens the penalty of death stood enacted in the
                    statute book against those who should introduce the worship of strange gods; but
                    it is only on very rare and scandalous occasions that we hear of this statute in
                    real life. There was a great invasion of foreign gods into Attica after the
                    Persian war, and they were not so easily driven out as were the hosts of Xerxes
                    who had imported them. Moreover, independently of foreign armies, the mere
                    commercial activity of Athens herself did much to promote the same evil. Her
                    sailors and soldiers, colonists and merchants, had explored the coasts of the
                    AegeanSea, and had brought home from Thrace, from Phrygia, from Cyprus, and
                    elsewhere, a whole host of deities, not more false indeed, but certainly more
                    dangerous, than those whom they had been wont to worship at home. These gods and
                    goddesses soon found little knots of devotees, who were led to form a kind of
                    confraternity among themselves, for the support of the forbidden worship.
                    Fragments both of tragic and comic poets have preserved to us some notice of the
                    kind of worship that was offered, and it was obviously in every way less
                    respectable than the worship sanctioned by the state. In the state temples the
                    priests and other officers were obliged to be freemen, citizens, and the sons of
                    citizens; any taint of servile or foreign blood was a fatal disqualification.
                    But here slaves, foreigners, and women were admitted indiscriminately. Indeed,
                    if we may judge from monuments that have recently come to light, these secret
                    confraternities found their principal support among these classes. At Rhodes
                    there was one consisting exclusively of the lowest class of slaves,—the public
                    slaves of the town; at Salamis, one exclusively of women; iû that of Cnidus
                    eleven members out of twelve were foreigners. All these monuments come from
                    islands; and of course it was there, and in the seaport towns of the peninsula,
                    that such illicit corporations were likely to be first introduced and to take
                    deepest root. By-and-by it became necessary even to give an official recognition
                    to some of them, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the Piraeus, for the
                    convenience of foreigners who were either detained there for a considerable time
                    by business, or perhaps had even taken up their permanent abode there.
                    Excavations made within the last twenty years in the Piraeus, and still more
                    recently in the neighbourhood of the silver mines of Laurium, enable us to
                    assist at the birth and early growth of some of these illicit clubs, but there
                    is nothing in the history specially inviting. In Rome the general policy of the
                    state towards foreign religions was more tolerant than in Greece. Nevertheless
                    here also the practice of certain religions was forbidden, and the prohibition
                    naturally produced certain secret societies amongst those who were attached to
                    them. The law indeed forbade the worship of any deity that had not been approved
                    by the senate, but then the senate was by no means illiberal in granting its
                    diploma of approbation, and as often as a*new deity was introduced, or even a
                    new temple built to an old deity, a new sodality seems to have sprung up, or to
                    have been officially appointed, to look after its interests. It is disputed
                    whether the prohibition of the worship of unknown, unrecognized gods, applied
                    only to acts of public worship, or extended even to the innermost secrecy of
                    private life. Cicero may be quoted in defence of the latter view, Livy of the
                    former. Probably the letter of the law favoured the stricter side and spoke
                    universally, but traditional practice ruled differently. Certainly the Romans
                    had a scruple about interfering with anything which even pretended to lay claim
                    to a religious character. Even when they repressed with such severity the secret
                    meetings of the Bacchanalians, this was done not so much in the interest of the
                    other gods, as of public order and morality and the security of the state. They
                    even continued to tolerate such foul associations as these, only they imposed
                    the condition that not more than five worshippers should meet together at once;
                    and under cover of this permission the number of <hi rend="italic">thiasi</hi>
                    was much multiplied in the city, and these exercised a powerful attraction over
                    women by the promise which they made of effecting a real purification of the
                    soul. At a later period, when Augustus destroyed all the temples of Serapis
                    which had been erected in Rome during his absence, he was careful to assign a
                    political motive for this unusual interference with religious liberty.</p>
                <p>If we turn from these religious associations to consider the craft-gilds in
                    ancient Rome, the first thing that strikes us is their extraordinary number. In
                    the days of Numa we are told that there were only eight; but as time went on
                    they so multiplied that in the imperial period we count more than fourscore of
                    them, including almost every profession and handicraft one can think of, from
                    bankers and doctors down to donkey-drivers and muleteers. Nor does the mere
                    enumeration of the different trades and professions give us at all an adequate
                    idea of their number; for when a club became very large, it was first subdivided
                    into centuries, and then these again broke off into separate clubs. Again, there
                    was one club or company of the watermen who plied their trade on the Saone, and
                    another of the watermen on the Rhone, though both these companies had their
                    headquarters at Lyons. The other navigable rivers, too, each had its own
                    company. Thus, the most ancient notice we have of Paris is derived from a
                    monument which has come down tous of the watermen on the Seine. We find mention,
                    also, of more craftgilds than one even in a single street of Rome; nay, further
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n49/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0049-0040"/> still, within the limits of a single house, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> of the imperial palace, and probably of other princely
                    establishments, which counted their hundreds or thousands of dependants. Each
                    class of slaves engaged in different domestic occupations had their own clubs.
                    Thus the <hi rend="italic">chef de cuisine (magister coquorum)</hi> of Augustus
                    bequeathed a sum of money to the collegium, or club, of cooks, in his imperial
                    majesty’s household, and there is evidence that there were five or six other
                    clubs in the palace at the same time. We do not know how large each club may
                    have been; an old inscription tells us of forty seats reserved for a particular
                    club in the amphitheatre at Nîmes, but these belonged probably to the officers
                    of the club, not to the ordinary members indiscriminately. Sometimes the number
                    of members was limited, either by the original constitution of the body, or by
                    conditions subsequently imposed by benefactors who did not wish their donations
                    to be frittered away and rendered useless by too minute subdivisions. As to the
                    internal organization of the clubs, the general laws and principles which
                    governed their constitution, both in Athens and in Rome, they were moulded, as
                    was only natural, very much after the pattern of the civil institutions of the
                    country. They were republican therefore in spirit, the administration of affairs
                    being wholly in the hands of the members themselves, all of whom had equal
                    rights; their watchful control was incessant, and their authority absolute;
                    their officers were elected by universal suffrage, sometimes by acclamation;
                    they were called by the same names as were borne by the magistrates of the
                    state, αpχorτeς, <hi rend="italic">quaestores,</hi><hi rend="italic">magistri
                    quinquennales, curatores,</hi> &amp;c.; they were elected annually, and on
                    entering into office they took-an oath that they would observe the constitution
                    and laws of the corporation; and on retiring from office they gave an account of
                    their stewardship to the assembled members, who exercised a right of judgment
                    over them. This judgment seems to have been almost uniformly favourable; <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> commendatory decree was voted almost as much a matter of
                    course as a vote of thanks to the chairman of our own public meetings. In Greece
                    this vote was accompanied by the offering of a crown of leaves, of olive, ivy,
                    or poplar, according to the supposed choice of the god or goddess to whom the
                    club was dedicated. In the East, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Bithynia, we find
                    crowns of ribands and flowers; in Rhodes, Delos, and the adjacent islands, it
                    was not uncommonly of gold,—of very little intrinsic worth, however, and
                    provided by special contributions at each monthly meeting. But the most valued
                    part of the reward to these retiring officers (in Greece) seems to have been the
                    proclamation of the honour obtained, which proclamation took place either after
                    the ceremonies of the chief annual festival, or sometimes on every occasion of
                    meeting. It was also engraved on a column which was set up in seme conspicuous
                    spot in or near their place of meeting. When any special services seemed to call
                    for special recognition, the title of benefactor or benefactress was awarded,
                    and this, too, was of course added to the inscription. A still higher and rarer
                    honour was to offer the retiring officer a statue or portrait of himself, either
                    full length or half figure only or sometimes both together, and even more than
                    one of each But only once among Greek inscriptions belonging to these clubs do
                    we find any mention of a salary awarded to the secretary, in consideration of
                    the zeal and justice with which he had attended to the general interests of the
                    community, the exactness with which he had rendered his own reports and
                    accounts, as well as audited those of others who from time to time had been
                    specially deputed to do anything for the club, and his constant devotion to the
                    interests of all the members both collectively and individually Even in this
                    instance, however, the zealous and disinterested secretary or treasurer declined
                    the proffered salary, whereupon the club voted him a golden crown, which again
                    he gave up for the decoration of the temple in which they met. And this, indeed,
                    was the usual fate of these complimentary offerings. The officers fulfilled the
                    duties of their post gratuitously, and often at great expense to themselves,
                    just as the civil magistrates were obliged to do; and it seems to have been
                    pretty generally understood, that any extraordinary compliments, such as the
                    offer of a statue or portrait, should, if accepted, be carried out at the
                    expense, not of the donor, but of the receiver. In Rome, also, whenever an
                    inscription states that the members of a <hi rend="italic">collegium</hi> decree
                    that a statue shall be erected in honour of some patron or benefactor, it is
                    generally added that he undertook to pay for the statue himself <hi
                    rend="italic">(honore contentus, impensam remisit).</hi> Besides the acting
                    officials of these clubs, there were also certain honorary patrons, whose
                    connection with them was probably much the same as that of most patrons of
                    benevolent societies in our own day. It was a compliment to invite them to
                    become patrons, and they were expected to contribute to the funds in return.</p>
                <p>It only remains that we should say a few words about the merely social clubs of
                    pagan times,—those clubs which had no other bond of union, either commercial,
                    political, or religious, but which aimed only at the amusement or private
                    advantage of their members. There was nothing in the functions of these clubs to
                    obtain for them a place in the page of history. The evidence, therefore, of
                    their existence and constitution is but scanty. Monumental inscriptions,
                    however, tell us of clubs of Roman citizens in some of the cities of Spain, of a
                    club of strangers from Asia resident in Malaga, of Phoenician residents at
                    Pozzuoli, and of other strangers elsewhere. These all were probably devised as
                    remedies against that sense of <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi> and isolation which
                    is apt to come over a number of foreigners residing at a distance from their
                    native country. Something of the same kind of feeling may have led to the
                    toleration of a club consisting of old soldiers who had been in the armies of
                    Augustus; these were allowed to meet and fight their battles over again, spite
                    of the legal prohibition of military clubs. Another military club of a different
                    kind existed among the officers of a regiment engaged in foreign service in
                    Africa. Its existence can have been no secret, for its rules were engraved on
                    pillars which were set up near the headquarters of the general, where they have
                    lately been found in the ruins of the camp. The contribution of each member on
                    admission scarcely fell short of £25, and two-thirds of this sum were to be paid
                    to his heir or representative on the occasion of his death, or he might himself
                    recover this proportion of his original subscription on retirement from military
                    service. The peculiarity, however, of this aristocratic <hi rend="italic"
                    >collegium</hi> was this, that it provided that a portion of the funds might
                    also be spent for other useful purposes, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> for
                    foreign travelling. It is to be presumed that a member who had availed himself
                    of this privilege thereby forfeited all claim to be buried at the expense .of
                    his club.</p>
                <p>Clubs were by no means the exclusive privilege of the male sex in ancient days.
                    Women also were united in similar associations. Their religious sodalities,
                    indeed, were not generally edifying; but they combined together also for social
                    and political purposes. The most remarkable of these was the great assembly of
                    matrons, called at one time, in a mock-heroic way, “the minor senate.” This
                    ladies’ club received its title from imperial authority, which also legislated
                    as to the needful qualifications of its members, the times of its meeting, and
                    the subjects of its debates. These concerned the gravest questions of etiquette,
                    such as what dress ladies should wear according to their social rank; who was to
                    take precedence one of another on public occasions of state, in processions, or
                    other <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n50/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0050-0041"/> ceremonies; who might ride in a carriage drawn by
                    horses; who must be content to sit behind mules; whose sedan-chair might have
                    fittings of ivory, whose of silver, &amp;c. Not all ladies could attain to a
                    seat in this little senate, which dealt with such delicate questions of
                    etiquette; but we find them forming other clubs of their own which occasionally
                    meddled with questions of municipal, if not of general, interest. They
                    deliberated on the rewards to be given to this or that magistrate, and voted
                    funds for monuments aud statues in honour of those who had earned their
                    approbation. The names of women are not unfrequently set down as patronesses of
                    certain craft-gilds, of which they can hardly have been ordinary members; and in
                    one instance at least in Africa, and in another in Majorca, inscriptions
                    distinctly mention that certain ladies had filled all the official posts in a
                    <hi rend="italic">collegium.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> s. N.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Modern Clubs.—</hi> The word <hi rend="italic">club,</hi>
                    denoting the promotion of intercommunity and good fellowship, is not very old,
                    and only became common in the time of the <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Spectator;</hi> it claims a descent, however, from the
                    Anglo-Saxon, being derived from <hi rend="italic">cleofan,</hi> to divide,
                    because the expenses are divided into shares. Thomas Occleve <hi rend="italic"
                    >(temp.</hi> Henry IV.) mentions a club designated <hi rend="italic">La Court de
                    Bone Compaignie</hi> of which he was a member. Aubrey (1659) speaks thus of the
                    word: “We now use the word <hi rend="italic">clul&gt;be</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >for</hi> a sodality in a taverne.” He also mentions the ballot box, that
                    potential instrument too often used in modern days for the indulgence of secret
                    spleen: “Here we had (very formally) a <hi rend="italic">ballotting box,</hi>
                    and ballotted how things should be carried.” Dr Johnson, according to Boswell,
                    defines a club to be an “assembly of good fellows meeting under certain
                    conditions.” And to the same authority may be traced the words “clubable” and
                    “unclubable.”</p>
                <p>The numerous London clubs which sprang into existence in the last and previous
                    century had their place and origin almost entirely in the coffee-houses and
                    taverns then so much in vogue. Of these the earliest known was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bread Street</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Friday Street Club</hi>
                    originated by Sir Walter Raleigh, and meeting at the Mermaid Tavern.
                    Shakespeare, Beaumont, Fletcher, Selden, Donne, and others were members of this
                    club. Other clubs were subsequently formed, such as that meeting at the Devil
                    Tavern near Temple Bar, of which Ben Jonson was supposed to be the founder; and
                    later on (in 1764) we find the <hi rend="italic">Literary Club</hi> was
                    established chiefly at the instance of Sir Joshua Reynolds, which soon acquired
                    a renown no more than proportionate to its merits—a renown maintained and
                    brought down to the present day.</p>
                <p>Addison, in the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> has a paper on the clubs of his
                    day (No. 9, vol. i. 1710). Of the description of club there sketched many exist
                    at the present time, having no object but that of good fellowship and dining. In
                    this category may be included the <hi rend="italic">Royal Society Club,</hi> the
                    history of which has been written by the late Admiral Wm. Henry Smyth, F.R.S.,
                    in the privately printed <hi rend="italic">Sketch of the Rise and Progress of
                    the Royal Society Club,</hi> published in 1860.</p>
                <p>Of the more notable of the clubs of the past and the early part of the present
                    century but few resembled the club of the Victorian era. Of those which survive
                    may be mentioned <hi rend="italic">White's,</hi> originally established in 1698.
                    This club was formerly of a high Tory character, and though no longer political
                    is still somewhat conservative and undoubtedly aristocratic. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brooks's</hi> club, similar to <hi rend="italic">White's</hi> in the character
                    of its members, and nearly coeval in date, has continued to maintain a political
                    aspect, and is considered to be identified with Whig principles. <hi
                    rend="italic">Boodle's,</hi> of later date, has always been deemed the resort of
                    country gentlemen, and especially of masters of fox-hounds. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arthur's,</hi> in βome respects an offshoot of <hi rend="italic">White's,
                    w¶us</hi> established fully a century ago, and continues to this day a club of
                    gentlemen associated for no special purpose, but united cnly by congeniality of
                    tastes and ideas</p>
                <p>The number of regularly established clubs in London is upwards of fifty, divided
                    into political, literary and scientific, university, naval and military, and
                    general clubs. Of the political clubs the principal are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carlton,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Conservative,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Junior Carlton,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">St Stephen's,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Reform,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Devonshire</hi> (a kind of
                    junior <hi rend="italic">Reform</hi> club), the conditions of admission into
                    which are of a political nature. Of the literary and scientific, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Athenceum</hi> was “instituted for the association of individuals
                    known for their scientific or literary attainments, artists of eminence in any
                    class of the fine arts, and noblemen and gentlemen distinguished as liberal
                    patrons of science, literature, or the arts,” and has long enjoyed a high
                    reputation, rendering admissicn to its ranks both tedious as regards the length
                    of time a candidate has to wait before being put up for ballot, and difficult
                    when he is subjected to that crucial test. Of university clubs the <hi
                    rend="italic">United University</hi> is the oldest, the others being the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oxford and Cambridge,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">New
                    University,</hi> and others, the qualification for membership of which would be
                    that of connection with the chief universities. The naval and military clubs
                    include the <hi rend="italic">United Service,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jιιnior</hi><hi rend="italic">United Service,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Army
                    and Navy,</hi> with numerous others intended for military and naval officers,
                    and in some instances for officers of militia. The general clubs include the <hi
                    rend="italic">Traveller^,</hi> to be deemed eligible for which a candidate must
                    have “travelled out of the British Islands to a distance of at least 500 miles
                    from London in a direct line” (not a very onerous condition in the present day,
                    but one of some weight in 1815 when the club was founded), and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oriental</hi> and <hi rend="italic">East India United Service</hi>
                    clubs, intended more especially for members of Her Majesty’s Indian services
                    both civil and military. Besides these there are numerous clubs of a special
                    character, such as the <hi rend="italic">Windham,</hi> whose object is stated to
                    be “to secure a convenient and agreeable place of meeting for a society of
                    gentlemen all connected with each other by a common bond of literary or persona)
                    acquaintance;” the <hi rend="italic">National</hi> club, consisting of “members
                    who hold the doctrines and principles of the Reformed faith, as revealed in Holy
                    Scripture, asserted at the Reformation, and generally embodied in the articles
                    of the Church of England;” or the <hi rend="italic">Garrick,</hi> which was
                    instituted in 1831 for “the general patronage of the drama, forbringing together
                    the supporters of the drama, and for the formation of a theatrical library with
                    works on costume.”</p>
                <p>This list might be extended, but the general aims of the modern style of club are
                    sufficiently indicated in this reference to the salient features of the clubs
                    named.</p>
                <p>The architectural elevations of the London club-houses are such as have lent
                    dignity and character to the parts of London in which they are situated. Pall
                    Mall notably is thus now a street of palaces. Nor should the contents of these
                    handsome and convenient mansions pass unnoticed. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Athenaeum</hi> has probably the choicest library of its kind, consisting mainly
                    of books of reference, and including 45,000 volumes. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Garrick</hi> club has an exceedingly valuable collection of oil and
                    water-colour paintings, chiefly, as might be expected, relating to dramatic
                    episodes. The <hi rend="italic">United Service,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reform,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Oriental,</hi> and some other clubs have an
                    assemblage of portraits of members who have won fame, or of paintings of
                    celebrated battles and public events. The furniture and arrangements of the
                    different apartments correspond to the exteriors, every convenience and luxury
                    being placed at the disposal of the members.</p>
                <p>The mode of election of members varies. In some clubs the committee alone have
                    the power of choosing new members. In others the election is by ballot of the
                    whole <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n51/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0051-0042"/> club, one black ball in ten ordinarily excluding.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> whilst the principle of election by
                    ballot of the whole club obtains, the duty is also cast upon the committee of
                    annually selecting nine members who are to be “of distinguished eminence in
                    science, literature, or the arts, or for public services,” and the rule makes
                    stringent provision for the conduct of these elections. On the committee of the
                    same club is likewise conferred power to elect without ballot princes of the
                    blood royal, Cabinet ministers, bishops, speaker of the House of Commons,
                    judges, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The general concerns of clubs are managed by committees constituted of the
                    trustees, who are usually permanent members thereof, and of ordinarily
                    twenty-four other members, chosen by the club at large, one-third of whom go out
                    of office annually. These committees have plenary powers to deal with the
                    affairs of the club committed to their charge, assembling weekly to transact
                    current business and audit the accounts. Once a year a meeting of the whole club
                    is held, before which a report is laid, and any action taken thereupon which may
                    be necessary.</p>
                <p>The entrance fee varies from £40 at the <hi rend="italic">United Service</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Army and Navy</hi> clubs to 20 guineas at the <hi
                    rend="italic">Carlton</hi> club. The annual subscription in like manner ranges
                    from 10 guineas in the <hi rend="italic">Carlton, Reform,</hi> and several
                    others, to 7 guineas in the <hi rend="italic">United Service</hi> club. The
                    largest income derived from these and all other sources may be stated to be that
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Army and Navy</hi> club, which in the year 1875
                    amounted to £30,813, of which £19,383 was raised by entrance fees and
                    subscriptions alone. The expenditure is, however, most commonly of nearly equal
                    amount, and of few of the clubs can it be said that they are entirely free from
                    debt. The number of members included in a London club varies from 2200 in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Army and Navy</hi> to 475 in the <hi rend="italic">St
                    James's</hi> club.</p>
                <p>Numerous provincial clubs are established throughout the country. In both
                    Edinburgh and Dublin are clubs fully coming up to the metropolitan societies.
                    Nor is this great public convenience lacking in the cities and towns of Europe,
                    the United States, and the British colonies.</p>
                <p>Of a different nature and with widely different objects are the learned bodies
                    designated publishing clubs, of which the <hi rend="italic">Abbotsford,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bannatyne,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Roxburgh*,</hi> and
                    others are examples. These societies devoted themselves solely to the editing of
                    unpublished MSS., or the reprint-of rare and valuable works. (j. c. w.)</p>
