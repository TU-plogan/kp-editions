                    side of the Sinus Ceramicus, or Gulf of Cos. It was built partly on the mainland
                    and partly on the Island of Triopion, or Cape Krio, which anciently communicated
                    with the continent by a causeway and bridge, and is now permanently connected by
                    a narrow sandy isthmus. By means of the causeway the channel between island and
                    mainland was formed into two harbours, of which the larger, or southern, now
                    known as port Freano, was further enclosed by two strongly-built moles that are
                    still in good part entire. The extreme length of the city was little less than a
                    mile, and the whole intramural area is still thickly strewn with architectural
                    remains. The walls, both insular and continental, can be traced throughout their
                    whole circuit; and in many places, especially round the acropolis, at the
                    north-east corner of the city, they are remarkably perfect. Our knowledge of the
                    site'is largely due to the mission of the Dilettanti Society in 1812, and the
                    excavations executed by Mr C. T. Newton in 1857-8. The agora, the theatre, an
                    odeum, a temple of Dionysus, a temple of the Muses, a temple of Venus, and a
                    great number of minor buildings have been identified, and the general plan of
                    the city has been very clearly made out. In a templeenclosure Mr Newton
                    discovered a fine seated statue of Demeter, which now adorns the British Museum;
                    and about three miles south-east of the city he came upon the ruins of a
                    splendid tomb, and a colossal figure of a lion carved out of one block of
                    Pentelic marble, 10 feet in length and 6 in height, which has been supposed to
                    commemorate the great naval victory of Conon over the Lacedaemonians in 394 B.c.
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Architecture,</hi> vol. ii. p. 412). Among the minor
                    antiquities obtained from the city itself, or the great necropolis to the east,
                    perhaps the most interesting are thô leaden <hi rend="italic">κaτaδεσμoι,</hi>
                    or imprecationary tablets, found in the temple of Demeter, and copied in
                    facsimile in the appendix to the second volume of Newton’s work.</p>
                <p>Cnidus was a city of high antiquity and probably of Lacedaemonian colonization.
                    Along with Halicarnassus and Cos, and the Rhodian cities of Lindus, Camirus, and
                    Ialysus, it formed the Dorian Hexapolis, which held its confederate assemblies
                    on the Triopian headland, and there celebrated games in honour of Apollo,
                    Poseidon, and the nymphs. The city was at first governed by an oligarchic
                    senate, composed of sixty members, known as <hi rend="italic">àp-výµoves,</hi>
                    and presided over by a magistrate called an <hi rend="italic">ape&lt;rτηp</hi>;
                    but, though it is proved by inscriptions that the old names continued to a very
                    late period, the c nstitution underwent a popular transformation. The situation
                    of the city was favourable for commerce, and the Cnidians acquired considerable
                    wealth, and were able to colonize the island of Lipara and founded the city of
                    Corcyra Nigra in the Adriatic. They ultimately submitted to Cyrus, and from the
                    battle of Eurymedon to the latter part of the Peloponnesian war they were
                    subject to Athens. The Romans easily obtained their allegiance, and rewarded
                    them by leaving them the freedom of their city. During the Byzantine period
                    there must still have been a considerable population; for the ruins contain a
                    large number of buildings belonging to the Byzantine style, and Christian
                    sepulchres are common in the neighbourhood. Eudoxus, the astronomer, Ctesias,
                    the writer on Persian history, and Sostratus, the builder of the celebrated
                    Pharos at Alexandria, are the most remarkable of the Cnidians mentioned in
                    history.</p>
