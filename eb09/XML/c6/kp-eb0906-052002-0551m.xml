                    these names are also called by the Italian equivalents Giacomo (or Jacopo)
                    Cortese and Guglielmo Cortese. Each of the brothers is likewise named, from his
                    native province, Le Bourguignon, or 11 Borgognone.</p>
                <p>Jâques Courtois was born at St Hippolyte, near Besançon in 1621. His father was a
                    painter, and with him Jâques remained studying up to the age of fifteen. Towards
                    1637 he came to Italy, was hospitably received at Milan by a Burgundian
                    gentleman, and entered, and for three years remained in, the French military
                    service. The sight of some battle-pictures revived his taste for fine art. He
                    went to Bologna, and studied under the friendly tutelage of Guido; thence he
                    went to Rome, where he painted, in the Cistercian monastery, the Miracle of the
                    Loaves. Here he took a house, and entered upon his own characteristic style of
                    art, that of battle-painting, in which he has been accounted to excel all other
                    old masters; his merits were cordially recognized by the celebrated Cerquozzi,
                    named Michelangelo delle Battaglie. He soon rose from penury to ease, and
                    married a painter’s beautiful daughter, María Vagini; she died after seven years
                    of wedded life. Prince Matthias of Tuscany employed Courtois on some striking
                    works in his villa, Lappeggio, representing with much historical accuracy the
                    prince’s military exploits. In Venice also the artist executed for the senator
                    Sagredo some remarkable battle-pieces. Returning to Florence, he entered the
                    Society of Jesus, taking the habit in Rome in 1655; it was calumniously rumoured
                    that he adopted this course in order to escape punishment for having poisoned
                    his wife. As a Jesuit father, Courtois painted many works in churches and
                    monasteries of the society. He lived piously in Rome, and died there of apoplexy
                    on 20th May 1676 (some accounts say 1670 or 1671). His battle-pieces have
                    movement and fire, warm colouring, and great command of the brush,—those of
                    moderate dimensions are the more esteemed. They are slight in execution, and
                    tell out best from a distance. Courtois etched with skill twelve battlesubjects
                    of his own composition. The Dantzic painter named in Italy Pandolfo Reschi was
                    his pupil.</p>
                <p>Guillaume Courtois, born likewise at St Hippolyte, came to Italy with his
                    brother. He went at once to Rome, and entered the school of Pietro da Cortona.
                    He studied also the Bolognese painters and Guercino, and formed for himself a
                    style with very little express mannerism, partly resembling that of Maratta. He
                    painted the Battle of Joshua in the Quirinal Gallery, the Crucifixion of St
                    Andrew in the church of that saint on Monte Cavallo, various works for the
                    Jesuits, some also in co operation with his brother. His last production was
                    Christ admonishing Martha. His draughtsmanship is better than that of Jâques,
                    whom he did not, however, rival in spirit, colour, or composition. He executed
                    some etchings, moreover. Guillaume Courtois died of gout on 15th June 1679.</p>
