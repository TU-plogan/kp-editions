                    concrete of only a few feet in height, or as high-water dams of timber and
                    puddle formed to resist the waves of the sea, they are in every sense structures
                    of great importance in the practice of hydraulic engineering.</p>
                <p>Tide-dams are chiefly used in laying the foundations of piers or other works that
                    must be founded under low-water level. They are generally made of clay and
                    planking, and are only carried to the height of about 3 feet above low-water.
                    The water being pumped out during the last of the ebb tide affords one or two
                    hours work at low-water, the dam being submerged on the rise of the tide. In
                    such dams a sluice should be introduced, which when open may allow the water to
                    escape with the falling tide and so save pumping. Such tide-dams when exposed to
                    a considerable wash of sea may advantageously be made of cement rubble masonry,
                    of the application of which to coffer-dams the earliest account we know is that
                    stated in Stevenson’s <hi rend="italic">Account of the Bell-Rock Lighthouse</hi>
                    (p. 230), where he successfully employed that method of construction in 1808 in
                    excavating the foundation of that work. When it is required to sink the
                    foundation some feet into sand and gravel, a convenient expedient is the
                    portable dam proposed by Mr Thomas Stevenson described in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trans, of the Roy. Scot. Society of Arts,</hi> 1848, to which reference is
                    made. The feature in this tide-dam is the use of double framed walings to
                    support and direct the driving of the sheet piles, and its advantages are its
                    cheapness, its portability, and its ready adaptation to a sloping or even very
                    irregular bottom.</p>
                <p>But when it is necessary entirely to exclude the water from large areas, as, for
                    example, in dock-works, it is necessary to adopt coffer-dams of varied
                    construction suited to the circumstances of each case, and as these protecting
                    coffer-dam works, notwithstanding their temporary nature, demand much of the
                    engineer’s skill in their design and construction, w e propose to notice some of
                    the different modes of construction that have been adopted in such cases to suit
                    the varying sub-soil and other features of different works.</p>
                <p>It may here be mentioned that, particularly in bridge building, caissons were
                    employed in early times instead of coffer-dams, but they are now entirely out of
                    use. The caisson was a flat-bottomed barge constructed of strongly framed
                    timber-work, in which the under courses forming the foundation of the piers of a
                    bridge, for example, were built at any convenient spot near the banks of the
                    river. The caisson was then floated to the site of the pier, the bed of the
                    river having previously been dredged so as to present a comparatively level and
                    smooth surface. On the bed so prepared the caisson was sunk by admitting the
                    water gradually by means of a valve provided for that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n134/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0134-0115"/> purpose. The sides were so constructed as to
                    admit of their easy removal from the bottom of the caisson when it had been sunk
                    to its bed. Rankine mentions a caisson described by Becker which measured 63
                    feet long, 21 feet broad, and 15 feet deep over all. The bottom beams used in
                    constructing this large caisson were 10 inches square and 2 feet 10 inches apart
                    from centre to centre, and the uprights forming the sides were 10 inches square
                    aud 5 feet 8 inches apart from centre to centre.</p>
                <p>But to return to the subject of this article. The dams used in soft bottoms,
                    where piles can be driven, are constructed of timber, and vary in strength
                    according to the head of water they have to sustain. But the general style of
                    construction is in all cases the same. The dams are formed of parallel rows of
                    piles driven into the bottom, the space between the rows being filled by a mass
                    of clay puddle of sufficient thickness to exclude the water which percolates
                    between the joints of the piles. In cases where the head of water is not great,
                    the coffer-dam is generally constructed as shown in fig 1., where the gauge
                    piles <hi rend="italic">a</hi> are driven at distances varying from 4 to 8 feet
                    apart, to which walings <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are fixèd, and between the
                    walings sheet piles c are driven. The sheet piles are shod with iroiι, having a
                    sloping edge to cause the piles to cling while being driven, and in the centre
                    of each bay there is a key pile <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> having a slight taper
                    which on being driven down compresses the sheet piles on either side of it
                    closely together. In cases where the water pressure is great the sheeting piles
                    are dispensed with, and the dam is formed of two or sometimes three rows of
                    whole timbers having the clay puddle between them. Fig. 2 is a dam on this
                    principle, used in the construction of the Thames embankment, and described in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Institution of Civil Engineers</hi> by
                    Mr Thomas Ridley, and after the explanations that have been given, its
                    construction will be easily understood as an outer and inner dam formed of two
                    rows of close-driven whole logs with intervening spaces of 6 feet filled with
                    clay puddle. In all cases the dams must be supported by sufficient stays or
                    struts, abutting on firm ground, or, when this cannot be got, on dwarf piles
                    driven deep enough to afford sufficient resistance. It is also important to
                    remove the soft matter between the rows of piles to as great a depth as
                    possible, and to fill in the excavated space with clay puddle, for although the
                    timber-work of the dam must be constructed so as to resist pressures, it will
                    generally be found that the greatest risk of failure arises from the filtration
                    of water under the bottom of the sheeting piles and puddle.</p>
                <p>The coffer-dams described illustrate the general construction of such works, but
                    various arrangements of the timber work have been adopted to suit particular
                    situations, such as Mr James Walker’s coffer-dam for constructing the
                    foundations of the river terrace of the Houses of Parliament at Westminster
                    (vide <hi rend="italic">Min. of Proc, of Inst, of C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >E.,</hi> vol. i.), and Sir John Hawkshaw’s dam for the middle level drainage of
                    Lincoln <hi rend="italic">(Min. of Proc, of Inst, of Civil Engineers,</hi> vol.
                    xxii.)</p>
                <p>All the examples that have been given are applicable to situations where the
                    bottom is sufficiently soft to admit of piles being driven. But cases occur
                    where this is impossible. Such, for example, as the removal of obstructions from
                    the beds of rivers where it may be necessary to lay dry a large area of solid
                    rock, and in that case it is necessary to adopt a totally different construction
                    of dam. The accompanying cut (fig. 3) shows a coffer-dam designed by Mr D.
                    Stevenson, which is specially adapted to a hard bottom where piles cannot be
                    driven.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of Institution of Civil Engineers,</hi> vol. iii. p.
                    337.</p></note> It is formed of two rows of iron piles placed 3 feet apart and
                    jumped into the rock, which supports two linings of planking, the intermediate
                    space being filled with puddle and the whole structure properly stayed. This dam
                    has been successfully employed on many works, and on the Ribble navigation,
                    where it was first introduced, it was used to excavate a bed of rock 300 yards
                    in length and of a maximum depth of 13 feet 6 inches. The maximum depth at high
                    water against the dam was 16 feet, but in high river floods the whole dam was
                    completely submerged, and on the water subsiding it was found that the iron
                    rods, although jumped only 15 inches into the rock, were not drawn from their
                    fixtures.</p>
                <p>Dams must be designed with a special regard to their sufficiency to resist the
                    water pressures they have to bear, and Professor Rankine gives the following
                    formulae, in his <hi rend="italic">Manual of Civil Engineering,</hi> p. 612, for
                    calculating the pressure which the struts may have to bear.</p>

                <p>In conclusion it may be noticed that the introduction of iron cylinders and
                    compressed air for founding the piers of bridges has not only superseded the use
                    of timber coffer dams for piers in soft bottoms, but has enabled bridges to be
                    securely placed in situations where no timber dams could have answered the
                    purpose. On the other hand, there are many engineering works connected with
                    river, harbour, and dock improvements, to which the cylinder system is quite
                    inapplicable, and for which extensive and costly coffer-dams of the kind we have
                    described must continue to be employed. The method of founding by iron cylinders
                    has been described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Bridge,</hi> to which the
                    reader is referred. <hi rend="smallcaps">(d. s.)</hi></p>
