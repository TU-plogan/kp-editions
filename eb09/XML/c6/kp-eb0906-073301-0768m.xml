                    form or material. The progress of manufacturing industry has, however, detached
                    from it the fabrication of several kinds of edge-tools, saws, and similar
                    implements, the manufacture of which is now regarded as distinct branches of
                    trade. On the other hand modern cutlery includes a great number of articles
                    which are not strictly cutting implements, but which, owing to their more or
                    less intimate relation to table or pocket cutlery, are classed with such
                    articles for convenience sake. Ä fork, for example, is an important article of
                    cutlery, although it is not a cutting tool, and silver or German silver forks in
                    no way answer to the common definition of cutlery, as “cutting implements made
                    of steel.”</p>
                <p>The original cutting instruments used by the human race consisted of fragments of
                    flint, obsidian, or similar stones, rudely flaked or chipped to a cutting edge;
                    and of these tools numerous remains yet exist. Stone knives and other tools must
                    have been employed for a long period by the prehistoric races of mankind, as
                    their later productions show great perfection of form and finish. In the Bronze
                    period, which succeeded the Stone age, the cutlery of our ancestors was
                    fabricated of that alloy. The use of iron was introduced at a later but still
                    remote period; and it now, in the form of steel, is the staple article from
                    which cutlery is manufactured.</p>
                <p>From the earliest period in English history the manufacture of cutlery has been
                    peculiarly associated with the town of Sheffield, and at the present day that
                    town not only practically monopolizes the ordinary cutlery trade of Great
                    Britain, but undoubtedly remains the chief centre of the industry for the whole
                    world. The prominence of the manufacture in his own age is attested by Chaucer,
                    who says of the whittler of Trompington—</p>
                <p>“A Shefeld thwytel bare he in his hose.”</p>
                <p>The thwytel or whittle of that period was a very poor rude implement, consisting
                    of a blade of bar steel fastened into a wooden or horn handle. It was used for
                    cutting food as well as for the numerous miscellaneous duties which now fall to
                    the pocket knife. To the whittle succeeded the Jack knife,—the Jacques-de-Liége,
                    or Jock-te-leg of the Scottish James VI.,—which formed the prototype of the
                    modern clasp knife, inasmuch as the blade closed into a groove in the handle.
                    This improved form was probably introduced to Sheffield by Protestant refugees
                    from the Low Countries who came to England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
                    Shortly thereafter, about the beginning of the 17th century, the pocket knife
                    with spring back was introduced, and no marked improvement thereafter took place
                    till the early part of the present century. In 1624, two centuries after the
                    incorporation of the Cutlers’ Company of London, the cutlers of Hallamshire—the
                    name of the district of which Sheffield is the centre—were formed into a body
                    corporate for the protection of the “industry, labour, and reputation” of the
                    trade, which was being disgraced by the “deceitful and unworkmanlike wares of
                    various persons.” The Act of incorporation specifies the manufacture of “knives,
                    scissors, shears, sickles, and other cutlery,” and provides that all persons
                    engaged in the business shall “make the edge of all steel implements
                    manufactured by them of steel, and steel only, and shall strike on their wares
                    such mark, and such only, as should be assigned to them by the officers of the
                    said company.” Notwithstanding these regulations, and the pains and penalties
                    attached to their infringement, the corporation was not very successful in
                    maintaining the high character of Sheffield wares. Most manufacturers made
                    cutlery to the order of their customers, on which the name of the retailer was
                    stamped, and very inferior malleable or cast iron bladés went forth to the
                    public with “London made,” “best steel,” and other falsehoods stamped on them to
                    order. The corporate mark and name of a few firms, among which Joseph Rodgers
                    &lt;fc Sons stand foremost, are a guarantee of the very highest excellence of
                    material and finish; and such firms decline to stamp any name or mark other than
                    their own on their manufactures. In foreign markets, however, the reputation of
                    such firms is much injùred by impudent forgeries; and so far was this system of
                    fraud carried that inferior foreign work was forwarded to London to be
                    transshipped and sent abroad ostensibly as English cutlery. To protect the trade
                    against frauds of this class the Trades Mark Act of 1862 was passed chiefly on
                    the instigation of the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce.</p>
                <p>Sword cutlery, which embraces the manufacture of all military cutting weapons,
                    has always been a distinct branch of trade; and it attained great perfection
                    long before much attention was bestowed upon the tools appertaining to the arts
                    of peace. Damascus blades, with their peculiar variegated watered appearance and
                    their unequalled excellence of metal, have possessed from an early period the
                    highest reputation; and the method by which its structure was produced was long
                    a matter of speculation. The following remarks by Dr Percy <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Metallurgy—Iron and Steel)</hi> explain the method of which Damascus or damask
                    work is produced :—</p>
                <p>“The damasked portion is due to the difference in coloration, resulting from the
                    action of acids on iron and steel, the surface of the former being left with a
                    metallic tissue, and that of the latter being left coated with a black firmly
                    adherent carbonaceous residue. By suitably piling together bars of steel and
                    iron, welding them, and then drawing them out under the hammer, or otherwise,
                    patterns of various kinds may be produced, just as is done in the case of glass,
                    by heating together variously coloured pieces of glass, and drawing them out
                    into rods.”</p>
                <p>The sword blades of Toledo, and the workmanship of Andrea de Ferrara in the 16th
                    century, were also triumphs of metal-work. While Sheffield is now the great
                    centre of the manufacture of ordinary cutlery, Birmingham occupies the leading
                    place in the sword cutlery department; but the sword and its congeners do not
                    now hold the important position either in civil or in military life which they
                    occupied in earlier ages.</p>
                <p>The variety of materials which go to complete any single article of cutlery is
                    very considerable; and as the stock list of a cutler embraces a vast number of
                    articles different in form, properties, and uses, the master cutler must have a
                    practical knowledge of a wide range of substances. The leading articles of the
                    trade may be classed under—1st, domestic cutlery, which includes carving and
                    table knives and forks, pocket or clasp knives, razors, scissors, and similar
                    articles; and 2d, tool cutlery, under which head may be arranged surgical knives
                    and lancets, butchers’- and shoemakers’ knives, gardeners’ pruning-knives,
                    &lt;kc., sickles, scythes, and a vast number of other allied cutting implements.
                    The blades or cutting portions of a certain number of these articles are made of
                    shear steel, and for others cast steel only is employed. Sometimes the cutting
                    edge alone is of steel, backed or strengthened with malleable iron, to which it
                    is welded. Tangs on which handles are fastened, and other non-cutting portions,
                    are also very often of malleable iron. Brass, German silver, silver, horn,
                    tortoise <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n769/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0769-0734"/> shell, ivory, bone, mother-of-pearl, and numerous
                    fancy woods are all brought into requisition for handles and other parts of
                    cutlery, each demanding special treatment according to its nature. The essential
                    processes in making a piece of steel cutlery are—1st, forging; 2d, hardening and
                    tempering; 3d, grinding; and 4th, polishing; and to these of course are added
                    the diverse operations of fitting and handling of various kinds.</p>
                <p>The following outline of the stages in the manufacture of a razor will serve to
                    indicate the sequence of operations in making an article which, though simple in
                    form, demands the highest care and skill in the departments which strictly
                    appertain to cutlery. The first essential of a good razor is that it be made of
                    the finest quality of cast steel. A razor must further, according to Mr Ebenezer
                    Rhodes, a practical cutler who writes an <hi rend="italic">Essay on</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tlιe</hi><hi rend="italic">Manufacture of a Razor,</hi> present
                    “due proportion, form, temperature, fitness, and regularity of concavity.” The
                    steel for razors is obtained in bars half an inch in breadth, and the thickness
                    of the back of the instrument. Such a bar the forger takes, and, heating one end
                    of it to the proper forging temperature, he, with great dexterity, fashions it
                    upon his anvil, giving it roughly the required form, edge, and concavity. It is
                    then separated from the remainder of the bar, leaving only sufficient metal to
                    form the tang, if that is to be made of steel; sometimes a tang of malleable
                    iron is welded tt&gt; the blade. The tang of the “mould,” as the blade in this
                    condition is termed, is next drawn out, and the whole “smithed” or beaten on the
                    anvil to compact the metal and improve the form and edge of the razor. At this
                    stage the razor is said to be “forged in the rough,” and so neatly can some w
                    orkmen finish off this operation that a shaving edge may be given to the blade
                    by simple whetting. The forged blade is next “shaped” by grinding on the dry
                    stone, in which operation it is considerably reduced in weight, and the oxidized
                    scale is removed, which allows the hardening and tempering to be done with
                    certainty and proper effect. The shaped razor is now returned to the forge,
                    where the tang is file-cut and pierced with the joint-hole, and into the blade
                    is stamped either the name and corporate mark of the maker, or any mark and name
                    ordered by the tradesman for whom the goods are being manufactured. The
                    hardening is accomplished by heating the blade to a cherry-red heat and suddenly
                    quenching it in cold water, which leaves the metal excessively hard and brittle.
                    To bring it to the proper temper for a razor, it is again heated till the
                    metallic surface assumes a straw colour, and upon plungihg it into water, it is
                    ready for the process of wet grinding. The wet grinding is done on stones which
                    vary in diameter from 4 to 12 inches according to the concavity of surface
                    desired. The stones recommended by Mr Rhodes are from 6 to 8 inches in diameter,
                    which produce, he says, “razors sufficiently hollowed or ground out for any
                    service, however hard, to which they may be applied; and they combine a
                    desirable strength and firmness of edge, with a requisite degree of thinness.”
                    “Lapping,” which is the first stage in polishing, is performed on a wheel of the
                    same diameter as the wet-grinding stone. The lap is built up of segments of wood
                    having the fibres towards the periphery, and covered with a metallic alloy of
                    tin and lead. The lap is fed with a mixture of emery powder and oil. “Glazing”
                    and “polishing,” which follow, are for perfecting the polish on the surface of
                    the razor, leather-covered wheels with fine emery being used; and the work is
                    finished off with crocus. The finished blade is then rivetted into the scales or
                    handle, which may be of ivory, bone, horn, or other material; and when
                    thereafter the razor is set on a hone it is ready for use.</p>
                <p>The processes employed in making a table knife do not differ essentially from
                    those required for a razor Knife blades are made from shear steel, and, after
                    forging the blade, a piece of malleable iron sufficient for the bolster or
                    shoulder and tang is welded to it. The bolster is formed with the aid of a die
                    and swage called “prints,” and the tang is drawn out. The tang is variously
                    formed, according to the method by which it is to be secured in the shaft, and
                    the various processes of tempering, wet grinding, and polishing are pursued as
                    described above. Steel forks of an inferior quality are cast and subsequently
                    cleaned and polished, but the best quality are forged from bar steel, and the
                    prongs are cut or stamped out of an extended flattened extremity called the
                    mould or “mood.” In the United States of America machinery has been extensively
                    adapted for performing the various mechanical operations in forging and fitting
                    table cuttlery, and to some extent machines have been introduced in Sheffield.
                    In the making of a common pocket-knife with three blades not fewer than one
                    hundred separate operations are involved, and these may be performed by as many
                    workmen. The diversity of quality and workmanship is probably greater in the
                    cutlery trade than in any other, although differences are not readily apparent
                    to the unskilled critic, and the range of prices is correspondingly wide.</p>
                <p>In the cutlery trade the division of labour is carried out to such an extreme
                    degree as to exercise a very baneful influence on the operatives—who, as a
                    class, are socially and morally inferior to many of their fellows. Cutlery
                    grinding, which is one of the most important and distinctive departments of the
                    trade, possesses the bad eminence of being one of the most unhealthy and
                    deleterious of all occupations. Grinders are divided into three classes—dry,
                    wet, and mixed grinders, according as they work at dry or wet stones. This
                    branch of trade is, in Sheffield, conducted in distinct establishments called
                    “wheels,” which are divided up into separate apartments or “hulls," dry grinding
                    being as much as possible separated from the wet grinding. Dry grinding, such as
                    is practised in the shaping of razors described above, the “humping,” or
                    rounding of scissors, and other operations, is by far the most injurious and
                    fatal process. Red-hot particles of steel fly off, injuring and sometimes
                    blinding the eyes, unless they are protected; and the atmosphere is loaded with
                    fine dust of silica and steel, inducing inflammation of the lungs, pleurisy, and
                    grinders’ asthma. The men work in a peculiarly constrained position, and under
                    highly unsanitary conditions; and although a fan has been invented and
                    extensively introduced which, placed behind the stones, by suction draws away a
                    large proportion of the grinding dust, and renders the atmosphere comparatively
                    pure, many grinders still neglect to keep it working or positively refuse to
                    have. it. In a communication to the Social Science Association (Sheffield
                    meeting, 1865) Dr John C. Hall stated that there were then 3090 men and 1073
                    boys employed in grinding,— wet, dry, and mixed. “The average ages of all the
                    fork grinders living,” he says, “does not exceed 29; scissors grinders, 32; edge
                    tool and wool-shear grinders, 33; table-knife grinders, 35 On taking down the
                    ages of all the grinders—wet, mixed, and dry—at one of our largest wheels, I
                    found the average 34; boys under 21 were excluded from this calculation.” Dr
                    Hall gives the accompanying table of the ages of 290 men over 21 years of age
                    employed in razor grinding :—</p>
