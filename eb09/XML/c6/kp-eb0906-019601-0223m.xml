                <p><label type="entry">COMMERCE</label></p>
                <p>COMMERCE, in its general acceptation, is the international traffic in goods, or
                    what constitutes the foreign trade of all countries as distinct from their
                    domestic trade, and it will be convenient in this place to treat it chiefly
                    under this aspect</p>
                <p>The same causes which give rise to exchange of commodities in a limited field
                    call it into operation over more extended territories, and the same effects
                    which flow from it in the smaller flow from it in the larger sphere. There are
                    the same phenomena in either case, but in proportion as trade extends beyond the
                    narrow boundaries of a tribe or a nation, the greater are the obstacles it has
                    to encounter, not only in physical distance, and the practicable transit of
                    commodities, but in computation, in gauging the capacity and course of markets,
                    in the risk of making wrong adventures, in tne rivalry and exclusiveness, the
                    wars and revolutions of states; and consequently the more liable it becomes to
                    complications, partly native and partly foreign to itself, by which its
                    advantages have been obscured and its progress has been impeded in all ages.</p>
                <p>Exchange of commodities implies not only a division of labour, but a development
                    of natural resources where most abundant and accessible. As long as mankind live
                    in scattered and isolated families, each supplying its own wants directly by its
                    own labour, there can be little or no commerce; and as long as there is no
                    commerce every local habitation of man must depend on its natural resources,
                    however poor, unvaried, or difficult to utilize. Division of labour and exchange
                    may be said to be of twin birth, since the existence of the one cannot be
                    conceived without the other; and as they grow up from the simplest embryo, they
                    act and react on each other, giving always wider scope to their mutual
                    operation, and preparing a certain density of population in central places, or
                    markets, where the traffickers meet and artificers find it their interest to
                    settle, whether in the desert where caravans converge in their various routes
                    from one region to another, or at the confluence of navigable rivers, or in
                    secure bays of inland seas, commanding an extensive coast line, or some
                    interoceanic passage, and thus laying the foundation of towns and cities, to
                    become, it may be, as they have become in many instances, the seats of rule and
                    empire. The direct result of these primitive human instincts, as they may be
                    called, of division and exchange of the products of labour was to extend among
                    mankind a material and social comity, apart from all tribal or political
                    relations, from which sprung, as on a solid base or framework, the fair but
                    often frail fabric of civilization, arts, sciences, letters, philosophy,
                    religion— all that gives grace and dignity to humanity. The special office of
                    commerce, in the material part of the economy, is to organize places, soils,
                    climates, all local conveniences of land or sea, and superior natural resources
                    of various countries, as that of the division of labour is to organize the
                    talent, handiness, and aptitude of individuals.</p>
                <p>The formative and developing power of this function of commerce is much more
                    conspicuous in the phenomena of ancient history and in contemporary results than
                    may at first sight appear It were easy, judging from local qualities alone, to
                    explain wħy the metropolis of the United Kingdom should be on the Thames where
                    London now is; how rival ports arose along the western coast of Britain, on the
                    Severn, the Mersey, and the Clyde; why Lancashire should have become the great
                    centre of the cotton manufacture; why Dundee, from a small beginning in flax
                    from the adjacent Baltic, should have become a great emporium of flaxen and
                    cognate fabrics; why there should be a Hull on the Humber, a Newcastle on the
                    Tyne, and a rapidly rising Middlesborough on the Tees; why the Thames should
                    maintain, after many centuries of change and amidst many rivals, its pristine
                    supremacy, and yet the western coast of our island be much more brilliant
                    commercially than the eastern. But the same principle may be no less a guide to
                    our understanding why the earliest records we have of great seats of population
                    should be on the Euphrates, the Nile, the Ganges, and the Blue and Yellow Rivers
                    of China; how Palmyra, the ancient grandeur of which has been discovered in its
                    modern ruins, should have been built in the middle of a desert; how the cradle
                    of navigation and maritime commerce should be so indelibly couched along the
                    coasts and round the numerous islands of the Mediterranean Sea; how
                    international trade, seeking an outlet from its dreary prison of overland
                    desert, war, and rapine, should have found it for a time by the Mediterranean to
                    the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, only to be diverted by a bold navigation round
                    the cape of Africa, and should now be returning under more secure conditions to
                    the shorter route again. The tendency of commerce to connect one seat of
                    population with another, to open roads, to seize on every physical advantage of
                    transit between them, to create new centres of industry and traffic on the lines
                    of communication, and by the union, not only of human labour and capacities, but
                    of almost boundlessly diversified territorial resources thus effected, to
                    increase the production and circulation of commodities, is too obvious to
                    require illustration. This is what has been called by economists “the
                    territorial division of labour,” but the term scarcely reaches a full expression
                    of the effect of commerce. There is not only a territorial extension of the
                    division of labour in the sense of being spread over a larger area and a greatly
                    more numerous population, but the physical resources, the natural agents of
                    wealth themselves, as found in various countries and places, are brought into
                    the general organization as they could be by no other means, and made to yield
                    in due harmony with each other all their special and relative superiorities.</p>
                <p>A consideration of this action of international traffic in commodities is
                    sufficient to dispel many false views that have at various times been propounded
                    with much authority—such as that commerce, being an exchange of value for value,
                    can add nothing tó the general wealth; or that the profit of one party to an
                    exchange is the loss of the other party; or that the only profit of commerce
                    consists of the balance accruing in the precious metals; and similar crudities
                    of conception. The substratum of the whole system of international traffic is
                    that commodities, after bearing the cost of transit, are of more value in one
                    place than in another. Commodities are often so abundant, or capable of being
                    produced so abundantly in some places, as to be superfluities, and absolutely
                    valueless in such places, and yet are of much value in other places. As this
                    relation is mutual, there is nothing inconsistent in an exchange of commodities
                    of more value in one place than in another with a gain of value on both sides of
                    the exchange; and this becomes all the more apparent when, in addition to the
                    profit of the merchants or agents employed in the transaction, there is taken
                    into account the gain arising to the communities in their industry, and in the
                    profits of their industry.</p>
                <p>Exchange of commodities must have been coeval with human society. However self
                    depending on their own labour men may have been in the social state, they must
                    soon have had some commodities to exchange with each <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n224/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0224-0197"/> other, and as stock increased the process would
                    rapidly extend. The liability to failure of crops and to famine must have led to
                    storing of corn in seasons of plenty, and to occasional traffic in the first
                    necessary of life.</p>
                <p>The earliest records of commerce on an international scale are to be found in the
                    Hebrew Scriptures. Such a transaction as that of Abraham, for example, weighing
                    down “four hundred shekels of silver, <hi rend="italic">current with the
                    merchant,”</hi> for the field of Ephron, is suggestive of a group of facts and
                    ideas indicating an advanced condition of commercial intercourse,—property in
                    land, sale of land, arts of mining and purifying metals, the use of silver ot
                    recognized purity as a common medium of exchange, and merchandize an established
                    profession, or division of labour. That other passage in which we read of Joseph
                    being sold by his brethren for twenty pieces of silver to “a company of
                    Ishmeelites, coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery, balm, and
                    myrrh to Egypt,” extends our vision still farther, and shows us the populous and
                    fertile Egypt in commercial relationship with Chaldea, and Arabians, foreign to
                    both, as intermediaries in their traffic, generations before the Hebrew
                    commonwealth was founded. The allusions in Homer and other ancient writings do
                    not bespeak so advanced a state of trade as those in Genesis. There would seem
                    to have been brass coins among the warriors engaged at the siege of Troy; and
                    the shields of Homeric heroes cost, some nine oxen, some more splendid a hundred
                    oxen, implying much rude magnificence in the form of barter; and yet probably
                    not such barter, pure and simple, as is seen in the present day at Kiakhta and
                    Maimatchin, on the Chinese borders of Russia, where chests of tea are exchanged
                    in bulk for Muscovite manufactures of cotton or wool. One might fairly infer,
                    from such archaic touches of the Greek bard, that he had in view an agricultural
                    and pastoral state of society, in which oxen, from their more ready power of
                    purchase than any other commodity, had become a rough standard of value; but
                    oxen could not in any state of society be a general medium of exchange, and the
                    history of circulating media, by which exchanges were effected in ancient times,
                    is curiously illustrative of the transition of real into symbolic value. It may
                    be doubted whether the hundred <hi rend="italic">kesitas</hi> paid by Jacob for
                    a field in Shalem were lambs or pieces of money having lambs as their insignia.
                    The leather money of Carthage, which appears to have been symbolic, was probably
                    much more valuable than the iron money of Sparta, which had an intrinsic worth.
                    Any commodity of the first rank in a public mart might become in small
                    circulable pieces the symbol of so much of that commodity to be delivered to
                    order, and from the constancy of that particular exchange, might be relied upon
                    for the purchase of other commodities. But, generally speaking, the use of gold
                    and silver as instruments of exchange betokens a much higher commercial
                    development than where commodities are priced by a number of oxen, or by rings
                    of brass or iron; and it is on record that the precious metals were thus
                    employed in Arabia and Syria, some 2000 years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> as
                    they, no doubt, had b.een much anterior to that date both in Egypt on the one
                    hand and in the rich and populous plains of the Tigris and Euphrates on the
                    other.</p>
                <p>The first foreign merchants of whom we read, carrying goods and bags of silver
                    from one distant region to another, were the Southern Arabs, reputed descendants
                    of Ishmael and Esau. Touching in their territory on the south the Red Sea and
                    the right bank of the Nile, and on the north and east the most densely inhabited
                    tracts of Asia, and accustomed in their own interior economy to a free and
                    nomadic life, it may have occurred to the more intelligent and enterprizing of
                    these people to enter on this new and adventurous course. Their traffic could
                    only have small beginnings, but they were pioneers of foreign trade, and showed
                    to their richer neighbours that the desert could be pierced. On the other hand,
                    the first navigators and maritime carriers of goods of whom we read were the
                    Phoenicians, the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> of the Canaanites overthrown by
                    the conquering Hebrews, who, intent on the plain of the Jordan, the hilly slopes
                    of Judea, and the sacred Mount Moriah—the long “promised land, ”—allowed the
                    dispossessed to settle on a narrow strip of territory along the coast of the
                    Mediterranean. As the clearance proceeded the number of refugees increased, and
                    this outcast race, with one foot on the sea and the other barely on the land,
                    soon outstripped the Edomites and the Ishmaelites in the career of commerce.
                    They founded Tyre and Sidon, of whose opulence there are abundant proofs both in
                    sacred and in profane history Launching their oared barks on the wave, and
                    steering close along the shore so as to be able to take shelter in the nearest
                    harbourage from a storm, they established a securer and cheaper passage between
                    Egypt and Syria than had before been known. The corn and ivory of the Nile and
                    the oil, silk, dyes, and spices of Western Asia flowed into their hands. From
                    carriers they became merchants, and to merchandize they added manufactures. They
                    enlarged their ships, grew bolder in navigation, and hoisted sails. In the days
                    of Solomon their vessels had penetrated the Red Sea. and brought back to the
                    great king the wealth of Ophir: but that this land of gold was in India, and
                    that the Phaenician craft crossed the Indian Ocean are conclusions unsupported
                    by evidence. It is certain that they traversed thoroughly the shores of the
                    Mediterranean, both continental and insular, established settlements and
                    colonies in many of the islands of the Greek Archipelago, and, greatest of all,
                    founded Carthage, one of the most noted, and probably the most lamented in its
                    fall, of the commercial cities and empires of the ancient world. The kings of
                    Tyre and Sidon, though often involved in the wars and troubles of the Hebrew
                    monarchy, remained for the most part in friendly alliance with Judah and Israel,
                    to whom they were the most valuable of allies both in a commercial and defensive
                    point of view; and it was their adhesion to the cause of Zedekiah, king of
                    Judah, that brought upon the Tyrians the terrible and all but fatal revenge of
                    Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, 3416 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> But while
                    their old city on the shore was being reduced to ashes by a thirteen years’
                    siege, the portion of inhabitants who clung to the defence built a new city on
                    an adjacent island, and thus took a new lease of life from the sea—a process
                    which was destined to be almost identically repeated by Venice many centuries
                    afterwards, when the Roman empire was falling under the blows of the barbarians.
                    But Phoenicia never fully recovered her former power, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >couγ&gt;</hi><hi rend="italic">de grace</hi> was given to this famous
                    commercial republic in the capture of Tyre by Alexander the Great, 250 years
                    after the struggle with Nebuchadnezzar. The whole inhabitants of the once proud
                    city, who had not saved themselves by flight, were either put to the sword,
                    crucified, or sold into slavery. After this event the name of the Phoenicians
                    disappeared from history, or was soon absorbed in the rising splendour of the
                    commercial cities of Greece— Athens, Corinth, Argos, and their colonies; of
                    Carthage, still in full fame; and of the great seaport named after its founder
                    Alexander, and built in a spot so well chosen that the city retains its
                    importance to the present hour.</p>
                <p>In the commerce of the ante-Christian ages the Jews do not appear to have
                    performed any conspicuous part. Both the agricultural and the theocratic
                    constitution of their society were unfavourable to a vigorous prosecution of
                    foreign trade. In such traffic as they had with other nations they were served
                    on their eastern borders by Arabian merchants, and on the west and south by the
                    Phoenician shippers.</p>

                <p>The abundance of gold, silver, and other precious commodities gathered from
                    distant parts, of which we read in the days of greatest Hebrew prosperity, has
                    more the character of spoils of war and tributes of dependent states than the
                    conquest by free exchange of their domestic produce and manufactures. The varied
                    merchandize of Tyre and Sidon must have passed over the roads of Palestine, and
                    helped to enrich the Jewish treasury. Tadmor, built by Solomon in the Syrian
                    desert, where there were wells of water, can only be supposed to have been
                    designed as a post for the service of this traffic; audit became not only a
                    resting-place for traffickers and their camels, but a great centre of commerce
                    and political power, under the later name of Palmyra. But it was not until the
                    Jews were scattered by foreign invasions, and finally cast into the world by the
                    destruction of Jerusalem, that they began to develop those commercial qualities
                    for which they have since been so famous. A similar remark may be made of the
                    more ancient nation of Egypt, of whom there is scarce a trace to be found as
                    pioneers of foreign trade. When famine visited adjacent tracts of country corn
                    was usually to be obtained on the Nile, but those in want had to go for it, and
                    the Phoenicians at one period, and the Greeks at another, became the corn
                    merchants of Egypt, while Rome for some centuries drew large supplies to order
                    of her Government. One can readily believe the great wealth, industry, and
                    resources of empires of which such cities as Nineveh and Babylon were the
                    capitals; but the habit of Eastern potentates to drain to their central
                    treasuries the riches of the most distant provinces, and the boundless power by
                    which millions of people were doomed to servitude, are calculated to weaken the
                    impression that such emblems of grandeur as may still remain in ruins are to be
                    ascribed to anything which in the present age could be dignified with the name
                    of commerce.</p>
                <p>Such being the general spirit and economy of the ancient nations of the East of
                    which we have historic records, it may be more easily conceived how dense
                    populations might grow up on the great plain of Hindustan and the still greater
                    plain of China; have their own wars, revolutions, and social changes; develop
                    much wealth and varied riches, much art and science, much literary and
                    philosophical refinement; have much internal traffic, with little or no commerce
                    beyond their own widely-extended and impassable frontiers; and yet be so unknown
                    to the rest of the world that the Persians, even in the days of Xerxes, appear
                    to have had scarce a conjecture that there was such an empire as China in
                    existence; that Alexander, on conquering Persia and watering his horses in the
                    Indus, should dream that he was master of all Asia—“weep," as the romantic
                    version runs, “that there was no more world to conquer;” and that, in short,
                    over the growth of these ancient civilizations of Eastern Asia, surviving to the
                    present day and embracing about a half of the human race, the curtain of history
                    should drop as blankly as if they belonged to another planet, or could be seen
                    only through a haze of fable and mystical tradition.</p>
                <p>There are three conditions as essential to extensive international traffic as
                    diversity of natural resources, division of labour, accumulation of stock, or
                    any other primal element—(1) means of transport, (2) freedom of labour and
                    exchange, and (3) security; and in all these conditions the ancient world was
                    signally deficient.</p>
                <p>The great rivers, which became the first seats of population and empire, must
                    have been of much utility as channels of transport, and hence the course of
                    human power of which they are the geographical delineation, and probably the
                    idolatry with which they were sometimes honoured. Nor were the ancient rulers
                    insensible of the importance of opening roads through their dominions, and
                    establishing posts and lines of communication, which, though primarily for
                    official and military purposes, must have been useful to traffickers and to the
                    general population. But the free navigable area of great rivers is limited, and
                    when diversion of traffic had to be made to roads and tracks through deserts,
                    there remained the slow and costly carriage of beasts of burden, by which only
                    articles of small bulk and the rarest value could be conveyed with any hope of
                    profit. 'Corn, though of the first necessity, could only be thus transported in
                    famines, when beyond price to those who were in want, and under this extreme
                    pressure could only be drawn from within a narrow sphere, and in quantity
                    sufficient to the sustenance of but a small number of people. The routes of
                    ancient commerce were thus interrupted and cut asunder by barriers of transport,
                    and the farther they were extended became the more impassable to any
                    considerable quantity or weight of commodities. As long as navigation was
                    confined to rivers and the shores of inland gulfs and seas, the oceans were a
                    <hi rend="italic">terra incognita,</hi> contributing nothing to the facility or
                    security of transport from one part of the world to another, and leaving even
                    one populous part of Asia as unapproachable from another as if they had been in
                    different hemispheres. The various routes of trade from Europe and North-Western
                    Asia to India, which have been often referred to, are to be regarded more as
                    speculations of future development than as realities of ancient history. It is
                    not improbable that the ancient traffic of the Red Sea may have been extended
                    along the shores of the Arabian Sea to some parts of Hindustan, but that vessels
                    braved the Indian Ocean and passed round Cape Comorin into the Bay of Bengal,
                    2000 or even 1000 years before mariners had learned to double the Cape of Good
                    Hope, is scarcely to be believed. The route by the Euxine and the Caspian Sea
                    has probably never in any age reached India. That by the Euphrates and the
                    Persian Gulf is shorter, and was besides the more likely from passing through
                    tracts of country which in the most remote times were seats of great population.
                    There may have been merchants many, who traded on all these various routes, but
                    that commodities were passed in bulk over great distances is inconceivable. It
                    may be doubted whether in the ante-Christian ages there was any heavy transport
                    over even 500 miles, save for warlike or other purposes, which engaged the
                    public resources of imperial states, and in which the idea of commerce, as now
                    understood, is in a great measure lost.</p>
                <p>The advantage which absolute power gave to ancient nations in their warlike
                    enterprises; and in the execution of public works of more or less utility, or of
                    mere ostentation and monumental magnificence, was dearly purchased by the
                    sacrifice of individual freedom, the right to labour, produce, and exchange
                    under the steady operation of natural economic principles, which more than any
                    other cause vitalizes the individual and social energies, and multiplies the
                    commercial resource of communities. Commerce in all periods and countries has
                    obtained a certain freedom and hospitality from the fact that the foreign
                    merchant has something desirable to offer; but the action of trading is
                    reciprocal, and requires multitudes of producers and merchants, as free agents,
                    on both sides, searching out by patient experiment wants more advantageously
                    supplied by exchange than by direct production, before it can attain either
                    permanence or magnitude, or can become a vital element of national life. The
                    ancient polities offered much resistance to this development, and in their
                    absolute power over the liberty, industry, and property of the masses of their
                    subjects raised barriers to the extension of commerce scarcely less formidable
                    than the want of means of communication itself. The conditions of security under
                    which foreign trade can alone flourish equally exceeded the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0226-0199"/> resources of ancient civilization. Such roads as
                    exist must be protected from robbers, the rivers and seas from pirates; goods
                    must have safe passage and safe storage, must be held in a manner sacred in the
                    territories through which they pass, be insured against accidents, be respected
                    even in the madness of hostilities; the laws of nations must give a guarantee on
                    which traders can proceed in their operations with reasonable confidence; and
                    the Governments, while protecting the commerce of their subjects with foreigners
                    as if it were their own enterprise, must in their fiscal policy, and in all
                    their acts, be endued with the highest spirit of commercial honour. Every great
                    breach of this security stops the continuous circulation, which is the life of
                    traffic and of the industries to which it ministers. But in tlιe ancient records
                    we see commerce exposed to great risks, subject to constant pillage, hunted down
                    in peace, and utterly extinguished in war. Hence it became necessary that
                    foreign trade should itself be an armed force in the world; and though the
                    states of purely commercial origin soon fell into the same arts and wiles as the
                    powers to which they were opposed, yet their history exhibits clearly enough the
                    necessity out of which they arose. Once organized, it was inevitable that they
                    should meet iutrigue with intrigue, and force with force. The political empires,
                    while but imperfectly developing industry and traffic within their own
                    territories, had little sympathy with any means of prosperity from without.
                    Their sole policy was either to absorb under their own spirit and conditions of
                    rule, or to destroy, whatever was rich or great beyond their borders.</p>
                <p>Nothing is more marked in the past history of the world than this struggle of
                    commerce to establish conditions of security and means of communication with
                    distant parts, When almost driven from the land, it often found both on the sea;
                    and often, when its success had become brilliant and renowned, it perished under
                    the assault of stronger powers, only to rise again in new centres and to find
                    new channels of intercourse.</p>
                <p>While Rome was giving laws and order to the halfcivilized tribes of Italy,
                    Carthage, operating on a different base, and by other methods, was opening trade
                    with less accessible parts of Europe. The strength of Rome was in her legions,
                    that of Carthage in her ships, and her ships could cover ground where the
                    legions were powerless. Her mariners had passed the mythical straits into the
                    Atlantic, and established the port of Cadiz. Within the Mediterranean itself
                    they founded Carthagena and Barcelona on the same Iberian peninsula, and ahead
                    of the Roman legions had depots and traders on the shores of Gaul. After the
                    destruction of Tyre, Carthage became the greatest power in the Mediterranean,
                    and inherited the trade of her Phoenician ancestors with Egypt, Greece, and Asia
                    Minor, as well as her own settlements in Sicily and on the European coasts. An
                    antagonism between the great naval and the great military power, whose interests
                    crossed each other at so many points, was sure to occur; and in the three Punic
                    wars Carthage measured her strength with that of Rome both on sea and land with
                    no unequal success. But a commercial state impelled into a series of great wars
                    has departed from its own proper base; and in the yeaι 146 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Carthage was so totally destroyed by the Romans that of the great
                    city, more than 20 miles in circumference, and containing at one period near a
                    million of inhabitants, only a few thousands were found within its ruined walls.
                    In the same year Corinth, one of the greatest of the Greek capitals and
                    seaports, was captured, plundered of vast wealth, and given to the flames by a
                    Roman consul. Athens and her magnificent harbour of the Piraeus fell into the
                    same hands 60 years later. It may be presumed that trade went on under the Roman
                    con quests in some degree as before; but these were grave events to occur within
                    a brief period, and the spirit of the seat of trade in every case having been
                    broken, and its means and resources more or less plundered, and dissipated—in
                    some cases, as in that of Carthage, irreparably— the most necessary commerce
                    could only proceed with feeble and languid interest under the military,
                    consular, and proconsular licence of Rome at that period. It may be remarked
                    that Tyre, the great seaport of Palestine, having been destroyed by Alexander
                    <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> the Great, Palmyra, the great inland centre of
                    Syrian trade, was visited with a still more complete annihilation by the Roman
                    Emperor Aurelian within little more than half a century after the capture and
                    spoliation of Athens. The walls were razed to their foundations; the
                    population—men, women, children, and the rustics round the city—were all either
                    massacred or dispersed; and the queen Zenobia was carried captive to Rome.
                    Palmyra had for centuries, as a centre of commercial intercourse and transit,
                    been of great service to her neighbours, east and west. In the wars .of the
                    Romans and Parthians she was respected by both as an asylum of common interests
                    which it would have been simple barbarity <hi rend="subscript"> k</hi> to invade
                    or injure; and when the Parthians were subdued, and Palmyra became a Roman <hi
                    rend="italic">annexe,</hi> she continued to flourish as before. Her relations
                    with Rome were more than friendly; they became enthusiastic and heroic; and her
                    citizens, in a most brave expedition, having inflicted signal chastisement on
                    the king of Persia for the imprisonment of the emperor Valerian, the admiration
                    of this conduct at Rome was so great that their spirited leader Odenathus, the
                    husband of Zenobia, was proclaimed Augustus, and became co-emperor with
                    Gallienus. But the Palmyrians, on receiving this exalted honour from the Roman
                    senate and people, might have said, “Timeo Danaos dona ferentes,” for it
                    introduced into their secure, palm-covered, and lucrative groves of commerce the
                    bane of imperial politics and ambition; and it was the passionate impulse of
                    Palmyra and her widowed queen to erect an empire of their own that brought down
                    upon them the terrible and enduring retribution of Aurelian. It is obvious that
                    the destruction of Palmyra must not only have doomed Palestine, already bereft
                    of her seaports, to greater poverty and commercial isolation than had been known
                    in long preceding ages, but have also rendered it more difficult to Rome herself
                    to hold or turn to any profitable account her conquests in Asia; and, being an
                    example of the policy of Rome to the seats of trade over nearly the whole
                    ancient· world, it may be said to contain in graphic characters a presage of
                    what came to be the actual event—the collapse and fall of the Roman empire
                    itself.</p>
                <p>The repeated invasions of Italy by the Goths and Huns gave rise to a seat of
                    trade in the Adriatic, which was to sustain during more than a thousand years a
                    history of unusual splendour. The Veneti cultivated fertile lands on the Po, and
                    built several towns, of which Padua was the chief. They appear from the earliest
                    note of them in history to have been both an agricultural and trading people;
                    and they offered a rich prey to the barbarian hordes w hen these broke through
                    every barrier into the plains of Italy. Thirty years before Attila razed the
                    neighbouring city of Aquileia, the consuls and senate of Padua, oppressed and
                    terrified by the prior ravages of Alaric passed a decree for erecting Rialto,
                    the largest of the numerous islets at the mouth of the Po, into a chief town and
                    port, not more as a convenience to the islanders than as a security for
                    themselves and their goods. But every fresh incursion, every new act of
                    spoliation by the dreaded enemies, increased the flight of the rich and the
                    industrious to the islands, and thus gradually arose the second Venice, whose
                    glory was so greatly to exceed that of the first. Approachable from tho <pb

                    easily defended by practised sailors against barbarians who had never plied an
                    oar, the Venetian refugees could look in peace on the desolation which swept
                    over Italy; their warehouses, their markets, their treasures were safe from
                    plunder; and •stretching their hands over the sea, they îound in it fish and
                    salt, and in the rich possessions of trade and territory which it opened to
                    them, more than compensation for the fat lands and inland towns which had long
                    been their home. The Venetians traded with Constantinople, Greece, Syria, and
                    Egypt. They became lords of the Morea, and of Candia, Cyprus, and other islands
                    of the Levant. The trade of Venice with India, though spoken of, was probably
                    never great. But the crusades of the 12th and 13th centuries against the
                    Saracens in Palestine extended her repute more widely east and west, and
                    increased both her naval and her commercial resources. It is enough, indeed, to
                    account for the grandeur of Venice that in course of centuries, from the
                    security of her position, the growth and energy of her population, and the
                    regularity of her government at a period when these sources of prosperity were
                    rare, she became the great emporium of the Mediterranean—all that Carthage,
                    Corinth, and Athens had been in a former age on a scene the most remarkable in
                    the world for its fertility and facilities of traffic,—and that as Italy and
                    other parts of the Western empire became again more settled her commerce found
                    always a wider range. The political history of the Venetian Republic is deeply
                    interesting, were this the proper place to do more than glance at the fortune of
                    commerce and the circumstances and conditions under which it attains its
                    grandest success. The bridge built from the largest of the islands to the
                    opposite bank became the “Rialto,” or famous exchange of Venice, whose
                    transactions reached farther, and assumed a more consolidated form, than had
                    been known before. There it was where the first public bank was organized; that
                    bills of exchange were first negotiated, and funded debt became transferable;
                    that finance became a science, and book-keeping an art. Nor must the effect of
                    the example of Venice on other cities of Italy be left out of account. Genoa,
                    following her steps, rose into great prosperity and power at the foot of the
                    Maritime Alps, and became her rival, and finally her enemy. Naples, Gaeta,
                    Florence, many other towns of Italy, and Rome herself, long after her fall, were
                    encouraged to struggle for the preservation of their municipal freedom, and to
                    foster trade, arts, and navigation, by the brilliant success set before them on
                    the Adriatic; but Venice, from the early start she had made, and her command of
                    the sea, had the commercial pre-eminence.</p>
                <p>The state of things which arose on the collapse of the Roman empire presents two
                    concurrent facts, deeply affecting the course of trade—(1) the ancient seats of
                    industry and civilisation were undergoing constant decay, while (2) the
                    energetic races of Europe were rising into more civilized forms and manifold
                    vigour and copiousness of life. The fall of the Eastern division of the empire
                    prolonged the effect of the fall of the Western empire; and the advance of the
                    Saracens over Asia Minor, Syria, Greece, Egypt, over Cyprus and other
                    possessions of Venice in the Mediterranean, over the richest provinces of Spain,
                    and finally across the Hellespont into the Danubian provinces of Europe, was a
                    new irruption of barbarians from another point of the compass, and revived the
                    calamities and disorders inflicted by the successive invasions of Goths, Huns,
                    and other Northern tribes. For more than ten centuries the naked power of the
                    sword was vivid and terrible as flashes of lightning over all the seats of
                    commerce, whether of ancient or more modern origin. The feudal system of Europe,
                    in organizing the open country under military leaders and defenders subordinated
                    in possession and service under a legal system to each other and to the
                    sovereign power, must have been well adapted to the necessity of the times in
                    which it spread so rapidly; but it would be impossible to say that the feudal
                    system was favourable to trade, or the extension of trade. The commercial spirit
                    in the feudal, as in preceding ages, had to find for itself places of security,
                    and it could only find them in towns, armed with powers of self-regulation and
                    defence, and prepared, like the feudal barons themselves, to resist violence
                    from whatever quarter it might come. Rome, in her best days, had founded the
                    municipal system, and when this system was more than ever necessary as the
                    bulwark of arts and manufactures, its extension became an essential element of
                    the whole European civilization. Towns formed themselves into leagues for mutual
                    protection, and out of leagues not infrequently arose commercial republics. The
                    Hanseatic League, founded as early as 1241, gave the first note of an increasing
                    traffic between countries on the Baltic and in northern Germany, which a century
                    or two before w ere sunk in isolated barbarism. From Lubeck and Hamburg,
                    commanding the navigation of the Elbe, it gradually spread over 85 tow ns,
                    including Amsterdam, Cologne, and Frankfort in the south, and Dantzic,
                    Königsberg, and Riga in the north. The last trace of this league, long of much
                    service in protecting trade, and as a means of political mediation, passed away
                    the other year in the erection of the new German empire, but only from the same
                    cause that had brought about its gradual dissolution—the formation of powerful
                    and legal governments— which, while leaving to the free cities their municipal
                    rights, were well capable of protecting their mercantile interests. The towns of
                    Holland found lasting strength and security from other causes. Their foundations
                    were laid as literally in the sea as those of Venice had been. They were not
                    easily attacked whether by sea or land, and if attacked had formidable means of
                    defence. The Zuyder Zee, which had been opened to the German Ocean in 1282,
                    carried into the docks and canals of Amsterdam the traffic of the ports of the
                    Baltic, of the English Channel, and of the south of Europe, and what the seas
                    did for Amsterdam from without the Rhine and the Maese did for Dort and
                    Rotterdam from the interior. By the Union of Utrecht in 1579 Holland became an
                    independent republic, and for long after, as it had been for some time before,
                    was the greatest centre of maritime traffic in Europe. The rise of the Dutch
                    power in a low country, exposed to the most destructive inundations, difficult
                    to cultivate or even to inhabit, affords a striking illustration of those
                    conditions which in all times have been found specially favourable to commercial
                    development, and which are not indistinctly reflected in the mercantile history
                    of England, preserved by its insular position from hostile invasions, and
                    capable by its fleets and arms to protect its goods on the seas and the rights
                    of its subjects in foreign lands.</p>
                <p>The progress of trade and productive arts in the Middle Ages, though not rising
                    to much international exchange, was very considerable both in quality and
                    extent. The republics of Italy, which had no claim to rival Venice or Genoa in
                    maritime power or traffic, developed a degree of art, opulence, and refinement
                    commanding the admiration of modern times; and if any historian of transAlpine
                    Europe, when Venice had already attained some greatness, could have seen it 500
                    years afterwards, the many strong towns of France, Germany, and the Low
                    Countries, the great number of their artizans, the products of their looms and
                    anvils, and their varions cunning workmanship might have added many a brilliant
                    page to his annals. Two centuries before England had discovered any
                    manufacturing quality, or knew even how to utilize her most valuable raw’
                    materials, and was importing goods from <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0228-0201"/> the Continent for the production of which she was
                    soon to be found to have special resources, the Flemings were selling their
                    woollen and linen fabrics, and the French their wines, silks, and laces in all
                    the richer parts of tlιe British Islands. It is more commonly, indeed, when
                    commerce is somewhat still, and men, finding their means resting within limited
                    bounds, learn to delight in labour and invention for their own sake apart from
                    their immediate profits, that the quality of work is improved, and a vantage
                    ground is established formore extended operations, than when commerce is in full
                    career, everything buoyant, saleable, and rising in value, and the lust of gain
                    has taken possession of the human spirit. The Middle Ages may be said to have
                    had this result on a large scale. They placed the barbarous populations of
                    Europe under a severe discipline, trained them in the most varied branches of
                    industry, and developed an amount of handicraft and ingenuity which became an
                    always more solid basis for the future. But trade was too walled in, too much
                    clad in armour, and too incessantly disturbed by wars and tumults, and
                    violations of common right and interest, to exert its full influence over the
                    general society, or even to realize its most direct advantages. It wanted
                    especially the freedom and mobility essential to much international increase,
                    and these it was now to receive from a series of the most pregnant events.</p>
                <p>The mariner’s compass had become familiar in the European ports about the
                    beginning of the 14th century, and the seamen of Italy, Portugal, France,
                    Holland, and England entered upon a more enlightened and adventurous course of
                    navigation. The Canary Islands were sighted by a French vessel in 1330, and
                    colonized in 1418 by the Portuguese, who two years later landed on Madeira. In
                    1431 the Azores were discovered by a shipmaster of Bruges. The Atlantic was
                    being gradually explored. In 1486, Diaz, a Portuguese, steering his course
                    almost unwittingly along the coast of Africa, came upon the land’s-end of that
                    continent; and nine years afterwards Vasco de Gama, of the same nation, not only
                    doubled the Cape of Good Hope, but reached Zanzibar. About the same period a
                    Portuguese traveller penetrated to India by the old time-honoured way of Suez;
                    and a land, which tradition and imagination had invested with almost fabulous
                    wealth and splendour, was becoming more real to the European world at the moment
                    when the expedition of Vasco de Gama had made an oceanic route to its shores
                    distinctly visible One can hardly now realize the impression made by these
                    discoveries in an age when the minds of men were awakening out of a long sleep,
                    when the printing press was disseminating the ancient classical and sacred
                    literature, and when geography and astronomy were subjects of eager study in the
                    seats both of traffic and of learning But their practical effect was seen in
                    swiftly-succeeding events. Before the end of the century Columbus had thrice
                    crossed the Atlantic, touched at San Salvador, discovered Jamaica, Porto Bico,
                    and the Isthmus of Darien, and had seen the waters of the Orinoco in South
                    America. Meanwhile Cabot, sent out by England, had discovered Newfoundland,
                    planted the EnglishflagonLabrador,Nova Scotia, and Virginia, and made known the
                    existence of an expanse of land now known as Canada. This tide of discovery by
                    navigators flowed on without intermission. But the opening of a maritime route
                    to India and the discovery of America, surprising as these events must have been
                    at the time, were slow in producing tne results of which they were a sure
                    prognostic. The Portuguese established at Goa the first European factory in
                    India a few years after Vasco de Gama’s expedition, and other maritime nations
                    of Europe traced a similar course. But it was not till 1600 that the English
                    East India Company was established, and the opening of the first factory of the
                    Company in India must be dated some ten or eleven years later. So also it was
                    one thing to discover the two Americas, and another, in any real sense, to
                    possess or colonize them, or to bring their productions into the general traffic
                    and use of the world. Spain, following the stroke of the valiant oar of
                    Columbus, found in Mexico and Peru remarkable remains of an ancient though
                    feeble civilization, and a wealth of gold and silver mines, which to Europeans
                    of that period was fascinating from the rarity of the precious metals in their
                    own realms, and consequently gave to the Spanish colonizations and conquests in
                    South America an extraordinary but unsolid prosperity. The value of the precious
                    metals in Europe was found to fall as soon as they began to be more widely
                    distributed, a process in itself at that period of no small tediousness; and it
                    was discovered further, after a century or two, that the production of gold and
                    silver is much like the production of other commodi ties for which they
                    exchange, viz., limited, and only increased in quantity at a heavier cost, that
                    is only reduced again by greater art and science'in the process of production.
                    Many difficulties, in short, had tc be overcome, many wars to be waged, and many
                    deplorable errors to be committed, in turning the new advantages to account. But
                    given a maritime route to India and the discovery of a new world of continent
                    and islands in the richest tropical and subtropical latitudes, it could not be
                    difficult to foresee that the course of trade was to be wholly changed as well
                    as vastly extended.</p>
                <p>The substantial advantage of the oceanic passage to India by the Cape of Good
                    Hope, as seen at the time, was to enable European trade with the East to escape
                    from the Moors, Algerines, and Turks who now swarmed round the shores of the
                    Mediterranean, and waged a predatory war on ships and cargoes which would have
                    been a formidable obstacle even if traffic, after running this danger, had not
                    to be further lost, or filtered into the smallest proportions, in the sands of
                    the Isthmus, and among the Arabs who commanded the navigation of the Red and
                    Arabian Seas. Venice had already begun to decline in her wars with the Turks,
                    and could inadequately protect her own trade in the Mediterranean. Armed vessels
                    sent out in strength from the Western ports often fared badly at the hands of
                    the pirates. European trade with India can scarcely be said, indeed, to have yet
                    come into existence. The maritime route was round about, and it lay on the
                    hitherto almost untrodden ocean, but the ocean was a safer element than inland
                    seas and deserts infested by the lawlessness and ferocity of hostile tribes of
                    men. In short, the maritime route enabled European traders to see India for
                    themselves, to examine what were its products and its wants, and by what means a
                    profitable exchange on both sides could be established; and on this basis of
                    knowledge, ships could leave the ports of their owners in Europe with a
                    reasonable hope, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> the Cape, of reaching the places to
                    which they were destined without transshipment or other intermediary obstacle.
                    This is the explanation to be given of the joy wdth which the Cape of Good Hope
                    route was received in one age, as well as the immense influence it exerted on
                    the future course and extension of trade, and of the no less apparent
                    satisfaction with which it has been to some extent discarded in favour of the
                    ancient line, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> the Mediterranean, Isthmus of Suez, and
                    the Red Sea in our own time.</p>
                <p>The maritime route to India was the discovery to the European nations of a “new
                    world” quite as much as the discovery of North and South America and their
                    central isthmus and islands. The one was the far, populous Eastern world, heard
                    of from time immemorial, but with which there had been no patent lines of
                    communication. The other was a vast and comparatively unpeopled solitude.</p>

                <p>yet full of material resources, and capable in a high degree of European
                    colonization. America offered less resistance to the action of Europe than
                    India, China, and Japan; but on the other hand this new populous Eastern world
                    held out much attraction to trade. These two great terrestrial discoveries were
                    contemporaneous; and it would be difficult to name any conjuncture of material
                    events bearing so importantly on the history of the world. The Atlantic Ocean
                    was the medium of both; and the waves of the Atlantic beat into all the bays and
                    tidal rivers of Western Europe. The centre of commercial activity was thus
                    physically changed; and the formative power of trade over human affairs was seen
                    in the subsequent phenomena, —the rise of great seaports on the Atlantic
                    seaboard, and the ceaseless activity of geographical exploration, manufactures,
                    shipping, and emigration, of which they became the outlets.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese are entitled to the first place in utilizing the new sources of
                    wealth and commerce. They obtained Macao as a settlement from the Chinese as
                    early as 1537, and their trading operations followed close on the discoveries of
                    their navigators on the coast of Africa, in India, and in the Indian
                    Archipelago. Spain spread her dominion over Central and South America, and
                    forced the labour of the subject natives into the gold and silver mines, which
                    seemed in that age the chief prize of her conquests. France intro duced her
                    trade in both the East and West Indies, and was the first to colonize Canada and
                    the Lower Mississippi. The Dutch founded New York in 1621; and England, which in
                    boldness of naval and commercial enterprize had attained high rank in the reign
                    of Elizabeth, established the thirteen colonies which became the United States,
                    and otherwise had a full share in all the operations which were transforming the
                    state of the world. The original disposi tion of affairs was destined to be much
                    changed by the fortune of war; and success in foreign trade and colonization,
                    indeed, called into play other qualities besides those of naval and military
                    prowess. The products of so many new countries—tissues, dyes, metals, articles
                    of food, chemical substances—greatly extended the range of European manufacture.
                    But in addition to the mercantile faculty of discovering how they were to be
                    exchanged and wrought into a profitable trade, their use in arts and
                    manufactures required skill, invention, and aptitude for manufacturing labour,
                    and these again, in many cases, were found to depend on abundant possession of
                    natural materials, such as coal and iron. In old and populous countries, like
                    India and China, modern manufacture had to meet and contend with ancient
                    manufacture, and had at once to learn from and improve economically on the
                    established models, before an opening could be made for 'its extension. In many
                    parts of the New World there were vast tracts of country, without population or
                    with native races too wild and savage to be reclaimed to habits of industry,
                    whose resources could only be developed by the introduction of colonies of
                    Europeans; and innumerable experiments disclosed great variety of qualification
                    among the European nations for the adventure, hardship, and perseverance of
                    colonial life. There were countries which, whatever their fertility of soil or
                    favour of climate, produced;iothing for which a market could be found; and
                    products such as the sugar-cane and the seed of the cotton plant had to be
                    carried from regions where they were indigenous to other regions where they
                    might be successfully cultivated, and the art of planting had to pass through an
                    ordeal of risk and speculation. There were also countries where no European
                    could labour; and the ominous work of transporting African negroes as slaves
                    into the colonies—begun by Spain in the first decade of the 16th century,
                    followed up by Portugal, and introduced bv England in 1562 into the West Indies,
                    at a later period into New England and the Southern States, and finally
                    domiciled by royal privilege of trade in the Thames and three or more outports
                    of the kingdom,—after being done on an elaborate scale, and made the basis of an
                    immense superstructure of labour, property, aud mercantile interest over nearly
                    three centuries, had, under a more just and ennobling view of humanity, to be as
                    elaborately undone at a future time. These are some of the difficulties that had
                    to be encountered in utilizing the great maritime and geographical conquests of
                    the new epoch. But one cannot leave out of view the obstacles, arising from
                    other sources, to what might be dreamed to be the regular and easy course of
                    affairs. Commerce, though an undying and prevailing interest of civilized
                    countries, is but one of the forces acting on the policy of states, and has
                    often to yield the pace to other elements of national life. It were needless to
                    say what injury the great but vain and purpose less w ars of Louis XIV. of
                    France inflicted on that country, or how largely the fruitful and heroic
                    energies of England were absorbed in the civil wars between Charles and the
                    Parliament, to what poverty Scotland was reduced, or in what distraction and
                    savagery Ireland was kept by the same course of events. The grandeur of Spain in
                    the preceding century was due partly to the claim of her kings to be Holy Roman
                    Emperors, in which imperial capacity they entailed intolerable mischief on the
                    Low Countries and on the commercial civilization of Europe, and partly to their
                    command of the gold and silver mines of Mexico and Peru, in an eager lust of
                    whose produce they brought cruel calamities on a newly-discovered continent
                    where there were many traces of antique life, the records of which perished in
                    their hands or under their feet. These ephemeral causes of greatness removed,
                    the hollowness of the situation was exposed; and Spain, though rich in her own
                    natural resources, was found to be actually poor—poor in number of people, poor
                    in roads, in industrial art, and in all the primary conditions of interior
                    development. An examination of the foreign trade of Europe two centuries after
                    the opening of the maritime route to India and the discovery of America would
                    probably give more reason to be surprised at the smallness than the magnitude of
                    the use that had been made of these events.</p>
                <p>Mr David Macpherson, who published his elaborate <hi rend="italic">Annals oſ
                    Commerce</hi> in 1805, states that in 1764 the total imports of Great Britain
                    amounted in official value to £11,250,660, and the total exports to
                    &lt;£17,446,306.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> The
                    imports and exports of Ireland at this period, and till the Union, formed a
                    separate account, but the great bulk of them were in her trade with England and
                    Scotland. In 1799 the imports of Ireland from all other ports than Great Britain
                    were £1,263,595, and her exports £759,692; while her imports from Great Britain
                    were £4,011,468, and her exports to Great Britain £4,891,161. Foreign markets
                    were found for Irish manufactures through the British ports, and Ireland was
                    supplied with foreign and colonial merchandize through the same channels. In
                    1771 the exports of British linen from England were 4,411,040 yards, and of
                    Irish linen 3,450,224 yards. In the same year the exports of linen from Scotland
                    included 701,012 yards of Irish manufacture.</p></note> He found from the Custom
                    House books that in 1800 the imports had increased to £30,570,004, and the
                    exports to £43,152,019, which he deemed an encouraging amount of progress, as,
                    in view of the events, then deemed peculiarly disastrous, that had occurred in
                    the interval—the loss of the American colonies, the French Revolution, and the
                    wars of Bonaparte—it may, no doubt, be held to be. Of the exports in 1800
                    £24,304,283 were British, and£18,847,735 foreign and colonial merchandize. The
                    proportion of the latter shows to what extent this country had become the medium
                    of trade between Europe and the East and West Indies; but as these re-exports
                    must be deducted from the total imports, there is left only £11,722,269 of
                    imports to <pb break="no"

                    and consumption. At the beginning of the century two-thirds of the foreign
                    commerce of England was through London, and was largely in the hands of
                    privileged companies. The commercial towns of the provinces and of Scotland had
                    only begun to make some figure. In 1787 Liverpool was a small seaport, having
                    only 445 vessels of 72.731 aggregate tonnage, and clearing inward and outward in
                    foreign trade less than double the amount of her own tonnage. At the same period
                    Glasgow, enriched though she had been by the trade with America, had only 46,000
                    inhabitants; and Manchester, though a place of considerable manufacture, was
                    still waiting the great impulse to be given to her industry by liberal supplies
                    of cotton, and by the inventions of Arkwright and Crompton.</p>
                <p>It may be said, however, that in three eventful centuries the world had been well
                    explored. Colonies had been planted on every coast; great nations had sprung up
                    in vast solitudes or in countries inhabited only by savage or decadent races of
                    men; the most haughty and exclusive of ancient nations had opened their ports to
                    foreign merchantmen; and all parts of the world been brought into habitual
                    commercial intercourse. The seas, subdued by the progress of navigation to the
                    service of man, had begun to yield their own riches in great abundance; and the
                    w lιale, seal, herring, cod, and other fisheries, prosecuted with ample capital
                    and hardy seamanship, had. become the source of no small traffic in themselves.
                    The lists of imports and exports and of the places from which they flowed to and
                    from the centres of trade, as they swelled in bulk from time to time, show how
                    busily and steadily the threads of commerce had been weaving together the labour
                    and interests of mankind, and extending a security and bounty of existence
                    unknown in former ages.</p>
                <p>Apart from wars, which commerce directly tends to avert, but which often spring
                    from forces more powerful for the time than commercial interest, there remained
                    little more by which a rapid extension of international trade could be impeded,
                    save causes arising from ignorance or impolicy; and among these deserves chiefly
                    to be noticed the prevailing practice of nations, in promoting their own several
                    industries and trade, to wage a subtle war in times of peace on the industries
                    and trade of each other. That foreign imports, and even domestic exports, should
                    contribute some quota to the public revenue is in itself a reasonable
                    proposition. The custom-house, which has t® register goods coming in and going
                    out, and to exercise an official regulation in the ports, should defray at the
                    least its own expense, like any other necessary mercantile function. The·
                    convenience of raising public revenue by duties on imports and exports is amply
                    evinced by the universal adoption of this expedient; and the convenience will
                    always be materially modified by the more or less crude or scientific form which
                    the system of taxation has assumed, by the financial exigency of states, and by
                    the degree in which other objects than those of revenue have been permitted to
                    enter into the general policy, It has been argued with much plausibility that
                    there are certain stages and conditions of some branches of industry, in which
                    it is politic to protect them against unequal competition in their own markets
                    with the more advanced arts ⅞nd appliances of foreign countries, until they have
                    by this means acquired ability to stand upon their own merits; and this being
                    once admitted, the transition is easy to the general doctrine that, since every
                    nation always finds that there are commodities which other nations can produce
                    much better and cheaper than it can produce them for itself, it is wise and
                    expedient to place the admission of nearly all foreign goods and produce under a
                    custom duty protective of the native industry. The interest of the public
                    revenue is here lost in another line of policy, because protective duties carry
                    the consequence that several parts of a natior have to pay to several other
                    parts more of their own means for what they need than they should have had to
                    pay tc the foreigner, and under a system of this kind the sources of public
                    revenue, so far from being increased, are certain of being impaired. On the
                    other hand, there are imports so entirely of foreign origin, and so free from
                    considerations of competition with domestic industry, that a large revenue may
                    be raised upon them in the custom-house, without disturbing the freedom or
                    equity of international trade. The immense customs revenue of the United Kingdom
                    from duties on tea, coffee, and tobacco (duties on wines and foreign spirits may
                    be excluded since they are set off by excise duties on native liquors) is a
                    remarkable example of the power of levying public revenue in the ports without
                    infringing any commercial or economic principle. The question of tariffs thus
                    appears to be capable of reasonable solution as long as it is kept within the
                    circle of what is permanently expedient to the public revenue. When it passes
                    beyond these bounds it launches into a sea of complicated errors. The idea or
                    self-interest that has force ∙to discourage the imports of foreign commodities
                    by protective duties passes naturally onward to bounties on the export of some
                    favoured articles of domestic produce, under which the same practical result is
                    conversely produced, and one part of the nation has to pay in taxes to the state
                    some proportion of the price necessary to effect a sale abroad of the produce of
                    another part of the nation. When bounties are given, they have to be accompanied
                    with a series of compensations or “drawbacks;” and the confusion has often
                    become so great, as when the export bounty is on the manufactured article and
                    the protective duty on the imported raw material, or as, say, when there is a
                    duty on foreign wo∙l, and woollen goods on export are entitled to a drawback,
                    that the state has been reduced to a dilemma, and anything it did seemed only to
                    make the condition worse. This medley of crosspurposes is increased by the means
                    adopted by parent states on one hand to bolster, on another to monopolize to
                    themselves, the trade of their colonies, and by the elaborate rules of
                    preference and exclusion by which maritime nations have attempted to favour
                    their own ships in the carrying trade of the seas.</p>
                <p>All the mischief of the protective and prohibitory system was exhibited by the
                    Orders in Council of the British Government, and the Berlin and Milan decrees of
                    Bonaparte, fulminated in the passion and fury of war; and if these high acts of
                    power were seen to be not only futile and sublimely ridiculous, but in their aim
                    and effects destructive of all commercial civilization, it would argue little
                    reason on the part of nations to carry out the same objects through the more
                    calm, systematic, and insidious operation of mutually hostile tariffs. Though
                    nothing dies more slowly than the spirit of monopoly in trade, yet from many
                    signs it may be hoped that this obstacle to commerce will gradually disappear
                    like others.</p>
                <p>The present century has witnessed an extension of the commercial relations of
                    mankind of which there is no parallel in previous history. The facts are so well
                    known that it is unnecessary to reproduce them in any detail; and yet it may be
                    useful to indicate, however lightly, the principal phenonema. The heavy debts
                    and taxes, and the currency complications in which the close of the Napoleonic
                    wars left the European nations, as well as the fall of prices which was the
                    necessary effect of the sudden closure of a vast war expenditure and absorption
                    of labour, had a crippling effect for many years on trading energies. Yet even
                    under such circumstances commerce is usually <pb break="no"

                    make steady progress from one series of years to another. The powers of
                    production had been greatly increased by a brilliant development of mechanical
                    arts and inventions. The United States had grown into a commercial nation of the
                    first rank. The European colonies and settlements were being extended, and
                    assiduously cultivated, and were opening larger and more varied markets for
                    manufactures. In 1819 the first steamboat crossed the Atlantic from New York to
                    Liverpool, and a similar adventure was accomplished from England to India in
                    1825—events in themselves the harbingers of a new era in trade. There began also
                    to be signs, in the general prominence given to the study of economic
                    principles, and in the policy of Mr Huskisson in England, of a growing public
                    opinion in favour of greater freedom of trade; and China, after many efforts,
                    was opened under treaty to an intercourse with foreign nations which was soon to
                    attain surprising dimensions. These various causes supported the activity of
                    commerce in the first four decades; but the great movement which has made the
                    century so remarkable was chiefly disclosed in practical results from about
                    1840.</p>
                <p>It has been seen above what the amount of the foreign trade of Great Britain was
                    in the last year of the 18th century. In 1839 the total value of British produce
                    and manufactures exported, then including under the Legislative Union of the
                    Kingdoms Irish produce and manufactures, was £53,233,580; and the total value of
                    imports was £62,048,000, of which £12,796,000 was exported to other countries.
                    The number of vessels belonging to the British empire in 1839, while the
                    navigation laws were still in force, was 27,745, of an aggregate tonnage of
                    3,068,433, and 191,283 men. In 1850 the exports of home produce and manufactures
                    had increased to £71,368,000, and the imports to £100,469,000, of which
                    £21,874,000, was exported. In 1873, which may be taken as the close of the
                    period under review, the declared value of exports of British and Irish produce
                    and manufactures reached the enormous total of £255,073.336, and the imports the
                    still more astonishing total of £370,380,742. In the returns for 1873 the
                    exports of foreign and colonial merchandize are given only in quantities, but in
                    the two succeeding years the value of this branch of export trade is given as
                    £10,251,220 in 1874, when the total imports were £370,054,834, and £12,103,732
                    in 1875, when the total imports were £373,941,125—much less than in 1800, when
                    the official value of re-exports is given as £18,847,735, on a total import of
                    only £30,570,004, indicating, on the one hand, how greatly direct import from
                    the countries of origin to the countries of use must have increased during the
                    century, and, on the other hand, in how much larger proportion our imports of
                    foreign and colonial merchandize had been entered for home consumption. The
                    shipping in 1873, not of the British empire as in 1839, but of the United
                    Kingdom alone, had increased, under repeal of the navigation laws, to 21,581
                    vessels, 5,748,097 tons, and 202,239 men.</p>
                <p>The total value of British and Irish exports in 1873, as compared with 1839,
                    shows an increase of 379 per cent., and of imports an increase of 496 per
                    cent.—an expansion of trade within the third of a century wholly without
                    example. In the years from 1800 to 1839 the increase of domestic exports had
                    been only 119 per cent., and of imports 102 per cent. A larger progressive
                    increase of imports than of exports has been a feature of British commerce for
                    the last twenty years, and would seem to bear out the opinion of economists that
                    this is the result of all prosperous foreign trade, though an excess of imports
                    over exports so large as £120,000,000 per annum cannot possibly be due to the
                    cause which they have usually assigned for it, viz , the profit accruing from
                    the exchange of goods less valuable for goods more valuable in the respective
                    countries, and is probably only accounted for by the large investments of
                    British capital of late years abroad, the interest of which has for the most
                    part to be paid in merchandize.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    discarded criterion of “the balance of trade,” but as a means of exact
                    comparison of one period with another; while, at the same time, they hold valid
                    enough as regards the relative value of the several branches of import and
                    export trade. Official valuation, the rates of which were fixed as far back as
                    1698, was long applied both to imports and exports, till at the close of last
                    century the real or declared value of domestic exports began to be given along
                    with the official value, and the discrepancy of the two—the official value
                    increasing, and the real value declining in proportion to the quantities—gave
                    rise to an opinion that we were always selling more of the products of our
                    industry for less value in exchange, whereas it was the result of the cheapening
                    of production by machines and steam-power, and anything but a proof either of
                    industrial or mercantile loss. The official valuation of imports was much longer
                    adhered to than in the case of exports, till of late years the practice has been
                    to give the real or declared value in both branches of the commerce. It must be
                    admitted, however, to Mr M'Culloch and other authorities, that these returns of
                    value, however near the mark, can never show a balance of trade in the sense
                    once supposed. The value given in the ports cannot exactly correspond with the
                    value realized, since the whole system of trade proceeds on the fact that
                    certain goods and produce are of more value in one country than in another. It
                    was remarked as long ago as 1800 that the export of coffee was much overvalued
                    in the official returns, and if coffee, one would say tea, and</p></note></p>

                <p>These figures speak largely for themselves. The British export of cotton
                    manufactures in 1839 was so great as to cast into the shade every other export,
                    and, though its increase since that period has been wonderful, yet it is
                    gratifying to observe, in the progress of other branches, the greater breadth
                    and variety which the manufacturing industry of the United Kingdom has assumed.
                    The export of cotton goods and yarns in 1839 was nearly a half of our whole
                    export of produce and manufactures. In 1873 they were less than a third. Indeed,
                    if coal and iron, and iron and steel manufactures be put together, they <pb

                    cotton industry, though it must be added that to the extension of the latter
                    there are yet no apparent limits. Many articles of export, which in 1839 were
                    too inconsiderable to be included in a summary of principal articles, and not a
                    few which had not then appeared in the export list, have since risen to a value
                    much exceeding that of some principal articles in 1839; as for example, in 1873
                    alkali and chemical products, £4,676,861; beerand ale, £2,419,575; books,

                    foreign order, of which there is no record in the Board of Trade returns
                    whatever. The imports of the United Kingdom in 1873, besides many new
                    commodities of great aggregate value, such as esparto, guauo, gutta-perçha,
                    hops, jute, oil-seed and oil-seed cakes, petroleum, pyrites, and various
                    chemical substances, present a general increase over the whole range of foreign
                    and colonial merchandize, most marked in raw materials and provisions, of which
                    the chiefly notable example, since they may fitly be embraced in the same
                    category, includes wheat, corn, flour, rice, cattle, sheep, pigs, bacon, butter,
                    cheese, eggs, poultry, potatoes, all manner of farm and dairy produce, the
                    import value of which in 1873 is found to have amounted to £85,036,365.</p>
                <p>This, however marvellous, is indeed but the commerce of our kingdom, but it
                    contains the main current of the commerce of the whole world, and is
                    consequently an example, though a strong and concentrated example, of what has
                    been passing in other mercantile communities. The exports of all nations have
                    not been computed at more than £800,000,000 to £850,000,000. Deducting from the
                    larger sum the British and Irish exports, it follows that more than two-thirds
                    of the exports of all other parts of the world are imported into the United
                    Kingdom. Any permanent increase of trade in so large a centre is impossible
                    without an increase throughout the general sphere, though this increase may be
                    variously distributed. The following statistical results of Professor Levi
                    exhibit in the briefest form where the chief movement has been in the remarkable
                    epoch under consideration, so far as it can be seen through the trade of the
                    United Kingdom.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>most other foreign and colonial produce; but the import of these articles having
                    been valued on the same official scale, this could not affect the proportion
                    either in quantity or value between the re-export and the total import of
                    foreign and colonial merchandize. What is shown by the above figures to have
                    been this proportion then, and what has occurred since so greatly to change the
                    relation of imports and exports, is consistent with what might be predicated on
                    grounds of general reason. It was certain that when Britain was supporting a
                    great war on the Continent, and paying heavy subsidies to European Governments,
                    she would have to send large quantities both of her own produce and her foreign
                    and colonial imports to the countries where she was spending her capital so
                    freely and continuously. It was equally certain that, when this burden was
                    thrown off, when her great debt had been consolidated, and its interest was
                    being paid out of her own resources, and a surplus capital was once more
                    developed, she would use her foreign and colonial merchandize more largely in
                    her own arts, manufactures, and consumption, and that in any lengthened course
                    of such prosperity her imports would begin to exceed her exports instead of the
                    reverse. The excess of British imports over exports, including exports of
                    foreign and colonial merchandize, began to appear in the Board of Trade returns
                    about 1850; and this is coincident with the period within which we have to date
                    an increasing investment of British canital in forρ.ie∙n and colonial
                    securities.</p>

                <p>It is always critical to assign specific causes for commercial results on so vast
                    a scale and over so wide a theatre, for in such cases there must not only have
                    been a long antecedent preparation of means to enable such rapid and gigantic
                    efforts to be made, but it is certain that many economic causes will be found to
                    have been in concurrent operation, eflects themselves becoming causes in turn,
                    and though in apparent conflict, one checking the excess of the other, yet in
                    reality extending and sustaining the general impulse. But three grand
                    characteristics of the period have been adduced with almost common consent as
                    affording an explanation of the phenomena—(1) the adoption of free trade by
                    Great Britain, (2) the Californian and Australian gold discoveries, and (3)
                    steam navigation, railways, telegraphs;—and these may obviously be accepted as
                    the most powerful forces ever brought to bear on the extension of trade in any
                    one age.</p>
                <p>The measures by which Sir Robert Peel introduced this great change in the policy
                    of the United Kingdom were marked by four general objects, merging by practical
                    sequence in the absolute principle of freedom of trade—lst, to remove from the
                    tariff all prohibitions of foreign import, among the chief of which were
                    agricultural live stock, while retaining for a limited period some protective
                    regulation; 2d, to place hundreds of articles of the nature of raw materials of
                    manufacture, and others of less importance, yet useful in the arts, on a footing
                    of entire freedom from customs duty; 3d, to reduce the duties on foreign
                    manufactures which came into competition with home manufactures; and 4th, to
                    repeal the corn laws, admitting foreign grain on a nominal fixed duty, which
                    last involved an equally complete relief to provisions, live stock, agricultural
                    produce of every kind, and to foreign manufactures. When the landlords and
                    farmers were placed in full and direct competition with the world, no class of
                    manufacturers had any excuse left for the slightest shred of protection. All
                    these measures had the appearance more of liberal concessions to foreign nations
                    than of any advantage to home producers , and this is, no doubt, the reason why
                    free trade was so long resisted, and many were unable to see, until the problem
                    was visibly demonstrated, that in liberating commerce, even in developing
                    foreign resources, the most powerful impulse may be given to all the springs of
                    domestic prosperity. The immediate effects in increasing the public revenue—even
                    the customs revenue, which seemed endangered by the abolition of so many
                    duties—in reviving British trade and manufactures, and imparting new life to
                    agriculture itself, were so great that the free trade policy was speedily
                    carried up to its highest points of triumph. The differential duties on foreign
                    and colonial, slave and free labour sugar were removed; and the navigation laws,
                    in favour of which the greatest prejudice had long existed, were fully conformed
                    to the new policy. The expected influence of so successful an illustration of
                    free trade on other nations has not yet been realized to any considerable
                    extent. A more liberal system of' trade with France and other European countries
                    has only been effected by treaty, which, however mutually advantageous in its
                    results, is in its temporary and provisional character more or less
                    unsatisfactory. It was not enough that Great Britain could say to her neighbours
                    that free trade had w orked well not only for herself but for them. There was
                    always the ready retort of the protected interests in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n233/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0233-0206"/> respective countries that what was good for
                    England in her somewhat exceptional condition, might not be good, or might even
                    be impossible, for them; and here the controversy has rested. But it must be
                    allowed to argue a vast deal for the power of free trade that Great Britain, in
                    the face of so many unreciprocal tariffs, has been able to open an effective
                    market in her ports for amounts of foreign goods and produce which thirty years
                    ago would have been deemed fabulous, while at the same time circulating her own
                    commodities in such increasing quantities to all parts of the world. There can
                    be little question that the free commercial policy of this country has been one
                    of the leading springs of the late marvellous extension of international
                    trade.</p>
                <p>The effect of the Californian and Australian gold mines has been compared to that
                    of the silver mines of South America at two periods—when their treasures began
                    to be distributed in Europe, and again when the abundance and cheapness of
                    quicksilver increased their productiveness: —but there is one difference at
                    least, viz., that under the greatly more active life of the present age, as
                    compared with the 16th and 17th centuries, the results ot the Californian and
                    Australian gold discoveries were much more rapidly developed than in the other
                    case, and may be said to have passed and been exhausted under the eyes of a
                    single generation. We should thus be better able to judge the effect of sudden,
                    though, as they prove, always temporary increases of the supplies of the
                    precious metals.</p>
                <p>The two events in question were almost coincident, and they came when a general
                    extension of trade had already been ten years in progress. The first effect was
                    to produce a great emigration to the countries in which the gold-fields were
                    situated, and this was followed by large exports of goods to the same quarters,
                    which, as usually happens when business falls under speculative impulses out of
                    the ordinary mercantile course, were much overdone, and ended eventually in
                    heavy loss to the shippers. Abundance of labour had been supplied to the
                    gold-fields with unwonted celerity, and as the labour was not unremunerative,
                    and in many cases was even rewarded by large findings of gold, the commotion in
                    emigration, traffic, and shipping was sustained for a considerable time, The
                    coffers of the banks of England and France were soon filled with the new
                    supplies of gold, and these imparted increased confidence to banking operations
                    by which they were as soon redistri buted. All this was calculated to give
                    additional impulse and extension to the commercial forces already in motion.
                    There was a new increase of demand for goods; much labour had been transferred
                    from old seats of industry to new fields; and there was rise of wages, and rise
                    of prîtes. But whether the effects would have been different whatever other
                    produce than gold had been the impelling cause may be much doubted. The effect
                    of increased supplies of the precious metals <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> on
                    prices is difficult to trace, and is seldom detected by the keenest analysis,
                    more especially in a period of extending trade and industry, for the precious
                    metals are then more quickly absorbed, and many causes, of which their increased
                    supply is but one and the least, are operating on the value of goods. The
                    Californian and Australian mines remain productive, though in much diminished
                    amount, and their most permanent effect on commerce will probably be found to be
                    that they helped materially to build California into a populous State, which has
                    become one of the largest granaries of wheat in the world, and to make the
                    Australian colonies a growing empire, of such varied resources that its foreign
                    trade, greatly as it had increased in the first ten years of the gold
                    discoveries, continued to increase in the subsequent ten years, when its produce
                    of gold had declined into a subordinate interest.</p>
                <p>Immensely important as the creative and stimulating effect of the free trade of
                    Britain and the Californian and Australian gold discoveries had been, they pale
                    before a mighty service that remains to be noticed, and which, in the prolific
                    force of a world aroused to commerce, they had all the while been carrying
                    forward in their train.</p>
                <p>There is little need of remark in this place on steam ships, railways, and
                    telegraphs—equally marvellous in their power of facilitating commerce and in the
                    rapidity of their construction to this end—beyond a simple indication. The words
                    alone convey what an age we have been living in, and what the international
                    progress in commerce must have been. In 1839 the ocean steamers in the world, if
                    any, could have been counted on one’s fingers. In the United Kingdom alone there
                    are now 1597 steam vessels, of nearly 1000 average tonnage, wholly employed in
                    foreign trade. All the greater maritime states have lines of ocean steamers, and
                    there is scarce any part of the world to which goods and passengers are not
                    carried with the speed, regularity, and capacity which steam-power has given to
                    navigation. That goods might be hauled overland by steam was only deemed
                    possible when George Stephenson opened the first short railway in England in
                    1825. There are now 17,000 miles of railway in the United Kingdom, or one mile
                    of steam-road to every seven square miles of area, carrying both goods and
                    passengers with the ease and celerity of this new system. A similar work has
                    been done in other civilized nations, and over many thousands of miles of
                    comparatively desert tracts of country. The only densely-peopled quarter of the
                    world unknown to railway enterprize is China, and in China a short railway has
                    just been opened from Shanghai to Woosung, amid the curiosity and welcome of the
                    populace. The rapid development of telegraphy is more wonderful even than that
                    of steam ships or railways. Difficult problems of pure science, of science
                    applied to art, and of material manufacture, had to be solved and tested at
                    every step, and all this had to be done with the slightest attractions to
                    capital on the· stock exchange. Yet the telegraph wires have been laid
                    successfully under the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Eastern Seas, and there
                    remain now but few parts of the commercial world to which messages may not be
                    sent and answers received within a few hours. These wondrous and wondrously
                    combined powers of science and mechanism have realized, in the highest form
                    conceivable to the practical mind, the facility of transport and the means of
                    rapid communication and intelligence which commerce had been seeking at infinite
                    distance from the beginning of time, but seeking in vain. Their influence on the
                    interior economy of commonwealths has been no less marked than on the exterior
                    distribution of their products. They are the work of less than half a century,
                    and yet to form them has cost tens of thousands of millions sterling of capital.
                    On whatever side the question is considered, nothing less than marvels are
                    presented to our reason. For supposing these achievements possible, the science,
                    art, and labour prepared and ready, where was the wealth to be found to
                    accomplish them? It may be said that steam ships, railways, and telegraphs have
                    been called into existence by the rising energy and resources of commerce, and
                    it may also be said that at every stage they have created the traffic by which
                    alone they could be sustained and extended.</p>
                <p>The international lending of capital has attained such magnitude, and is so often
                    lost sight of in the study of more visible imports and exports, as to require
                    careful consideration, not only on the part of the immediate lenders and
                    borrowers, but of all who are engaged in foreign trade.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Capital, in its monetary form of transfer, is as much a commodity as the more
                    usual articles of trade; and when a country lends large sums to another country,
                    the same effects are produced on the rates of exchange for the time being, and
                    more protractedly on the general course of import and export, as would be
                    produced by an equivalent amount of goods exported by the borrowing country. The
                    imports of the borrower, during the period of expenditure of the loans, will
                    increase; and the exports, though they may not diminish, will lose in some
                    measure theiι previous proportion to the imports. These are consequences worthy
                    of observation in the general conduct of mercantile business, but they also go
                    farther. The free lending of money from country to country, with its incidents
                    of higher rates of interest, and a certain degree of speculative adventure, is
                    legitimate. By this means the richer parts of the world help to develop the
                    poorer, as well as to increase their own prosperity; and when the debts thus
                    contracted become valid and transferable securities, they are an important
                    element in equalizing exchange where temporarily disturbed. But the extreme
                    looseness with which this branch of commerce is conducted almost exceeds belief.
                    The proceedings of the recent Committee on Foreign Loans have thrown some light
                    on the subject. As long as bankers and financiers of repute put loans on the
                    market without care as to their objects or security, or an exercise of the least
                    mercantile judgment as to the probable effect of the loans on the value of
                    requisite materials, and with the view simply of making some large immediate
                    profit to themselves, and dropping the whole charge and risks, often by
                    deceptive means, into the hands of a helpless public of investors, the most
                    deplorable consequences must ensue. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that
                    in the years 1869-72 the foreign railway and other undertakings thus launched
                    were such as there were not materials in the markets of the whole world to carry
                    through, without an enhancement of values that should not only render the
                    undertakings themselves hopeless, but seriously cripple much well-established
                    trade. In the more solid class of foreign loans, bearing the security of not
                    unprosperous states, it has frequently happened that nearly the whole revenue of
                    the state was derived from customs duties. While the borrowing proceeded, the
                    imports of the state increased, and the revenue flourished, giving a guarantee
                    to the creditors. When the loan had been expended, and the return interest and
                    redemptions had to be paid, the imports suddenly declined, and the revenue
                    security on which the money had been lent disappeared, throwing the states
                    themselves into much commercial embarrassment, in some cases into political
                    convulsions.</p>
                <p>This subject cannot here be further pursued, but its bearings on trade are
                    sufficiently apparent.</p>
                <p>It may be said, in conclusion, that commerce has acquired a security and
                    extension, in all its most essential conditions, of which it was void in any
                    previous age. It can hardly ever again exhibit that wandering course from route
                    to route, and from one solitary centre to another, which is so characteristic of
                    its ancient history, because it is established in every quarter of the globe,
                    and all the seas and ways are open to it on terms fair and equal to every
                    nation. Wherever there is population, industry, resource, art, and skill, there
                    will be international trade. Commerce will have many centres, and one may
                    relatively rise or relatively fall; but such decay and ruin as have smitten many
                    once proud seats of wealth into dust cannot again occur without such cataclysms
                    of war, violence, and disorder as the growing civilization and reason of
                    mankind, and the power of law, right, and common interest forbid us to
                    anticipate. But, with all these advantages, it must not be supposed that the
                    future course of trade is free of difficulty. The very magnitude of commerce now
                    suggests what serious work devolves on all who are engaged in it. If in the
                    older times it was thought that a foreign merchant required to be not only a
                    good man of business, but even a statesman, it is evident that all the higher
                    faculties of the mercantile profession must still more be called into request
                    when imports and exports are reckoned by hundreds instead of fives or tens of
                    millions, when the markets are so much larger and more numerous, the competition
                    so much more keen and varied, the problems to be solved in every course of
                    transaction so much more complex, the whole range of affairs to be overseen so
                    immensely widened. It is not a company of merchants, having a monopoly, and
                    doing whatever they please, whether right or wrong, that now hold the commerce
                    of the world in their hands, but large communities of free merchants in all
                    parts of the world, affiliated to manufacturers and producers equally free, each
                    under strong temptation to do what may be wrong in the pursuit of his own
                    interest, and the only security of doing right being to follow steady lights of
                    information and economic science common to all. The triumphs of commerce and its
                    auxiliaries have been exhibited in the present article. Easy transport of goods
                    by land and sea, prompt intelligence from every point of the compass, general
                    prevalence of mercantile law and safety, have all been accomplished; and the
                    world is opened to trade. But intellectual grasp of principles and details, and
                    the moral integrity which is the root of all commercial success, have to be
                    severely tested in this vaster sphere. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r.</hi> so.)</p>
