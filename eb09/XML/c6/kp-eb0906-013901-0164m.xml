                    dean of St Paul’s, the eldest son of Sir Henry Colet, was born at London in
                    1466. His education commenced in St Anthony’s school in that city, from which,
                    in 1483, he was sent to Magdalen College, Oxford. After seven years’ study of
                    logic and philosophy, he took his degree in arts. About the year 1493 he went to
                    Paris, and thence to Italy, in order to improve himself in the Greek and Latin
                    languages, which at that time were imperfectly taught in our universities.
                    During his residence abroad he became acquainted with Budaeus and Erasmus. On
                    his return to England in 1497 he took orders, and settled at Oxford, where he
                    read lectures, without fee, on the Epistles of St Paul. At this period he held
                    the rectory of St Dennington in Suffolk, to which he had been instituted at the
                    early age of nineteen; and he was also prebendary of York, and canon of St
                    Martin’s le Grand, London. In 1502 he became prebendary of Sarum, in 1505
                    prebendary of St Paul’s, and immediately afterwards dean of that cathedral,
                    having previously taken the degree of doctor of divinity. He was no sooner
                    raised to this dignity than he introduced the practice of preaching and
                    expounding the Scriptures; and he soon afterwards established a perpetual
                    divinity lecture, on three days in each week, in St Paul’s Church,—an
                    institution which helped to pave the way for the Reformation. About the year
                    1508 Dean Colet formed his plan for the foundation of St Paul’s school, which he
                    completed in 1512, and endowed with estates of an annual value of £122 and
                    upwards. The celebrated grammarian William Lilly was the first master, and the
                    company of mercers were appointed trustees. The dean’s religious opinions were
                    so much more liberal than those of the contemporary clergy, that they deemed him
                    little better than a heretic; and on this account he was so frequently molested
                    that he at last determined to spend the rest of his days in peaceful retirement.
                    To carry this resolution into-effect he built a house near the palace of
                    Richmond; but being seized with the sweating sickness, he died in 1519, in the
                    fifty-third year of his age. Pie was buried on the south side of the choir of St
                    Paul’s, where a stone was laid over his grave, with no other inscription than
                    his name. Besides the preferments above mentioned, he was rector of the guild of
                    Jesus at St Paul’s, and chaplain to Henry VIII. Dean Colet, though in communion
                    with the Church of Rome, disapproved of auricular confession, of the celibacy of
                    priests, and other tenets and ceremonies which have since been rejected by all
                    Protestants. He vrote— <hi rend="italic">Absolutissimus</hi><hi rend="italic">de

                    sacred books, together with a number of smaller theological works.</p>
