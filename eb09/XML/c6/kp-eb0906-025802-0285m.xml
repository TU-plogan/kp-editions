                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) They are very few among all the millions of the
                    Chinese people who would not heartily repeat the lines with which the first
                    paragraph in a popular history of the sage concludes :—</p>
                <p>“Confucius! Confucius! How great was Confucius!</p>
                <p>Before him there was no Confucius, Since him there has been no other. Confucius!
                    Confucius! How great was Confucius !”</p>
                <p>The man whose memory is thus cherished by a third portion of the human race, and
                    the stamp of whose character and teachings is still impressed, after so long a
                    time, on the institutions of his country, demands our careful study. In order to
                    understand the events of his life and the influence of his opinions, we must
                    endeavour to get some impression of the China that existed in his time, in the
                    5th and 6th centuries before our Christian era.</p>
                <p>The dynasty of Chow, the third which within historic time had ruled the country,
                    lasting from 1122 to 256 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> had passed its zenith,
                    and its kings no longer held the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0286-0259"/> sceptre with a firm grasp. It must not be
                    supposed that the territory under their sway extended over all the eighteen
                    provinces which now constitute what is called “China proper.” It was not a sixth
                    part of the present empire. On the south it hardly reached half-way from the Ho,
                    or Yellow River, to the Kiang, or Yang-tze. Cheh-kiang, Kiang-si, Hu-nan,
                    Fuh-kien, Kwang-tung, Kwang-si, Kweichow, and the great provinces of Yun-nan,
                    Sze-ch*uen, and Kan-suh on the west, were thinly peopled by barbarous tribes
                    which acknowledged no subjection to “the Middle State.” Ho-nan and Shan-si, with
                    portions of Shen-si, Chih-li, Shan tung, Gan-hwui, Kiang-su, and Hu-pih, were
                    all which formed the dominions of Chow. For thirteen years of his life Confucius
                    wandered about from state to state, seeking rest and patrons; but his
                    journeyings were confined within the modern provinces of Ho-nan and Shantung,
                    and the borders of Chih-li and Hu-pih. Many Europeans now living have travelled
                    over much more of China than he did. The fact helps us to realize the relation
                    of Confucius to his age, and it shows us that he gained his high position
                    through his own unaided powers and the influences of his native country. It has
                    never been hinted, as in the case of his contemporary, the founder of Taoism,
                    that he learned anything from abroad.</p>
                <p>Within this China of the Chow dynasty there might be a population, in Confucius’s
                    time, of from 10,000,000 to 15,000,000. We read frequently, in the classical
                    books, of the “ten thousand states,” in which the people were distributed; but
                    that is merely a grand exaggeration. In what has been called, though
                    erroneously, as we shall see, <hi rend="italic">Confucius's History of his own
                    Times,</hi> we find only 13 states of note, and the number of all the states,
                    large and small, which can be brought together from it, and the much more
                    extensive supplement to it by Tso K <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> iu-ming, not
                    much posterior to the sage, is under 150.</p>
                <p>Chow was a feudal kingdom. The lords of the different territories belonged to
                    five orders of nobility, corresponding closely to the dukes, marquises, earls,
                    counts, and barons of feudal Europe. The theory of the constitution required
                    that the princes, on every fresh succession, should receive investiture from the
                    king, and thereafter appear at his court at stated times. They paid to him
                    annually certain specified tributes, and might be called out with their military
                    levies at any time in his service. A feudal kingdom was sure to be a prey to
                    disorder unless there were energy and ability in the character and
                    administration of the sovereign; and Confucius has sketched, in the work
                    referred to above, the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Lu,</hi> his native state,
                    for 242 years, from 722 to 481 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> which might
                    almost be summed up in the words: “In those days there was no king in China, and
                    every prince did what was right in his own eyes.” In 770 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> a northern horde had plundered the capital, which was then in the
                    present department of Si-gan, Shen-si, and killed the king, whose son withdrew
                    across the Ho and established himself in a new centre, near the present city of
                    Loh-yang in Ho-nan; but from that time the prestige of Chow was gone. Its
                    representatives continued for four centuries and a half with the title of king,
                    but they were less powerful than several of their feudatories. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Annals of Lu,</hi> enlarged by Tso K <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> iu-ming so as to embrace the history of the kingdom generally, are as
                    full of life and interest as the pages of Froissart. Feats of arms, great
                    battles, heroic virtues, devoted friendships, and atrocious crimes make the
                    chronicles of China in the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries before the birth of
                    Christ as attractive as those of France and England in the 14th and some other
                    centuries after it. There was in China in the former period more of literary
                    culture and of many arts of civilization than there was in Europe in the latter.
                    Not only the royal court, but every feudal court, had its historiographers and
                    musicians. Institutions of an educational character abounded. There were ancient
                    histories and poems, and codes of laws, and books of ceremonies. Yet the period
                    was one of wide-spread and ever-increasing suffering and degeneracy. While the
                    general government was feeble, disorganization was at work in each particular
                    state.</p>
                <p>But three things must be kept in mind when we compare feudal China with feudal
                    Europe,—three elements which wrought to give to the former peculiarities of
                    character for which our better acquaintance with the latter will not have
                    prepared us. First, we must take into account the long duration of the time
                    through which the central authority was devoid of vigour. For about five
                    centuries state was left to contend with state, and clan with clan in the
                    several states. The result was chronic misrule, and misery to the masses of the
                    people, with frequent famines. Secondly, we must take into account the
                    institution of polygamy, with the low status assigned to woman, and the many
                    restraints put upon her. In the ancient poems, indeed, there are a few pieces
                    which are true love songs, and express a high appreciation of the virtue of
                    their subjects; but there are many more which tell a different tale. The
                    intrigues, quarrels, murders, and grossnesses that grew out of this social
                    condition it is difficult to conceive, and would be impossible to detail.
                    Thirdly, we must take into account the absence of strong and definite religious
                    beliefs, properly so called, which has always been a characteristic of the
                    Chinese people. We are little troubled, of course, with heresies, and are not
                    shocked by the outbreaks of theological zeal; but where thought as well as
                    action does not reach beyond the limits of earth and time, we do not find man in
                    his best estate. We miss the graces and consolations of faith; we have human
                    efforts and ambitions, but they are unimpregnated with divine impulses and
                    heavenly aspirings.</p>
                <p>Confucius appeared, according to Mencius, one of his most distinguished followers
                    (371-288 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), at a crisis in the nation’s history.
                    “The world,” he says, “had fallen into decay, and right principles had
                    disappeared. Perverse discourses and oppressive deeds were waxen rife. Ministers
                    murdered their rulers, and sons their fathers. Confucius was frightened by what
                    he saw,—and he undertook the work of reformation.”</p>
                <p>The sage was born, according to the historian Sze-ma Ts’in, in the year 550 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> according to Kung-yang and Kuh-liang, two earlier
                    commentators on his <hi rend="italic">Annals of Lu,</hi> in 551; but all three
                    agree in the month and day assigned to his birth, which took place in winter.
                    His clan name was K‘ung, and it need hardly be stated that Confucius is merely
                    the Latinized form of K <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ung Fu-tze, meaning “the
                    philosopher or master K'ung.” He was a native of the state of Lu, a part of the
                    modern Shan-tung, embracing the present department of Yen-chow and other
                    portions of the province. Lu had a great name among the other states of Chow,
                    its marquises being descended from the duke of Chow, the legislator and
                    consolidator of the dynasty which had been founded by his father and brother,
                    the famous kings Wan and Wu. Confucius’s own ancestry is traced up, through the
                    sovereigns of the previous dynasty of Shang, to Hwang-ti, whose figure looms out
                    through the mists of fable in prehistoric times. A scion of the house of Shang,
                    the surname of which was Tze, was invested by King Wu with the dukedom of Sung
                    in the present province of Honan. There, in the Tze line, towards the end of the
                    8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> we find a K <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> ung Kia, whose posterity, according to the rules for the dropping of
                    surnames, became the K'ung clan. He was a high officer of loyalty and probity,
                    and unfortunately for himself had a wife of extraordinary beauty. Hwa Tuh,
                    another high officer of the duchy, that <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0287-0260"/> he might get this lady into his possession,
                    brought about the death of K <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> ung Kia, and was
                    carrying his prize in a carriage to his own palace, when she strangled herself
                    on the way. The K <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ung family, however, became
                    reduced, and by-and-by its chief representative moved from Sung to Lu <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> where in the early part of the 6th century we meet with
                    Shuh-liang Heih, the father of Confucius, as commandant of the district of Tsow,
                    and an officer renowned for his feats of strength and daring.</p>
                <p>There was thus no grander lineage in China than that of Confucius; and on all his
                    progenitors, since the throne of Shang passed from their line, with perhaps one
                    exception, he could look back with complacency. He was the son of Heih’s old
                    age. That officer, when over seventy years, and having already nine daughters
                    and one son, because that son was a cripple, sought an alliance with a gentleman
                    of the Yen clan, who had three daughters. The father submitted to them Heih’s
                    application, saying that, though he was old and austere, he was of most
                    illustrious descent, and they need have no misgivings about him. Ching-tsai, the
                    youngest of the three, observed that it was for their father to decide in the
                    case. “You shall marry him then,” said the father, and accordingly she became
                    the bride of the old man, and in the next year the mother of the sage. It is one
                    of the undesigned coincidences which confirm the credibility of Confucius’s
                    history, that his favourite disciple was a scion of the Yen clan.</p>
                <p>Heih died in the child’s third year, leaving his family in straitened
                    circumstances. Long afterwards, when Confucius was complimented on his
                    acquaintance with many arts, he accounted for it on the ground of the poverty of
                    his youth, which obliged him to acquire a knowledge of matters belonging to a
                    mean condition. When he was five or six, people took notice of his fondness for
                    playing with his companions at setting out sacrifices, and at postures of
                    ceremony. He tells us himself that at fifteen his mind was set on learning; and
                    at nineteen, according to the ancient and modern practice in China, in regard to
                    early unions, he was married,—his wife being from his ancestral state of Sung. A
                    son, the only one, so far as we know, that he ever had, was born in the
                    following year; but he had subsequently two daughters. Immediately after his
                    marriage we find him employed under the chief of the Ki clan to whose
                    jurisdiction the district of Tsow belonged, first as keeper of stores, and then
                    as superintendent of parks and herds. Mencius says that he undertook such mean
                    offices because of his poverty, and distinguished himself by the efficiency with
                    which he discharged them, without any attempt to become rich.</p>
                <p>In his twenty-second year Confucius commenced his labours as a teacher. He did so
                    at first, probably, in a humble way; but a school, not of boys to be taught the
                    elements of learning, but of young and inquiring spirits who wished to be
                    instructed in the principles of right conduct and government, gradually gathered
                    round him. He accepted the substantial aid of his disciples; but he rejected
                    none who could give him even the smallest fee, and he would retain none who did
                    not show earnestness and capacity. “When I have presented,” he said, “one corner
                    of a subject, and the pupil cannot of himself make out the other three, I do not
                    repeat my lesson.”</p>
                <p>Two years after, his mother died, and he buried her in the same grave with his
                    father. Some idea of what his future life was likely to be was already present
                    to his mind. It was not the custom of antiquity to raise any tumulus over
                    graves, but Confucius resolved to innovate in the matter. He would be
                    travelling, he said, to all quarters of the kingdom, and must therefore have a
                    mound by which to recognize his parents’ resting-place. He returned home from
                    the interment alone, having left his disciples to complete this work. They were
                    long in rejoining him, and had then to tell him that they had been detained by a
                    heavy fall of rain, which threw down the first product of their labour. He burst
                    into tears, and exclaimed, “Ah! they did not raise mounds over their graves in
                    antiquity.” His affection for the memory of his mother and dissatisfaction with
                    his own innovation on ancient customs thus blended together; and we can
                    sympathize with his tears. For the regular period of 27 months, commonly spoken
                    of as three years, he observed all the rules of mourning. When they were over he
                    allowed five more days to elapse before he would take his lute, of which he had
                    been devotedly fond, in his hands. He played, but when he tried to sing to the
                    accompaniment of the instrument, his feelings overcame him.</p>
                <p>For some years after this our information about Confucius is scanty. Hints,
                    indeed, occur of his devotion to the study of music and of ancient history; and
                    we can perceive that his character was more and more appreciated by the
                    principal men of Lu. He had passed his thirtieth year when, as he tells us, “he
                    stood firm” in his convictions on all the subjects to the learning of which he
                    had bent his mind fifteen years before. In 517 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    two scions of one of the principal houses in Lu joined the company of his
                    disciples in consequence of the dying command of its chief; and being furnished
                    with the means by the marquis of the state, he made a visit with them to the
                    capital of the kingdom. There he examined the treasures of the royal library,
                    and studied the music which was found in its highest style at the court. There,
                    too, according to Sze-ma Ts <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> in, he had several
                    interviews with Lao-tze, the father of Taoism. It is characteristic of the two
                    men, that the latter, a transcendental dreamer, appears to have thought little
                    of his visitor, while Confucius, an inquiring thinker^ was profoundly impressed
                    with him.</p>
                <p>On his return to Lu, in the same year, that state fell into great disorder. The
                    marquis was worsted in a struggle with his ministers, and fled to the
                    neighbouring state of Ts‘i. Thither also went Confucius, for he would not
                    countenance by his presence the men who had driven their ruler away. He was
                    accompanied by many of his disciples; and as they passed by the T‘ai Mountain,
                    an incident occurred, which may be narrated as a specimen of the way in which he
                    communicated to them his lessons. The attention of the travellers was arrested
                    by a woman weeping and wailing at a grave. The sage stopped, and sent one of his
                    followers to ask the reason of her grief. “My husband’s father” said she, “was
                    killed here by a tiger, and my husband also, and now my son has met the same
                    fate.” Being asked why she did not leave so fatal a spot, she replied that there
                    was there no oppressive government. “Remember this,” said Confucius to his
                    disciples, “remember this, my children, oppressive government is fiercer and
                    more feared than a tiger.”</p>
                <p>He did not find in Ts‘i a home to his liking. The marquis of the state was
                    puzzled how to treat him. The teacher was not a man of rank, and yet the prince
                    felt that he ought to give him more honour than rank could claim. Some
                    counsellors of the court spoke of him as “impracticable and conceited, with a
                    thousand peculiarities.” It was proposed to assign to him a considerable
                    revenue, but he would not accept it while his counsels were not followed.
                    Dissatisfactions ensued, and he went back to Lu.</p>
                <p>There for fifteen more years he continued in private life, prosecuting his
                    studies, and receiving many accessions to his disciples. He had a difficult part
                    to play with the different parties in the state, but he adroitly kept himself
                    aloof from them all; and at last, in his fifty-second year, he was made chief
                    magistrate of the city of Chung-too. A marvellous reformation, we are told,
                    forthwith ensued in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0288-0261"/> the manners of the people , and the marquis, a
                    younger brother of the one that fled to Ts‘i and died there, called him to
                    higher office. He was finally appointed minister of crime,—and there was an end
                    of crime. Two of his disciples at the same time obtained influential positions
                    in the two most powerful clans of the state, and co-operated with him. He
                    signalized his vigour by the punishment of a great officer and in negotiations
                    with the state of Tsſl. He laboured to restore to the marquis his proper
                    authority, and as an important step to that end, to dismantle the fortified
                    cities where the great chiefs of clans maintained themselves like the barons of
                    feudal Europe. For a couple of years he seemed to be master of the situation.
                    “He strengthened the ruler,” it is said, “and repressed the barons. A
                    transforming government went abroad. Dishonesty and dissoluteness hid their
                    heads. Loyalty and good faith became the characteristics of the men, and
                    chastity and docility those of the women. He was the idol of the people, and
                    flew in songs through their mouths.”</p>
                <p>The sky of bright promise was soon overcast. The marquis of Ts*i and his advisers
                    saw that if Confucius were allowed to prosecute his course, the influence of Lu
                    would become supreme throughout the kingdom, and Tsſt would be the first to
                    suffer. A large company of beautiful women, trained in music and dancing, and a
                    troop of fine horses, were sent to Lu. The bait took; the women were welcomed,
                    and the sage was neglected. The marquis forgot the lessons of the master, and
                    yielded supinely to the fascinations of the harem. Confucius felt that he must
                    leave the state. The neglect of the marquis to send round, according to rule,
                    among the ministers portions of the flesh after a great sacrifice, furnished a
                    plausible reason for leaving the court. He withdrew, though very unwillingly and
                    slowly, hoping that a change would come over the marquis and his counsellors,
                    and a message of recall be sent to him. But no such message came; and he went
                    forth in his fifty-sixth year to a weary period of wandering among various
                    states.</p>
                <p>It may be well to pause here in the sketch of his life, and consider what his
                    object and hope had been.</p>
                <p>A disciple once asked him what he would consider the first thing to be done, if
                    intrusted with the government of a state. His reply was, “The rectification of
                    names.” When told that such a thing was wide of the mark, he held to it, and
                    indeed his whole social and political system was wrapped up in the saying. He
                    had told the marquis of Ts <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> i that good government
                    obtained when the ruler was ruler, and the minister minister; when the father
                    was father, and the son son. Society, he considered, was an ordinance of heaven,
                    and was made up of five relationships,— ruler and subject, husband and wife,
                    father and son, elder brothers and younger, and friends. There was rule on the
                    one side of the first four, and submission on the other. The rule should be in
                    righteousness and benevolence; the submission in righteousness and sincerity.
                    Between friends the mutual promotion of virtue should be the guiding principle.
                    It was true that the duties of the several relations were being continually
                    violated by the passions of men, and the social state had become an anarchy. But
                    Confucius had confidence in the preponderating goodness of human nature, and in
                    the power of example in superiors. “Not more surely,” he said, “does the grass
                    bend before the wind than the masses yield to the will of those above them.”
                    Given the model ruler, and the model people would forthwith appear. And he
                    himself could make the model ruler. He could tell the princes of the states what
                    they ought to be; and he could point them to examples of perfect virtue in
                    former times,—to the sage founders of their own dynasty; to the sage T‘ang, who
                    had founded the previous dynasty of Shang; to the sage Yu, who first established
                    a hereditary kingdom in China; and to the greater sages still who lived in a
                    more distant golden age. With his own lessons and those patterns, any ruler of
                    his day, <hi rend="italic">who would listen to him,</hi> might reform and
                    renovate his own state, and his influence would break forth beyond its limits
                    till the face of the whole kingdom should be filled with a multitudinous
                    relation-keeping, well fed, happy people. “If any ruler,” he once said, “would
                    submit to me as his director for twelve months, I should accomplish something
                    considerable; and in three years I should attain the realization of my hopes.”
                    Such were the ideas, the dreams of Confucius. But he had not been able to get
                    the ruler of his native state to listen to him. His sage counsels had melted
                    away before the glance of beauty and the pomps of life.</p>
                <p>His professed disciples amounted to 3000, and among them were between 70 and 80
                    whom he described as “scholars of extraordinary ability.” The most attached of
                    them were seldom long away from him. They stood or sat reverently by his side,
                    watched the minutest particulars of his conduct, studied under his direction the
                    ancient history, poetry, and rites of their country, and treasured up every
                    syllable which dropped from his lips. They have told us how he never shot at a
                    bird perching nor fished with a net, the creatures not having in such a case a
                    fair chance for their lives; how he conducted himself in court and among
                    villagers; how he ate his food, and lay in his bed, and sat in his carriage; how
                    he rose up before the old man and the mourner; how he changed countenance when
                    it thundered, and when he saw a grand display of viands at a feast. He was free
                    and unreserved in his intercourse with them, and was hurt once when they seemed
                    to think that he kept back some of his doctrines from them. Several of them were
                    men of mark among the statesmen of the time, and it is the highest testimony to
                    the character of Confucius that he inspired them with feelings of admiration and
                    reverence. It was they who set the example of speaking of him as the greatest of
                    mortal men; it was they who struck the first notes of that paean which has gone
                    on resounding to the present day.</p>
                <p>Confucius was, it has been seen, in his fifty-sixth year when he left Lu; and
                    thirteen years elapsed ere he returned to it. In this period were comprised his
                    travels among the different states, when he hoped, and ever hoped in vain, to
                    meet with some prince who would accept him as his counsellor, and initiate a
                    government that should become the centre of an universal reformation. Several of
                    the princes were willing to entertain and support him; but for all that he could
                    say, they would not change their ways.</p>
                <p>His first refuge was in Wei, a part of the present Ho-nan, the marquis of which
                    received him kindly; but he was a weak man, ruled by his wife, a woman notorious
                    for her accomplishments and wickedness. In attempting to pass from Wei to
                    another state, Confucius was set upon by a mob, which mistook him for an officer
                    who had made himself hated by his oppressive deeds. He himself was perfectly
                    calm amid the danger, though his followers were filled with alarm. They were
                    obliged, however, to retrace their way to Wei, and he had there to appear before
                    the marchioness, who wished to see how a sage looked. There was a screen between
                    them at the interview, such as the present regent-empresses of China use in
                    giving audience to their ministers; but Tze-lu, one of his principal disciples,
                    was indignant that the master should have demeaned himself to be near such a
                    woman, and to pacify him Confucius swore an oath appealing to Heaven to reject
                    him if he had acted improperly. Soon afterwards he left the state.</p>
                <p>Twice again, during his protracted wanderings, he was placed in imminent peril,
                    but he manifested the same fearlessness, and expressed his confidence in the
                    protection of Heaven till his course should be run. On one of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n289/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0289-0262"/> occasions he and his company were in danger of
                    perishing from want, and the courage of even Tze-lu gave way. “Has the superior
                    man, indeed, to endure in this way I” he asked. “The superior man may have to
                    endure want,” was the reply, “but he is still the superior man. The small man in
                    the same circumstances loses his self-command.”</p>
                <p>While travelling about, Confucius repeatedly came across recluses,—a class of men
                    who had retired from the world in disgust. That there was such a class gives us
                    a striking glimpse into the character of the age. Scholarly, and of good
                    principles, they had given up the conflict with the vices and disorder that
                    prevailed. But they did not understand the sage, and felt a contempt for him
                    struggling on against the tide, and always hoping against hope. We get a fine
                    idea of him from his encounters with them. Once he was looking about for a ford,
                    and sent Tze-lu to ask a man who was at work in a neighbouring field where it
                    was. The man was a recluse, and having found that his questioner was a disciple
                    of Confucius, he said to him: “Disorder in a swelling flood spreads over the
                    kingdom, and no one is able to repress it. Than follow a master who withdraws
                    from one ruler and another that will not take his advice, had you not better
                    follow those who withdraw from the world altogether!” With these words he
                    resumed his hoe, and would give no information about the ford. Tze-lu went back,
                    and reported what the man had said to the master, who observed: “It is
                    impossible to withdraw from the world, and associate with birds and beasts that
                    have no affinity with us. With whom should I associate but with suffering men
                    <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> The disorder that prevails is what requires my efforts.
                    If right principles ruled through the kingdom, there would be no necessity for
                    me to change its state.” We must recognize in those words a brave heart and a
                    noble sympathy. Confucius would not abandon the cause of the people. He would
                    hold on his way to the end. Defeated he might be, but he would be true to his
                    humane and righteous mission.</p>
                <p>It was in his sixty-ninth year, 483 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> that
                    Confucius returned to Lu. One of his disciples, who had remained in the state,
                    had been successful in the command of a military expedition, and told the prime
                    minister that he had learned his skill in war from the master,—urging his
                    recall, and that thereafter mean persons should not be allowed to come between
                    the ruler and him. The state was now in the hands of the son of the marquis
                    whose neglect had driven the sage away; but Confucius would not again take
                    office. Only a few years remained to him, and he devoted them to the completion
                    of his literary tasks, and the delivery of his lessons to his disciples.</p>
                <p>The next year was marked by the death of his son, which he bore with equanimity.
                    His wife had died many years before, and it jars upon us to read how he then
                    commanded the young man to hush his lamentations of sorrow. We like him better
                    when he mourned, as has been related, for his own mother. It is not true,
                    however, as has often been said, that he had divorced his wife before her death.
                    The death of his favourite disciple, Yen Hwui, in 481 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> was more trying to him. Then he wept and mourned beyond what seemed
                    to his other followers the bounds of propriety, exclaiming that Heaven was
                    destroying him. His own last year, 478 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> dawned on
                    him with the tragic end of his next beloved disciple, Tze-lu. Early one morning,
                    we are told, in the fourth month, he got up, and with his hands behind his back,
                    dragging his staff, he moved about his door, crooning over—</p>
                <p>“The great mountain must crumble, The strong beam must break, The wise man must
                    wither away like a plant.”</p>
                <p>Tze-kung heard the words, and hastened to him. The master told him a dream of the
                    previous night, which, he thought, presaged his death. “No intelligent ruler, he
                    said, arises to take me as his master. My time has come to die.” So it was. He
                    took to his bed, and after seven days expired. Such is the account we have of
                    the last days of the sage of China. His end was not unimpressive, but it was
                    melancholy. Disappointed hopes made his soul bitter. No wife nor child was by to
                    do the offices of affection, nor was the expectation of another life with him,
                    when he passed away from among men. He uttered no prayer, and he betrayed no
                    apprehension. Years before, when he was very ill, and Tze-lu asked leave to pray
                    for him, he expressed a doubt whether such a thing might be done, and added, “I
                    have prayed for a long time.” Deep· treasured now in his heart may have been the
                    thought that he had served his generation by the will of God; but he gave no
                    sign.</p>
                <p>When their master thus died, his disciples buried him with great pomp. A
                    multitude of them built huts near his grave, and remained there, mourning as for
                    a father, for nearly three years; and when all the rest were gone, Tze-kung, the
                    last of his favourite three, continued alone by the grave for another period of
                    the same duration. The news of his death went through the states as with an
                    electric thrill. The man who had been neglected when alive seemed to become all
                    at once an object of unbounded admiration. The tide began to flow which has
                    hardly ever ebbed during three-and-twenty centuries.</p>
                <p>The grave of Confucius is in a large rectangle separated from the rest of the K
                    <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ung cemetery, outside the city of K'iuh-fow. A
                    magnificent gate gives admission to a fine avenue, lined with cypress trees and
                    conducting to the tomb, a large and lofty mound, with a marble statue in front,
                    bearing the inscription of the title given to Confucius under the Sung dynasty
                    :—“The most sagely ancient Teacher; the all-accomplished, all-informed King.” A
                    little in front of the tomb, on the left and right, are smaller mounds over the
                    graves of his son and grandson, from the latter of whom we have the remarkable
                    treatise called <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of the Mean.</hi> All over the
                    place are imperial tablets of different dynasties, with glowing tributes to the
                    one man whom China delights to honour; and on the right of the grandson’s mound
                    is a small house said to mark the place of the hut where Tze-kung passed his
                    nearly five years of loving vigil. On the mound grow cypresses, acacias, what is
                    called “the crystal tree,” said not to be elsewhere found, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Achillea,</hi> the plant whose stalks were employed in ancient
                    times for purposes of divination.</p>
                <p>The adjoining city is still the home of the K‘ung family; and there are said to
                    be in it between 40,000 and 50,000 of the descendants of the sage. The present
                    chief of the family is in the line of the 75th generation, and has large estates
                    by imperial gift, with the title of “Duke by imperial appointment and hereditary
                    right, continuator of the sage.” It is thus no empty honour which is still given
                    by the sovereigns of China to Confucius, in the persons of his descendants.</p>
                <p>The dynasty of Chow finally perished two centuries and a quarter after the death
                    of the sage at the hands of tha first historic emperor of the nation,—the first
                    of the dynasty of Ts’in, who swept away the foundations of the feudal system,
                    and laid those of the despotic rule which was subsequently and gradually
                    matured, and continues to the present day. State after state went down before
                    his blows, but the name and followers of Confucius were the chief obstacles in
                    his way. He made an effort to destroy the memory of the sage from off the earth,
                    consigning to the flames all the ancient books from which he drew his rules and
                    examples (save one), and burying alive hundreds of scholars who were ready to
                    swear by his name. But <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n290/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0290-0263"/> Confucius could not be so extinguished. The
                    tyranny of Ts’in was of short duration; and the next dynasty, that of Han, while
                    entering into the new China, found its surest strength in doing honour to his
                    name, and trying to gather up the wreck of the ancient books. It is a great and
                    a difficult undertaking to determine what there was about Confucius to secure
                    for him the influence which he has wielded. Reference has been made to his
                    literary tasks; but the study of them only renders the undertaking more
                    difficult. He left no writings in which he detailed the principles of his moral
                    and social system. <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of the Mean,</hi> by his
                    grandson Tze-sze, and <hi rend="italic">The Great Learning,</hi> by Tsang Sin,
                    the most profound, perhaps, of his disciples, give us the fullest information on
                    that subject, and contain many of his sayings. The <hi rend="italic">Lun
                    Yu,</hi> or Analects, “Discourses and Dialogues,” is a compilation in which many
                    of his disciples must have taken part, and has great value as a record of his
                    ways and utterances; but its chapters are mostly <hi rend="italic">disjecta
                    membra,</hi> affording faint traces of any guiding method or mind. Mencius,
                    Hsiin King, and writers of the Han dynasty, whose works, however, are more or
                    less apocryphal, tell us much about him and his opinions, but all in a loose and
                    unconnected way. No Chinese writer has ever seriously undertaken to compare him
                    with the philosophers and sages of other nations.</p>
                <p>The sage, probably, did not think it necessary to put down many of his own
                    thoughts in writing, for he said of himself that he was “a transmitter, and not
                    a maker.” Nor did he lay claim to have any divine revelations. He was not born,
                    he declared, with knowledge, but was fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking
                    knowledge there. The rule of life for men in all their relations, he held, was
                    to be found within themselves. The right development of that rule, in the
                    ordering not of the individual only, but of society, was to be found in the
                    words and institutions of the ancient sages.</p>
                <p>China, it has already been observed, had a literature before Confucius. All the
                    monuments of it, however, were in danger of perishing through the disorder into
                    which the kingdom had fallen. The feudal system that had subsisted for more than
                    1500 years had become old. Confucius did not see this—did not see how</p>
                <p>“The old order changeth, giving place to new, And God fulfils himself in many
                    ways, Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.”</p>
                <p>It was impossible that in his circumstances he should see it. China was in his
                    eyes drifting from its ancient moorings, drifting on a sea of storms “to hideous
                    ruin and combustion;” and the expedient that occurred to him to arrest the evil
                    was to gather up and preserve the records of antiquity, illustrating and
                    commending them by his own teachings. For this purpose he lectured to his
                    disciples on the histories, poems, and constitutional works of the nation. What
                    he thus did was of inestimable value to his own countrymen, and all other men
                    are indebted to him for what they know of China before his time, though all the
                    contents of the ancient works have not come down to us.</p>
                <p>He wrote, we arè told, a preface to the <hi rend="italic">Shu King,</hi> or Book
                    of Historical Documents. The preface is, in fact, only a schedule, without any
                    remark by Confucius himself, giving the names of 100 books, of which it
                    consisted. Of these we now possess 59, the oldest going back to the 23d century,
                    and the latest dating in the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The
                    credibility of the earlier portions, and the genuineness of several of the
                    documents have been questioned, but the collection as a whole is exceedingly
                    valuable.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Shi King, or</hi> Ancient Poems, as existing in his time,
                    or compiled by him (as generally stated, contrary to the evidence in the case),
                    consisted of 311 pieces, of which we possess 305. The latest of them dates 585
                    years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and the oldest of them ascends perhaps
                    twelve centuries higher. It is the most interesting book of ancient poetry in
                    the world, and many of the pieces are really fine ballads. Confucius was wont to
                    say that he who was not acquainted with the <hi rend="italic">Shi</hi> was not
                    fit to be conversed with, and that the study of it would produce a mind without
                    a single depraved thought. This is nearly all we have from him about the
                    poems.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Li,</hi> or Books of Rites and Ancient Ceremonies and of
                    Institutions, chiefly of the Chow dynasty, have come down to us in a sadly
                    mutilated condition. They are still more than sufficiently voluminous, but they
                    were edited, when recovered under the Han dynasty, with so many additions, that
                    it is hardly worth while to speak of them in connection with Confucius, though
                    much of what was added to them is occupied with his history and sayings.</p>
                <p>Of all the ancient books not one was more prized by him than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Yih King, or “</hi> The Book of Changes,” the rudiments of which
                    are assigned to Fuh-hsi in the 30th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Those
                    rudiments, however, are merely the 8 trigrams and 64 diagrams, composed of a
                    whole and a broken line ( , ), without any text or explanation of them earlier
                    than thè rise of the Chow dynasty. The leather thongs, by which the tablets of
                    Confucius’s copy were tied together, were thrice worn out by his constant
                    handling. He said that if his life were lengthened he would give fifty years to
                    the study of the <hi rend="italic">Yih,</hi> and might then be without great
                    faults. This has come down to us entire. If not intended from the first for
                    purposes of divination, it was so used both before and after Confucius, and on
                    that account it was exempted, through the superstition of the emperor of the
                    Ts’in dynasty, from the flames. It is supposed to give a theory of the phenomena
                    of the physical universe, and of moral and political principles by the trigrams
                    and the different lines and numbers of the diagrams of Fuh-hi. Almost every
                    sentence in it is enigmatic. As now published, there are always subjoined to it
                    certain appendixes, which are ascribed to Confucius himself. Pythagoras and he
                    were contemporaries, and in the fragments of the Samian philosopher about the
                    “elements of numbers as the elements of realities” there is a remarkable analogy
                    with much of the <hi rend="italic">Yih.</hi> No Chinese critic or foreign
                    student of Chinese literature has yet been able to give a satisfactory-account
                    of the book.</p>
                <p>But a greater and more serious difficulty is presented by his last literary
                    labour, the work claimed by him as his own, and which has already been referred
                    to more than once as the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Lu.</hi> Its title is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ch</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >un</hi><hi rend="italic">Ts iu,</hi> or “Spring and Autumn,” the events of
                    every year being digested under the heads of the four seasons, two of which are
                    used by synecdoche for the whole. Mencius held that the composition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chfun</hi><hi rend="italic">Ts</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">iu</hi> was as great a work as Yu’s
                    regulation of the waters of the deluge with which the <hi rend="italic">Shu
                    King</hi> commences, and did for the face of society what the earlier labour did
                    for the face of nature. This work also has been preserved nearly entire, but it
                    is excessively meagre. The events of 242 years barely furnish an hour or two’s
                    reading. Confucius’s annals do not bear a greater proportion to the events which
                    they indicate than the headings in our Bibles bear to the contents of the
                    chapters to which they are prefixed. Happily Tso Kſlu-ming took it in hand to
                    supply those events, incorporating also others with them, and continuing his
                    narratives over some additional years, so that through him the history of China
                    in all its states, from year to year, for more than two centuries and a half,
                    lies bare before us. Tso never challenges the text of the master as being
                    incorrect, yet he does not warp or modify his own narratives to make them square
                    with it; and the astounding fact is, that when we compare the events with the
                    summary of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n291/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0291-0264"/> them, we must pronounce the latter misleading in
                    the extreme. Men are charged with murder who were not guilty of it, and base
                    murders are related as if they had been natural deaths. Villains, over whose
                    fate the reader rejoices, are put down as victims of vile treason, and those who
                    dealt with them as he would have been glad to do are subjected to horrible
                    executions without one word of sympathy. Ignoring, concealing, and
                    misrepresenting are the characteristics of the <hi rend="italic">Spring and
                    Autumn.</hi></p>
                <p>And yet this work is the model for all historical summaries in China. The want of
                    harmony between the facts and the statements about them is patent to all
                    scholars, and it is the knowledge of this, unacknowledged to themselves, which
                    has made the literati, down to the present day, labour with an astonishing
                    amount of fruitless ingenuity and learning to find in individual words, and the
                    turn of every sentence, some mysterious indication of praise or blame. But the
                    majority of them will admit no flaw in the sage or in his annals. His example in
                    the book has been very injurious to his country. One almost wishes that critical
                    reasons could be found for denying its authenticity. Confucius said that “by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Spring and Autumn</hi> men would know him and men would
                    condemn him.” It certainly obliges us to make a large deduction from our
                    estimate of his character and of the beneficial influence which he has exerted.
                    The examination of his literary labours does not on the whole increase our
                    appreciation of him. We get a higher idea of the man from the accounts which his
                    disciples have given us of his intercourse and conversations with them, and the
                    attempts which they made to present his teachings in some systematic form. If he
                    could not arrest the progress of disorder in his country, nor throw out
                    principles which should be helpful in guiding it to a better state under some
                    new constitutional system, he gave important lessons for the formation of
                    individual character, and the manner in which the duties in the relations of
                    society should be discharged.</p>
                <p>Foremost among these we must rank his distinct enunciation of “the golden rule,”
                    deduced by him from his study of mail’s mental constitution. Several times he
                    gave that rule in express words :—“What you do not like when done to yourself do
                    not do to others.” The peculiar nature of the Chinese language enabled him to
                    oxpress this rule by one character, which for want of a better term we may
                    translate in English by “reciprocity.” When the ideagram is looked at, it tells
                    its meaning to the eye,— “a thing seen weightier than a thing heard.” It is
                    composed of two other characters, one denoting “heart,” and the other— itself
                    composite—denoting “as.” Tze-kung once asked if there were any one word which
                    would serve as a rule of practice for all one’s life, and the master replied,
                    yes, naιħ-ing this character (¾S, <hi rend="italic">shu),</hi> the “<hi
                    rend="italic">as</hi><hi rend="italic">lιeartf</hi> my heart, that is, in
                    sympathy with yours; and then he added his usual explanation of it, which has
                    been given above. It has been said that he only gave the rule in a negative
                    form, but he understood it also in its positive and most comprehensive force,
                    and deplored, on one occasion at least, that he had not himself always attained
                    to taking the initiative in doing to others as he would have them do to him.</p>
                <p>Another valuable contribution to ethical and social science was the way in which
                    he inculcated the power of example, and the necessity of benevolence and
                    righteousness in all who were in authority. 1200 years before he was born, an
                    ancient hero and king had proclaimed in China: “The great God has conferred on
                    the people a moral sense, compliance with which would show their nature
                    invariably right. To cause them tranquilly to pursue the course which it
                    indicates is the task of the sovereign.” Confucius knew the utterance well; and
                    he carried out the principle of it, and insisted on its application in all the
                    relations of society. He taught emphatically that a bad man was not fit to rule.
                    As a father or a magistrate, he might wield the instruments of authority, and
                    punish the transgressors of his laws, but no forth-putting of force would
                    countervail the influence of his example. On the other hand, it only needed
                    virtue in the higher position to secure it in the lower. This latter side of his
                    teaching is far from being complete and correct, but the former has, no doubt,
                    been a check on the “powers that be,” both in the family and the state ever
                    since Confucius became the acknowledged sage of his country. It has operated
                    both as a restraint upon evil, and a stimulus to good.</p>
                <p>A few of his more characteristic sayings may here be given, the pith and point of
                    which attest his discrimination of character, and show the tendencies of his
                    views :—</p>
                <p>“What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man seeks is in
                    others.”</p>
                <p>“The superior man is dignified, but does not wrangle; social, but not a partisan.
                    He does not promote a man simply because of his words, nor does he put good
                    words aside because of the man. ’*</p>
                <p>“A poor man who does not flatter, and a rich man who is not proud, are passable
                    characters; but they are not equal to the poor who yet are cheerful, and the
                    rich who yet love the rules of propriety. '</p>
                <p>“Learning, undigested by thought, is labour lost; thought, unassisted by
                    learning, is perilous.”</p>
                <p>“In style all that is required is that it convey the meaning.” “Extravagance
                    leads to insubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be mean
                    than insubordinate.”</p>
                <p>“A man can enlarge his principles; principles do not enlarge the man.” That is,
                    man is greater than any system of thought.</p>
                <p>“The cautious seldom err.”</p>
                <p>Sententious sayings like these have gone far to form the ordinary Chinese
                    character. Hundreds of thousands of the literati can repeat every sentence in
                    the classical books; the masses of the people have scores of the Confucian
                    maxims, and little else of an ethical nature, in their memories,—and with a
                    beneficial result.</p>
                <p>Confucius laid no claim, it has been seen, to divine revelations. Twice or thrice
                    he did vaguely intimate that he had a mission from heaven, and that until it was
                    accomplished he was safe against all attempts to injure him; but his teachings
                    were singularly devoid of reference to anything but what was seen and temporal.
                    Man as he is, and the duties belonging to him in society, were all that he
                    concerned himself about. Man’s nature was from God; the harmonious acting out of
                    it was obedience to the will of God; and the violation of it was disobedience.
                    But in affirming this, there was a striking difference between his language and
                    that of his own ancient models. In the <hi rend="italic">King</hi> the
                    references to the Supreme Being are abundant; there is an exulting awful
                    recognition of Him as the almighty personal Ruler, who orders the course of
                    nature and providence. With Confucius the vague, impersonal term, Heaven, took
                    the place of the divine name. There is no <hi rend="italic">glow</hi> of piety
                    in any of his sentiments. He thought that it was better that men should not
                    occupy themselves with anything but themselves.</p>
                <p>There were, we are told in the <hi rend="italic">Analects,</hi> four things of
                    which he seldom spoke—extraordinary things, feats of strength, rebellious
                    disorder, and spiritual beings. Whatever the institutions cf Chow prescribed
                    about the services to be paid to the spirits of the departed, and to other
                    spirits, he performed reverently, up to the letter; but at the same time, when
                    one of the ministers of Lu asked him what constituted wisdom, he replied: “To
                    give one’s self earnestly to the duties due to men, and while respecting
                    spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them,—that may be called wisdom.”</p>
                <p>But what belief underlay the practice, as ancient as the first foot-prints of
                    history in China, of sacrificing to the spirits of the departed? Confucius would
                    not say. There <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n292/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0292-0265"/> was no need, in his opinion, to trouble the mind
                    about it. “While you cannot serve men,” he replied to the inquiry of Tze-lu,
                    “how can you serve spirits?” And what becomes of a man’s own self, when he has
                    passed from the stage of life? The oracle of Confucius was equally dumb on this
                    question. “While you do not know life,” he said to the same inquirer, “what can
                    you know about death 1” Doubts as to the continued existence of the departed
                    were manifested by many leading men in China before the era of Confucius. In the
                    pages of Tso K*iu-ming, when men are swearing in the heat of passion, they
                    sometimes pause, and rest the validity of their oaths on the proviso that the
                    dead to whom they appeal really exist. The “expressive silence” of Confucius has
                    gone to confirm this scepticism.</p>
                <p>His teaching was thus hardly more than a pure secularism. He had faith in man,
                    man made for society, but he did not care to follow him out of society, nor to
                    present to him motives of conduct derived from the consideration of a future
                    state. Good and evil would be recompensed by the natural issues of conduct
                    within the sphere of time,—if not in the person of the actor, yet in the persons
                    of his descendants. If there were any joys of heaven to reward virtue, or
                    terrors of future retribution to punish vice, the sage took no heed of the one
                    or the other.</p>
                <p>A very remarkable man Confucius was, persistent and condensed, but neither his
                    views nor his character were perfect. In the China then existing he saw terrible
                    evils and disorders, which he set himself, in the benevolence of his heart, to
                    remedy, but of one principal cause of its unhappy condition he had no idea. Near
                    the beginning of this article, the existence of polygamy and the evils flowing
                    from it were referred to. Confucius never appeared to give the subject a
                    thought. We saw how he mourned on the death of his mother; but no generous word
                    ever passed his lips about woman as woman, and apparently no chivalrous
                    sentiment ever kindled in his bosom. Nor had he the idea of any progress or
                    regeneration of society. The stars all shone to him in the heavens behind; none
                    beckoned brightly before. It was no doubt the moral element of his teaching,
                    springing out of his view of human nature, which attracted many of his
                    disciples, and still holds the best part of the Chinese men of learning bound to
                    him; but the conservative tendency of his lessons— nowhere so apparent as in the

                    chief reason why successive dynasties have delighted to do him honour. (j. <hi
