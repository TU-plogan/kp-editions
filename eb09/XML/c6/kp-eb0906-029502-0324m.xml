                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0325-0296"/> year there appeared a volume entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Forest of Fancy by H.</hi><hi rend="italic">C.,</hi> which has
                    been attributed to Henry Chettle, but may with far more probability be assigned
                    to Constable. This is a black-letter romance in prose and verse, of some slight
                    literary value. Until 1592 we lose sight of the poet altogether, but in that
                    year appeared his principal work, the book of sonnets called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diana.</hi> The only sonnets in the Italian form which had preceded them were
                    those of Sidney, printed the year before, and as Constable had been writing
                    those poems for many years he deserves credit as being one of the first to
                    introduce this elegant form of verse among us. His sonnets are not merely
                    quatorzains, like Shakespeare’s; he preserves the exact arrangement of rhymes,
                    except that he usually closes with a couplet. So popular was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diana</hi> that in 1594 a second enlarged edition appeared. But all this time a
                    cloud was gathering round the poet. As a Catholic and a pronounced admirer of
                    the queen of Scots, he came under suspicion of plotting treason against
                    Elizabeth. Almost immediately after ushering Sir Philip Sidney’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Apology for Poetry</hi> into the world with four magnificent
                    sonnets, in 1595, he was obliged, in October of that year, to fly for his life
                    to France. After a short stay in Paris, he wintered at Rouen, and then set off
                    on a long pilgrimage to Rome, Poland, the Low Countries, and Scotland. In 1600
                    we find him still an exile, this time in Spain. About the year 1601 he could
                    endure the growing home-sickness no longer, and returned to England in disguise.
                    He was discovered at once and committed to the Tower, where he languished until
                    1604, when he was released. Of the date of his death we know no more than can be
                    gathered from the fact that he is spoken of as alive in 1606, and as apparently
                    not long dead in 1616. Besides the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> he was the
                    author of four important poems which were printed in the 1600 edition of <hi
                    rend="italic">England's Helicon.</hi> Two of these, the exquisite lyric of
                    “Diaphenia like the Daffadowndilly,” and the charming pastoral song of <hi
                    rend="italic">Venus and Adonis,</hi> hold a prominent place in our early
                    literature,—the latter especially being believed to precede Shakespeare’s epic
                    in date of composition. Some very fine <hi rend="italic">Spiritual Sonnets</hi>
                    of Constable have been printed in our own day, and it is understood that certain
                    compositions of this “ambrosiae muse,” as Ben Jonson styled it, are still
                    awaiting an editor. The style of Constable is fervid and full of colour. Mr
                    Minto has well said that his words flow with happiest impulse “when his whole
                    being is aglow with the rapture of beauty.”</p>
