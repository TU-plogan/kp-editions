                    former containing a large number of fine villas, and the latter devoted
                    specially to manufacturing purposes. The principal buildings are the cathedral,
                    the broletto or town hall, the churches of St Fedele and St Abondio, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Palazzo Giovio,</hi> with its library and collection of
                    antiquities, the Gallio College, and the theatre. The cathedral, erected by the
                    voluntary contributions of the citizens, is a structure of various dates and
                    styles of architecture,—the earliest portions being by Lorenzo de’ Spaziof the
                    end of the 14th century, while the cupola is the work of Guvara, an architect of
                    the first half of the 18th. The most interesting, perhaps, of the monuments
                    which it preserves, is that of Benedetto Giovio, an early historian of the city.
                    The broletto dates from 1215, and is built of alternate courses of black and
                    white marble; but of still greater value as an artistic effort is the church of
                    St Abondio, a small but exquisite structure of the 11th century, built, it would
                    seem, in the lower portions of Roman remains, and remarkable for an “apse of
                    extraordinary height and richness rising between two tall campaniles.” There are
                    extensive factories in Como for the spinning and weaving of silk; it also
                    manufactures woollens, cotton, and soap; and there are iron-works in the
                    immediate vicinity. To its position on the lake and its command of the Splügen
                    and St Gotthard lines of communication, it is indebted for a considerable trade
                    by way <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n247/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0247-0220"/> of transit and distribution. About a mile to the
                    south of the town is the tower of Baradello, famous as the place where the
                    Torriani of Milan were confined in cages by the Visconti party, over whom they
                    had previously tyrannized. The population of Como is 24,350.</p>
                <p>Como is readily identified with the ancient <hi rend="italic">Comum,</hi> a city
                    of Gallic origin, situated within the territory of the Galli Insubres. Though
                    from an early period a flourishing and important centre, it never played a very
                    conspicuous part in ancient history. Soon after the beginning of the 2d century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the people of Comum joined the Insubres in an
                    attack on the Romans; but they were defeated, and their city fell into the hands
                    of the conquerors, and became a Roman colony. The first colonists, however, were
                    unable to maintain themselves against the inroads of the Rhaetian Gauls; and
                    additional settlers were sent down from time to time. Julius Caesar, in
                    particular, introduced 5000, of whom a tenth were Greeks; and the colony assumed
                    for a short time the name of Novum Comum. On the accession of Caesar to supreme
                    power, Comum obtained the complete right of citizenship; but though it was at
                    this time at the height of its prosperity, it never took rank higher than a
                    municipal town. In the early part of the Middle Ages it formed for a time, like
                    many of the towns of Italy, an independent republic; but after a considerable
                    struggle it had to submit to Milan. Its deliverance was effected in 1158 by
                    Frederick I. of Germany, to whom its citizens had appealed; but in the 15th
                    century it again succumbed before the Milanese nobles. In 1520 it was captured
                    by Charles V. During the Roman period the Pliny family were connected with the
                    city; and in more modern times it numbers among its celebrities Paulus Jovius,
                    Piazzi the astronomer, and Volta the electrician. See Cantu, <hi rend="italic"
