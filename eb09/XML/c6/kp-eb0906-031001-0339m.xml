                <p>The mode in which elementary substances combine to form compound substances is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">chemical</hi> constitution of bodies, and is
                    treated of in <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry.</hi></p>
                <p>The mode in which sensible quantities of matter, whether elementary or compound,
                    are aggregated together so as to form a mass having certain observed properties,
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> constitution of bodies.</p>
                <p>Bodies may be classed in relation to their physical constitution by considering
                    the effects of internal stress in changing their dimensions. When a body can
                    exist in equilibrium under the action of a stress which is not uniform in all
                    directions it is said to be solid.</p>
                <p>When a body is such that it cannot be in equilibrium unless the stress at every
                    point is uniform in all directions, it is said to be fluid.</p>
                <p>There are certain fluids, any portion of which, however small, is capable of
                    expanding indefinitely, so as to fill any vessel, however large. These are
                    called gases. There are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n340/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0340-0311"/> ether fluids, a small portion of which, when
                    placed in a large vessel, does not at once expand so as to fill the vessel
                    uniformly, but remains in a collected mass at the bottom, even when the pressure
                    is removed. These fluids are called liquids.</p>
                <p>When a liquid is placed in a vessel so large that it only occupies a part of it,
                    part of the liquid begins to evaporate, or in other words it passes into the
                    state of a gas, and this process goes on either till the whole of the liquid is
                    evaporated, or till the density of the gaseous part of the substance has reached
                    a certain limit. The liquid and the gaseous portions of the substance are then
                    in equilibrium. If the volume of the vessel be now made smaller, part of the gas
                    will be condensed as a liquid, and if it be made larger, part of the liquid will
                    be evaporated as a gas.</p>
                <p>The processes of evaporation and condensation, by which the substance passes from
                    the liquid to the gaseous, and from the gaseous to the liquid state, are
                    discontinuous processes, that is to say, the properties of the substance are
                    very different just before and just after the change has been effected. But this
                    difference is less in all respects the higher the temperature at which the
                    change takes place, and Cagniard de la Tour in 1822<note anchored="true"

                    alcohol, bisulphide of carbon, and water, when heated to a temperature
                    sufficiently high, pass into a state which differs from the ordinary gaseous
                    state as much as from the liquid state. Dr Andrews has since <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> made a complete investigation of the properties of
                    carbonic acid both below and above the temperature at which the phenomena of
                    condensation and evaporation cease to take place, and has thus explored as well
                    as established the continuity of the liquid and gaseous states of matter.</p>
                <p>For carbonic acid at a temperature, say of 0° C., and at the ordinary pressure of
                    the atmosphere, is a gas. If the gas be compressed till the pressure rises to
                    about 40 atmospheres, condensation takes place, that is to say, the substance
                    passes in successive portions from the gaseous to the liquid condition.</p>
                <p>If we examine the substance when part of it is condensed, we find that the liquid
                    carbonic acid at the bottom of the vessel has all the properties of a liquid,
                    and is separated by a distinct surface from the gaseous carbonic acid which
                    occupies the upper part of the vessel.</p>
                <p>But we may transform gaseous carbonic acid at 0 <hi rend="superscript"> θ</hi> C.
                    into liquid carbonic acid at 0° C. without any abrupt change, by first raising
                    the temperature of the gas above 30°.92 C. which is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >critical</hi> temperature, then raising the pressure to about 80 atmospheres,
                    and then cooling the substance, still at high pressure, to zero.</p>
                <p>During the whole of this process the substance remains perfectly homogeneous.
                    There is no surface of separation between two forms of the substance, nor can
                    any sudden change be observed like that which takes place when the gas is
                    condensed into a liquid at low temperatures; but at the end of the process the
                    substance is undoubtedly in the liquid state, for if we now diminish the
                    pressure to somewhat less than 40 atmospheres the substance will exhibit the
                    ordinary distinction between the liquid and the gaseous state, that is to say,
                    part of it will evaporate, leaving the rest at the bottom of the vessel, with a
                    distinct surface of separation between the gaseous and the liquid parts.</p>
                <p>The passage of a substance between the liquid and the solid state takes place
                    with various degrees of abruptness. Some substances, such as some of the more
                    crystalline metals, seem to pass from a completely fluid to a completely solid
                    state very suddenly. In some cases the melted matter appears to become thicker
                    before it solidifies, but this may arise from a multitude of solid crystals
                    being formed in the still liquid mass, so that the consistency of the mass
                    becomes like that of a mixture of sand and water, till the melted matter in
                    which the crystals are swimming becomes all solid.</p>
                <p>There are other substances, most of them colloidal, such that when the melted
                    substance cools it becomes more and more viscous, passing into the solid state
                    with hardly any discontinuity. This is the case with pitch.</p>
                <p>The theory of the consistency of solid bodies will be discussed in the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Elasticity,</hi> but the manner in which a solid behaves
                    when acted on by stress furnishes us with a system of names of different degrees
                    and kinds of solidity,</p>
                <p>A fluid, as we have seen, can support a stress only when it is uniform in all
                    directions, that is to say, when it is of the nature of a hydrostatic
                    pressure.</p>
                <p>There are a great many substances which so far correspond to this definition of a
                    fluid that they cannot remain in permanent equilibrium if the stress within them
                    is not uniform in all directions.</p>
                <p>In all existing fluids, however, when their motion is such that the shape of any
                    small portion is continually changing, the internal stress is not uniform in all
                    directions, but is of such a kind as to tend to check the relative motion of the
                    parts of the fluid.</p>
                <p>This capacity of having inequality of stress called into play by inequality of
                    motion is called viscosity. All real fluids are viscous, from treacle and tar to
                    water and ether and air and hydrogen.</p>
                <p>When the viscosity is very small the fluid is said to be mobile, like water and
                    ether.</p>
                <p>When the viscosity is so great that a considerable inequality of stress, though
                    it produces a continuously increasing displacement, produces it so slowly that
                    we can hardly see it, we are often inclined to cal] the substance a solid, and
                    even a hard solid. Thus the viscosity of cold pitch or of asphalt is so great
                    that the substance will break rather than yield to any sudden blow, and yet if
                    it is left for a sufficient time it will be found unable to remain in
                    equilibrium under the slight inequality of stress produced by its own weight,
                    but will flow like a fluid till its surface becomes level.</p>
                <p>If, therefore, we define a fluid as a substance which cannot remain <hi
                    rend="italic">in permanent equilibrium</hi> under a stress not equal in all
                    directions, we must call these substances fluids, though they are so viscous
                    that we can walk on them without leaving any footprints.</p>
                <p>If a body, after having its form altered· by the application of stress, tends to
                    recover its original form when the stress is removed, the body is said to be
                    elastic.</p>
                <p>The ratio of the numerical value of the stress to the numerical value of the
                    strain produced by it is called the <hi rend="italic">coefficient of
                    elasticity,</hi> and the ratio of the strain to the stress is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">coefficient of pliability.</hi></p>
                <p>There are as many kinds of these coefficients as there are kinds of stress and of
                    strains or components of strains produced by them.</p>
                <p>If, then, the values of the coefficients of elasticity were to increase without
                    limit, the body would approximate tc the condition of a rigid body.</p>
                <p>We may form an elastic body of great pliability by dissolving gelatine or
                    isinglass in hot water and allowing the solution to cool into a jelly. By
                    diminishing the proportion of gelatine the coefficient of elasticity of the
                    jelly may be diminished, so that a very small force is required to produce a
                    large change of form in the substance.</p>
                <p>When the deformation of an elastic body is pushed beyond certain limits depending
                    on the nature of the substance<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n341/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0341-0312"/>, it is found that when the stress is removed it
                    does not return exactly to its original shape, but remains permanently deformed.
                    These limits of the different kinds of strain are called the limits of perfect
                    elasticity.</p>
                <p>There are other limits which may be called the limits of cohesion or of tenacity,
                    such that when the deformation of the body reaches these limits the body breaks,
                    tears asunder, or otherwise gives way, and the continuity of its substance is
                    destroyed»</p>
                <p>A body which can have its form permanently changed without any flaw or break
                    taking place is called <hi rend="italic">mild.</hi> When the force required is
                    small the body is said to be <hi rend="italic">soft;</hi> when it is great the
                    body is said to be <hi rend="italic">tough.</hi> A body which becomes flawed or
                    broken before it can be permanently deformed is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >brittle.</hi> When the force required is great the body is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">hard.</hi></p>
                <p>The stiffness of a body is measured by the force required to produce a given
                    amount of deformation.</p>
                <p>Its strength is measured by the force required to break or crush it.</p>
                <p>We may conceive a solid body to approximate to the condition of a fluid in
                    several différent ways.</p>
                <p>If we knead fine clay with water, the more water we add the softer does the
                    mixture become till at last we have water with particles of clay slowly
                    subsiding through it. This is an instance of a mechanical mixture the
                    constituents of which separate of themselves. But if we mix beeswax with oil, or
                    rosin with turpentine, we may form permanent mixtures of all degrees of
                    softness, and so pass from the solid to the fluid state through all degrees of
                    viscosity.</p>
                <p>We may also begin with an elastic and somewhat brittle substance like gelatine,
                    and add more and more water till we form a very weak jelly which opposes a very
                    feeble resistance to the motion of a solid body, such as a spoon, through it.
                    But even such a weak jelly may not be a true fluid, for it may be able to
                    withstand a very small force, such as the weight of a small mote. If a small
                    mote or seed is enclosed in the jelly, and if its specific gravity is different
                    from that of the jelly, it will tend to rise to the top or sink to the bottom.
                    If it does not do so we conclude that the jelly is not a fluid but a solid body,
                    very weak, indeed, but able to sustain the force with which the mote tends to
                    move.</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that the passage from the solid to the fluid state may be
                    conceived to take place by the diminution without limit either of the
                    coefficient of rigidity, or of the ultimate strength against rupture, as well as
                    by the diminution of the viscosity. But whereas the body is not a true fluid
                    «till the ultimate strength, or the coefficient of rigidity, are reduced to
                    zero, it is not a true solid as long as the viscosity is not infinite.</p>
                <p>Solids, however, which are not viscous in the sense of being capable of an
                    unlimited amount of change of form, are yet subject to alterations depending on
                    the time during which stress has acted on them. In other words, the stress at
                    any given instant depends, not only on the strain at that instant, but on the
                    previous history of the body. Thus the stress is somewhat greater when the
                    strain is increasing than when it is diminishing, and if the strain is continued
                    for a long time, the body, when left to itself, does not at once return to its
                    original shape, but appears to have taken a set, which, however, is not a
                    permanent set, for the body slowly creeps back towards its original shape with a
                    motion which may be observed to go on for hours and even weeks after the body is
                    left to itself.</p>
                <p>Phenomena of this kind were pointed out by Weber and Kohlrausch <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pogg. Ann.</hi> Bd. 54, 119 and 128), and have been described by O. E. Meyer
                    <hi rend="italic">(Pogg. Ann.</hi> Bd. 131, 108), and by Maxwell <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phü. Trans.</hi> 1866, p. 249), and a theory of the phenomena has
                    been proposed by Dr L. Boltzmann <hi rend="italic">(Wiener</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sitzungsberichte,</hi> 8th October 1874).</p>
                <p>The German writers refer to the phenomena by the name of “elastische
                    Nachwirkung,” which might be translated “elastic reaction” if the word reaction
                    were not already used in a different sense. Sir W. Thomson speaks of' the
                    viscosity of elastic bodies.</p>
                <p>The phenomena are most easily observed by twisting a fine wire suspended from a
                    fixed support, and having a small mirror suspended from the lower end, the
                    position of which can be observed in the usual way by means of a telescope and
                    scale. If the lower end of the wire is turned round through an angle not too
                    great, and then left to itself, the mirror makes oscillations, the extent of
                    which may be read off on the scale. These oscillations decay much more rapidly
                    than if the only retarding force were the resistance of the air, showing that
                    the force of torsion in the wire must be greater when the twist is increasing
                    than when it is diminishing. This is the phenomenon described by Sir W. Thomson
                    under the name of the viscosity of elastic solids. But we may also ascertain the
                    middle point of these oscillations, or the point of temporary equilibrium when
                    the oscillations have subsided, and trace the variations of its position.</p>
                <p>If we begin by keeping the wire twisted, say for a minute or an hour, and then
                    leave it to itself, we find that the point of temporary equilibrium is displaced
                    in the direction of twisting, and that this displacement is greater the longer
                    the wire has been kept twisted. But this displacement of the point of
                    equilibrium is not of the nature of a permanent set, for the wire, if left to
                    itself, creeps back towards its original position, but always slower and slower.
                    This slow motion has been observed by the writer going on for more than a week,
                    and he also found that if the wire was set in vibration the motion of the point
                    of equilibrium was more rapid than when the wire was not in vibration.</p>
                <p>We may produce a very complicated series of motions of the lower end of the wire
                    by previously subjecting the wire to a series of twists. For instance, we may
                    first twist it in the positive direction, and keep it twisted for a day, then in
                    the negative direction for an hour, and then in the positive direction for a
                    minute. When the wire is left to itself the displacement, at first positive,
                    becomes negative in a few seconds, and this negative displacement increases for
                    some time. It then diminishes, and the displacement becomes positive, and lasts

                <p>The phenomena are in soïne respects analogous to the variations of the surface
                    temperature of a very large ball of iron which has been heated in a furnace for
                    a day, then placed in melting ice for an hour, then in boiling water for a
                    minute, and then exposed to the air; but a still more perfect analogy may be
                    found in the variations of potential of a Leyden jar which has been chargeçl
                    positively for a day. negatively for an hour, and positively again for a
                    minute.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> See Dr

                <p>The method proposed by Boltzmann for representing such phenomena mathematically
                    is to express the actual stress, L(0, in terms not only of the actual strain,
                    0«), but of the strains to which the body has been subjected during all previous
                    time.</p>

                <p>We may describe this method of deducing the actual state from the previous states
                    as the historical method, because it involves a knowledge of the previous
                    history of the body. But this method may be transformed into another, in which
                    the present state is not regarded as influenced by any state which has ceased to

                <p>This expression of Boltzmann’s, however, is not in any sense a physical theory of
                    the phenomena; it is merely a mathematical formula which, though it represents
                    some of the observed phenomena, fails to express the phenomenon of permanent
                    deformation. Now we know that several substances, such as gutta-percha,
                    India-rubber, àc., may be permanently stretched when cold, and yet when
                    afterwards heated to a certain temperature they recover their original form.
                    Gelatine also may be dried when in a state of strain, and may recover its form
                    by absorbing water.</p>
                <p>We know that the molecules of all bodies are in motion. In gases and liquids the
                    motion is such that there is nothing to prevent any molecule from passing from
                    any part of the mass to any other part; but in solids we must suppose that some,
                    at least, of the molecules merely oscillate about a certain mean position, so
                    that, if we consider a certain group of molecules, its configuration is never
                    very different from a certain stable configuration, about which it
                    oscillates.</p>
                <p>This will be the case even when the solid is in a state of strain, provided the
                    amplitude of the oscillations does not exceed a certain limit, but if it exceeds
                    this limit the group does not tend to return to its former configuration, but
                    begins to oscillate about a new configuration of stability, the strain in which
                    is either zero, or at least less than in the original configuration.</p>
                <p>The condition of this breaking up of a configuration must depend partly on the
                    amplitude of the oscillations, and partly on the amount of strain in the
                    original configuration; and we may suppose that different groups of molecules,
                    even in a homogeneous solid, are not in similar circumstances in this
                    respect.</p>
                <p>Thus we may suppose that in a certain number of groups the ordinary agitation of
                    the molecules is liable to accumulate so much that every now and then the
                    configuration of one of the groups breaks up, and this whether it is in a state
                    of strain or not. We may in this case assume that in every second a certain
                    proportion of these groups break up, and assume configurations corresponding to
                    a strain uniform in all directions.</p>
                <p>If all the groups were of this kind, the medium would be a viscous fluid.</p>
                <p>But we may suppose that there are other groups, the configuration of which is so
                    stable that they will not break up under the ordinary agitation of the.
                    molecules unless the average strain exceeds a certain limit, and this limit may
                    be different for different systems of these groups.</p>
                <p>Now if such groups of greater stability are disseminated through the substance in
                    such abundance as to build up a solid framework, the substance will be a solid,
                    which will not be permanently deformed except by a stress greater than a certain
                    given stress.</p>
                <p>But if the solid also contains groups of smaller stability and also groups of the
                    first kind which break up of themselves, then when a strain is applied the
                    resistance to it will gradually diminish as the groups of the first kind break
                    up, and this will go on till the stress is reduced to that due to the more
                    permanent groups. If the body is now left to itself, it will not at once return
                    to its original form, but will only do so when the groups of the first kind have
                    broken up so often as to get back to their original state of strain.</p>
                <p>This view of the constitution of a solid, as consisting of groups of molecules
                    some of which are in different circumstances from others, also helps to explain
                    the state of the solid after a permanent deformation has been given to it. In
                    this case some of the less stable groups have broken up and assumed new
                    configurations, but it is quite possible that others, more stable, may still
                    retain their original configurations, so that the form of the body is determined
                    by the equilibrium between these two sets of groups; but if, on account βf rise
                    of temperature, increase of moisture, violent vibration, or any other cause, the
                    breaking up of the less stable groups is facilitated, the more stable groups may
                    again assert their sway, and tend to restore the body to the shape it had before
                    its deformation. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> c. Μ.)</p>
