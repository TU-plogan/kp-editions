                    The word “cloister,” though now restricted to the four-sided enclosure,
                    surrounded with covered ambulatories, usually attached to conventual and
                    cathedral churches, and sometimes to colleges, or by a still further limitation
                    to the ambulatories themselves, originally signified the entire monastery. In
                    this sense it is of frequent occurrence in our earlier literature <hi
                    rend="italic">(p.g.,</hi> Shakespeare, <hi rend="italic">Meas, for Meas.,</hi>
                    i. 3, “This day my sister should the <hi rend="italic">cloister</hi> enter”),
                    and is still employed in poetry. The Latin <hi rend="italic">claustrum,</hi> as
                    its derivation implies, primarily denoted no more than the enclosing wall of a
                    religious house, and then came to be used for the whole building enclosed within
                    the wall. To this sense the German “kloster” is still limited, the covered
                    walks, or cloister in the modern sense, being called “kloster-gang,” or
                    “kreuz-gang.” In French, as with us, the word <hi rend="italic">cloître</hi>
                    retains the double sense.</p>
                <p>In the special sense now most common, the word “cloister” denotes the
                    quadrilateral area in a monastery or college of canons, round which the
                    principal buildings are ranged, and which is usually provided with a covered way
                    or ambulatory running all round, and affording a means of communication between
                    the various centres of the ecclesiastical life, without exposure to the weather.
                    According to the Benedictine arrangement, which from its suitability to the
                    requirements of monastic life was generally adopted in the West, one side of the
                    cloister was formed by the church, the refectory occupying the side opposite to
                    it, that the worshippers might have the least annoyance from the noise or smell
                    of the repasts. On the eastern side the chapterhouse was placed, with other
                    apartments belonging to the common life of the brethren adjacent to it, and, as
                    a common rule, the dormitory occupied the whole of the upper story. On the
                    opposite or western side were generally the cellarer’s lodgings, with the
                    cellars and store-houses, in which the provisions necessary for the sustenance
                    of the confraternity were housed. In Cistercian monasteries the western side was
                    usually occupied by the “domus conversorum,” or lodgings of the lay-brethren,
                    with their dayrooms and workshops below, and dormitory above. The cloister, with
                    its surrounding buildings, generally stood ou the south side of the church, to
                    secure as much sunshine as possible. A very early example of this disposition is
                    seen in the plan of the monastery of St Gall <hi rend="smallcaps">(Abbey,</hi>
                    vol. i. p. 12). Local requirements, in some instances, caused the cloister to be
                    placed to the north of the church. This is the case in the English cathedrals,
                    formerly Benedictine abbeys, of Canterbury, Gloucester, and Chester, as well as
                    in that of Lincoln. Other examples of the northward situation are at Tintern,
                    Buildwas, and Sherborne. Although the covered ambulatories are absolutely
                    essential to the completeness of a monastic cloister, a chief object of which
                    was to enable the inmates to pass from one part of the monastery to another
                    without inconvenience from rain, wind, or sun, it appears that they were
                    sometimes wanting. The cloister at St Alban’s seems to have been deficient in
                    ambulatories till the abbacy of Robert of Gorham, 1151- 1166, when the eastern
                    walk was erected. This, as was often the case with the earliest ambulatories,
                    was of wood covered with a pentice roof. We learn from Osbern’s account of the
                    conflagration of the monastery of Christ Church, Canterbury, 1067, that a
                    cloister with covered ways existed at that time, affording communication between
                    the church, the dormitory, and the refectory. We learn from an early drawing of
                    the monastery of Canterbury that this cloister was formed by an arcade of Norman
                    arches supported on shafts, and covered by a shed roof.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0045-0036"/>
                <p>A fragment of an arcaded cloister of this pattern is still found on the eastern
                    side of the infirmary-cloister of the same foundation. This earlier form of
                    cloister has been generally superseded with us by a range of windows, usually
                    unglazed, but sometimes, as at Gloucester, provided with glass, lighting a
                    vaulted ambulatory, of which the cloisters of Westminster Abbey, Salisbury, and
                    Norwich are typical examples. The older design was preserved in the South, where
                    “the cloister is never a window, or anything in the least approaching to it in
                    design, but a range of small elegant pillars, sometimes single, sometimes
                    coupled, and supporting arches of a light and elegant design, all the features
                    being of a character suited to the place where they are used, and to that only”
                    (Fergusson, <hi rend="italic">Hist, of Arch.,</hi> i. p. 610). As examples of
                    this description of cloister, we may refer to the exquisite cloisters of St John
                    Lateran, and St Paul’s without the walls, at Rome, where the coupled shafts and
                    arches are richly ornamented with ribbons of mosaic, and those of the convent of
                    St Scholastica at Subiaco, all of the 13th century, and to the beautiful
                    cloisters at Arles, in southern France, “than which no building in this style,
                    perhaps, has been so often drawn or so much admired” (Fergusson); and those of
                    Aix, Fonti-froide, Elne, &amp;c., are of the same type; as also the Romanesque
                    cloisters at Zurich, where the design suffers from the deep abacus having only a
                    single slender shaft to support it, and at Laach, where the quadrangle occupies
                    the place of the “atrium” of the early basilicas at the west end, as at St
                    Clement’s at Rome, and St Ambrose at Milan. Spain also presents some magnificent
                    cloisters of both types, of which that of the royal convent of Huelgas, near
                    Burgos, of the arcaded form, is, according to Mr Fergusson, “unrivalled for
                    beauty both of detail and design, and is perhaps unsurpassed by anything in its
                    age and style in any part of Europe.” Few cloisters are more beautiful than
                    those of Monreale and Cefalu in Sicily, where the arrangement is the same, of
                    slender columns in pairs with capitals of elaborate foliage supporting pointed
                    arches of great elegance of form.</p>
                <p>All other cloisters are surpassed in dimensions and in sumptuousness of
                    decoration by the “Campo Santo” at Pisa. This magnificent cloister consists of
                    four ambulatories as wide and lofty as the nave of a church, erected in 1278 by
                    Giovanni Pisano round a cemetery composed of soil brought from Palestine by
                    Archbishop Lanfranchi in the middle of the 12 th century. The window openings
                    are semicircular, filled with elaborate tracery in the latter half of the 15th
                    century. The inner walls are covered with frescos invaluable in the history of
                    art by Orgagna, Simone Memmi, Buffalmacco, Benozzo Gozzoli, and other early
                    painters of the Florentine school. The ambulatories now serve as a museum of
                    sculpture. The internal dirtιen-sions are 415 feet 6 inches in length, 137 feet
                    10 inches in breadth, while each ambulatory is 34 feet 6 inches wide by 46 feet
                    high.</p>
                <p>The cloister of a religious house was the scene of a large part of the life of
                    the inmates of a monastery. When not in church, refectory, or dormitory, or
                    engaged in manual labour, the monks were usually to be found here. The north
                    walk of the cloister of St Gall appears to have served as the chapter-house. The
                    cloister was the place of education for the younger members, and of study for
                    the elders. A canon of the Roman council held under Eugenius II., in 826,
                    enjoins the erection of a cloister as an essential portion of an ecclesiastical
                    establishment for the better discipline and instruction of the clerks. Peter of
                    Blois <hi rend="italic">(foerm.</hi> 25) describes schools for the novices as
                    being tn the west walk, and moral lectures delivered in that next the church. At
                    Canterbury the monks’ school was in the western ambulatory, and it was in the
                    same walk that the novices were taught at Durham (ΛVillis, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monastic Buildings of Canterbury,</hi> p. 44; <hi rend="italic">Rites of
                    Durham,</hi> p. 71). The other alleys, especially that next the church, were
                    devoted to the studies of the elder monks. The constitutions of Hildemar and
                    Dunstan enact that between the services of the church the brethren should sit in
                    the cloister and read theology. For this purpose small studies, known as <hi
                    rend="italic">carrols,</hi> from their square shape, were often found in the
                    recesses of the windows. Of this arrangement we have examples at Gloucester,
                    Chester (recently restored), and elsewhere. The use of these studies is thus
                    described in the <hi rend="italic">Rites of Durham :—</hi> “In every wyndowe” in
                    the north alley “were iii pewes or carrells, where every one of the olde monkes
                    had his carrell severally by himselfe, that when they had dyned they dyd resorte
                    to that place of cloister, and there studyed upon their books, every one in his
                    carrell all the afternonne unto evensong tyme. This was there exercise every
                    daie.” On the opposite wall were cupboards full of books for the use of the
                    students in the carrols. The cloister arrangements at Canterbury were similar to
                    those just described. New studies were made by Prior De Estria in 1317, and
                    Prior Selling (1472-94) glazed the south alley for the use of the studious
                    brethren, and constructed “the new framed contrivances, of late styled carrols”
                    (Willis, <hi rend="italic">Mon. Buildings,</hi> p. 45). The cloisters were used
                    not for study only but also for recreation. The constitutions of Archbishop
                    Lanfranc, sect. 3, permitted the brethren to converse together there at certain
                    hours of the day. To maintain necessary discipline a special officer was
                    appointed under the title of <hi rend="italic">prior</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >claustri.</hi> The cloister was always furnished with a stone bench running
                    along the side. It was also provided with a lavatory, usually adjacent to the
                    refectory, but sometimes standing in the central area, termed the
                    cloister-garth, as at Durham. The cloistergarth was used as a place of
                    sepulture, as well as the surrounding alleys. The cloister was in some few
                    instances of two stories, as at Old St Paul’s, and St Stephen’s Chapel,
                    Westminster, and occasionally, as at Wells, Chichester, and Hereford, had only
                    three alleys, there being no ambulatory under the church wall.</p>
                <p>The larger monastic establishments had more than one cloister; there was usually
                    a second connected with the infirmary, of which we have examples at Westminster
                    Abbey and at Canterbury; and sometimes one giving access to the kitchen and
                    other domestic offices.</p>
                <p>The cloister was not an appendage of monastic houses exclusively. We find it also
                    attached to colleges of secular canons, as at the cathedrals of Lincoln,
                    Salisbury, Wells, Hereford, and Chichester, and formerly at St Paul’s and
                    Exeter. It is, however, absent at York, Lichfield, Beverley, Ripon, Southwell,
                    and Wimborne. A cloister forms an essential part of the colleges of Eton and of
                    St Mary’s, Winchester, and New and Magdalen at Oxford, and was designed by
                    Wolsey at Christ Church. These were used for religious processions and lectures,
                    for ambulatories for the studious at all times, and for places of exercise for
                    the inmates generally in wet weather, as well as in some instances for
                    sepulture.</p>
