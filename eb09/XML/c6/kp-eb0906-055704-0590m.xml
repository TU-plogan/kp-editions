                    MOBILIER are finance institutions, which had their origin in the joint-stock
                    speculation and sanguine promotion of public works which marked many years of
                    the second empire in France, and to which the introduction of limited liability
                    in England had given a great stimulus on the British side of the Channel. The
                    parent institutions in Paris were followed by similar establishments in some
                    other capitals. As the terms imply, the credit foncier contemplates loans and
                    advances on real securities, and the crédit mobilier ou what is called with us
                    personal or movable estate. Whether such limits and distinctions have been evei
                    strictly observed in the practical working of these credit banks is doubtful.
                    The credit mobilier of France has had a more unfortunate experience than the
                    credit foncier, though the latter has by no means sustained the promise of its
                    early years. While tho mania of launching new projects continued, enormous
                    profits were made, which could only be the result of heavy promotion charges,
                    and the shares rose in value with tho extraordinary liberality of the dividends.
                    But the system of business pursued had the result of mixing the credit banks
                    very closely with the various companies and undertakings they were promoting,
                    and of throwing back upon them a growing mass of depreciated or unsaleable
                    securities; while the abatement or collapse of speculation restricted the
                    business from which the main part of the former income had been derived. The
                    rates of dividend and the value of the <pb break="no"

                    risen. This has been the practical experience of the crédit foncier and the
                    crédit mobilier of France, which were the first, and remain the greatest
                    examples of the finance companies so named. The credit foncier of England (there
                    has been no credit mobilier in London) has had much the same course as the
                    French companies; large profits for a few years were followed by increasing
                    difficulties, and the locking up of large amounts of capital in hopeless
                    undertakings. The Imperial Land Company of Marseilles has absorbed £260,000, the
                    Santiago and Carril Railway £193,000, and both are failures. The directors in
                    these circumstances have been applying the annual profits to a reserve fund, and
                    addressing themselves to a class of loans and advances on securities differing
                    little from that of ordinary bankers and many finance companies under various
                    names.</p>
