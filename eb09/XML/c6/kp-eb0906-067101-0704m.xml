                    straight lines. Fused metals consolidating in certain favourable conditions
                    appear as similar bodies. And in nature also, in cracks or fissures of the
                    rocks, or imbedded in their mass, minerals resembling these in form are
                    frequently found. These regular polyhedric, or many-sided bodies, whether
                    natural or artificial, are named crystals, and the science naming and describing
                    the fcrms they assume, and pointing out the relations that exist among them, is
                    termed crystallography. In a theoretical point of view this science may be
                    regarded as a branch of mathematics, and might be studied independent altogether
                    of the fact of any material bodies existing in the forms described. Practically,
                    however, its chief interest and value is as a mean of distinguishing many salts,
                    ores, and other substances, either formed artificially or, more especially,
                    occurring naturally as minerals. At present no particular system of
                    crystallography has found general acceptance, and referring for the details of

                    the science, pointing out the more remarkable steps in its progress, the chief
                    general results attained, and some of the best works from which further
                    information in regard to it may be obtained.</p>
                <p>The term crystal, found in most modern European languages, is derived from the
                    Greek word κ∕√σταλλoς, meaning ice or frozen water, and subsequently transferred
                    to pure transparent stones cut into seals, and, as was thought, only produced in
                    the extreme cold of the lofty passes of the Alps. Pliny, who notices this
                    rock-crystal in his <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi> (book xxxvii.),
                    points out clearly enough the hexagonal form of the crystals, remarking that it
                    is not easy to give any reason why they grow in this foιm, more especially as
                    the points have not the same appearance <hi rend="italic">(yo</hi><hi

                    and the polish of the sides is such that no art can equal it. T1 e forms of
                    other minerals are also noticed by him, but the term crystal still had regard to
                    the ice-like transparency and purity of the stone, a reference entirely lost in
                    the modern scientific use of the word.</p>
                <p>It is not wonderful that these bodies, often so remarkable for the beauty of
                    their forms, colours, and other physical properties, attracted considerable
                    attention even in the so-called dark ages. But these notices rather amuse us by
                    their quaint absurdity, as we should now regard it, than throw light on the
                    progress of the science. Thus Albertus Magnus in the middle of the 13th century
                    tells how the <pb break="no"

                    affirming that <hi rend="italic">crystallus</hi> was not ice but rather <hi
                    rend="italic">succus frigore densatus.</hi> Still he indicates some simple forms
                    of crystals, and notes the fissile structure of some stones, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">lapis</hi><hi rend="italic">specularis</hi> (probably gypsum or
                    mica), a property which as cleavage soon exercised much influence. Nicolaus
                    Steno, the Dane, born in 1638 at Copenhagen, but for a time resident at
                    Florence, amidst his well-known studies in anatomy, found leisure also to
                    speculate on questions concerning the structure of the earth aud the nature of
                    gems and precious stones. As his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">solido</hi><hi rend="italic">intra</hi><hi rend="italic">solidum,
                    naturaliter contento,</hi> published in 1669, anticipated in geology some modern
                    speculations and theories subsequently confirmed, so it also contains the germs
                    of important facts in crystallography. It was still the wondrous rock-crystal
                    with the polished sides of the middle prism and the terminal points of the
                    pyramids, joined by the central axis of the crystal, that formed the
                    starting-point of his speculations, and led him to introduce some new notions
                    and terms into the science. How these crystals originated was doubtful, but they
                    evidently grew, not from within like plants, but from without, by the addition
                    of new layers of minute particles carried to the crystal by a fluid, and laid
                    down specially at the ends, as shown by the fine striae that are never wanting
                    on the middle planes. His rejection of extreme cold as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >causa</hi><hi rend="italic">efficiens,</hi> for something similar to magnetic
                    power, is again a suggestive idea, and not less his conclusion that crystals
                    therefore were not formed only at the first beginning of things, but continue to
                    grow even at the present day. Still more important as a step in the progress of
                    the science would be his assertion that the number and length of the sides in
                    the plane of the axis may vary widely without change in the angles <hi
                    rend="italic">(in piano axis,</hi><hi rend="italic">laterum et numerum</hi><hi

                    application than to the case in hand. It was perhaps more a deduction from the
                    mathematical form of the body than a generalization from observed facts. But
                    some of his other descriptions show great powers of observation, and in his
                    notice of the cleavage of calcspar, and its division into other rhomboidal
                    bodies, we have again a fact that in other hands was to bear important
                    fruits.</p>
                <p>Erasmus Bartholinus, another Dane (born 1625, died 1698), made known, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Experimenta Crystalli</hi><hi rend="italic">Islandiçi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">disdiadastid</hi> (1670), another property of the same mineral,
                    very remarkable in itself and its results to science. This was the double
                    refraction of the beautifully transparent variety sent from the Rödefiord in
                    Iceland to Copenhagen. In the same tract, it may be mentioned in passing, occurs
                    the first reference to the blowpipe as a mean of applying heat to minerals. But
                    the optical fact, turning the attention of mathematicians to crystals, had more
                    direct influence on our science. The celebrated Huyghens described the same <hi
                    rend="italic">miranda refractio,</hi> and pointed out its laws; he also measured
                    the angles of the rhomboids with a close approximation to truth, and remarked
                    the occurrence of a less distinct double refraction in quartz— <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">crystallo</hi><hi rend="italic">duplex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">esset refractio.</hi> He likewise observed the peculiar cleavage
                    of calcspar, which he tried to explain by building up the crystals of spheroids.
                    Leeuwenhoek also, in his <hi rend="italic">Arcana Naturae</hi> (1695), mentions
                    cleavage in gypsum and Muscovy glass, and tried to estimate the thickness of the
                    laminae, which Newton in his <hi rend="italic">Optics</hi> in 1706 showed could
                    be calculated from his doctrine of the colour of thin plates. In the same work
                    Newton gives an account of the double refraction of Iceland spar and the laws it
                    follows, and, observing the changes tυ which the rays were subject, asks if
                    these rays of light may not have different sides, with different properties—the
                    first anticipation of the polarization of light, so important in this science.
                    Returning to Leeuwenhoek, we find him showing salts of various forms, growing up
                    in solutions under his microscopes. About this time too Guglielmini in his
                    treatise on these bodies, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Salibus
                    Dissertatio Epistolaris</hi> (1707), tried to prove that they could all be
                    divided into molecules of a few regular forms, and affirms as a consequence that
                    the inclination of the planes and angles is always constant. Ata somewhat
                    earlier period the celebrated Robert Boyle had published a treatise on precious
                    stones, in which he describes many properties of crystals and their peculiar
                    forms which he compares to those of salts. He also pointed out the
                    crystallization of bismuth from fusion by heat—a fact often overlooked by later
                    observers.</p>
                <p>The attention of men of science was now thoroughly directed to the forms and
                    origin of these bodies, and many curious observations might be collected from
                    the writings of De la Hire, Woodward, Cappeller, Henckel, and others. But we
                    pass on to Linnaeus, whose <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Naturae</hi> formed, in this as in other departments of natural science, the
                    commencement of a new period in its history. In his first edition in 1736 he
                    gave a classification which, as he says himself, though far from perfect and
                    often blamed, had enabled others mounted on his shoulders to see wider. Some of
                    these successors he enumerates in the twelfth edition of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >System</hi> (1768)—among them Wallerius, Swab, and Cronstedt. He admits in the
                    preface that he had laid aside the study of stones in which he once delighted,
                    and therefore could not boast of his knowledge of lithology. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lithologia mihi cristas non</hi><hi rend="italic">eriget, lapides</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">en im</hi><hi rend="italic">quos quondam in deliciis habui,
                    tradita demum aliis disciplina, seposui,</hi> are his characteristic words Still
                    there is much that was important in his work. Thus he distinguishes figured
                    stones from those that are amorphous, and notes the difference of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tessellata</hi> or cubical from the <hi rend="italic">prisma</hi>
                    or long columnar and the <hi rend="italic">pyramis</hi> or pointed forms. Then
                    he figures rudely, it may be, and describes some forty common forms of crystals,
                    and gives examples of minerals in which they occur. His table of “<hi
                    rend="italic">Affinitates</hi><hi rend="italic">crystallorum!'</hi> is even more
                    suggestive, and could scarcely fail, if followed out, to lead to further
                    advances. The use he made of these forms as important characters in describing
                    and classifying minerals was well calculated to promote their study. Even the
                    fact that he cut out models in wood of the forms he saw, shows in what a truly
                    practical manner he regarded the subject. His notions regarding the formation of
                    crystals were, however, very imperfect. Salt, he affirms, is the only known
                    natural cause of crystallization, and consequently the forms of the crystals of
                    other substances were determined by the salts in union with them. This is the
                    more remarkable, as he refers to an anonymous author in his own country, to whom
                    he applies the words of Isaac, <hi rend="italic">vox Swabii,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">manus</hi><hi rend="italic">Cronstedti,</hi> as refuting this
                    theory from the fact that crystals of metals were produced by fusion.</p>
                <p>The advanced character of these views of Linnaeus appears more strongly when we
                    contrast them with those of his great rival Buffon. According to him crystals
                    are only a result of organization, so that the prisms of rock crystal, the
                    rhombs of calcspar, the cubes of sea salt, the needles of nitre, and others are
                    produced by the motions of organic molecules, and specially of those derived
                    from the remains of animals and plants found in calcareous masses, and in the
                    layer of vegetable earth covering the surface of the globe. Hence he takes no
                    note of crystallization among the characters of minerals. Very different was the
                    influence of Linnaeus on Romé Delisle (born 1736, died 1790), whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai de Cristallographie</hi> appeared first in 1772, and in an
                    enlarged form in 1783. Working· in the spirit of his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n706/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0706-0673"/> master, he formed a large collection of mineral
                    crystals which he examined with great care, comparing the forms of the faces and
                    measuring the angles. In doing this he soon found that the same mineral assumed
                    various forms,— calcspar, for instance, sometimes that of a six-sided prism, at
                    others of a rhomboid, and fluor-spar in some cases forming cubes, in others
                    octahedrons. In trying to explain this fact, he assumed that in each species
                    there w as a certain original form, generally the most simple he could find,
                    from which all the others might he derived when cut in a particular manner. Thus
                    by cutting off the angles of the cube, it may be converted into an octahedron.
                    Werner in his treatise <hi rend="italic">On the External Character of
                    Minerals</hi> had used the terms truncation, bevelling, acumination <hi
                    rend="italic">(Abstumpfung, Zuschärfung, Zuspitzung)</hi> for similar changes on
                    the fundamental forms, but Delisle probably had no knowledge of this fact, and
                    in other respects could borrow little from Werner, who in crystallography scarce
                    went beyond Linnaeus. The progress Delisle made in the ten years between his
                    first and second work <hi rend="italic">(Cristallographie ou</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Description des formes</hi><hi rend="italic">propre à tous les
                    corps du règne minéral,</hi> 1783) is truly remarkable. He now affirms in clear
                    and distinct terms “that amidst all the innumerable variations of which the
                    primitive form of a salt or crystal is susceptible, there is one thing that
                    never varies and remains constantly the same in each species,—that is, the angle
                    of incidence, or the respective inclination of the faces to each other.” Hence
                    these angles are truly characteristic of each species, but only of the primitive
                    forms, from which others, which he names secondary, are derived by various
                    modifications. Of these principal primitive forms he assumes six; but these are
                    less skilfully chosen and, as now seen, not always truly distinct. But many
                    defects were compensated for by the great labour he expended on figuring and his
                    superior accuracy in measuring crystals. This he was able to secure by the use
                    of the goniometer recently invented by Carangeau, the new instrument, as it
                    were, transforming the science. Then his observation of twin crystals, or
                    macles, as he named them,—which he showed were characterized by their
                    re-entering angles as made up of two crystals, or two halves of one crystal, in
                    a reversed position,—was also a noteworthy step. How much he accomplished may be
                    judged from the fact that he gives figures of more than 500 regular forms, in
                    place of the forty described by Linnaeus. He had probably carried his system as
                    far as it could go, and not merely familiarized the forms of crystals to
                    mineralogists, but also suggested the possible connections that might exist
                    among them.</p>
                <p>Delisle seems to have assigned little value to cleavage, and in his preface
                    speaks contemptuously of the crystal-loclastes <hi rend="italic"
                    >{brise-cristaux)</hi> as innovators in the science. But even earlier, in 1773,
                    Bergman, the well-known Swedish chemist, had shown its importance, and used this
                    peculiar structure to explain the relations of the different forms of crystals
                    observed in the same mineral. Starting from the rhombohedron of calcspar, he
                    placed it with the chief axis upright, and then building up other similar rhombs
                    on it, formed a six-sided prism with rhombic ends. By stopping at a certain
                    stage, it became a dodecahedron, or body with twelve rhombic faces, which he
                    assumed, not quite accurately, to be the same as that proper to garnet. Again,
                    placing this garnet-form in proper position and adding other rhombs, he showed
                    how it easily changed into another characteristic of the hyacinth <hi

                    crystals were produced. But he did not proceed far in the direction thus
                    indicated, and deeper views, with more accurate facts and measurements, were
                    required before this could be done.</p>
                <p>These were found in the works of Réné Just Haüy (born 1743, died 1822), who seems
                    to have been led almost by accident to his theory. Curiously it is still the
                    same mineral that with him, as with so many of his predecessors, forms the
                    starting-point. When looking over the cabinet of Citizen Defrance a hexahedral
                    prism of calcspar was accidentally broken from a group to which it belonged, and
                    given him in a present. This crystal showed at the base, where it had been
                    detached, a broken corner with the peculiar brilliant lustre, “poli de la
                    Nature,” of the cleavage faces. Haüy’s attention was arrested by the fact, and
                    he tried to obtain similar faces on other corners, but he only succeeded on the
                    three alternate edges at each end of the prism. Continuing the process further,
                    he found that he could remove slice after slice, till no vestige of the original
                    prism was left, but in place of it a rhomboid perfectly similar to the Iceland
                    spar and lying in the middle of the prism. The fact struck him with surprise,
                    mingled with the hope that it was not isolated, and this, he says, served to
                    “develop my ideas regarding the structure of crystals, and has been, as it were,
                    the key of the theory” <hi rend="italic">(et a été comme la</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">clef</hi><hi rend="italic">de la théorie).</hi> Following it out
                    on differently formed crystals of this mineral he found they could all be
                    reduced to a similar internal nucleus. But when the mineral was distinct the
                    nucleus had a different form. Thus in fluor-spar the nucleus was an octahedron;
                    in heavy spar a right prism with rhombic bases; in galena, or sulphate of lead,
                    a cube; and so of other substances. In each also these forms were constant,
                    relative to the entire species, so that its angles were subject to no
                    appreciable variation. Even where crystals cannot be thus mechanically divided,
                    Haüy stated that theory aided by certain indications might serve to discover the
                    primitive form.</p>
                <p>On these and other similar facts, Haüy erected his celebrated theory of the
                    structure of crystals. In each mineral there exists what he calls its integrant
                    molecules,—solid bodies incapable of further division and of invariable form,
                    with faces parallel to the natural joints indicated by the mechanical division
                    of the crystals, and with angles and dimensions given by calculation and
                    observation combined. These molecules are marked in different species by
                    distinct and determinate forms, except in a few regular bodies, such as the
                    cube, which do not admit of variations. From these primitive or integrant
                    molecules all the various crystals found in each species are built up according
                    to certain definite laws, and thus the secondary crystals, as he names them, are
                    produced. Of primitive forms only six were known from observation. These were
                    the parallelepiped, the octahedron, the tetrahedron, the regular hexahedral
                    prism, the dodecahedron with equal and similar rhombic faces, and the
                    dodecahedron with triangular faces, consisting of two regular six-sided pyramids
                    joined base to base. In order to produce those secondary crystals which covered
                    over the primitive form, so as to disguise it in so many different ways, he
                    supposed the enveloping matter to be made up of a series of laminae, each
                    decreasing in extent either equally in all directions, or only at certain parts.
                    This decrease takes place by the regular subtraction of one or several ranges of
                    integrant molecules in each successive layer; and theory, determining by
                    calculation the number of these ranges, can represent all the known results of
                    crystallization, and even anticipate discoveries, and indicate hypothetical
                    forms which may one day reward the research of naturalists. He thus claims for
                    his theory that greatest proof of its truth and value which a scientific theory
                    can present,—the power to anticipate observation and to foretell future
                    discoveries. As an example of this process Haüy showed how by applying
                    successive layers of integrant molecules, each less by one row all round, to the
                    faces of the primitive cube, a rhombic dodecahedron was necessarily formed. In
                    other cases he assumed that the decrease was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n707/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0707-0674"/> not parallel to the edges, but took the angles as
                    its point of departure, and thus was parallel to a diagonal. In the case above
                    supposed the decrease took place by two ranges in breadth for one in height or
                    thickness, but other less simple ratios might be supposed, as of two in breadth
                    to, three in height, and to these the name mixed decrements were given. There
                    were other possible modes of decrease also distinguished, to which it is
                    needless now to refer. But by these and other modes of procedure Haüy showed how
                    the various secondary crystals could arise from his assumed primitive forms or
                    molecules.</p>
                <p>The great advance secured by this theory of Haüy’s was the firm establishment of
                    the idea that the forms of crystals were not irregular or capricious, but
                    definite and based on fixed and ascertainable laws. Hence he showed that, whilst
                    certain secondary forms may be deduced from a given nucleus, there are other
                    forms that cannot occur. Further he pointed out what he named “the law of
                    symmetry,” in consequence of which, when any change of a crystal form took place
                    by its combination with other forms, all similar parts—angles, edges, faces—were
                    modified in the same way at the same time. AU these changes too, he said, could
                    be indicated by rational coefficients or commensurable numbers.</p>
                <p>A not less important principle, which Haüy endeavoured to establish, was the
                    intimate relation of the crystalline form to the chemical composition of
                    minerals, so that even prior to analysis the real diversity of species formerly
                    conjoined might be inferred from differences in the angles. As an example of
                    this may be mentioned his discovery of the difference of the angles in crystals
                    classed together as “heavy spar,” a difference only explained when Vauquelin
                    showed that those with the larger angle from Sicily contained the new earth
                    strontia, discovered by Klaproth, instead of the baryta found in those from
                    Derbyshire. The modifications which this view has had to undergo from wider
                    observations will be noticed afterwards, but even its enunciation by Haüy formed
                    a great stimulus to research both as to the forms and the composition of
                    minerals. Taken in connection with the perspicuous and elegant style of his
                    work, its clear arrangement and full illustration by figures, its influence on
                    the progress of the science may be readily understood. Many deficiencies in his
                    system are now easily seen, and some of the most fatal were soon brought to
                    light by the very stimulus his works gave to the science.</p>
                <p>Thus one of the first to criticise the system was Weiss, who translated Haüy’s
                    work into German in 1804.. He not only pointed out that the primitive forms
                    erred both in excess and defect, but struck deeper at the theory by showing that
                    the integrant molecules might better be entirely laid aside. They were not
                    wanted to explain the observed facts, and the so-called planes built up of them
                    would not reflect the light. Bernhardi, a medical man in Erfurt, attacked the
                    theory from other points of view. Thus he objected to the prisms which Haüy had
                    chosen as primitive forms that their dimensions could not be determined from
                    themselves, their height depending on another form, and therefore that
                    octahedrons or double pyramids were preferable. Then he showed that various
                    crystals were more readily explained from other forms than those taken as their
                    primaries by Haüy, and that in the regular formsit wasquite indifferent whether
                    the cube or regular octahedron was chosen, whilst among the irregular forms
                    other divisions might be established, more conformable to nature. It is needless
                    to specify further criticisms on Haüy’s theory, as its very merits soon led to
                    its being replaced by more profound views. Thus the importance it ascribed to
                    the angles of the faces and cleavages of crystals for the true determination of
                    minerals formed a strong motive for their more accurate determination. The
                    discovery also of the reflecting goniometer in 1809 by Wollaston (born 1766,
                    died 1829) enabled this to be done with a degree of accuracy previously
                    impossible. The writings of Dr Wollaston himself, of Mr Brooke, and especially
                    the <hi rend="italic">Introduction to Mineralogy</hi> (1816) of William Phillips
                    (born 1773, died 1828) were specially rich in material of this kind. The
                    influence of this accumulation of facts was shown less in the correction of
                    Haüy’s data than in the necessity it involved of some new and more workable
                    theory for connecting the facts than that adopted by the French
                    mineralogist.</p>
                <p>For this science is chiefly indebted to Weiss, already mentioned as the
                    translater and critic of Haüy’s great work. Born at Leipsic in 1780, and
                    educated in its university, where he began to teach in 1803, he inaugurated his
                    appointment as ordinary professor of physics in 1808 by the publication the
                    following year of a dissertation, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >indagando formarum crystallinarum charactere geometrico principali.</hi> In
                    this he pointed out for the first time the importance of the axes of crystals,
                    to which, however, Haüy had referred. “The axis,” he says, “is truly the line
                    governing every figure <hi rend="italic">(omnis</hi><hi rend="italic">figurae
                    dominatrix)</hi> round which the whole is uniformly disposed. All the parts look
                    to it, and by it they are bound together as by a common chain and mutual
                    contact.” But the axes are not mere geometric lines physically dead and
                    powerless. It is in reference to them that the forces work which have formed the
                    crystals. Hence the importance of the inclination of the faces to the axes as
                    characterizing forms, and the simpler numbers by which the relations of these
                    faces might be expressed. He further points out various distinctions in the
                    forms of crystals, in which his followers have traced the germs of the systems
                    of crystallization he subsequently established. This was done in his memoir,
                    “Uebersichtliche Darstellung der verschiedenen natürlichen Abtheilungen der
                    Krystallisa-tionssysteme,” published in 1815 in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions of the Academy of Berlin,</hi> to which city he had been
                    transferred in 1820. In this memoir the terms regular system, four-membered
                    system, two-and-two-membered system, and others afterwards used first appear. In
                    other memoirs in the same series, of which the more important were those on the
                    crystallization of felspar, epidote, gypsum, and quartz, his views were more
                    fully developed. Along with these views of the general relations of crystals
                    Weiss also introduced important improvements in the mode of designating the
                    faces of crystals, so as to render it more easy to calculate their angles. Haüy
                    had already done this in conformity to his theory of decrements, but the
                    expressions were complex and the numbers large. But here as elsewhere, Weiss
                    says, the mechanical atomistio views by which Haüy was led must be laid aside,
                    in order to allow the ascertained knowledge of the mathematical laws and
                    relations of crystalline structure to come out purely. Leaving out of view,
                    therefore, the supposed primitive forms, and looking only to vzhat was above and
                    beyond them, Weiss referred all to the essential relations of the axes or the
                    co-ordinates of the faces, and thus gave at once far more precision and
                    simplicity to the symbols, and facilitated the necessary calculations.</p>
                <p>It often happens in periods of intellectual activity that several inquirers are
                    engaged on the same subject, and, following it out in similar directions, come
                    to results that more or less coincide. Such seems to have been so far true in
                    regard to crystallography, and these discoveries of Weiss have been claimed for
                    Mohs. Born in the Hartz in 1773, he studied at Halle, turning his attention
                    specially to mining. Tn 1812 he became professor in Grätz, and in 1818 succeeded
                    Werner in Freiberg, which a few years later he left for Vienna, where he taught
                    with great success. He died in 1839. The dates of their publications leave no
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n708/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0708-0675"/> doubt that Weiss preceded him in promulgating
                    these new views, but also show that Mohs wrought them out in a more systematic
                    form, and made them more generally known. In 1820 he published his <hi

                    >sternes,</hi> followed in 1822 by his <hi rend="italic">Grundriss der
                    Mineralogie.</hi> Both these treatises were translated into English, the second
                    by the well-known Haidinger, then residing in Edinburgh. The clearness and
                    precision with which he marked out and defined the various terms and new ideas
                    required, and followed out the laws regulating combinations, had a great effect
                    in giving a wider currency to his writings. The thorough mode in which he traced
                    out the <hi rend="italic">series</hi> of forms in the systems and explained
                    these also added to their popularity. Professor Jameson too gave it a higher
                    authority and wider acceptance, describing it “as eminently distinguished by its
                    originality and simplicity.” Its success was further promoted by the remarkable
                    discovery made about the same time by Sir David (then Dr) Brewster. In
                    connection with his observations on the polarization of light, this
                    distinguished optician had endeavoured to point out the connection between
                    Haüy’s nuclei or primitive forms of crystals and the number of their axes of
                    double refraction, and even shown that Haüy had in some cases chosen erroneous
                    forms, as they did not agree with their optical characters. The appearance of
                    Mohs’s views threw unexpected light on the fact, as his system of
                    crystallography harmonized in a most remarkable manner with the arrangement
                    proposed on optical grounds. In reality, as now well known, all minerals
                    crystallizing in the regular system of Weiss and Mohs with equal and uniform
                    axes show only single refraction; those belonging to the two and one axial and
                    three and one axial systems &lt;f Weiss, the pyramidal and rhombohedral of Mohs,
                    have double refraction with only one optical axis; whilst those in the three
                    other systems show double refraction and two optical axes. As Whewell has well
                    remarked, “Sir D. Brewster’s optical experiments must have led to a
                    classification of crystals into the above systems, or something nearly
                    equivalent, even if the crystals had not been so arranged by attention to their
                    forms.”</p>
                <p>The establishment of this system, whether due to Weiss or Mohs, or in part to
                    both, gave to crystallography as a pure science essentially its present form.
                    Taken in connection with the law that the indices marking the relative
                    dimensions of the parameters are always rational numbers, and seldom large, with
                    the symmetry of forms, and the grouping of the faces in zones, we have the
                    leading principles on which it depends. The subsequent progress of the science
                    has been rather directed to working out and completing the structure, and
                    showing the mutual relations of its essential principles, than to modifying the
                    foundations on which it rests. These researches have taken two chief directions,
                    the one explaining the geometrical properties of crystals, and the systems under
                    which in consequence of these properties they necessarily fall to be classed,
                    while the second has regard to the physical properties of crystals, that is, of
                    the various bodies, especially the native minerals, assuming these forms. Before
                    noticing these we must refer to another point in which Haüy’s views were also
                    about the same time remarkably modified and extended.</p>
                <p>Haüy, we have seen, maintained that a very close connection always existed
                    between the crystalline character and the chemical composition of minerals, so
                    that from diversity in the angular measurement of two crystals we might infer a
                    difference in their chemical composition, or tho reverse. More accurate analyses
                    soon showed that this law had not that universal application which Haüy assumed,
                    and even in 1815 Fuchs had pointed out that certain elements were what he named
                    vicarious, so that in compounds a certain amount of one could replace so much of
                    some other. The remarkable theories and researches of Berzelius soon rendered
                    some change in this respect inevitable, and it was carried out by the discovery
                    of isomorphism by his pupil Mitscherlich in 1822. The subject, however, belongs
                    less to crystallography than to chemistry or mineralogy, and we can only mention
                    the general principle. Mitscherlich showed that there are certain substances
                    which crystallize in forms closely resembling each other, and with tho
                    corresponding angles only differing by one or two degrees, or even less. Thus
                    the carbonates of iron and manganese, or lime and magnesia, agree nearly in form
                    and dimensions. Such substances were named isomorphous, and were found to have
                    the tendency to replace or be substituted for each other in compound bodies,
                    with very slight modification of the forms or angles of the crystals. Though at
                    first denied by Haüy and his followers, this truth is now fully established, and
                    has had vast influence in the determination and classification of minerals. As
                    modifying the same conclusion of Haüy, but in an opposite direction, we must
                    also mention Mitscherlich’s further discovery of dimorphism, according to which
                    the same element (as sulphur), or the same compound (as carbonate of lime), when
                    crystallizing under different conditions, especially as regards temperature, may
                    assume two distinct forms of crystals belonging even to different systems.
                    Instances are even known of trimorphism and polymorphism, in which the same
                    substance may occur in three or more forms of crystallization.</p>
                <p>The mode of formation of crystals, and the powers that are active in their
                    formation, were, as we have seen, favourite subjects of speculation with the
                    earlier writers on crystallography, and are closely connected with the chemical
                    composition of minerals to which we have just referred. This subject continues
                    to attract many inquirers, and has given occasion to some remarkable
                    speculations; but it can hardly be affirmed that much progress has been made in
                    this direction. Crystals may still be seen, as in the time of Leeuwenhoek,
                    springing out of solutions under the microscope, and continuingto increase
                    insize, butthe powers that are active escape our notice, and we are still left
                    almost in the same region of speculation as our predecessors. Such discussions,
                    in truth, concern ratner the general constitution of matter than the special
                    corner whose history we have been following, so that the words of Brewster still
                    hold true :—“In whatever way crystallographers shall succeed in accounting for
                    the various secondary forms of crystals, they are then only on the threshold of
                    their subject. The real constitution of crystals would be still unknown; and
                    though the examination of these bodies has been pretty diligently pursued, we
                    can at this moment form no adequate idea of the complex and beautiful
                    organization of these apparently simple bodies.”</p>
                <p>Returning to the more special subject of pure or geometric crystallography, one
                    great object of recent inquiry has been to discover some method of designating
                    the forms or faces of crystals by numbers or symbols, that would at once point
                    out their general relations to each other, and facilitate the calculation of
                    their angles so as to check or control observation. Haüy had already attempted
                    to do this in his great work, by means of his theory of decrements, but his
                    materials were still too imperfect, and his symbols are often very complex.
                    Still the weight of his name retains great influence in France, where a system
                    founded on his, but modified by the more recent views, prevails. It is generally
                    associated with the name of Armand Lévy (born 1794, died 1841), who in 1837
                    published an important w ork on Mr Heuland’s collection <hi rend="italic"

                    forms, and designates the faces, angles, and edges by letters, as was done by
                    Haüy. This system is adopted and explained by Dufrénoy in bis <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traité de Minéralogie</hi> (Paris, 1844-56), and by Des Cloizeaux in bis <hi

                <p>In Germany also various methods have appeared. Weiss himself only published
                    special papers, but his views have been wrought out by several of his many
                    followers. Thus one of his favourite pupils, F. E. Neumann, in his
                    “Contributions” <hi rend="italic">(Beiträge zur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Krystallonomie)</hi> in 1823, showed how crystals might be represented not so
                    much by the faces as by their normals, that is, by lines drawn from the centre
                    of the system vertical to the faces. Cleavage, he says, and the reflection of
                    light, &amp;c., all indicate a force acting vertical to the faces, or in the
                    normal. He further brought clearly out the arrangement of the faces in zones,
                    and showed how they could be represented to the eye either by lines on a plain
                    surface, or by great circles on the circumscribing sphere. Quenstedt of
                    Tübingen, another pupil of Weiss, made known a similar method in 1835, which he
                    has since illustrated in his <hi rend="italic">Methode</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >der</hi><hi rend="italic">Krystallographie</hi> in 1840, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mineralogie,</hi> 1855 (2d ed. 1863), and more fully in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Grundriss der bestimmenden und rechnenden Krystallographie,</hi>
                    1873. The truest representative of Weiss, however, is generally regarded as
                    Gustaf Rose, who laid the foundation of his reputation by his account of the
                    “crystallization of sphene and titanite” in 1820. His <hi rend="italic">Elemente
                    der</hi><hi rend="italic">Krystallographie</hi> first appeared at Berlin in
                    1833, and in a third edition in 1873.</p>
                <p>Mohs’s method was expounded in his works already noticed, and became better known
                    in Britain by Haidinger’s translation of his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on
                    Mineralogy,</hi> published at Edinburgh in 1825; and is further explained in
                    Mohs’s <hi rend="italic">Anfangsgründe der Naturgeschichte des
                    Mineralreichs</hi> (1832, 2d edition by Zippe, 1839). Haidinger, besides many
                    memoirs, has also published a separate work in which the method is fully
                    explained <hi rend="italic">(Handbuch der bestimmenden Mineralogie,</hi> 1845).
                    But wider success and more general adoption has attended the method of Dr Carl
                    Naumann, in which the faces are represented by means of their co-ordinates, and
                    thus in an easily understood form. Born in 1797, Naumann began his studies under
                    Werner, and completed them under Mohs, and has been regarded as carrying out the
                    system of his teacher, whilst trying to mediate between him and Weiss. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Lehrbuch der reinen und angewandten Krystallographie</hi> appeared
                    in 1830; his <hi rend="italic">Anfangsgründae der Krystallographie</hi> in 1841,
                    2d edition, 1855, and his <hi rend="italic">Theoretische Krystallographie</hi>
                    in 1856. His <hi rend="italic">Elemente der Mineralogie,</hi> first published in
                    1846, and of which a ninth edition appeared in 1874, has still further extended
                    his method and nomenclature. His system, occasionally in slightly altered form,
                    has wide prevalence in Germany, and has been introduced into this country in
                    Nicol’s <hi rend="italic">Mineralogy,</hi> 1849, and in the article on <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mineralogy</hi> in the eighth edition of the present work. Dana
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Mineralogy,</hi> 1854, has given it wide currency in
                    America; he has endeavoured to simplify the mode of representing the faces.
                    Another method, which in Germany in great measure divides the field with
                    Naumann’s, may be said to <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> have had its origin in
                    Britain. In 1825 Dr. Whewell published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> a memoir on “A General Method of Calculating the Angles of
                    Crystals,” in which he referred only to Haüy’s views, and in 1826 another “On
                    the Classification of Crystalline Combinations,” founded on the methods of Weiss
                    and Mohs, especially of the latter, with which he had in the meantime become
                    acquainted. The author himself states that his method had little value as a
                    method of calculating the angles of crystals. But in 1839 Professor Miller of
                    Cambridge, partly adopting his views, and partly aiding himself by the
                    suggestions of Neumann and of Grassmann, who, without any knowledge of what his
                    predecessor had done, had re-invented the method of representing the position of
                    the faces of crystals by corresponding points on the surface of a circumscribing
                    sphere, brought out his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Crystallography.</hi> In
                    his edition of Phillips’s <hi rend="italic">Mineralogy,</hi> 1852, the same
                    system was also employed. In Germany this system has found many followers, and
                    is used in several of the best text-books, among which may be mentioned the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lehrbuch der</hi><hi rend="italic">Krystallographie</hi> of
                    Karsten, 1861, and the works with the same title of Von Lang, 1866, and Dr A.
                    Schrauf, 1866.</p>
                <p>The relative merit of the methods mentioned cannot be discussed in this place.
                    The system of Naumann is, perhaps, the one now most generally prevalent, and
                    most easily understood by beginners, as giving the most graphic picture of the
                    various forms and their combinations. Miller’s system, on the other hand, is
                    regarded as better adapted for the various calculations needed in the higher
                    portions of the science, and is therefore often preferred by those who make a
                    special study of the subject. How closely their merits are balanced is shown by
                    the fact that Groth, in his recent valuable work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physikalische</hi><hi rend="italic">Krystallographie,</hi> Leipsic, 1876,
                    whilst preferring Naumann’s, deems it necessary to explain Miller’s also to his
                    readers, and to give a comparative table of the symbols employed, by Naumann,
                    Miller, and Lévy, so that the one may be, as it were, translated into the other.
                    Similar tables may also be found in Des Cloizeaux’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mineralogie</hi> and in Schrauf’s <hi rend="italic">Atlas.</hi></p>
                <p>Many very interesting facts have also been recently ascertained, showing the
                    intimate relation that exists between the various physical properties of
                    crystals and their crystallographic characters, proving very distinctly that the
                    systems of crystals are not mere artificial arrangements of speculative men, but
                    have a real foundation in the structure of the bodies observed. We saw already
                    how Brewster proved this connection in reference to their optical properties. He
                    continued his researches on this subject for many years, and it was also pursued
                    by many of his contemporaries, among whom Biot, Sir John Herschel, and Haidinger
                    may be named. More recently the stauroscope, invented by Von Kobell, and the
                    polarizing microscope of Nörremberg have proved valuable aids in investigating
                    these properties. In France Μ. des Cloizeaux has specially directed attention to
                    the optical properties of crystals and their value in mineralogy <hi
                    rend="italic">(Del'</hi><hi rend="italic">emploi des propriétés optiques
                    biréfringentes en Minéralogie,</hi> 1857, and <hi rend="italic">Sur l'emploi du
                    microscope,</hi> in 1864), and in his <hi rend="italic">Mamiel de
                    Minéralogie</hi> records many remarkable observations made both by himself and
                    others. In Britain and in Germany these investigations have recently been
                    conjoined with the examination with the microscope of thin slices of minerals
                    and rocks. The method of preparing such transparent sections was first described
                    by William Nicol of Edinburgh, to whom is also due the discovery in 1828 of the
                    peculiar prisms of Iceland or calcareous spar which are now known by his name,
                    and which form an almost indispensable part of apparatus for such researches. It
                    is scarcely possible to avoid noticing the important influence which this one
                    mineral with its marked properties has had on the progress of the science whose
                    history we are describing. In this country a new impulse was given to the study
                    by Mr Sorby’s memoir “On the Microscopical Structure of Crystals,” published in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Geological Society</hi> in 1848. In Germany
                    the workers in this field are so numerous that we cannot specialize individuals,
                    but shall only refer to the works of Zirkel <hi rend="italic">(Mikroskopische
                    Gesteinsstudien,</hi> 1863, <hi rend="italic">Mikroskopische Beschaffenheiten
                    der Mineralien,</hi> 1873, &amp;c.), Schrauf <hi rend="italic">(Lehrbuch der

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0710-0677"/><hi rend="italic">Mineralien,</hi> 1873), both for
                    further information on the subject generally, and for lists of the more
                    important recent publications. How valuable it has become may be seen from the
                    fact that these transparent sections, examined between two Nicol’s prisms, from
                    the phenomena of the interference of light, readily enable the observer to
                    determine to which of the six systems of crystallization the mineral interposed
                    belongs, and thus to fix one of its most essential characters. In this way the
                    exact composition of many fine-grained crystalline rocks can be determined, and
                    much light thrown on their history.</p>
                <p>In regard to the other physical properties of crystals, it must suffice to say
                    that they all indicate a similar close dependence on their geometric character.
                    The same systems shown by their mathematical forms and optic properties reappear
                    in reference to their relations to heat, magnetism, electricity, and other
                    properties. The regular or tesseral minerals, with simple refraction of light,
                    are shown by Senarmont’s researches also to conduct heat uniformly in all
                    directions, and their magnetic and electric peculiarities, are similar. The
                    tetragonal and hexagonal crystals with one chief axis, as they show double
                    refraction of light with a single optic axis, have also analogous modes of
                    conducting heat, of expanding under its influence, and of transmitting magnetism
                    and electricity. And again, the three other systems with unequal axes, as they
                    show two optic axes, exhibit also corresponding peculiarities in respect to the
                    other properties mentioned. In this we have a remarkable instance of connection
                    of the various physical sciences, and a strong proof of the sound basis that
                    crystallography attained by the discoveries of Weiss and Mohs.</p>
                <p>A great deal has been recently done in improving the instruments employed in
                    determining the forms and dimensions of crystals. Though for first and rough
                    approximations to the angles the early form of the hand goniometer may still be
                    used, even the reflecting goniometer of Wollaston no longer meets the
                    requirements of modern accuracy. In 1820 the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin
                    offered a prize for the best methods of measuring these angles, which was gained
                    by Dr Kupffer. Malus added a telescope to Wollaston’s goniometer, and other
                    methods of increasing its accuracy have been proposed, as by Babinet and
                    Mitscherlich. Frankenheim, Haidinger, and others have also endeavoured to
                    perfect the methods or means of observation which now, as tested by comparison
                    with the results of calculation, seem fully adequate to the wants at least of
                    determinative mineralogy.</p>
                <p>The forms of crystals that occur in native minerals are described more or less

                    Schrauf, 1865-1873, is intended to form a complete collection of all the forms
                    observed in the mineral kingdom,—estimated as exceeding 10,000 in number,
                    described in very many separate treatises and memoirs, and every day becoming
                    more numerous. The arrangement is alphabetical, and the work, from its accuracy
                    and rich material, is highly valuable but still unfinished. The forms of salts
                    and artificial crystals are described in Rammelsberg’s <hi rend="italic"
