                    priest to make confession of sins to God in the name of the whole people.
                    Besides this general confession, the Jews were enjoined, as a first principle of
                    their religion, to confess their sins individually to God. Herein, indeed, lay
                    one marked and leading feature of difference between their creed and that of the
                    heathen around them. The Jew was taught to regard his Maker as a merciful God,
                    who forgives sin (Mic. vii. 18, 19; Isa. lvii. 16-19). While, however, the
                    contrite heart was insisted on as the all-important element on man’s part,
                    outward signs of humiliation were valued as tokens and manifestations of the
                    inward sentiment, as is seen in such cases as those of David, Ahab, and the
                    captives who returned from Babylon (2 Sam. xii. 16; 1 Kings xxii. 27; Neh. ix.
                    2, 3). Such conduct implied admission of wrongdoing before man as well as before
                    heaven. In some cases, as in that of Achan (Josh. vii. 19), acknowledgment
                    before man was demanded. In others, as in those involving sin or trespass
                    offerings, some degree of acknowledgment to the priest seems to be implied (Lev.
                    iv. v.). Restitution of things stolen, and general reparation for injustice were
                    also enjoined (Ezek. xxxiii. 15, &amp;c.) as evidences of sincerity.</p>
                <p>In the Christian church public offenders were from an early period put to open
                    penance. We find St Paul enjoining this, but subsequently interceding that the
                    offender be not dealt with too severely (1 Cor. v. 2; 2 Cor. ii. 6, 7). The
                    growth of private (or <hi rend="italic">auricular)</hi> confession is more
                    difficult to trace. Even those who would be most inclined to represent it as
                    primitive admit that for the first three centuries little or no mention is made
                    of any such practice; and though they would fain attribute such silence to
                    persecution, or to the reserve known as the <hi rend="italic">disciplina</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">arcani,</hi> they seem inclined to admit that private confession
                    was a development, and grew up gradually. Passages from the fathers, such as St
                    Cyprian, St Basil, St Gregory of Nyssa, and others, recommending the practice,
                    have to be confronted with the small prominence given to it in the works of St
                    Augustine and the strong declarations of St Chrysostom on the sufficiency of
                    confession to God. But <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n285/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0285-0258"/> the practice gradually became more common,
                    especially in the West, and more a matter of rule and precept; until at length,
                    in the fourth Lateran Council, held under Pope Innocent IIL, in 1215, it was
                    enjoined upon all members of the Church of Rome once a year, by the famous 21st
                    canon, beginning with the words, <hi rend="italic">Omnis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >utriusque</hi><hi rend="italic">sexus fidelis.</hi> The mediaeval church of the
                    West fixed the number of sacraments as seven, and insisted on auricular
                    confession as an essential part of the sacrament of penance. Confession and
                    absolution was reserved for the priesthood. Yet a certain recognition of a
                    quasi-priestly power, residing in the church at large, and in some sense
                    therefore in the laity, appears in the Roman office-books, and we find laymen,
                    in cases of extreme emergency, confessing and absolving each other. (An instance
                    occurs in one of the earliest and most admirable of French biographies,
                    Joinville’s <hi rend="italic">Life of St Louis.)</hi> Russia appears now to be
                    the country where, at least in theory, confession is most insisted upon as a
                    certificate of annual confession (often, it is said, purchased) is a condition
                    of being a witness in court.</p>
                <p>At the Reformation the reformed communities were unanimous in rejecting enforced
                    auricular confession, but it is a mistake to suppose that they were equally
                    unanimous in reprobating its use in cases where it was sought by the free choice
                    of penitents. The Augsburg Confession (part i. art. 11) retains it, and
                    Melanchthon asserts that many frequently availed themselves of it. Luther did
                    not even deny its claim to a sacramental character; nor has it ever died out
                    among the Lutherans. But the sacramental character is denied by Calvin and the
                    Calvinistic churches generally. Peter Martyr, Charnier, and others seem to
                    identify absolution with the preaching of God’s Word. Nevertheless absolution
                    still retained, for a long time, a disciplinarian character even among these
                    bodies. Thus we find the Scottish ministers offering absolution to the marquis
                    of Montrose before his execution at Edinburgh on May 21, 1650; and his refusal
                    seems, according to the historian Burton, to have influenced his enemies in the
                    matter of the sepulture granted to his remains. Private confession also finds a
                    place in the English prayer-book and homilies. Before the Revolution of 1G88 it
                    was so far common that we find Bishop Burnet, in his <hi rend="italic">History
                    of His Own Times,</hi> naming this or that clergyman as confessor in the family
                    of such and such a nobleman. To divulge anything thus confided is as strictly
                    forbidden in the reformed English as in the mediaeval or modern Roman church,
                    though an exception is made in the English canons in the case of such crimes as
                    might endanger the life of the recipient of the confession by making him an
                    accessory in the eye of the law.</p>
                <p>The connection of confession with casuistry and with the morality of nations,
                    cannot be discussed here. As regards casuistry, it must suffice to allude to the
                    great name of Pascal, and the controversy arising out of his celebrated <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettres Provinciales.</hi> The question of its effect on morality
                    is still more complex and difficult to estimate. As a rule, we may expect to
                    find its influence well spoken of by Roman Catholics and the reverse in the
                    opposite camps; nevertheless, some Protestant writers, as Hallam, and perhaps
                    Sismondi, appear to view it with a certain amount of tolerance and even favour,
                    while some Roman Catholic writers <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Vitelleschi,
                    under the pseudonym <hi rend="italic">Pomponio Leto),</hi> on the contrary, seem
                    inclined to censure at any rate its extreme development in the form of
                    direction, as injurious to proper self-reliance and independence of
                    character.</p>
                <p>It remains to add, that the terms <hi rend="italic">confessor</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">confessional</hi> are used by ecclesiastical writers in very
                    distinct senses, which can only ba judged of by the context in which they are
                    fourni. The statement that a given priest is the confessor—say of the king of
                    Spain—means, of course, that he is the person to whom that sovereign confesses;
                    but the term found simply after a name, as “St Leonard, confessor,” means that
                    the person so designated underwent more or less of suffering on behalf of the
                    Christian faith, though he may not have been an actual martyr. This latter sense
                    is the usual one in ancient writers. In like manner the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >confessional,</hi> which is now commonly employed to signify the structure
                    placed in Roman Catholic churches for the purpose of hearing confessions, meant
                    originally, in Christian antiquity, the place where a martyr had been buried. It
                    was subsequently applied to a tomb built over a spot thus hallowed either in the
                    crypt or in the upper part of a church.</p>
                <p>The authorities on the subject embrace, as has been seen, hets of councils,
                    confessionsof faith, andan abundanceof controversial works. The foreign
                    Reformers—Luther, Melanchthon, Calvin, Zwingli— have all touched upon it in
                    their writings. Among Anglican works may be named Jewell’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apology,</hi> and Marshall’s <hi rend="italic">Penitential Discipline of the
                    Early Church</hi> (republished in the Anglo-Catholic Library, 1844), and various
                    modern <hi rend="italic">Catenae</hi> of authorities, as Gray’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Statement on Confession.</hi> The Roman Catholic view is set forth
                    in such works as Klee’s <hi rend="italic">Dogmatik</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Dogmas</hi> (Mayence, 1834, 1838), and Martigny’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionnaire des antiquités chrétiennes,</hi> Paris, 1865. The subject is a
                    prominent one in the Acts of the Council of Trent, and for the fourth Lateran
                    Council the student may refer to Labbe’s <hi rend="italic">Concilia</hi> (tom.
                    vii.,Paris, 1714). (J. G. C.)</p>
