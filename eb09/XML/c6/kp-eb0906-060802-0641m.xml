                    ball <hi rend="italic">(pilaf),</hi> and a mallet very similar to the mallets
                    now in use, and with two hoops, or a hoop and a peg, the game being won by the
                    player who ran the hoop or hoops and touched the peg under certain conditions in
                    the fewest number of strokes. Croquet certainly has some resemblance to
                    paille-maille, played with more hoops and more balls.</p>
                <p>It is said that the game was brought to Ireland from the south of France by the
                    eldest daughter of Sir Edward Macnaughten some twenty-five years ago; but Mr
                    Dickson, an ivory turner, of Gracechurch Street, London, remembers having made a
                    set of croquet implements for Ireland over forty years ago. At all events, the
                    re-introduction of the game by Miss Macnaughten, under whose auspices it was
                    first played on the lawn of the late Lord Lonsdale, in 1852, marks the time when
                    it became of sufficient importance to find a regular maker of croquet implements
                    in London. Shortly afterwards, in 1856, Mr Jaques of Hatton Garden, London, saw
                    the game in Ireland, and commenced manufacturing it in England, where it soon
                    became very popular.</p>
                <p>One of the first symptoms that the game had taken root was the playing of a
                    public match on the bowling green at Evesham in Worcestershire in 1867. In 1868
                    the first all-comers’ meeting was held on the cricket ground at
                    Moreton-in-Marsh. In the same year the All England Croquet Club was formed, and
                    on the grounds of this club at Wimbledon the annual contest for the championship
                    takes place. The laws of the game, which are used in all public matches, were
                    settled by a conference of delegates from the principal croquet clubs in 1869,
                    1870, and 1873 <hi rend="italic">(Conference Laws,</hi> De la Rue and Co.). In
                    addition to these, laws for the regulation of prize-meetings (Horace Cox) were
                    issued by the A. E. C. C., which are tho authority for the management of such
                    meetings. According to these laws, match games are played on a ground measuring
                    40 yards by 30, with four balls, two forming a side against the other two,—one
                    player owning two balls, or four players each taking one ball. In match play the
                    hoops and pegs are set and run as in the diagram (fig. 1).</p>
                <p>The hoops are of ∣-inch round iron, painted blue, and are 4 inches in width
                    (inside measurement) for handicaps, and for ladies and ordinary matches, and 3¾
                    inches wide, steel braced, with oak sockets, for championship matches for
                    gentlemen. They and the pegs are thus named <hi rend="italic">in order—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in the order in which they are to be run or made. First

                    three, two, and one to go out or last hoop; winning peg.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Distances on a full-sized ground.—</hi>:Pegs in centre line of
                    ground, 8 yards from nearest boundary. Hoops up centre line of ground 8 yards
                    apart and. 8 yards from pegs. Corner hoops 7 yards from centre and in a line
                    with pegs. Starting spot 1 foot from left-hand corner hoop and opposite its
                    centre.</p>
                <p>The height of the hoops and pegs and various minor matters have been also settled
                    by the same authorities. The balls are of boxwood, 3∣ inches in diameter, and
                    should weigh not less than 14∣ oz. There is no restriction as to the size,
                    weight, number or material of the mallets employed; in striking, the cue and
                    mace strokes are not allowed, and the head of the mallet only must be used. The
                    most approved mallets have boxwood heads and ash handles; they weigh from 3 lb
                    to 4 δ&gt;, and are from 32 inches to 35 inches in length. The patterns vary
                    considerably.</p>
                <p>In playing the game, the objects∖re to make all the <hi rend="italic">points</hi>
                    (hoops and pegs) of the balls belonging to one side, in the order shown in the
                    diagram, and to prevent the adversaries from doing the same. The side that first
                    succeeds in making all its points in order wins the game. The striker is
                    entitled to another stroke, or to continue his turn so long as he succeeds in
                    making his next point, or in causing his ball by a stroke of the mallet to hit
                    another ball (called making a <hi rend="italic">roquet),</hi> when he must place
                    his ball in contact with the one roqueted, and striking his own ball with the
                    mallet he must move the two balls which are in contact, sending them in any
                    directions he pleases, called <hi rend="italic">taking croquet.</hi> If in his
                    stroke after taking croquet he hits another ball or makes his next point, he
                    similarly continues until he fails to do either, when it is his adversary’s
                    turn. Each ball can only be roqueted once during each turn, unless a point in
                    order is made, when each ball can again be roqueted as at first. This rule does
                    not apply to the winning peg, as when that is hit in order the ball is out of
                    the game.</p>
                <p>The striker should stand with the feet about 15 inches apart, with the toe of the
                    right foot at right angles to the line of aim, the other being somewhat turned
                    out. The body should be inclined over the ball, so that the player can look down
                    upon it. The mallet should be grasped with both hands, and the striking face
                    placed close to the ball, so that a line drawn through the mallet head and
                    centre of the ball gives the line of aim. The striker, having taken his aim,
                    should keep his eye on <hi rend="italic">his own</hi> ball, and should then lift
                    the mallet, and strike the ball quietly and without hurry, in the line of aim.
                    For gentle strokes the wrist is mainly used; harder strokes are played more from
                    the arm and shoulder.</p>
                <p>When able to make a roquet at several yards with tolerable certainty, the learner
                    should next practise <hi rend="italic">rushing,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    roqueting with such force as to move the ball aimed at some distance, and <hi
                    rend="italic">cutting,</hi> which is a rush played fine instead of full. To
                    avoid accidentally jumping over in playing rushes, care must be taken not to hit
                    down on the striker’s ball; this is effected by carrying the mallet up towards
                    the left shoulder after striking,—just the stroke that would be called badly hit
                    at cricket.</p>
                <p>When able to rush, the strokes made in taking croquet, viz., splitting, taking
                    off, rolling, passing, and stopping, should be practised.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">split,</hi> which sends the two balls in different given
                    directions, may be made to a certainty by dividing the angle, as in the half
                    push at billiards. Thus, if the striker wishes to croquet his own ball in the
                    direction A (fig. 2), and the other ball in the direction B, he must aim in the
                    direction C, and strike, not push his ball.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">take</hi> q/is merely a thin split, in which the roqueted
                    ball is moved slightly. If an imaginary line is drawn through the balls and
                    another at right angles to it, as in diagram, and the aim made a little to the
                    right of the second line. viz. at A (fig. 3), the striker’s ball will travel in
                    the direction required, viz., to B, and the other ball to C. When taking off
                    from the side of the ball furthest from the striker, the aim must be slightly to
                    the left of the line or aim.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rolling croquet,</hi> in which the balls are sent together in
                    nearly the same line, is made by trailing the mallet after the balls as soon as
                    the stroke or tap is made. Care must be taken not to make a second tap, or the
                    stroke is foul.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Passing croquet</hi> is a sort of roll. The front ball must be
                    placed about 30 degrees out of the line along which it is intended to pass the
                    striker’s ball, in order to avoid a kiss, and, after the stroke, the mallet must
                    remain in contact <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> with the striker’s ball, and
                    its rate of going must be accelerated by a push. If the ball is hit twice the
                    stroke is foul.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">stop stroke</hi> is made by means of a sharp clean tap, the
                    mallet being arrested in its onward course as soon as it has struck the ball.
                    For stop strokes, where it is desired to move the striker’s ball very little and
                    to send the other ball a considerable distance, a light mallet (called a stop
                    mallet) is required.</p>
                <p>In addition to the mastery of these strokes and also of thejzmy&gt; stroke, which
                    is played by striking down on the ball, and is very useful for running narrow
                    hoops at an angle, <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> has to be learned in order to
                    obtain position. Judging strength is mainly a matter of practice.</p>
                <p>When the above strokes can be played with tolerable certainty, they should be
                    made use of in practising <hi rend="italic">breaks.</hi> A break is made when
                    two or more points are scored in order. To practise the break, place the
                    striker’s ball on the starting spot (see diagram of setting); place a ball
                    several feet on the other side of the first hoop, a ball near the second hoop,
                    and one in the middle of the ground. Make the first hoop, and then roquet the
                    ball placed near. Drive this ball by a medium roll near the third hoop, and
                    leave the striker’s ball near the ball in the middle of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n643/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0643-0610"/> ground. Roquet thia ball and take off to the
                    second hoop. Use the ball placed there to make that hoop; then roquet it after
                    running the hoop and send it to the hoop three to peg, going to the middle of
                    the ground with the striker’s baU. Take off to the third hoop, make it with the
                    ball placed there to help, and then send it to the hoop one to peg, going with
                    the striker’s ball to the one in the middle of the ground. Then rush it to hoop
                    two to peg, and take off to the hoop three to peg, or failing a rush, roll or
                    split it to two to peg, aud the striker’s ball to three to peg. Make that hoop,
                    and split, roll, or rush the ball placed there to help to hoop second back,
                    going to ball placed near hoop two to peg.</p>
                <p>By judicious repetition of these or similar tactics there is no limit to the
                    number of points that can be made. The practice should be continued until, on
                    good ground, with 4-inch hoops and three balls to help, the break of fourteen
                    points becomes a feat easy of accomplishment.</p>
                <p>In order to become an adept at the game, judgment must be added to mere
                    execution. Judgment cannot be taught in writing, further than by laying down
                    certain principles of play. They are briefly as under :—</p>
                <p>1. Keep the partner balls together, the adverse balls apart.</p>
                <p>It is clear, from the remarks on the break, that at most one or two points can be
                    made without a ball or balls to help; hence going to the next hoop in order is
                    very poor tactics, if we regard the advantages gained by helping partner by
                    keeping near him, and by separating the adversaries, or at least giving partner
                    the opportunity of separating them.</p>
                <p>2. When out of the break, it is often a nice point whether to go to partner, or
                    to finesse to the boundary, or to take a shot at the opponents. As a rule a long
                    shot should not be attempted if failure would leave the ball in the adversary’s
                    game, where it may be brought into play to help him in his break. Also the
                    question often arises whether to separate the adversaries at once or to continue
                    the break. The answers to these questions must depend on the striker’s estimate
                    of his ability and of his adversary’s ability, and on the state of the game.</p>
                <p>The principal exception to playing to partner’s, ball is when the ball played
                    with is a rover and the adversary is also a rover, and has a fair probability of
                    making a roquet next time. For, under these circumstances, the opponent will
                    take off to the two adverse balls and rush the rover up to the winning peg, and
                    very probably peg it out.</p>
                <p>3. Keep the last player in your game.</p>
                <p>The object of this is to prevent the adversaries from combining at their next
                    stroke. It compels the next player either to take an uncertain shot which may
                    bring him into the game, or to finesse.</p>
                <p>The last player may be kept, either by sending him to partner during or at the
                    end of the turn, or by putting him near partner’s hoop and then going to
                    partner.</p>
                <p>The striker should, if the opportunity offers during his break, pick up the last
                    player for the reasons already given.</p>
                <p>When sending the next player away, choose such part of the ground to send him
                    that if he takes a shot it brings him into partner’s game.</p>
                <p>4. Make the break with two or three balls to help, in preference to one.</p>
                <p>The reason is obvious to those who have practised the break. Skilful players
                    endeavour to keep all the balls in the break; but the safe plan for novices is
                    to dismiss the next player and to make the break with two balls to help.</p>
                <p>5. When in the break do not play uncertain strokes on the next player.</p>
                <p>For any mistake made then gives the break to the adversary. It is, however, a
                    matter of judgment how far risks may be run, varying with the amount of skill
                    and nerve of the striker.</p>
                <p>When partner’s ball is a long way off, using the last player to help is just as
                    dangerous as using the next player.</p>
                <p>6. At the end of the break play partner’s game.</p>
                <p>This is accomplished by leaving him the last player’s ball to help and going to
                    his hoop, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> or by leaving him a rush to his
                    hoop and a ball at his next hoop but one, and in several other ways, which will
                    be apparent to any thoughtful player.</p>
