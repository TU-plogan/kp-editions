                    of</hi></label>, the most southern of the five states of Central America,
                    occupies the isthmus between about 8° and ll <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> N.
                    lat., and 82* and 86° W. long. It is bounded on the N. by Nicaragua, the
                    frontier claimed on this side running from the Pacific coast at the stream
                    called La Flor, immediately north of Saliiías Bay, to the Lake of Nicaragua, and
                    along its southern shore to the Rio San Juan, and thence down the right bank of
                    the river to its most southerly mouth—but this line is disputed by the
                    Nicaraguan Government; on the S. by the Colombian state of Panamá, the
                    recognized boundary extending from the Golfo Dulce to the Chiriqui river south
                    of the islet called Escudo de Veragua—this line also overlapping a debatable
                    borderland; on the N.E. by the Caribbean Sea; and on the S.W. by the Pacific
                    Ocean.</p>
                <p>Its area within these limits, officially stated at 26,040 English square miles,
                    has been found by planimetric measurements, made at Gotha, to be more accurately
                    21,495 square miles, or not quite double that of Belgium.</p>
                <p>The population, which consists mainly of people of Spanish descent, little mixed
                    with foreign elements, is officially estimated at 175,000 (according to Μ. Belly
                    it is 154,000), including about 5000 civilized Indians of pure blood, 1200
                    negroes, and 600 Chinese; but besides these there are from 10,000 to 12,000
                    uncivilized Indians within the limits of the republic.</p>
                <p>The Atlantic coastland is generally low, and is characterized by numerous lagoons
                    which have been formed by the prevailing currents opposite the river mouths, the
                    chief break in its extent being the great Lagoon or Gulf of Chiriqui; the
                    Pacific csast rises higher and is marked by the two large peninsulas which
                    inclose the Gulfs of Nicoya and Dulce. Inland the surface of the country is much
                    diversified, but is chiefly occupied by mountains, plateaus, and valleys. In the
                    northern portion a great volcanic range extends from north-west to south-east,
                    from between the Lake of Nicaragua and the Pacific coast to the centre of Costa
                    Rica, separating a narrower Pacific descent from the broader slope to the
                    Atlantic; the peaks of Orosi (5200 feet), Rincon de la Vieja, Miravalles, Poas
                    (8845 feet), Barba, Irazu (10,850 feet), and Turrialba, (10,330 feet) are the
                    summits of this range. The form of the southern half of Costa Rica is determined
                    by the great range called the Montana Dota, 7000 to 9000 feet in elevation,
                    which extends from west to east nearly across the country, in about 9° 40' N.
                    lat., and from which two branch range sxtends south-eastwards, the one close
                    along the Pacific coast as far as the lower Terraba river, the other through the
                    centre of the country, rising to its highest points in the Cerro Chiripó and
                    Pico Blanco or Nemú, 11,740 feet above the sea. Between the northern and
                    southern masses lie the broad table-lands of San José and Cartago, marked out on
                    the Pacific side by the ridges called the Cerro del Aguacate and Cerro de
                    Candelaria, and towards the Atlantic by the Cerro Mateo. This central plateau
                    has an elevation of from 3000 to 4000 feet above the sea, and is the most
                    important, and as yet almost the only cultivated region of the country.</p>
                <p>The rivers which flow down the Atlantic slope in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n481/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0481-0450"/> NAE., the Rio Frio, San Carlos, Sarapiqui, and
                    Colorado, are tributaries of the boundary river San Juan, the outlet of Lake
                    Nicaragua; the others of this slope from N. to S., tho Reventazon, Pacuar,
                    Chiripó or Matini, Sixaula or Estrella, Changuenola, and Chiriqui, flow
                    independently to the Atlantic lagoons. On the Pacific side from N. to S. the
                    chief rivers are the Tempisque and Las Piedras, flowing to the head of the Gulf
                    of Nicoya; the Rio Grande, from the high borders of the plateau of San José; the
                    Rio de Pirris, Naranjo, and Rio Grande de Terraba.</p>
                <p>In contrast to the south-western descent, the Atlantic slope is covered with
                    dense impenetrable forest, and has remained almost closed to traffic and
                    civilization from the earliest times of colonization. Indians still living in a
                    savage state occupy some portions of this wild forest country. The former tribes
                    of the Reventazon and Pacuar have been completely exterminated; those remaining
                    are the Pranzos or Guatusos Indians of the valley of the Rio Frio in the north,
                    the Bizeita tribe on the Sixaula River, and the Terrbis on the Changuenola, in
                    the south-east, sometimes collectively called the Talamanca Indians. The latter
                    tribes have remained in hostility to each other since the discovery of the
                    country; they are perfectly uncivilized, hunters with bow and arrow, and
                    independent of the Government; they trade a little with adventurers from
                    Jamaica, bartering sarsaparilla, hides, and turtle-shells for arms and powder,
                    cotton stuffs, and tobacco. The Mosquito Indians come annually in canoes to the
                    Atlantic coast in May and June to fish for turtle in the Lagoon of Chiriqui. The
                    Pacific slope, on the other hand, is characterized by wide savannahs or
                    llanuras, bordered by forest, and is much more accessible.</p>
                <p>The climate varies with the elevation, from the tropical heat of the coast, which
                    is often fever-stricken, to the temperate and healthy air of the plateau and the
                    cold of the mountain heights. In the plateau of San José the northeast trade
                    wind, prevailing from October to April, brings dry weather; from April to
                    October the south-west monsoon, blowing up from the Pacific, brings almost daily
                    rain, excepting within a remarkable period of about a fortnight of dry weather
                    in June, called the “Veranillo de San Juan.” The rainfall at San José (3872 feet
                    above the sea) averages from 40 to 60 inches annually; the average temperature
                    here is about 68° Fahr., rising to 76° in the hottest month of summer and
                    falling to 55° Fahr, in the coldest. The country is subject to earthquakes; a
                    very severe one occurring in 1841 destroyed the town of Cartago.</p>
                <p>Costa Rica is exceedingly fertile, its forests being filled with an immense
                    variety of timber trees and useful dye woods, such as mahogany, ebony,
                    Indian-rubber, Brazilwood, and oak; almost all the fruits of the tropical and
                    temperate zones are found to thrive, and flowering plants are in rich profusion.
                    Coffee is the staple cultivated product of the country, and is grown chiefly on
                    the plateau lands of San José and Cartago,—the special adaptability of these to
                    the growth of this plant being attributed to the nature of the soil, which
                    consists of layers of black or dark brown volcanic ash of from 1 to 6 yards in
                    depth. Rice, maize, barley, potatoes, beans, bananas, and yucca are also
                    cultivated to some extent in the interior; cocoa, vanilla, sugar-cane, tobacco,
                    cotton, and indigo, on the warm coast lands, but as yet only for home
                    consumption. About 1150 square miles of the country are under cultivation.</p>
                <p>In the forests the wild animals of Central America—tho tapir, jaguar, ocelot,
                    puma, deer, and wild pigs—are numerous; a multitude of birds, including the
                    humming bird and the splendid quetzal or trogon, fill the woods; the reptiles
                    include the alligator of the rivers, the iguana, and many other lizards, the
                    boba, tuboba, black snake, rattlesnake, and corale. Among domestic animals oxen
                    and mules are the most valuable, almost all the traffic of the country being
                    carried on by means of ox-waggons.</p>
                <p>As yet the chief highway of Costa Rica is the waggon road from Punta Arenas on
                    the Gulf of Nicoya virtually the only port of the country, to the capital San
                    José, and thence to Cartago on the central plateau. Mule tracks lead
                    north-westwards from Punta Arenas through the province of Guanacaste to
                    Nicaragua, from San José north-east by the valley of the Sarapiqui to Grey Town
                    on the Atlantic, from Cartago eastwards to Puerto Limon also on the Atlantic,
                    and southward over the western spurs of the Montana Dota to the plains of
                    Terraba. A railroad from Alajuela to the capital and through Cartago to Puerto
                    Limon, part of a proposed inter-oceanic highway, was begun in 1871, and in
                    December 1873 the portion between Alajuela and Cartago, 42 miles, had been
                    completed. Owing to financial difficulties, however, the work ceased in 1874,
                    and only sufficient hands were employed to keep the part finished in working
                    order. Two hundred miles of telegraph line had been completed in 1875.</p>
                <p>There are no manufacturing industries in Costa Rica. The country is rich in
                    minerals—gold, silver, copper, iron, nickel, zinc, lead, marble—but up to the
                    present time gold, silver, and copper are the only ores that have been worked.
                    The principal gold mines are—(1) those of Trinidad, 4 leagues inland from Punta
                    Arenas <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> 1200 feet above the sea, worked on a small
                    scale by a Costa Rican company,—the quartz yields gold of a fineness of about
                    17¾ carats; and (2) the mines of the Cerro del Aguacate, one of which is worked
                    by the native “Compania de la Montana del Aguacate,” also in an imperfect
                    manner, but with good results. Another called the “Sacra Familia,” lies a little
                    north of the Aguacate mine, at an elevation of 3000 feet above the sea; it has
                    two chief veins, one containing galena and zinc blend, with silver, and grey
                    copper ore also yielding silver, and a second, with a lode of gold quartz
                    similar to that of Trinidad. This mine is also worked on a small scale by
                    private individuals, and gives gold of about 15¾ carats fine. Gold is said also
                    to exist in the wild Indian country of the Atlantic slope, but the position of
                    the supposed mines is uncertain.</p>
                <p>Costa Rica is divided into six provinces, in which the population is distributed
                    as follows according to the estimate of Μ. Belly:—</p>

                <p>The government is vested in a president elected for tour years, and a first and
                    second vice-president, aided by four ministers and the national congress of
                    deputies also elected for four years. The present constitution, the seventh
                    which has been in force in the republic, dates from 1871. All men between the
                    ages of eighteen and thirty form the militia of the republic, and in 1874
                    numbered 16,380,— 900 being employed in active service. All men between the ages
                    of thirty and fifty-five years form a reserve. The religion of the state is
                    Roman Catholic, but full liberty for the public exercise of all religions is
                    granted by the constitution. The revenue of the republic, derived from customs,
                    monopolies of spirits and tobacco, from the national bank, sales of land, and
                    various taxes, chiefly that oncthe exportation of coffee, amounted in 1875 to
                    £517,605; the expenditure in the same year was £556,221, showing a deficit of
                    £38,616.</p>
                <p>In 1871 the Government contracted in London a loan of £1,000,000, and in 1872
                    another of £2,400,000 for the construction of an inter-oceanic railway. In 1875
                    the external debt from this source was £2,401,300. Of this <pb break="no"

                    previous to the close of 1873, when the further execution of the work ceased.
                    The interest and sinking fund of this loan are far in arrears; the country is
                    bankrupt, and the Government has made no attempt to pay even part of its
                    liabilities.</p>
                <p>The value of the coffee exported in 1874 was estimated at £892,800; and that of
                    hides, timber, &amp;c., at £20,000.</p>
                <p>Imports are chiefly of Manchester goods, hardwares, flour, salt, and sugar,
                    chiefly shipped from England; but trade with France, Germany, and the United
                    States was increasing in 1875. Only about a fourth part of the trade of the
                    republic passes through Puerto Limon on the Atlantic, to which there is a mule
                    track, the bulk of goods being carried round to the Pacific port of Punta
                    Arenas, whence there is a highway to the interior.</p>
                <p>Costa Rica was one of the first discovered portions of the American continent;
                    Columbus touched on its shores in his third voyage, and it is probable that
                    Spanish adventurers first established themselves within it after the fourth
                    voyage of Columbus in 1502. In 1821, when all the provinces which formed the
                    kingdom of Guatemala declared their independence of the mother country, two
                    parties, one desiring union with Mexico under the dynasty of Iturbide, the other
                    seeking to form a separate republic, divided opinions in the revolted provinces.
                    In Costa Rica the town of Cartago chose the former; San José the latter. The
                    opposing factions met at a place called the Laguna de Ochomogo. The republicans
                    were victorious, and the seat of government was transferred from Cartago to San
                    José. In 1824 Costa Rica joined the federation of the Central American States,
                    but on the dissolution of that union in 1839 became an independent republic.
                    Internal disturbances and overturnings of the Government have been less frequent
                    in Costa Rica than in the other states of Central America, and its progress has
                    been correspondingly greater. Of recent years, however, the Government has been
                    obliged to maintain an army to guard itself against smouldering revolutions, and
                    at the present time (1877) angry discussions are taking place with Nicaragua on
                    the question of boundaries. On the other hand, an attempt is being made to
                    induce the Central American republics to join again in forming one government.
