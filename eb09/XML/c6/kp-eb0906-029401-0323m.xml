                    after by an edict of Louis XIII., but from that office, says Lambard, this lower
                    constableship was first drawn, and is, as it were, a very finger of that
                    hand.”</p>
                <p>The Statute of Winchester (13 Edw. I. st. 2, c. 6), ordaining every citizen to
                    have armour according to his condition to keep the peace, requires that in every
                    hundred and fran chise two constables be chosen to make the view of armour twice
                    a year, and that the said constables “shall present before justices assigned
                    such defaults as they do see in the county about armour, and of the suits, and
                    of watches, and of highways; and also shall present all such as do lodge
                    strangers in uplandish towns, for whom they will not answer.” These are the
                    officers known as <hi rend="italic">high</hi> constables; who are especially
                    charged with the peace of the hundred, just as the <hi rend="italic">petty</hi>
                    constables are charged with the peace of the parish or township. They were
                    appointed at the court of the hundred, or in default thereof by justices at
                    special sessions (7 and 8 Vict. c. 33, § 8). By a recent Act, 32 and 33 Vict. c.
                    47, they are practically abolished, as the justices of each county are required
                    to consider and determine whether it is necessary that the office of high
                    constable of each hundred, or other like district, should be continued.</p>
                <p>The petty or parish constable unites two offices—the ancient one of head-borough
                    or tithing man, and the modern one, instituted about the reign of Edward III.,
                    of assistant to the high constable. Considering what manner of men were for the
                    most part appointed to these offices, Blackstone thought it was well that they
                    should be kept in ignorance of the extent of their powers. Besides their general
                    duties in the preservation of the peace they are charged with the execution of
                    warrants and the service of summonses. No action can be brought against a
                    constable for any act done in the execution of his office unless within six
                    months from the time of its being committed. By 24 Geo. II. c. 44, the justice
                    who signed the warrant must be made a co-defendant in any action against the
                    constable, and on the production of such warrant at the trial the jury must find
                    for the constable, notwithstanding any want of jurisdiction in the magistrate.
                    Petty constables were formerly elected at the court leet or, in default thereof,
                    by two justices. But by 5 and 6 Vict. c. 109, it is .ordered that the justices
                    shall annually issue their precept to the overseers of each parish in their
                    county, requiring them to return a list of persons in such parish qualified and
                    liable to serve as constables, and that the justices on special petty sessions
                    shall revise the list, and select therefrom such number of constables as they
                    may deem necessary. Every able-bodied man resident within the parish, between
                    the ages of twenty-five and fifty-five, rated to the relief of the poor or to
                    the county rate, on any tenements of the net yearly value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >£4</hi> and upwards, is qualified and liable to serve as constable for that
                    parish. But large classes of persons are specially exempted from the liability
                    to serve,— including peers and members of Parliament, judges, justices,
                    clergymen and ministers, lawyers, physicans, officers of the army and navy,
                    public servants, &amp;c. Licensed victuallers and beer-sellers, game-keepers,
                    and convicts are disqualified. Every person so chosen must serve; but those who
                    have served already shall not be liable to serve again until every other person
                    liable shall have served. Boroughs under the Municipal Corporation Act do not
                    come within this statute. In .consequence of the establishment of a county
                    constabulary it is now enacted, by 35 and 36 Vict. c. 92, that no such constable
                    shall be appointed unless for parishes in regard to which the magistrates for
                    the county shall at their general or quarter sessions determine that it js
                    necessary that such appointment shall be made.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Special Constables</hi> are appointed to act on occasional
                    emergencies when the ordinary police force is thought to be deficient. In the
                    absence of volunteers the office is compulsory, on the appointment of two
                    justices. The lord-lieutenant may also appoint special constables, and the
                    statutory exemptions may be disregarded.</p>
                <p>The Acts establishing and regulating county constabulary are the 2 and 3 Viet, c,
                    93, 3 and 4 Vict. c. 88, 19 and 20 Vict. c. 69, 20 Vict. c. 2, ar/í 22 and 23
                    Vict. c. 32. The police force of every county shall be under the superintendence
                    of a chief-constable, who, with the approbation of justices in petty sessions,
                    may appoint constables and provisional superintendents. The chief-constable has
                    the general superintendence and direction of the force (including the petty
                    constables where they still exist), and he may dismiss them at his pleasure,
                    subject to the orders of Quarter Sessions, and the rules established for the
                    government of the force. The salaries and other expenses under these Acts are to
                    be paid by a police rate, to be made by the justices at Quarter Sessions.
                    Counties and boroughs may consolidate their police force. The Crown appoints
                    inspectors to report on the efficiency of the police, and whenever a certificate
                    shall be granted by the Secretary of State that the police has been maintained
                    during the preceding year in a state of efficiency as to discipline and numbers,
                    the Treasury shall grant a sum in aid of the expenses not exceeding one-fourth
                    of the charge for pay and clothing.</p>
