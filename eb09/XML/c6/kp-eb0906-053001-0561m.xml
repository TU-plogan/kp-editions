                    parliamentary borough of England, in the county of Warwick, 18 miles E.S.E.of
                    Birmingham. It stands on a gentle eminence, and is watered by the Sherbourne and
                    the Radford Brook, which unite within the town. Of its ancient fortifications
                    two gates and some portions of the wall are still extant, and several of the
                    older streets present a picturesque appearance, from the number of half-timbered
                    houses projecting over the footways. In the course of the present century, and
                    more especially since 1850, great improvements have been made in various
                    quarters. The most remarkable buildings are the churches; and of theβe the
                    oldest are St Michael’s, one of the finest specimens of Perpendicular
                    architecture in England, with a beautiful steeple rising to a height of 303
                    feet; Holy Trinity Church, a cruciform structure in the Later English style,
                    with a steeple at the intersection 237 feet high; and St John’s, or Bablake
                    Church, which is nearly a parallelogram on the ground plan, but cruciform in the
                    clerestory with a tower in the centre. All three have been restored under the
                    direction of Sir G. Gilbert Scott. Christ Church only dates from 1832, but it is
                    attached to the ancient spire of the Grey Friars’ Church. Of secular edifices
                    the most interesting is St Mary’s Hall, erected by the united guilds in the
                    early part of the 15th century. The principal chamber, situated above a fine
                    crypt, is 76 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 34 feet high; its roof is of carved
                    oak, and in the north end there is a large window of old stained glass, with a
                    curious piece of tapestry beneath nearly as old as the building. In the treasury
                    is preserved a valuable collection of ancient muniments. Among the other public
                    buildings of the city may be mentioned the new corporate offices and police
                    court, the county hall, the drapers’ hall, the hospital, the corn-exchange, the
                    market hall, the self-supporting dispensary, the free library, the institute,
                    the baths, the theatre, and the barracks. The cemetery is one of the most
                    beautiful in the kingdom. The educational institutions include a well-endowed
                    free grammar school, founded in the reign of Elizabeth, and held in the disused
                    church of the hospital of St John, a school of art, seven endowed charity
                    schools, and a county reformatory for girls; and among the charitable
                    foundations, which are numerous and valuable, Bond’s hospital for old men and
                    Ford’s hospital for old women are remarkable as fine specimens of ancient timber
                    work. Coventry w as early celebrated for its manufactures, and had numerous
                    guilds or trading companies. It was noted for its woollens in the 15 th century,
                    and subsequently acquired such a reputation for its dyeing that the expression
                    “as true as Coventry blue” became proverbial. The weaving of tammies, camlets,
                    shalloons, &amp;c., succeeded; but these branches of industry no longer exist.
                    At present the staple trades are ribbon and trimming weaving, elastic web
                    manufacturing, dyeing, and watchmaking; to which may be added the weaving of
                    woollens, carpets, and carriage-lace, the spinning of cotton, the manufacture of
                    sewing machines and bicycles, art metal-work, and ironfounding. The fairs are
                    numerous and well attended. The borough returns two members to Parliament. In
                    1871 the population of the municipal borough was 37,670 (17,750 males, and
                    19,920 females), and of the parliamentary borough, which comprises an area of
                    6448 acres, 41,348.</p>
                <p>Coventry derives its name (Conventre, or convent town), from a Benedictine
                    priory, founded in 1043 by Earl Leofric and his wife Lady Godiva, who were
                    afterwards buried within the priory church. According to a well-known popular
                    tradition, exquisitely related in Tennyson’s poem, the inhabitants were freed
                    from the earl’s excessive taxation by the romantic devotion of the lady, who
                    rode through the streets of the city “clothed on with chastity,” and thus
                    compelled her husband to keep his oath. A procession, instituted in the time of
                    Charles II. in commemorative imitation of the event, continued for many years to
                    be annually celebrated; and an effigy called Peeping Tom is still pointed out
                    projecting from an upper window at the corner of Smithford Street, popularly
                    reputed to represent an inquisitive tailor, who was struck blind for having
                    peered at the lady as she passed, while every other eye was averted in thankful
                    reverence. Carmelite, Franciscan, and Carthusian monasteries were early
                    established in the city, which was not long in acquiring a high position in the
                    country. Gosford Green, outside its eastern walls, was chosen in 1397 for that
                    great wager <pb break="no"

                    Norfolk, which w as interrupted by Richard IL, and formed such an important
                    episode in the tragic history of the time. During the Wars of the Roses the
                    citizens adhered to the Lancastrian party, and were consequently rewarded by
                    Henry VI., whose charter, constituting the city and certain adjacent villages a
                    separate county, continued in force till 1842. In the course of the 15th century
                    several Parliaments were held in the town; and in 1569 it afforded for a short
                    time a prison-house to Mary, Queen of Soots. Daring the troubles of the
                    commonwealth the citizens espoused the cause of the Parliament; and on the
                    restoration of Charles II. their fortifications were dismantled as a penalty for
                    their disloyalty. To the student of English literature Coventry has a special
                    interest on account of its mystery-plays, full details in regard to which will
                    be found in Thomas Sharp’s <hi rend="italic">Dissertation,</hi> 1825. Various
                    explanations of the popular phrase “to send to Coventy” have been
                    suggested,—none of them particularly satisfactory. See Reader’s <hi
