                    school. As early as 1628, that is in his tenth year, he composed his <hi
                    rend="italic">Tragicall History of Piramus and</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Thisbe,</hi> an epical romance written in a six-line stanza of his own
                    invention. It is not too much to say that this work is the most astonishing feat
                    of imaginative precocity on record; it is marked by no great faults of
                    immaturity, and by constructive merits of a very high order. Two years later the
                    child wrote another and still more ambitious poem, <hi rend="italic">Constantia
                    and Philetus,</hi> being sent about the same time to Westminster School. Here he
                    displayed the most extraordinary mental precocity and versatility, and wrote in
                    his thirteenth year yet another poem, the <hi rend="italic">Elegy on the Death
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">Dudley</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lord Carlton.</hi> These three poems of considerable size, and
                    some smaller ones, were collected in 1633, and published in a volume entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Poetical Blossoms,</hi> dedicated to the head-master of the
                    school, and prefaced by many laudatory verses by schoolfellows. The author at
                    once became famous, although he had not, even yet, completed his fifteenth year.
                    His next composition was a pastoral comedy, entitled <hi rend="italic">Love's
                    Biddle,</hi> a marvellous production for a boy of sixteen, airy, correct, and
                    harmonious in language, and rapid in movement. The style is not without
                    resemblance to that of Randolph, whose earliest works, however, were at that
                    time only just printed. In 1636 Cowley was elected into Trinity College,
                    Cambridge, where he betook himself with enthusiasm to the study of all kinds of
                    learning, and early distinguished himself as a ripe scholar. It was about this
                    time that he composed his scriptural epic on the history of King David, one book
                    of which still exists in the Latin original, the rest being superseded in favour
                    of an English version in four books, called the <hi rend="italic">Davideis,</hi>
                    which he published a long time after. This Ms most grave and important work is
                    remarkable as having suggested to Milton several points which he afterwards made
                    use of. This epic, written in a very dreary and turgid manner, but in good
                    rhymed heroic verse, deals with the adventures of King David from his boyhood to
                    the smiting of Amalek by Saul, where it abruptly closes. In 1638 <hi
                    rend="italic">Love's Riddle</hi> and a Latin comedy, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naufragium Joculare,</hi> were printed, and in 1641 the passage of Prince
                    Charles through Cambridge gave occasion to the production of another dramatic
                    work, <hi rend="italic">The Guardian,</hi> which was'acted before the royal
                    visitor with much success. During the civil war this play was privately
                    performed at Dublin, but it was not printed till 1650. It is bright and amusing,
                    in tho style common to the “sons " of Ben Jonson, the university wits who wrote
                    more for the closet than the public stage. The learned quiet of the young poet’s
                    life was broken up by the civil war; he warmly espoused the royalist side.
                    Cambridge became in 1643 too hot to hold him, and he made his way to Oxford,
                    where he enjoyed the friendship of Lord Falkland, and was tossed, in the tumult
                    of affairs, into the personal confidence of the royal family itself. After the
                    battle of Marston Moor he followed the queen to Paris, and the exile so
                    commenced lasted twelve years. This period was spent almost entirely in the
                    royal service, “bearing a share in the distresses of the royal family, or
                    labouring in their affairs. To this purpose he performed several dangerous
                    journeys into Jersey, Scotland, Flanders, Holland, or wherever else the king’s
                    troubles required his attendance. But the chief testimony of his fidelity was
                    the laborious service he underwent in maintaining the constant correspondence
                    between the late king and the queen his wife. In that weighty trust he behaved
                    himself with indefatigable integrity and unsuspected secrecy; for he ciphered
                    and deciphered with his own hand the greatest part of all the letters that
                    passed between their majesties, and managed a vast intelligence in many other
                    parts, which for some years together took up all his days, and two or three
                    nights every week.” In spite of these labours he did not refrain from literary
                    industry. During his exile he met with the works of Pindar, and determined to
                    reproduce their lofty lyric passion in English. At the same time he occupied
                    himself in writing a history of the civil war, which he completed.as far as the
                    battle of Newbury, but unfortunately afterwards destroyed. In 1647 a collection
                    of his love verses, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Mistress,</hi> was published,
                    and in the next year a volume of wretched satires was brought out under his
                    name, with the composition of which he had nothing to do. In spite of the
                    troubles of the times, so fatal to poetic fame, his reputation steadily
                    increased, and when, on his return to England in 1656, he published a volume of
                    his collected poetical works, he found himself without a rival in public esteem.
                    This volume included the later works already mentioned, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pindarique Odes,</hi> and some <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies.</hi> Among the
                    latter are to be found Cowley’s most vital pieces. This section of his works
                    opens with the famous aspiration—</p>
                <p>What shall I do to be for ever known, And make the coming age my own?</p>
                <p>It contains elegies on Wotton, Vandyck, Harvey, and Crashaw, the last two being
                    among Cowley’s finest poems, brilliant, sonorous, and original; the amusing
                    ballad of <hi rend="italic">The Chronicle,</hi> giving a fictitious catalogue of
                    his supposed amours; various gnomic pieces; and some charming paraphrases from
                    Anacreon. The <hi rend="italic">Pindarique</hi><hi rend="italic">Odes</hi>
                    contain weighty lines and passages, buried in irregular and inharmonious masses
                    of moral verbiage. Not more than one or two are good throughout, but a full posy
                    of beauties may easily be culled from them. The long cadences of the
                    Alexandrines with which most of the strophes close, continued to echo in English
                    poetry from Dryden down to Gray, but the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> themselves,
                    which were found to bo obscure by the poet’s contemporaries, immediately fell
                    into disesteem. <hi rend="italic">The Mistress</hi> was the most popular poetic
                    reading of the age, and is now the least read of all Cowley’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n564/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0564-0533"/> works. It was the last and most violent
                    expression of the amatory affectation of the 17th century, an affectation which
                    had been endurable in Donne and other early writers because it had been the
                    vehicle of sincere emotion, but was unendurable in Cowley because in him it
                    represented nothing but a perfunctory exercise, a mere exhibition of literary
                    calisthenics. He appears to have been of a cold, or at least of a timid,
                    disposition; in the face of these elaborately erotic volumes, we are told that
                    to the end of his days he never summoned up courage to speak of love to a single
                    woman in real life. Soon after his return to England he was seized in mistake
                    for another person, and only obtained his liberty on a bail of £1000. In 1658 he
                    revised and altered his play of <hi rend="italic">The Guardian,</hi> and
                    prepared it for the press under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Cutter of
                    Coleman Street,</hi> but it did not appear until 1663. Late in 1658 Oliver
                    Cromwell died, and Cowley took advantage of the confusion of affairs to escape
                    to Paris, where he remained until the Restoration brought him back in Charles’s
                    train. Wearied with the broils and fatigues of a political life, Cowley obtained
                    permission to retire into the country; through his friend, Lord St Albans, he
                    obtained a property near Chertsey, and here, devoting himself to the study of
                    botany, and buried in his books, he lived in comparative solitude until his
                    death, which occurred on the 28th of July 1667, a period otherwise famous for
                    the publication of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> On the 3d of August he
                    was buried in Westminster Abbey beside the ashes of Chaucer and Spenser, where
                    in 1675 the duke of Buckingham erected a monument to his memory. Throughout
                    their parallel lives the fame of Cowley completely eclipsed that of Milton, but
                    posterity instantly and finally reversed the judgment of their contemporaries.
                    The poetry of Cowley rapidly fell into a neglect as unjust as the earlier
                    popularity had been. As a prose writer, especially as an essayist, he holds, and
                    will not lose, a high position in literature; as a poet it is hardly possible
                    that he can enjoy more than a very partial revival. The want of nature, the
                    obvious and awkward art, the defective melody of his poems, destroy the interest
                    that their ingenuity and occasional majesty would otherwise excite. He had lofty
                    views of the mission of a poet and an insatiable ambition, but his chief claim
                    to poetic life is the dowry of sonorous lyric style which he passed down to
                    Dryden and his successors of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>The works of Cowley were not collected till 1688, when Thomas Sprat, afterwards
                    bishop of Rochester, brought out a splendid edition in folio, to which fie
                    prefixed a graceful and elegant life of the poet. There were many reprints of
                    this collection, but since the early part of the 18th century no good edition of
                    Cowley’s poems has appeared. The Essays, on the contrary, have frequently been
                    revived with approval. (E. W. G.)</p>
