                    indigenous species in most warm regions of the globe, and distinguished by the
                    following characters :—plants, annual or possessing a perennial thick root;
                    stems, rarely if ever climbing; leaves heart-shaped, sometimes reniform, with
                    three to seven lobes, and crenulate or denticulate margin; flowers, monoecious
                    and yellow, having tubular campanulate calices, petals but slightly adherent,
                    three free stamens, and a tripartite, obtuse, and spheroidal stigma; fruits or
                    pepones, three to six celled, smooth or echinate; and seeds, more or less
                    compressed, ovate, sharp-edged, and of a yellow or dirty-white colour. <hi
                    rend="italic">Cucumis sativus,</hi> the common cucumber, is an annual,
                    indigenous probably to tropical Asia; the branches ramify little; the leaves are
                    hairy and have three to five sharply-pointed lobes; the ovary is often fusiform;
                    the fruits are for the most part oblong, obscurely trigonal or cylindrical, and
                    except in one variety contain three carpels, and their flesh is white, firm, and
                    of an agreeable sub-acid taste. In its characters it is one of the most uniform
                    species of its genus. The principal <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0721-0688"/> varieties are (1) the small Russian cucumber, the
                    fruit of which is ovoid, smooth, scarcely larger than a hen’s egg, and when ripe
                    of a dull orange colour; (2) the common long cucumber; (3) the white cucumber,
                    with fruits usually shorter and proportionally thicker than in the preceding
                    kind; (4) the Sikkim cucumber, the leaves of which may be seven or even
                    uine-lobed, while its fruits are long-oval in shape, have the skin marbled with
                    yellowish-white and reddish-brown, and regularly contain five placentae.</p>
                <p>The cucumber usually trails on the ground, but it can be made to grow well in an
                    upright position, supported by its tendrils. It thrives best in deep, loose, and
                    rich earth, but if supplied with liquid manure it may be cultivated in old tan
                    or brick-rubbish. An excellent soil is a sandy loam with a fourth part of rotten
                    dung intermixed. A damp atmosphere and a temperature of from 75° to 80° Fahr.,
                    with plenty of light, are the conditions best suited to the cucumber; but it can
                    be grown at so low a temperature as 50, <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> and will
                    bear fruit at 60°; in the presence of abundant moisture a heat between 90* and
                    110° may be borne. Exposure to the air on cold nights is highly injurious to the
                    plants, rendering them sickly, and rapidly producing mildew. In England
                    cucumbers are cultivated in dung and hot-beds, also in pots, and during summer
                    in the open fields. At Sandy in Bedfordshire the temperature of the soil of
                    cucumber plantations is in a week or ten days raised 8° oι 10° above that of the
                    neighbouring soil by turning in the surface-earth, and covering the ground with
                    litter at the close of every sunny day. To promote the formation of fruit the
                    young shoots of the cucumber should be nipped off occasionally between the thumb
                    and finger, and should be allowed to proceed no further than the second joint
                    beyond the fading fruitblossom. The plants are raised from both seeds and
                    cuttings. For procuring good seed the following method has been given. A strong
                    plant is chosen, and allowed to bear only one fruit, which, when ripe and
                    yellow, is cut and laid by in a dry place; when it begins to rot, it is cut in
                    pieces, the pulp is allowed to ferment, and the seeds are then washed from it
                    with water, those which float being rejected. The seed retains its vitality for
                    a considerable period, and that which has been kept for some years is said to
                    produce the best fruit-bearing plants. The seed-bed for cucumbers is made 3 feet
                    high at the back, and six inches less in front. After its preparation eight or
                    nine days are allowed to elapse before the seed is sown. The tops of tjιe young
                    plants are kept at a distance of 6 or 8 inches from the glass of the frame by
                    lowering from time to time the pots in which they grow. By pinching off the
                    leading shoot that rises at the base of the petiole, fresh shoots are made to
                    proceed from the base of the seed-leaves; these are in their turn nipped back
                    when the length of two joints. Plants grown in winter in frames and hot-houses
                    are given as much light and air as possible, and care is taken not to supply
                    them with very cold water. On account of their expense, dung-beds have been
                    generally superseded by hot-beds for the growth of cucumbers. The cucumber is a
                    common vegetable in all parts of India; in the cold season it is cultivated in
                    the grain-fields, and in summer in the sandy beds and islands of rivers. In
                    Cashmere, as in China and Persia, cucumbers and melons are grown in the lakes on
                    floats formed by cutting through, at about 2 feet under the water, the roots of
                    sedges, reeds, and other aquatic plants, which, being pressed together, are made
                    to form a bed about 2 yards in breadth, and of indefinite length. The heads of
                    the plants are next cut off, laid upon its surface, and covered with a thin coat
                    of mud. The float is moored in its place by a stake of willow driven through it
                    at each end,, and confervae and weeds from the bottom of the lake are piled on
                    it in conical mounds about 2 feet in height, and 2 feet broad at the base, and
                    having a hollow at the top filled with soft mud, in which the young cucumber and
                    melon plants are placed. No further labour is requisite save that of gathering
                    the fruit (Moorcroft, <hi rend="italic">Journ.</hi><hi rend="italic">R.
                    Geog.</hi><hi rend="italic">Soc.,</hi> ii. p. 258).</p>
                <p>The varieties of the common cucumber are exceedingly numerous, and constantly
                    changing. Among the longer sorts may be mentioned Dale’s Conqueror, Blue Gown,
                    and Hamilton’s Invincible. Though generally eaten as a salad or pickled, the
                    cucumber is used in the preparation of various cooked dishes, and is
                    occasionally preserved. The juice is said to be an ingredient in some pomades
                    and cosmetics. For pickling, the young unripe fruit, or gherkins, and the
                    Russian variety are employed. Cucumbers were much esteemed by the ancients.
                    According to Pliny (xix. 23), the Emperor Tiberius was supplied with them daily,
                    both in summer and winter. Naudin enumerates thirteen well-determined and eight
                    doubtful species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Cucumis.</hi> Of one of these,
                    <hi rend="italic">C. Figarei,</hi> he describes five, and of another, <hi
                    rend="italic">C. Melo,</hi> or the melon, no less than thirty varieties. Among
                    the latter is the <hi rend="italic">C. Chate</hi> of Linnaeus, the fruit of
                    which is supposed to be the same as the <hi rend="italic">kishuim</hi> or
                    “cucumbers” of the Scriptures (Num. xi. 5; Isa. i. 8; Baruch vi. 70). Forskal
                    describes the plant as follows :—“Stalks smooth, with rigid bristles; leaves
                    lobed, scabrous on both sides, with obtuse angles; fruit, hairy when young,
                    smooth when old, attenuated at both ends.” The fruit, he tells us, is common in
                    Egypt, where it is grown in the open fields. By many a drink is prepared from it
                    when ripe. The pulp is broken and stirred by means of a stick thrust through a
                    hole cut at the umbilicus of the fruit; the hole is then closed with wax, and
                    the fruit, without removing it from its stem, is buried in a little pit; after
                    some days the pulp is found to be converted into an agreeable liquor <hi

                    Owing to the exmosis of the juice of the fruit through the strong cortical
                    tissue that lines its central cavity, a pressure is accumulated sufficient to
                    cause the severance of the fruit from its peduncle, and the consequent sudden
                    ejection of its contents. The <hi rend="italic">Cucumis</hi><hi rend="italic"
