                    Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. After a few years he took holy orders and
                    -was appointed domestic chaplain to the bishop of Durham. At the close of 1624
                    he was made a prebendary of Durlιam, and in the following year archdeacon of the
                    East Riding of Yorkshire. Before this time he had married, and in 1628 he took
                    his degree of D.D. He first became known as an author in 1627, when he published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Collection of Private Devotions,</hi> a manual stated to
                    have been prepared by command of the king, Charles I., for the use of the maids
                    of honour to the queen. This book, in connection with his insistence on points
                    of ritual in his cathedral church and his friendship with Bishop Laud, exposed
                    him to the suspicion and hostility of the Puritans; and the book was rudely
                    handled by Prynneand Burton (who both, nine years later, were set in the pillory
                    and mutilated for their free speeches on other matters). In the year following
                    this publication Cosin took part in the prosecution of Prebendary Smart for a
                    sermon against Papistical bishops and priests and practices; and the prebendary
                    was deprived. In 1634 Cosin was appointed master of Peterhouse, Cambridge; and
                    in 1640 he became vice-chancellor of the university. In October of this year he
                    was promoted to the deanery of Peterborough. A few days before his installation
                    the Long Parliament had met; and among the complainants who hastened to appeal
                    to it for redress was the ex-prebendary, Smart. His petition against the new
                    dean was considered; and early in 1641 Dr Cosin was sequestered from his
                    benefices. Articles of impeachment were, two months later, presented against
                    him, but he was dismissed on bail, and was not again called for. He took part,
                    in 1642, in sending the university plate to the king, and was for this offence
                    deprived of the mastership of Peterhouse. He thereupon withdrew to France,
                    preached at Paris, served as chaplain to some members of the household of the
                    exiled royal family, and at the Restoration he returned to England. He was
                    reinstated in the mastership, restored to all his church benefices, and in a few
                    months raised to the see of Durham (December 1660). This dignity he enjoyed for
                    about eleven years; and during this time he applied a large share of his
                    revenues to the promotion of the interests of the church, of schools, and of
                    charitable institutions. He died in London, January 15, 1672.</p>
