                    >familias.</hi> The Wordsworths at Grasmere were their neighbours; and the
                    children of the three families grew up together. Wordsworth, in his poem, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Triad,</hi> has left us a description, or “poetical
                    glorification,” as Sara Coleridge calls it, of the three girls—his own daughter
                    Dora, Edith Southey, and Sara Coleridge, the “last of the three, though eldest
                    born.” Greta Hall was Sara Coleridge’s home until her marriage; and the little
                    Lake colony of poetical and speculative genius seems to have been her only
                    school. Guided by Southey, and w ith his ample library at her command, she read
                    by herself the chief Greek and Latin classics, and before she was
                    five-and-twenty had learnt French, German, Italian, and Spanish.</p>
                <p>In 1822 Sara Coleridge published a translation in three large volumes of
                    Dobrizhoffer’s <hi rend="italic">Account of the Ábipones,</hi> undertaken in
                    connection with Southey’s <hi rend="italic">Tale of Paraguay,</hi> which had
                    been suggested to him by Dobrizhoffer’s volumes; and Southey alludes to his
                    niece, the translator (canto iii. stanza 16), where he speaks of the pleasure
                    the old missionary w ould have felt if</p>
                <p>“ . . . .he could in Merlin’s glass have seen</p>

                    about the <hi rend="italic">Tale of Paraguay to</hi> Southey in 1825, says, “How
                    she Dobrizhoffered it all out, puzzles my slender Latiuity to conjecture.” In
                    1825 her second work appeared, a translation from the mediaeval French, in 2
                    volumes, called <hi rend="italic">The Right Joyous and Pleasant History of the
                    Feats, Jests, and</hi><hi rend="italic">Prouesses</hi><hi rend="italic">of the
                    Chevalier Bayard, the Good Knight without Fear and without Reproach: By the
                    Loyal Servant.</hi></p>
                <p>In September 1829, at Crosthwaite Church, Keswick, after an engagement of seven
                    years’ duration, Sara Coleridge was married to her cousin, Henry Nelson
                    Coleridge, then a Chancery barrister in London. The first eight years of her
                    married life were spent in a little cottage on Downshire Hill, in the town of
                    Hampstead. There four of her children were born, of whom two survived. In 1834
                    Mrs Coleridge published her <hi rend="italic">Pretty Lessons in Verse for Good
                    Children; with some Lessons in Latin in Easy Rhyme.</hi> These were originally
                    written for the instruction of her own children. On their publication they
                    became very popular; aud a new edition has been lately published by Henry S.
                    King &amp; Co. In 1837 the Coleridges removed to Chester Place, Regent’s Park;
                    and in the same year appeared <hi rend="italic">Phantasmion, a Fairy Tale,</hi>
                    Sara Coleridge’s longest original work. An edition of this also was published in
                    1874 by Henry S. King &amp; Co., with a preface by Lord-Chief-Justice Coleridge.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Songs of Phantasmion</hi> were much admired at the time by
                    Leigh 1 I unt and other critics; and Mr Justice Coleridge is not afraid to say
                    of them in his preface that they are “surely worthy of any great lyrical
                    writer.” Without meriting such praise as this, however, some of these songs,
                    such as “Sylvan Stay” and “One Face Alone,” are extremely graceful and musical,
                    and the whole fairy tale is noticeable for the beauty of the story and the
                    richness of its language.</p>
                <p>In 1843 Mr Henry Coleridge died, leaving to his widow the unfinished task of
                    editing her father’s works. To these she added some compositions of her own,
                    among which are the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Rationalism, with a special
                    application to the Doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration,</hi> appended to
                    Coleridge’s <hi rend="italic">Aids to Reflection,</hi> a Preface to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays on his Own Times, by</hi><hi rend="italic">S.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">T. Coleridge,</hi> and the Introduction to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biographia Literaria.</hi> During the last few years of her life Sara Coleridge
                    was a confirmed invalid. Shortly before she died she amused herself by writing a
                    little autobiography for her daughter. This, which reaches only to her ninth
                    year, was completed by her daughter, and published in 1873, together with some
                    of her letters, under the title <hi rend="italic">Memoirs and Letters of Sara
                    Coleridge.</hi> These letters show a cultured and highly speculative mind. They
                    contain many apt criticisms of known people and books, and are specially
                    interesting for their allusions to Wordsworth and the Lake Poets. Sara Coleridge
                    died at Chester Place, May 3, 1852, and was buried by the side of her father,
                    mother, and husband, in Highgate churchyard.</p>
