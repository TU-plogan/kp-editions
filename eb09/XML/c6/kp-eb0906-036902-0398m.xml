                <p>“Coral-Animals” are included all those members of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actinozoa</hi> which have the power of secreting hard structures of the nature
                    of a skeleton. Whether this skeleton be continuous or discontinuous, of
                    conspicuous dimensions or simply of microscopic spicula, it constitutes what is
                    known properly as the “coral” or “corallum;” and the animals which produce it
                    are the so-called “Coralligenous Zoophytes” <hi rend="italic">(Actinozoa
                    Coralligena).</hi> The class of the <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa</hi> is one of
                    the primary divisions of the sub-kingdom of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coelenterata,</hi> or Radiated Animals; and those forms of the class which
                    secrete a corallum belong to the orders of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoantharia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Rugosa,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcyonaria.</hi> No corallum is ever produced in the order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ctenophora,</hi> and many members of the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi> are
                    either destitute of a skeleton or have but an imperfect one, whilst the corallum
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Alcyonaria</hi> is also often rudimentary. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Ctenophora,</hi> therefore, will be wholly omitted here; and only
                    those members of the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcyonaria</hi> in which a well-developed corallum is present, will be
                    considered at any length,—the soft-bodied forms requiring no notice except in so
                    far as they serve to elucidate the peculiarities of the Coralligenous
                    groups.</p>
                <p>The class of the <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa</hi> comprises those Coelenterate
                    animals in which the space included within the body-walls is divided into an
                    inner “gastric” cavity or stomach and an outer “perivisceral” cavity. The
                    gastric sac is short and is open below, so that the perivisceral cavity freely
                    communicates with the outer world through the mouth, and the two cavities become
                    practically one. The perivisceral cavity, in turn, is divided into a series of
                    compartments by the development of a series of vertical membranous plates (the
                    “mesenteries”), which are arranged in a radiating manner between the walls of
                    the gastric sac and the wall of the body. The reproductive organs are not
                    external, but are attached to the faces of the mesenteries, and shed their
                    contents into the body-cavity. The ova reach the external medium either through
                    the mouth or through the ends of the tentacles.</p>
                <p>The class of the <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa</hi> is divided into four orders,
                    viz., the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi> (Sea-Anemones, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Madreporaria,</hi> &lt;fcc.), the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Cyathophyllum,Zaphrentis,</hi> &amp;c.), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcyonaria</hi> (Red Coral, Sea-Pens, Sea-Shrubs, Organ-pipe Corals, &lt;fcc.),
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Ctenophora (Beroë, Pleurobrachia,</hi> Venus’s Girdle,
                    &amp;c.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Order</hi> I.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoantharia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Hexacoralla).</hi></p>
                <p>The members of this order are distinguished by the fact that the intermesenteric
                    chambers and tentacles are generally and fundamentally six in number, or some
                    multiple of six, however largely they may be subsequently increased, whilst the
                    tentacles are simple, rounded, or conical, not fringed with lateral processes.
                    The corallum may be wholly absent <hi rend="italic">(Actinidae),</hi> spicular
                    <hi rend="italic">(Zoanthidce),</hi> in the form of an internal axis or
                    “sclerobasis” <hi rend="italic">(Antipathidae),</hi> or “sclerodermic,” with a
                    distinct wall, and generally distinct septa (as in the Madrepores, and the
                    “Stone-corals” generally). According to the nature of the skeletal structures
                    the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi> are divided into the three groups of the
                    <hi rend="italic">malacodermata, sclerobasica,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sclerodermata.</hi><hi rend="italic">Zoantharia malacodermata.—</hi> In this
                    section are the animals commonly known as Sea-Anemones, in which there is either
                    no skeleton at all <hi rend="italic">(Actinidae),</hi> or simply a discontinuous
                    pseudo-skeleton composed of minute adventitious spicules scattered through the
                    integuments <hi rend="italic">(Zoanthidae).</hi> Though possessing nothing that
                    would ordinarily be termed a “coral,” it may be well to insert here a general
                    description of the anatomy of the Sea-Anemones, as they are readily accessible
                    for study, and may be regarded as being fundamentally identical in the structure
                    of their soft parts with the coralligenous <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia,</hi> as
                    well (probably) as with the extinct <hi rend="italic">Rugosa.</hi></p>
                <p>The true Sea-Anemones <hi rend="italic">(Actinia, Tealia, Actinoloba,
                    Sagartza,</hi> &amp;c.) are under ordinary circumstances simple animals, but
                    some closely allied forms <hi rend="italic">(Zoanthus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paly th oa)</hi> form compound growths or colonies, which are produced by
                    budding, and consist of numerous polypes united by a fleshy base or coenosarc.
                    In the simple forms the body is generally a short cylinder or truncated cone
                    (the “column”), usually of a fleshy or leathery consistence, and capable of
                    undergoing great variations in shape. The lower extremity of the column usually
                    forms a flattened discoidal area (the “base”), whereby the animal attaches
                    itself at will to foreign bodies. The base, however, may be wholly non-adherent,
                    pointed <hi rend="italic">(Ily</hi><hi rend="italic">an thus),</hi> thin,
                    distensible, and imperforate <hi rend="italic">(Edwardsia),</hi> or swollen,
                    rounded, and pierced with a distinct orifice <hi rend="italic">(Peachia</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Cerianthus).</hi> The upper surface of the column constitutes
                    a circular flattened area (the “disc ”), which carries the tentacles round its
                    margin, and is perforated centrally by the aperture of the mouth.</p>
                <p>In size the Sea-Anemones vary from less than a sixth of an inch up to 2 feet in
                    diameter; and their habits of life are very various. Generally they attach
                    themselves by the muscular base to foreign bodies, in rock-pools, at low-water
                    mark, or extending to considerable depths. Others, again (such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Peachia, Halcampa,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Edwardsia),</hi>
                    live more or less completely buried in the sand; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cerianthus</hi> has the same habit, and further protects the body by the
                    secretion of a loose, membranous, non-adherent tube; whilst <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arachnactis</hi> is free-swimming and pelagic.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">integuments</hi> of the Sea-Anemones consist of an outer
                    layer (“ectoderm ”), an inner layer (“endoderm ”), and a more or less largely
                    developed intermediate layer (“mesoderm ”), each of which may in turn be
                    differentiated into successive more or less distinguishable strata. The ectoderm
                    is composed of an exterior stratum of ciliated epithelial cells, a granular
                    stratum crowded with “thread-cells,” and a stratum of pigment to which the
                    brilliant coloration so characteristic of these animals is due. The peripheral
                    epithelial cells are constantly being thrown off from the surface as a viscid
                    mucus, which may entangle foreign bodies and form a species of investing tube.
                    In other cases <hi rend="italic">(Tealia, Bunodes),</hi> the surface is studded
                    with adhesive vesicular warts, by means of which the integument obtains <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n399/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0399-0370"/> an adventitious coat of fragments of shell,
                    grains of sand, and small pieces of stone. The mesoderm is essentially composed
                    of two layers of muscular fibres, those of the outer layer having a circular
                    direction, whilst those of the inner layer are longitudinal in the column and
                    become radial in the base and disc. The endoderm is likewise double in its
                    composition, its inner stratum being formed of ciliated epithelial cells.</p>
                <p>The “thread-cells” (cnidae or nematocysts), which are so abundantly developed in
                    the integument of the Sea-Anemones, are microscopic organs of offence and
                    defence. Though differing very much in size and in the details of structure in
                    different species, the thread-cells consist essentially of an elastic do
                    able-walled sac, one extremity of which is invaginated and carries a long, often
                    serrated or spinose filament, which lies coiled up in the interior of the sac.
                    On the slightest pressure the sac is instantaneously everted, and the lasso-like
                    thread in its interior is shot forth with the rapidity of lightning, having the
                    power of penetrating any soft body with which it may come in contact, and
                    apparently inflicting an envenomed puncture.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">organs of prehension</hi> of the Sea-Anemones are the
                    “tentacles” <hi rend="italic">(tentacula).</hi> These are hollow, smooth,
                    conical or filiform organs, arranged around the margin of *the disc in one or
                    more successive circles. The walls of the tentacles are formed of the general
                    integuments of the body, and each communicates inferiorly with an
                    intermesenteric chamber, and is thus filled with fluid derived from the general
                    cavity of the body. They are capable of extension and retraction, and their
                    extremities are commonly perforated, though sometimes swollen and impervious <hi
                    rend="italic">(Corynactis, Caryophyllia).</hi> They are abundantly furnished
                    with thread-cells, and are, therefore, organs of touch as well as of prehension.
                    Except in some cases, where one or more tentacles may be aborted, the number of
                    the tentacles seems to be primitively six, and remains some multiple of this
                    during life,— the number of these organs being increased by the development of
                    successive cycles arranged in concentric and alternating circles. The primitive
                    cycle consists of <hi rend="italic">six</hi> tentacles, the second cycle also of
                    <hi rend="italic">six,</hi> the third cycle of <hi rend="italic">twelve,</hi>
                    the fourth cycle of <hi rend="italic">twenty-four,</hi> the fifth of <hi
                    rend="italic">forty-eight,</hi> and so on, the number of each cycle being
                    invariably double that of the preceding cycle, except in the case of the second
                    cycle. Though it has been generally accepted that the number of the tentacles is
                    primitively six in the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharιa</hi> (hence often called <hi
                    rend="italic">Hexactiniae),</hi> and that their increase is as above stated,
                    grave doubts have of late arisen as to the correctness of this view. According
                    to Lacaze-Duthiers, the primitive tentacles are first two in number, then four,
                    then six, then eight, and finally twelve (in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actiniae).</hi> According, also, to competent observers (Gosse, Fischer, and
                    others) the adult Sea-Anemones by no means invariably possess tentacles which
                    are a multiple of six, or even of five. On the contrary, various species have
                    tentacles which are a multiple of eight, whilst in others the numerical
                    arrangement of the tentacles seems to belong to an indeterminate type. Though
                    showing a marked radiate arrangement, it will be subsequently shown, in speaking
                    of the mesenteries, that even the tentacles occasionally show distinct traces of
                    bilateral symmetry.</p>
                <p>Internal to the circle of tentacles, the upper surface of the disc exhibits a
                    more or less conspicuous flattened area (“peristomial space ”), which is
                    destitute of appendages, but is marked with converging lines (“radii”), which
                    start from the bases of the tentacles and meet round the mouth, and which
                    represent the upper attached edges of the mesenteries. In the centre of the
                    peristomial space, often at the summit of a kind of proboscis, is placed the
                    opening of the oval or fissure-like <hi rend="italic">mouth.</hi> The angles of
                    the mouth are furnished with grooves (“gonidial grooves”), which serve as
                    channels for the conveyance of the ova to the exterior. The mouth opens by the
                    intervention of a short corrugated and folded <hi rend="italic">gullet</hi> into
                    a membranous <hi rend="italic">stomach,</hi> with thin muscular walls, usually
                    descending about one-third of the distance towards the base. The stomach, when
                    distended, is of a globular form, and it opens inferiorly directly into the
                    general cavity of the body, by a wide patulous opening. "When not in use, the
                    walls of the stomach are in contact; its sides exhibit the downward continuation
                    of the oral gonidial grooves. In some forms, a layer of coloured fat-cells is
                    developed in the walls of the stomach towards its upper portion, and this is
                    conjectured by Mr Gosse to represent the <hi rend="italic">liver.</hi> No other
                    distinct alimentary organs exist, and indigestible matters are got rid of
                    through the moutíi.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">general cavity of the body</hi> (“somatic cavity ”) freely
                    communicates with the external medium through the stomachic sac and mouth, and
                    is bounded externally by the integuments, and lined by the endoderm. The space
                    thus formed is subdivided into a series of chambers or compartments by a number
                    of radiating vertical membranous laminae, to which the name of “mesenteries” is
                    given. The mesenteries are essentially double, each being composed of an inward
                    reduplication of the muscular mesoderm, covered by the endoderm, and they vary
                    greatly in width. The first-formed and widest mesenteries (“primary mesenteries
                    ”) are attached by the whole of their <hi rend="italic">outer</hi> edges to the
                    column-wall, by their <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> edges to the disc from its
                    margin to the mouth, and by their <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> edges to the base
                    from the circumference to the centre. The <hi rend="italic">inner</hi> edges of
                    the primary mesenteries are attached to the sides of the stomach, from the mouth
                    almost to its inferior opening; but below this point they present a free, curved
                    margin, which looks inwards towards the centre of the visceral chamber, being
                    ultimately continued to the centre of the base. Between the primary mesenteries
                    are developed other shorter laminae, which agree with the preceding in being
                    attached externally along their whole length to the column-wall, but which do
                    not extend sufficiently far inwards to reach the walls of the stomach, According
                    to their width these are known as “secondary” and “tertiary” mesenteries. The
                    primitive number of the primary mesenteries is normally <hi rend="italic"
                    >six,</hi> and the development of the remaining mesenteries is effected by the
                    same law as governs the development of the tentacles. Thus the second <pb

                    number of these organs present in the adult is much greater. As already
                    indicated with regard to the tentacles, it cannot be regarded as certain that
                    the hexameral arrangement of the mesenteries, which is so conspicuous a feature
                    in many of the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia,</hi> is by any means universal in
                    the order, or even in the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia malacodermata</hi> in
                    particular. Many of the adult forms, at any rate, appear to invariably possess
                    mesenteries which are not a multiple of six in number. According to the
                    researches of Rötteken and Schneider, the mesenteries are invariably of three
                    orders in the <hi rend="italic">Actiniae,</hi> each individual mesentery being
                    double, and the smallest number of each order that was observed being six of the
                    first cycle, six of the second, and twelve of the third order.</p>
                <p>It is chiefly to the star-like disposition of the mesenteries and tentacles that
                    the Sea-Anemones owe their conspicuous radial symmetry; but indications are not
                    wanting of true bilaterality. Thus a single tentacle may be of a different
                    colour from, or a larger size than the others; the two radii of the disc which
                    correspond with the gonidial grooves and run to the angles of the mouth are
                    often more conspicuous than the other radii; the mouth itself runs fore-and-aft,
                    and divides the body into a right and left half; there may be only a single
                    mouth-angle and gonidial groove <hi rend="italic">(Actinoloba);</hi> and.
                    lastly, two of the mesenteries, corresponding with the opposite mouth angles,
                    are commonly developed before the rest. Even more conspicuous traces of
                    bilateral symmetry which will be subsequently alluded to, are recognizable in
                    many corals.</p>
                <p>The entire body-cavity, with the intermesenteric chambers and tentacular
                    diverticula, is filled with a transparent fluid (“chylaqueous fluid ”), which is
                    to be regarded as the representative of the <hi rend="italic">blood.</hi> It
                    consists of sea-water mixed with the products of digestion, containing albumen
                    in solution along with numerous floating corpuscles, representing the
                    “blood-corpuscles” of the higher animals. There are no proper <hi rend="italic"
                    >circulating organs,</hi> but a free circulation of the chylaqueous fluid
                    through all parts of the body is effected by means of the richly ciliated
                    endoderm which lines all parts of the somatic cavity.</p>
                <p>No distinct <hi rend="italic">respiratory organs</hi> are present, as a rule, the
                    function of respiration being discharged by the ciliated endoderm, as well as by
                    the currents in the external water maintained by the cilia covering the
                    tentacles. In some species, however, which live half-buried in the sand, there
                    are found lobed and frilled organs attached to or beside the tentacles, and
                    these have been conjectured to be branchial (Verrill). In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoanthidae,</hi> aιso, there are found curious paired organs covered with
                    cilia, and attached to the primary mesenteries a little below the stomach; and
                    these may probably be regarded as gills (Dana).</p>
                <p>The free edges of the mesenteries below the stomach are thickened, and constitute
                    a puckered and convoluted marginal cord (“craspedum ”), which is richly
                    furnished with thread-cells. Also attached to the free edges of the mesenteries
                    are sometimes found the organs known as “acontia.” These are long, thread-like
                    filaments, which are only attached by one end to the mesentery, and are crowded
                    with thread-cells. The acontia seem to be undoubtedly organs of offence and
                    defence, as they can, on irritation, be rapidly shot forth from the mouth, as
                    well as from certain minute orifices in the body-wall (cinclides) which appear
                    to be specially intended for their emission.</p>
                <p>Specialized <hi rend="italic">organs of the senses</hi> are either wanting in the
                    Sea-Anemones, or only present in a rudimentary condition. Tactile sensibility,
                    though well developed, is generally diffused over the surface, residing more
                    particularly in the tentacles. Organs of hearing are wholly unknown. As regards
                    the sense of sight, many species possess round the margins of the disc a series
                    of brightly-coloured bead-like bodies (“marginal spherules,” “bourses
                    marginales,” or “chromatoph ores ”), which are said to be furnished with nervous
                    filaments, and which may with great probability be regarded as imperfect organs
                    of vision. The condition of the <hi rend="italic">nervous system</hi> is still a
                    matter of great obscurity, and its very existence has generally been considered
                    as doubtful. According, however, to recent researches (Duncan), it would appear
                    that a plexiform arrangement of nerve fibres can be detected in the base of <hi
                    rend="italic">Actinia,</hi> a similar nervous apparatus probably existing in the
                    disc as well.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">reproductive organs</hi> are in the form of thickened
                    bands, of an orange or pink colour, enclosed in the mesenteries near their free
                    edges, and the ovaries and testes are similar to one another in form and
                    structure, differing only in their contents. As a rule, the sexes appear to be
                    distinct, but in some forms they are united in the same individual. The
                    reproductive elements escape into the body-cavity by dehiscence of the
                    reproductive glands, but the precise manner in which the ova of the dioecious
                    species are fertilized has not been determined. In addition to true sexual
                    reproduction, increase is sometimes effected, non-sexually, by gemmation or
                    fission. Gemmation is rare amongst the Sea-Anemones, the new polypes being
                    budded forth from the sides of the parents close to the base, and being finally
                    detached as independent animals. Fission is not by any means so rare, and may
                    either take place by a longitudinal cleavage of the original polype into two
                    wholly or partially independent individuals <hi rend="italic">(Antheus</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Actinia),</hi> or by the separation of portions of the margins
                    of the base of the parent, and by the development of these into new polypes <hi
                    rend="italic">(Actinoloba,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sagartid).</hi></p>
                <p>As regards their <hi rend="italic">development,</hi> the fecundateα ovum becomes
                    converted into an ovate, ciliated, actively locomotive embryo (“planula ”), with
                    a double wall enclosing a central cavity. A depression next appears at one
                    extremity, indicating the future mouth, and the embryo passes into the
                    “gastrula” stage, by the opening up of a communication between its central
                    cavity and the exterior medium, or by invagination on itself, it being still
                    uncertain which of these modes is employed. The gastrula now fixes itself by one
                    extremity to some foreign body, and the primitive mesenteries and tentacles are
                    developed. These are originally six in number; but according to Lacaze-Duthiers
                    the first and second cycles (tw elve in all) are developed by passing
                    successively through the numbers two, four, six, and eight. The remaining cycles
                    of tentacles and mesenteries are rapidly added, until the animal attains the
                    full number of these organs proper to the adult.</p>
                <p>As to the <hi rend="italic">geographical distribution</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zoantharia malacodermata</hi> little need be said, as the members
                    of this group, taken as a whole, are cosmopolitan in their range. They are,
                    however, pre-eminently characteristic of the littoral and laminarian zones, only
                    very few forms, and these not typical Sea-Anemones, extending to depths of over
                    500 fathoms <hi rend="italic">(Palythoa),</hi> and one genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Arachnactis)</hi> being pelagic. As to their <hi rend="italic">distribution in
                    time,</hi> nothing at all can be said, as, from the soft nature of their bodies,
                    they have left no traces of their past existence.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic">malacodermata</hi> may be
                    divided into the following three families :—</p>
                <p>Fam. I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Actinidae.</hi> —Polypes essentially simple, the
                    base forming a flattened sucker by means of which the animal adheres at pleasure

                <p>Fam. III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoanthidae.</hi> —Polypes adherent, united by a
                    creeping or crust-like caenosarc, rarely solitary, and never capable of
                    locomotion. No true corallum, but generally a pseudoskeleton formed by
                    adventitious particles of sand or stone imbedded in the ectoderm. <hi

                    >Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic">scier</hi><hi rend="italic">obasica.—</hi> The
                    “Black Corals,” or <hi rend="italic">Antipathidae,</hi> which comprise this
                    group, are always composite, consisting of a number of polypes united together
                    by a thin fleshy caenosarc, which is spread over and supported by a simple or
                    commonly branched horny axis, or “sclero base.” The tissues are not furnished
                    with calcareous secretions, and the polypes have in general six simple
                    tentacles.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Antìpathidae</hi> form colonies which are attached by the
                    base to some foreign object, and are generally more or less branched and
                    plant-like. The colony consists of a thin fleshy crust or caenosarc, in which
                    the minute polypes are imbedded at intervals. The polypes are furnished with six
                    simple conical tentacles each, though in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gerardia</hi> as many as twenty-four of these organs may be present. The soft
                    tissues appear to be wholly destitute of calcareous secretions of any kind, such
                    as are found in the <hi rend="italic">Gorgonidae.</hi> The entire caenosarc,
                    with its imbedded polypes, is supported by a horny <hi rend="italic"
                    >corallum,</hi> which is generally black in colour, and forms an axis or stem
                    covered by the soft parts. The corallum is secreted by the caenosarc, and is
                    wholly external to the polypes, for which reason it constitutes what is
                    technically called a “sclerobasis” or “sclerobasic corallum” (“foot-secretion”
                    of Mr Dana), in contradistinction to the true tissue secretions of so many other
                    <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa.</hi> In some instances <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cirrhipathes)</hi> the sclerobasis is simple and unbranched, and may attain a
                    length of several feet; but it is more commonly branched in a more or less
                    plantlike and complicated manner <hi rend="italic">(Antipathes,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Arachnopathes, Rhipidopathes).</hi> The surface of the corallum
                    may be smooth <hi rend="italic">(Leiopathes)</hi>; but it is more commonly
                    covered with minute spines <hi rend="italic">(Antipathes),</hi> being thus
                    readily distinguished from the grooved or striated sclerobasis of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gorgonidae.</hi> In composition the corallum is horny.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Antipathidae</hi> constitute the only known family of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia sclerobasica,</hi> as most naturalists are now
                    agreed that the “Glass-rope Zoophytes” <hi rend="italic">(Hyalonemadae),</hi>
                    with their twisted siliceous axis, are truly referable to the sponges. As
                    regards their <hi rend="italic">distribution in space,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antipathidae</hi> are principally inhabitants of warm seas, and
                    are, therefore, most abundant in the neighbourhood of the equator. Several
                    species are known from the Mediterranean; they have been found at various points
                    in the North Atlantic; and they have even been recorded from the coasts of
                    Greenland. They occur in depths of from 10 feet up to several hundred fathoms.
                    As regards their <hi rend="italic">distribution in time,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antipathidae</hi> are not known to have come into existence during
                    the Palaeozoic or Mesozoic period. They appear for the first time in the Miocene
                    Tertiary, where they are represented by a single species <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Leiopathes</hi><hi rend="italic">vetusta).</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic">sclerodermata</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Madreporaria).—</hi> This group includes the majority of the coralligenous
                    zoophytes of recent seas. They may be simple, consisting of a single polype
                    only, or composite, consisting of many polypes united by a fleshy caenosarc.
                    They always possess a corallum, which is partially or wholly developed within
                    the tissues of the polypes themselves (“sclerodermic ”), which does not consist
                    simply of scattered spicules, and in which the parts are so very generally
                    disposed in multiples of six as to justify the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hexacoralla</hi> applied to the group.</p>
                <p>The anatomy of the soft parts of the simple <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sclerodermata</hi> may be considered as practically identical with
                    that of the Sea-Anemones; and the compound forms may be regarded as being
                    essentially composed of a number of actinoid polypes united by a common flesh or
                    caenosarc. It will, therefore, be unnecessary to treat here of more than the
                    leading peculiarities of the hard parts, or “corallum,” from which these
                    organisms derive their common name of “corals.”</p>
                <p>An ordinary simple coral of this group may, then, be regarded as being
                    essentially a Sea-Anemone, in which a more or less complicated skeleton has been
                    developed. As in the Sea-Anemones, the animal possesses a column, a base, and a
                    disc, the margin of the disc supporting the tentacles, and its centre being
                    perforated by the aperture of the mouth. The mouth, often more or less
                    proboscidiform, opens into a stomachal sac, the walls of which are connected
                    with the parietes of the body by vertical folds of the mesoderm and endoderm
                    (“mesenteries ”), and which communicates freely below with the general cavity of
                    the body. Within the mesenteries are contained the reproductive organs; and the
                    disc, with its tentacles and dependent gastric sac, is permanently soft and
                    capable of retraction and expansion. Below the stomach the soft tissues of the
                    animal are strengthened and supported by a more or less perfect calcareous
                    skeleton or corallum. This is composed of calcareous matter (“sclerenchyma”)
                    deposited by and in the tissues themselves, and the corallum is therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">within</hi> the polype, and is said to be “sclerodermic.” It is
                    thus a true “tissue-secretion,” and differs very conspicuously from the
                    “sclerobasis” of other <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa (“</hi> foot-secretion” of
                    Dana), which is secreted by the caenosarc, and is not formed by a calcification
                    of the soft parts of the polypes themselves. A typical simple corallum may be
                    regarded as a cone, sometimes extremely depressed, sometimes so elongated as to
                    be almost a cylinder, with an outer wall and an internal included space. The
                    wall of the cone is known as the “theca,” and it may be very imperfect, or it
                    may be covered externally more or less completely with a secondary calcareous
                    investment (the “epitheca ”). The theca encloses a space which is known as the
                    “visceral chamber,” is variously subdivided inferiorly, and superiorly presents
                    itself as a shallower or deeper cup-shaped depression (the “calice ”). The
                    centre of the calice is hollowed out for the reception and protection of the
                    stomach-sac of the polype, but the theca generally rises round its margins
                    nearly to the level of the disc. Below the calice the visceral chamber is
                    divided into a series of vertical compartments (the “interseptal loculi ”) by a
                    series of upright partitions or “septa,” which spring from the inner surface of
                    the theca and are directed inwards towards the centre. The septa are of
                    different breadths. Some of them are much wider than the others, and often
                    extend far enough inwards to meet in the centre of the visceral chamber. These
                    are the “primary septa;” but there are others which fall short of the centre by
                    a greater or less distance, and these are known as the “secondary” and
                    “tertiary” septa, according to their width. The centre of the visceral chamber
                    may or may not be occupied by a variously-formed structure known as the
                    “columella.” In its most typical form the columella is a calcareous rod, which
                    extends from the bottom of the visceral chamber to the floor of the calice, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n402/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0402-0373"/> projecting upwards into the latter, and having
                    the primary septa usually closely connected with it. The continuity of the
                    interseptal loculi is often more or less broken up by the development of
                    incomplete more or less horizontal plates, the “dissepiments,” which stretch
                    from one septum to another; or the septa may be connected by numerous delicate
                    cross-bars (“synaptîculae ”).</p>
                <p>The above expresses the general features of the structure of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >simple</hi> sclerodermic corallum, and it is easy to see that this structure
                    owes its peculiarities to the fact that it has been produced by the
                    calcification of the lower portion of a polype similar in its anatomy to an
                    ordinary Sea-Anemone. Thus, the “theca” of the corallum corresponds to the
                    column-wall of the polype, in the interior of which it is secreted. The “septa,”
                    again, are developed within the mesenteries of the living animal, with which
                    they correspond, and, like the mesenteries, they are “primary,” “secondary,” or
                    “tertiary,” according as they reach the centre or fall short of it by a greater
                    or less distance. It is to be recollected, however, that it is only the inferior
                    portion of the polype which is thus hardened with carbonate of lime. The
                    tentacular disc and mouth are placed at a level higher than the upper margin of
                    the theca, and the digestive sac occupies the calice; whilst the whole of the
                    space comprised within the theca is lined by the endoderm, and its outer surface
                    is covered by the ectoderm.</p>
                <p>Whilst the simple corallum is the skeleton of a single polype, the <hi
                    rend="italic">compoun&lt;Psclerodermιc</hi> corallum is the aggregate skeleton
                    composed by a colony of such polypes, and it varies in form according to the
                    form and nature of the colony by which it is produced. Such a colony consists in
                    general of a number of polypes united together by a common flesh or “coenosarc,”
                    and corresponding elements are found in the corallum. Thus a compound coral
                    consists generally of certain portions which are secreted by the individual
                    polypes of the colony, and are known as the “corallites,” and of a common
                    calcareous basis or tissue, which unites the various corallites into a whole, is
                    secreted by the coenosarc, and is known as the “caenenchyma.” The latter element
                    of a compound corallum is, however, by no means always present, the entire
                    structure often consisting simply of the skeletons of the individual polypes
                    (“corallites ”) united with one another directly and in different ways.</p>
                <p>The compound coralla are, of course, primitively simple, and they become
                    composite either by budding or by cleavage of the original polype. The principal
                    methods in which this increase is effected in the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia
                    scleroder'mata</hi> are the following :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Lateral Gemmation.—</hi> In thia method of increase the
                    original polype throws out buds from some point on its sides between the base
                    and the circle of tentacles. The bud is at first simply a protuberance of the
                    ectoderm and endoderm of the parent, containing in its interior a diverticulum
                    of the somatic cavity; but a mouth and tentacles are developed at its distal
                    extremity, mesenteries and septa appear in its interior, and it gradually
                    assumes all the characters of the polype from which it was budded forth. Lateral
                    or parietal gemmation generally gives rise to dendroid or arborescent coralla,
                    as in the genera <hi rend="italic">Madrepora, Dendrophyllia, Cladocora, Oculina,
                    Lophohelia,</hi> &amp;c., but the precise form of the resulting colony depends
                    on the way in which the buds are given off, regularly or irregularly, singly or
                    in numbers together, alternately or at opposite points, and also on the
                    continuance or arrest of the growth of the parent. In other cases, where the
                    parietal buds are given off from the edge of thecalice (“marginalgemmation”),
                    the resulting corallum may become massive by the soldering together of the
                    separate corallites, as occurs in the genus <hi rend="italic">Astrocaenia,</hi>
                    where the parent corallite continues to grow side by side with its buds.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Basal Gemmation.—</hi> In this mode of growth the original
                    polype gives forth from its base a rudimentary coenosarc from which new buds are
                    thrown up. Sometimes the coenosarc has the form of rootlike prolongations from
                    which the buds are developed at intervals. More commonly, the coenosarc forms a
                    more or less extensive horizontal expansion. The resulting form of corallum
                    varies, being sometimes fasciculate, but more commonly massive or encrusting;
                    and in all cases the youngest corallites are those which occupy the
                    circumference of the mass. Good examples of the process of basilar gemmation are
                    to be found in <hi rend="italic">Rhizangia, Astrangia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Calicular Gemmation.—</hi> This consists in the production
                    of buds from the calicine disc of the parent polype, which may or may not
                    continue to grow thereafter. This mode of increase, though known to occur in
                    forms like <hi rend="italic">Isastraea,</hi> and some of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Montlivaltiae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thccosmiliae,</hi> is very rare
                    amongst the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sclerodermata,</hi> and it may be doubted whether in certain cases it should
                    not rather be regarded as a species of fission. Calicular gemmation, however, is
                    seen in characteristic form amongst many Rugose corals, in treating of which it
                    will be noticed at length.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Fission.—</hi> This consists in a process of spontaneous
                    division or cleavage of the original polype into two individuals. This is
                    usually effected by means of “oral cleavage,” the calicine disc of the parent
                    polype becoming divided into two portions by a groove, which gradually deepens
                    till the original mass is converted into two halves. The proximal extremity of
                    the parent always remains undivided, and, according to Dana, the primitive mouth
                    and stomach are appropriated by one of the halves produced by the fission,
                    whilst a new mouth and stomach are developed in the other half. The form of
                    corallum produced by fission varies in different cases. Sometimes the corallum
                    becomes “caespitose” or tufted, consisting of a number of short diverging pairs
                    of branches, each pair produced by the cleavage of a single corallite <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gaulastraeafi.</hi> In other cases
                    the corallum becomes “massive,” the corallites produced by fission remaining
                    permanently connected with one another. In other cases, again, the secondary
                    corallites do not become perfectly separated from one another, their calices
                    remaining more or less completely continuous, —often so much so as to give rise
                    to one long calicine groove, with a long line of septa on each side, or to an
                    aggregation of such grooves. By this “serial” growth the corallum becomes
                    “gyrate” or “meandriue;” and excellent examples may be found in the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Maeardrina, Diploria, Latimaeandra, Rhipidogyra, Pkytogyra,</hi>
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Finally, it should be noticed that, though the above mentioned modes of growth
                    may be conveniently distinguished from one <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n403/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0403-0374"/> another, they are nevertheless not unfrequently
                    combined in the ⅛ιmβ individual. Thus, lateral may be combined with basal
                    gemmation, and gemmation is commonly found accompanying fission.</p>
                <p>It is next necessary to consider the different structures which compose the
                    sclerodermic corallum in greater detail.</p>
                <p>The general <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of the corallum varies so much, that it
                    is scarcely possible to make any statements on this subject except of an
                    entirely general nature. The simplest corallum is most commonly cylindrical,
                    conical, or turbinate <hi rend="italic">(Cary ophy Ilia, Turbinolia,
                    Balanophyllia,</hi> &amp;c.), but it may be more or less compressed <hi
                    rend="italic">(Flabellum),</hi> discoidal (some species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fungia),</hi> or concavo-convex. It may be rooted by its base to some foreign
                    object, or it may be wholly free. The compound coralla are of the most varied
                    shape. Commonly they are arborescent or dendroid <hi rend="italic">(Madrepora,
                    Dendrophyllia, Lophohelia,</hi> àc.); at other times they grow in clusters of
                    branches springing from a common base <hi rend="italic">(Massa,
                    Caulastraea,</hi> and many species of <hi rend="italic">Forties, Madrepora,</hi>
                    &lt;fcc.), the colony being “caespitose,” and convex on its distal aspect;
                    others are “fasciculate,” or composed of numerous cylindrical corallites placed
                    parallel with one another, or slightly diverging from the base <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Calamophylliaſt</hi>; others are massive and
                    “astraeiform,” composed of polygonal corallites united with one another, and
                    forming rounded, globular, hemispherical, or irregular masses (as in the typical
                    <hi rend="italic">Astraeidae);</hi> others are “foliaceous” (species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Madrepora, Pocillopora, Manopora,</hi> &amp;c.); others, finally,
                    are “encrusting” <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> some of the species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Manopora, Agaricia,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
                <p>The “<hi rend="italic">wall”</hi> (“muraille,” “eigentliche Wand ”) is the proper
                    outer investment of the visceral chamber, whether we consider a simple corallum
                    or take a single corallite in a compound corallum. The hard structures which are
                    placed on the inside of the wall are the “endotheca,” whilst those which are
                    developed exteriorly to the wall constitute what is collectively known as the
                    “exotheca.” The condition of the wall varies greatly in different groups of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia,</hi> being thick, compact, and impervious in some
                    <hi rend="italic">(Aporosa),</hi> and at other times more or less incomplete and
                    pierced by larger or smaller apertures <hi rend="italic">(Perforata).</hi> The
                    surface of the wall may be smooth, or it may be marked with vertical ridges
                    (costae), or by transverse striae or annulations of growth. Though often very
                    distinctly recognizable, the wall may become so united with the caenenchyma as
                    to be no longer determinable, or its place may be more or less completely taken
                    by the epitheca.</p>
                <p>The “<hi rend="italic">epitheca</hi>” is a secondary calcareous investment, which
                    is very commonly developed in both simple and compound coralla, and is probably
                    an integumentary secretion. In the simple coralla it is placed outside the
                    proper wall, to which it may be closely applied, or from which it may be
                    separated by the costae. It may be extremely thin, or very dense; and in the
                    latter case its development is generally at the expense of the wall, which
                    becomes so thin as to be often irrecognizable. It varies also in its extent,
                    sometimes covering only the basal region of the coral, and at other times
                    extending to the margin of the calice. It is generally marked with concentric
                    striae and vertical ridges, often with accretions of growth, and it may give off
                    spines or root-like processes of attachment. In the compound corals it is not
                    unusual to find a well-developed epitheca enclosing the entire corallum below
                    and on the sides, whilst each individual corallite is furnished with its own
                    wall.</p>
                <p>The external surface of the corallum often exhibits more or less prominent
                    vertical ridges, which are known as the “costae.” The costae in a general way
                    correspond with the septa in number and arrangement, and they usually appear,
                    therefore, as so many prolongations of the septa outside the wall. It does not
                    appear, however, that this is due to the septa being really continued through
                    the wall so as to form the costae, but these structures would really seem to
                    have an entirely independent origin. The projection of the costae from the wall
                    is generally proportionate to the development of the septa to which they
                    correspond, and there are great differences in different cases as to their size
                    and distance apart. They may be ornamented with spines or tubercles, and they
                    may be united by transverse plates (“exothecal dissepiments ”), which run
                    horizontally across the intercostal spaces. Sometimes the costae, instead of
                    corresponding with the septa, are placed opposite the interseptal loculi, and
                    are thus seen to be really independent of the septa. In compound coralla the
                    costae are often wanting when the corallites are amalgamated by their walls. In
                    other cases the costae are greatly developed, and serve by their coalescence to
                    unite the various corallites into a single colony.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">“calice”</hi> is the generally cup-shaped depression which
                    is seen at the upper end of a corallum or of a single corallite of a compound
                    mass, and which lodges the gastric sac of the animal in its living
                    condition.</p>
                <p>The “margin” of the calice is formed by the wall, and its “floor” is occupied by
                    the septa, the interseptal loculi, and the central structures of the corallum.
                    Though in general more or less cup-shaped and depressed, the calice may be
                    prominent, and the septa may be produced beyond it (“exsert”). The outline of
                    the calice is very different in different cases, though typically more or less
                    circular; its depth is also extraordinarily variable; and its plane varies much
                    in the angle which it forms with the axis of the corallum. The
                    “se/&gt;ía”(“cloisons,”“Längsscheidewände”), as previously noticed, are the
                    vertical plates which radiate from the wall towards the centre and divide the
                    visceral chamber into a series of vertical chambers or compartments
                    (“interseptal loculi”). The septa correspond with the mesenteries of the living
                    animal, within which they are developed, and the tentacles correspond each with
                    an interseptal space. In their most rudimentary condition the septa appear
                    simply as rows of spines or tubercles, but they in general present themselves as
                    calcareous laminae, which can usually be shown to consist each of two closely
                    apposed plates (in <hi rend="italic">Dasmia</hi> of three), though often so thin
                    and delicate as to appear single. When fully developed, a septum may be regarded
                    as a somewhat triangular lamina, the base of which projects freely into the
                    calice, whilst its outer margin is attached to the internal surface of the wall,
                    and its inner margin is directed towards the centre of the visceral chamber,
                    extending from the bottom of the coral to the floor of the calice, and being
                    either free or united with certain other structures to be spoken of hereafter.
                    Tho free edges of the septa are usually thin, and they may be plain or
                    ornamented with spines, serrations, or granules. The parietal or attached edges
                    of the septa are usually the thickest, but occasionally the septum widens out in
                    the middle or centrally. The <hi rend="italic">sides</hi> of the septa, looking
                    into the interseptal loculi, may be smooth or may be ornamented with ridges,
                    striae, papillae, or granules. The septa may be compact and imperforate, or they
                    may be more or less porous and cribriform. Usually the various septa are quite
                    independent of each other, but occasionally some of the smallest and latest
                    formed septa may become inclined towards, and coalescent with, the larger and
                    older septa.</p>
                <p>The number of septa varies, but in none of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic">sclerodermata,</hi> in which septa are
                    developed at all, are there found less than six septa in the adult corallum.
                    Sometimes this number is permanently retained; sometimes twelve septa are
                    present; most commonly the septa of the adult are over twelve in number. When
                    there are more than six septa then their breadth varies, according as the
                    mesenteries vary, and they thus become “primary,”<pb break="no"

                    “tertiary.” The chief facts which it is important to know about the development
                    and arrangement of the septa are the following, taking the generally received
                    views on this subject. At first six septa make their appearance simultaneously.
                    These are the <hi rend="italic">primary septa,</hi> and they may not be further
                    added to. In other cases six additional and smaller <hi rend="italic">secondary
                    septa</hi> are next produced, one bisecting each of the six interseptal loculi
                    between the primary septa; and this condition may also be permanently retained
                    <hi rend="italic">(Abveopora). In</hi> other cases twelve additional septa are
                    produced in the now existing twelve interseptal loculi, one to each loculus, and
                    these are the <hi rend="italic">tertiary septa.</hi> In a corallum in which this
                    last state of things was permanent, we should, therefore, find twenty-four septa
                    in all, belonging to three <hi rend="italic">orders</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >cycles,</hi> six septa of the <hi rend="italic">first order,</hi> six of the
                    <hi rend="italic">second order,</hi> and twelve of the <hi rend="italic">third
                    order.</hi> Such a corallum has obviously twenty-four interseptal loculi, and we
                    should imagine that the next order of septa (if developed at all) ought to
                    consist of twenty-four septa bisecting these loculi. This is not the case,
                    however, and any further orders of septa that may be produced are always twelve
                    in number. If, therefore, a <hi rend="italic">fourth order</hi> of septa be
                    developed, it consists of twelve shorter septa intercalated in alternate
                    interseptal loculi; whilst the loculi still vacant are filled by the development
                    of twelve additional septa of the <hi rend="italic">fifth order;</hi> the
                    twenty-four septa thus produced collectively constituting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fourth cycle.</hi> The septa between each pair of primary septa constitute a
                    <hi rend="italic">system;</hi> and in the instance just taken there are
                    forty-eight septa in all, arranged in five <hi rend="italic">orders</hi>
                    according to the time of their development, but only constituting four <hi
                    rend="italic">cycles</hi> of equally sized septa, and forming six <hi
                    rend="italic">systems</hi> of eight septa each. Each system contains the
                    following orders: —</p>

                </table>
                <p>If a fifth cycle of septa be formed, then there are 96 septa, in six systems of
                    sixteen septa each. Six cycles give 192 septa, and seven cycles produce 384; but
                    it is far from common for these higher cycles to be completely developed.</p>
                <p>The rule amongst the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sclerodermata</hi> is that the septa are arranged in six systems, and are
                    therefore, however numerous, some multiple of six; but this rule is not of
                    universal application, and the typical hexameral arrangement may be departed
                    from altogether. Thus, certain forms have the primary septa four, five, eight,
                    or ten in number, and, therefore, have the septa of the adult arranged in a
                    corresponding number of systems. It should be added that the researches of
                    Lacaze&lt;Duthiers have given rise to some doubt as to the above being truly the
                    method in which the septa are successively developed. According to this observer
                    the septa are developed before the wall (contrary to the received opinion), and
                    are primitively twelve in number; but it seems clear that though this may be the
                    case in the species examined by the French naturalist, it cannot be true of all
                    the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic">sclerodermata.</hi></p>
                <p>Between the internal edges of the septa and the axis of the visceral chamber
                    there may exist a series of laminar processes to which the name of “<hi
                    rend="italic">pali”</hi> is given. The pali vary in number and size, and they
                    may be developed internal to several orders of the septa, forming so many
                    “crowns.” They are united by their outer edges with the inner edges of the
                    septa, whilst their internal edges are free, or are united with the columella
                    (if present).</p>
                <p>The axis of the visceral chamber may be vacant and unoccupied, but it is very
                    commonly filled by the structure known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >“columella.”</hi> The true or “essential” columella is an axial rod of a
                    lamellar, compact, or fasciculate structure, extending from the bottom of the
                    visceral chamber to the floor of the calice, into which it projects, and formed
                    independently of the septa. The septa may or may not be, some of them, attached
                    by their inner ends tocthe columella, or there may be pali attached to it. A
                    “parietal” or “septal” columella may be formed by the coalescence in different
                    ways of the inner edges of the septa, which divide and inosculate so as to form
                    a spongy or cellular central structure. In other cases a “pseudo-columella” may
                    be produced by the twisting together of the inner ends of a certain number of
                    the septa.</p>
                <p>The continuity of the interseptal loculi is liable to be more or less interfered
                    with by the development of the endothecal structures known as the dissepiments,
                    synapticulae, and tabulae. The “<hi rend="italic">dissepiments"</hi> (“traverses
                    ”) are incomplete, approximately horizontal plates, which stretch between
                    adjacent septa, and break up the interseptal loculi into secondary compartments
                    or cells. They may be absent, or rudimentary, or they may be so greatly
                    developed as to render a greater or less portion of the corallum completely
                    “vesicular,” in the vicinity of the wall more especially.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">tabuloe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >”</hi> (“planchers,” “Boden ”) may be regarded as highly developed
                    dissepiments, and like them are approximately horizontal, as a rule at any rate.
                    They differ from the dissepiments in cutting across the interseptal loculi at
                    the same level. When completely developed they extend right across the visceral
                    chamber, and divide it into a series of stories placed one above the other, the
                    only living portion of the corallum being that above the last formed tabula.
                    They may, however, be present only in the central portion of the corallum, or
                    they may spring from the wall, but not extend across the visceral chamber.
                    Tabulae may exist in conjunction with well-developed septa <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Alυeopo,ra),</hi> or the septa may be rudimentary or absent <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Halysites, Favosites).</hi></p>
                <p>The “<hi rend="italic">synapticulae</hi>” are transverse calcareous bars which
                    stretch across the interseptal loculi, like a kind of trelliswork. They are
                    formed by papillae developed on the opposite faces of adjacent septa, coalescing
                    with one another in the middle of the interseptal loculi. In other cases they
                    may be so greatly developed as to constitute elongated ridges between the septa.
                    They are characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">Fungidae.</hi></p>
                <p>In compound coralla the various corallites of the colony are often united
                    together by a common calcareous tissue, which is known as the “<hi rend="italic"
                    >caenenchymafi</hi> and which varies very much in texture, being sometimes loose
                    and spongy <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Madreporidae),</hi> at
                    other times dense and compact. <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Oculinidae).</hi> In other cases the caenenchyma is absent or rudimentary <hi
                    rend="italic">(Astraeidae, Turbinolidae),</hi> and the corallites are then
                    united together in different ways. In some of the arborescent and fasciculate
                    coralla the corallites are only united with one another at the points where they
                    are budded out; but in other cases <hi rend="italic">(Syringopora,</hi> for
                    example) they may be united by horizontal outgrowths.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n405/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0405-0376"/>
                <p>Sometimes the corallites are simply in contact with one another, or their walls
                    may be fused together, in which case there is a great tendency for the calices
                    to become polygonal by mutual pressure. In other cases, again, the corallites
                    are united together by the great development and coalescence of the costae.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia sclerodermata</hi> were divided by Milne-Edwards
                    and Jules Haime into the four great sections of the <hi rend="italic">Aporosa,
                    Perforata,</hi><hi rend="italic">Tabulata,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tubulosa.</hi> The first two of these groups constitute large, important, and
                    natural divisions, whilst the two latter are of doubtful affinities and
                    uncertain value.</p>
                <p>(1.) The <hi rend="smallcaps">Aporosa</hi> are characterized by the fact that the
                    calcareous tissue of the corallum is more or less compact and imperforate; the
                    septa are well developed, and usually constitute complete lamellae; while the
                    walls are generally quite complete, and, as a rule, are not pierced by any
                    apertures. Dissepiments or synapticulae are usually present, but tabulae are
                    rarely developed. This section includes the most highly developed of existing
                    corals, and it is subdivided by Milne-Edwards and Haime into six families:—</p>

                <p>(2.) The <hi rend="smallcaps">Perforata</hi> are distinguished by the fact that
                    the calcareous tissue of the corallum is more or less porous, loosely
                    aggregated, spongy, or reticulate, the walls in all being perforated with more
                    or fewer apertures. The septa are generally well developed, but may be
                    represented only by trabeculae. The visceral chamber is usually more or less
                    completely open from top to bottom, but there may be imperfect dissepiments, and
                    in some cases well-developed tabulae are present. The section <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perforata</hi> comprises the following families :-</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a. Eupsammidae.</hi> —Corallum simple or compound; septa well
                    developed, lamellar, for the most part perforated; a spongy columella is
                    present; walls perforated, granular, sub-costulate, often thickened with age.
                    Septa numerous, those of the last cycle bent towards those of the penultimate
                    cycle, so as to produce the appearance of a six or twelve-branched star;
                    interseptal loculi open, or only with a few dissepiments; costae rudimentary.
                    The chief genera of this family are <hi rend="italic">Eupsammia
                    Endopachys,</hi><hi rend="italic">Balanopħyllia,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    increasing by gemmation; caenenchyma abundant, spongy, and reticulate; walls
                    porous, not distinct from the caenenchyma; septa often well developed; no
                    synapticulae, and, generally speaking, no dissepiments, but occasionally
                    tabulae. (The diagnosis of this family may require amendment for the reception
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Favositidae</hi> proper). The chief genera of this
                    family are <hi rend="italic">Madrepora, Explanaria, Astrteopora, Turbinaria,

                    from the sclerenchyma; a few dissepiments, but no tabulae. The principal genera

                <p>(3. ) The <hi rend="smallcaps">Tabulata</hi> constitute a group founded by
                    Milne-Edwards and Haime for the reception of a number of corals essentially
                    characterized by the rudimentary condition or absence of septa, conjoined with
                    the presence of well-developed tabulae dividing the visceral chamber into so
                    many distinct stories. Recent researches, however, by Agassiz, Verrill,
                    Lindstrom, Duncan, Dollfus, Moseley, and others, have clearly shown that the old
                    order <hi rend="italic">Tabulata</hi> is a heterogeneous assemblage, comprising
                    forms of very different zoological affinities, and that it must be broken up and
                    redistributed, or greatly restricted. It has been unequivocally shown, in fact,
                    that the presence of tabulae cannot, of itself, be regarded as a point of high
                    classificatory value, since these structures occur in forms in other respects no
                    way related to each other. Thus, tabulae occur in <hi rend="italic">Pocillopora,
                    Cyathophora,</hi> and occasionally in <hi rend="italic">Loplιohelia</hi> amongst
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aporosa,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Alvcopora</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Favositopora</hi> amongst the <hi rend="italic">Perforata,</hi> in
                    <hi rend="italic">Heliopora</hi> amongst the <hi rend="italic">Alcyonaria,</hi>
                    in the great majority of the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa,</hi> andin certain of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa (e.g., Radiopora</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hetaerodictya).</hi> It has also been shown that some of the so-called
                    “tabulate corals” are not <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa</hi> at all, but that they
                    belong to the Molluscan order of the <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa;</hi> and good
                    authorities believe that this is the true position of a very large number of the
                    forms previously included under this head. The whole of this subject is at
                    present under investigation, and the ultimate results of the inquiry are
                    uncertain. It will, therefore, be sufficient here to indicate the views which
                    are now generally entertained as to the true affinities of the principal forms
                    included by Milne-Edwards and Haime amongst the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tabulata.</hi></p>
                <p>The affinities of the great and important reef-building genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Millepora,</hi> are still not absolutely settled. By Professor Louis Agassiz it
                    was taken out of the true corals and placed amongst the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrozoa,</hi> and the most recent researches of Mr Mosely upon the living
                    animal appear to corroborate this view. According to this observer, the spongy
                    corallum is composed of calcareous trabeculae disposed in layers concentric with
                    the surface of the mass, and there is the unique feature that these layers are
                    penetrated by a series of ramifying and anastomosing canals, which communicate
                    with the calicular cavities. There are two kinds of calices in the species
                    examined, large and small, the former being surrounded each by a ring of the
                    latter. The polypes, or zooids, are of two kinds, the larger ones, occupying the
                    large calices, having a mouth and from four to six knobbed tentacles. The
                    smaller zooids are more slender, have no mouth, and have from five to twenty
                    tentacles. Mr Mosely appears to consider that the structure of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Millepora,</hi> as examined by him, is <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoan;</hi> but a
                    recent investigation carried out, on the other hand, by Major-General Nelson and
                    Professor Martin Duncan leads these authors to the opinion that <hi
                    rend="italic">Millepora</hi> is really <hi rend="italic">Alcιjonarian,</hi> and
                    therefore truly referable to the <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa.</hi></p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Heliopora</hi> has recently been examined by Mosely
                    in its living condition, and it has been shown to be <pb break="no"

                    unquestionably be placed the extinct genera <hi rend="italic">Heliolites,
                    Plasmopora, Lyeilia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polytremacis,</hi> all of which
                    have an essentially tubular and tabulate caenenchyma, the corallites having
                    tabulae and more or less distinct pseudosepta. These, therefore, must also be
                    removed to the <hi rend="italic">Alcyonaria.</hi> The genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pocillopora,</hi> as shown by Verrill, is a true <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoantharian,</hi> belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Aporosa,</hi> and
                    apparently referable to the <hi rend="italic">Oculinidae. Seriatopora,</hi>
                    though still imperfectly known, may with great probability be placed in the
                    immediate neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic">Pocillopora;</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhabdopora</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trachypora</hi> may be
                    provisionally grouped along with it. The genus <hi rend="italic">Axopora,</hi>
                    with its great columella, its reticulate sclerenchyma, and its want of septa, is
                    in an extremely uncertain position, but may possibly be <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcyonarian.</hi></p>
                <p>There remain four groups of the <hi rend="italic">Tabulata,</hi> which are in
                    themselves well marked, but which are still in a doubtful position. The first
                    c∙f these is the group of the <hi rend="italic">Favositidae</hi> (comprising <hi
                    rend="italic">Favosites, Em - nonsia, Michelinia, Koninckia, Striatopora,
                    Alveolites,</hi> &amp;c), in which the septa are rudimentary or absent, the
                    tabulae are extremely well developed, and the walls are perforated more or less
                    freely with mural pores. Their septa (when present at all) may be only
                    pseudosepta, like those of the genus <hi rend="italic">Heliopora,</hi> and these
                    forms may perhaps be <hi rend="italic">Alcyonaria.</hi> In their perforated
                    walls, however, they closely resemble the recent genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alveopora</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Favositopora,</hi> and their true
                    affinities would thus seem to be rather with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Madreporidae</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia perforata.</hi> This view
                    is further supported by the occurrence of genera like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Columnopora,</hi> in which the perforated walls and tabulate corallites are
                    associated with comparatively well-developed septa. Another group is that of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Chaetetidae</hi> (comprising <hi rend="italic">Chaetetes,
                    Monticulipora, Dania, Constellaria,</hi> &amp;c., and probably <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fistulipora, Callopora,</hi> and some allied forms), in which the walls of the
                    corallites are imperforate, the tabulae are well developed, and there are no
                    traces of septa. This group is in a most uncertain position, it being an open
                    question whether it should be referred to the <hi rend="italic">Alcyonaria,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa,</hi> or
                    whether it can be retained in the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia.</hi> Though
                    often associated with the <hi rend="italic">Favositidae,</hi> it seems certain
                    that there is little true relationship between the two groups; and the most
                    probable view is perhaps the one which refers the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chaetetidae</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lcyonaria.</hi> The genus <hi rend="italic">Labechia</hi> has not been examined
                    in sufficient detail to render its reference to this group at all certain. A
                    third group is that of the <hi rend="italic">Thccidae,</hi> comprising the
                    single genus <hi rend="italic">Thecia,</hi> in which the corallites have no true
                    Avail, but the costae are greatly developed, and are so filled up as to
                    constitute a dense caenenchyma. The affinities of this group are quite
                    uncertain, though it may be regarded with some probability as belonging to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Alcyonaria.</hi> Lastly, there is a fourth group, comprising
                    the genera <hi rend="italic">Haly sites, Syringopora, Chonostegitcs,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Thecostegites,</hi> with probably <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flctcheria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Beaumontia,</hi> in which there are
                    rudimentary septa (typically twelve in number), well developed tabulae, and
                    imperforate walls. 1 n <hi rend="italic">Syringopora,</hi> though the walls are
                    compact, the visceral chambers of contiguous corallites are placed in
                    communication by means of tubular connecting processes, and there is thus a
                    decided approach to the structure of the <hi rend="italic">Favositidae</hi> on
                    the one hand, whilst, on the other hand, the genus in some respects is nearly
                    allied to <hi rend="italic">Aulopora.</hi> The other genera of this group have
                    no communication between their corallites. If any forms can be retained to
                    constitutea “tabulate” order of the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia,</hi> it would
                    seem to be these; but it is not possible at present to come to any decided
                    conclusion on this point.</p>
                <p>(4). The <hi rend="smallcaps">Tubulosa</hi> constitute a small group, including
                    principally the genera <hi rend="italic">Aulopora</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyrgia,</hi> to which perhaps <hi rend="italic">Clado-ehonus</hi> ana <hi
                    rend="italic">Stomatopora</hi> should be added. The corallum in this group is
                    simple <hi rend="italic">(Pyrgia)</hi> or compound <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Aulopord),</hi> the corallites in the latter case being united by a creeping
                    and branched caenenchyma. The thecae are trumpet-shaped, tubular or pyriform,
                    without tabulae, and having the septa indicated by mere striae on the inner
                    surface of the wall. The affinities of this group are very doubtful, and it
                    seems questionable if it can be retained in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoantharia.</hi> In some respects the forms included under this head show
                    points of relationship with the Cyclostomatous <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa,</hi>
                    such as <hi rend="italic">Alecto;</hi> but it seems more probable that they are
                    really <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa,</hi> and perhaps referable to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alcyonaria.</hi></p>
                <p>As regards their <hi rend="italic">distribution in space,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zoantharia sclerodermata</hi> are, like the other members of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa,</hi> exclusively marine. They are very widely
                    distributed over the globe, occurring in all seas except the coldest, but
                    attaining their maximum development in warm regions. They may convenaently be
                    regarded under two heads—the one comprising the “solitary” corals, whether
                    simple or compound, the other comprising the “reef-building'’ corals. The former
                    do not constitute the great aggregations of coral which are known as “reefs,”
                    and though some of the compound forms may, as individuals, attain a large size,
                    they are destitute of the loose cellular caenenchyma of so many of the
                    reefbuilders, and thus do not tend to increase indefinitely in dimensions. The
                    solitary corals, further, are essentially and principally deep-sea forms, only
                    rarely found in the littoral zone, or at extreme low water, abounding most in
                    depths of from 10 to 200 fathoms, and extending their range even to depths of
                    from 500 to over 1500 fathoms. They may, as already remarked, be either simple
                    or compound, and amongst the more important recent genera which are solely, or
                    chiefly, deep-water forms, may be mentioned <hi rend="italic">Caryophyllia</hi>
                    (rarely found in the littoral zone), <hi rend="italic">Balanophyllia,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Flabellum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sphenotrochus, Paracyathus,

                    rend="italic">Lophohelia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amphihelia.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Coral Reefs.</hi></p>
                <p>The “reef-building” corals are essentially shallow-water forms, flourishing
                    between extreme low-water mark and depths of from 20 to 25 fathoms. By their
                    continued growth and aggregation they give rise to the great banks of coral
                    which are known as “coral-reefs,” the compound species often possessing a lax
                    cellular caenenchyma, enabling them to increase almost indefinitely in size. In
                    other cases they increase rapidly by spontaneous fission. Amongst the more
                    important reef-building corals of the present day may be mentioned the <hi
                    rend="italic">Astraeidae</hi> generally <hi rend="italic">(Astraea, Meandrina,

                <p>The distribution of the reef-building corals seems to depend mainly upon the mean
                    winter temperature of the sea, and they are confined to seas in which the
                    temperature of the water during the winter does not sink on an average below 66°
                    or 68° Fahr. The seas thus limited may be said to be comprised within a distance
                    of about 1800 miles on either side of the equator. Even within these limits,
                    however, apparently owing to the influence of Arctic currents, no coral-reefs
                    are found on the western coasts of Africa and South America. The metropolis of
                    the reef-building corals may be said to be the central Pacific Ocean, with its
                    numerous islands and masses of continental land; <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0407-0378"/> but reefs are also found more or less largely
                    developed in the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the coasts of
                    Zanzibar, Madagascar, and Mauritius, the Gulf of Panama, the coast of Brazil,
                    around the West Indian Islands and the shores of Florida,and around the
                    Bermudas. According to the classification of Darwin, which is essentially the
                    same as that adopted by other authorities, coral-reefs may be separated into
                    three principal groups, viz.: Fringing-reefs, Barrier-reefs, and Atolls. <hi
                    rend="italic">Fringing∙τeefs</hi> are shallow-water reefs, found in the
                    immediate neighbourhood of land, either surrounding islands or skirting the
                    shores of continents. These shore-reefs have no channel of any great depth of
                    water intervening between them and the land, and the soundings on their sea-ward
                    margin indicate that they repose upon a gently-sloping surface. <hi
                    rend="italic">Barrier-reefs,</hi> like the preceding, may either encircle
                    islands or skirt continents. They are distinguished from Fringing-reefs by the
                    fact that they are placed at a much greater distance from the land, that there
                    intervenes a channel of comparatively deep water between them and the shore, and
                    that soundings taken close to their seaward margin indicate profound depths of
                    water outside them. The Barrier-reefs which surround islands are termed
                    “encircling Barrier-reefs,” and they occasionally form a complete ring, though
                    more usually discontinuous and broken at intervals. The Barrier-reefs which
                    skirt continents attain a greater size. As an example of these may be taken the
                    succession of reefs which form the great “barrier” on the north-east coast of
                    Australia. These run, with occasional breaches in their continuity, for a
                    distance of over 1000 miles, their average distance from the shore being between
                    20 and 30 miles, the depth of the inner channel being from 10 to 60 fathoms, and
                    the sea outside being sometimes over 2000 feet in depth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Atolls</hi> are ring-shaped reefs usually oval or circular in
                    form, which enclose a central expanse of water or lagoon, without any land.
                    Occasionally (as in Whitsunday Island) the entire circle of the Atoll may have
                    been raised above the water. More commonly the ring is not complete, but is
                    breached by one or more openings, which are always placed on the leeward side of
                    the Atoll, or on the side most completely sheltered from, the prevailing winds.
                    In their structure Atolls are identical with “encircling Barrier-reefs,” from
                    which they differ only in the fact that the lagoon which they enclose does not
                    contain an island in its centre.</p>
                <p>Many coral-reefs are constantly submerged below the sea, and are not laid bare
                    even at extreme low water; others are exposed to view by the recession of the
                    tide, and are covered at high water; others, again, are partially raised above
                    the level of the highest tides, and thus constitute dry land. If we examine a
                    reef of the last class—say a portion of an Atoll or an encircling
                    Barrier-reef—the following are the general phenomena which may be noticed. The
                    general form of the reef is approximately triangular, as seen, in section, with
                    a steep and abrupt seaward face, and a long and gentle slope towards the inner
                    lagoon or channel. The extreme outer margin of the reef is the only portion of
                    the whole which is composed of actually living coral, and this part is not
                    exposed to view even at extreme low water. Soundings outside this line always
                    indicate a more or less considerable depth of water, and the outer margin of the
                    reef is usually exposed to the beating of a tremendous surf, in which the
                    coral-polypes find their most congenial home. Immediately inside the line of
                    breakers is a broader or narrower platform of dead coral and coralrock, which is
                    only laid bare at low water, and which may be bounded internally by a ledge of
                    brecciated coral-rock only reached by the waves at high water. Finally, the
                    inner portion of the reef rises to the height of a few feet above the level of
                    high water, and constitutes dry land. It is composed of blocks of coral more or
                    less completely cemented together by the percolation of water holding carbonate
                    of lime in solution, along with blown sand derived from the disintegration of
                    the coral. The land generally bears a luxuriant vegetation, and slopes with a
                    prolonged and gentle inclination to the inner lagoon. The beach of the Atoll is
                    covered with coral-sand, and with fragments of coral, which are often cemented
                    together by the percolation of water so as to form compact oolitic or brecciated
                    limestones. The bottom of the inner lagoon usually supports many living corals,
                    along with accumulations of fine chalky mud, apparently largely formed from the
                    excreta of animals, which, like the <hi rend="italic">Scari</hi> and
                    Holothurians, feed upon the living corals. Outside the reef, at depths greater
                    than 25 fathoms, the bottom seems to be covered with coral-sand and dead
                    coral.</p>
                <p>The general method of formation of a coral-reef becomes readily intelligible on a
                    consideration of the conditions which are requisite for the existence and
                    welfare of the coral-polypes. The reef-building corals, in the first place,
                    flourish most vigorously in depths up to 10 fathoms, and appear to be incapable
                    of existing at all at depths exceeding 25, or at the utmost 30 fathoms. It
                    follows from this that no coral-reef can begin to be formed on a sea-bottom
                    covered by more than 30 fathoms of water. In the case, however, of Atolls and
                    Barrier-reefs, we have reefs rising out of profound depths, soundings on their
                    seaward margin indicating depths of from 100 up to more than 1000 fathoms, at
                    points not far removed from the actual edge of the reef. Originally it was
                    believed that the reef had been raised from these great depths to the surface by
                    the exertions of the polypes themselves; but the extremely limited bathymetrical
                    range of these animals renders this view wholly untenable. The true explanation
                    of this problem was first afforded by the masterly researches of Mr Darwin, who
                    showed that the production of Barrier-reefs and Atolls is really to be ascribed
                    to the subsidence by slow degrees of the foundations on which they rest. Thus a
                    Fringing-reef surrounding an island may be formed in depths of from 10 to 15
                    fathoms, and may grow till it reaches the level of low water. If, now, such a
                    reef be supposed to sink gradually beneath the sea by a sufficiently slow
                    subsidence, the upward growth of the corals will neutralize the downward
                    movement of the land, so that the reef will appear to be stationary, whilst it
                    is really growing upwards. Whilst the reef will remain to all appearance
                    unaffected in its form, position, and size, the island which it surrounds will
                    gradually diminish in size as the subsidence goes on, and a wide and deep
                    channel will be formed between it and the reef. If the depression should be
                    continued still further, the island will be reduced to a mere peak in the centre
                    of a lagoon, and the reef, from a “Fringing-reef,” will have become converted
                    into an “encircling Barrier-reef.” Simultaneously, we should find that there is
                    now deep water all round the reef, on its <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n408/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0408-0379"/> outer margins; for the coral-polypes grow
                    principally in a vertical direction, so that the width of the reef can be little
                    or not at all greater than the width of its original base. If the depression of
                    the land be still further continued, the central island will ultimately
                    disappear altogether, and the reef will become an oval or circular ring, usually
                    more or less incomplete, and perhaps 30, 40, or 50 miles in diameter, enclosing
                    a central expanse of water or lagoon. It is thus seen that Fringing-reefs,
                    Barrier-reefs, and Atolls are different stages of the same thing, the latter
                    being produced out of the former by the progressive subsidence of the land. In
                    order, however, that this process should be carried out, it is necessary that
                    the rate of subsidence should not be more rapid than the rate of upward growth
                    of the corals. If it should be so, then the reef is carried down into deep
                    water, and becomes submerged, as is the case, for example, with the great Chagos
                    Bank. In accordance with Mr Darwin’s theory on this subject, it is found that
                    Barrierreefs and Atolls do not occur in the immediate vicinity of active
                    volcanoes—regions where geology teaches us that the land is either stationary,
                    or is undergoing slow upheaval. On the other hand, the existence of
                    Fringing-reefs is only possible wſliere the land is either slowly rising, or is
                    stationary; and, as a matter of fact, Fringing-reefs are often found to be
                    conjoined with upraised strata of post-Tertiary age. As regards their upward
                    limits of growth, again, the coral-polypes cannot exist on levels higher than
                    extreme low water, exposure to the sun, even for a short period, proving
                    generally, if not invariably, fatal. The coral-polypes, therefore, can raise the
                    reef to the level of extreme low water, but no further; and it is to the
                    denuding power of the ocean that the elevation of the reef above this level is
                    due. The breakers which fall upon the outer edge of the reef detach masses of
                    dead coral, often of very large size, and these become gradually accumulated at
                    particular spots, till they rise above the level of high water. The detached
                    masses, thus heaped up, become compacted together by the finer sediment of the
                    reef, and agglutinated by the percolation through them of water holding
                    carbonate of lime in solution, till they become ultimately converted into a hard
                    compact limestone. The new land produced in this way is protected from
                    destruction by the vital activity of the living corals, which occupy a fringe at
                    the outermost margin of the reef just below the level of extreme low water, and
                    which by their continual growth preserve the inner parts of the reef from the
                    waves.</p>
                <p>Another condition very essential to the welfare of the coral-polypes is an
                    abundant supply of pure and properly aerated water. They flourish, therefore, in
                    their highest vigour at the extreme outer edge of the reef, and on its windward
                    side, where they are exposed to the constant beating of the surge; and hence it
                    is that the growth of the reef is principally carried on at these points. Mud
                    and sediment are, on the other hand, very injurious to corals, and they rarely
                    occur, therefore, on sandy or muddy bottoms. It is for this reason, also, as
                    much probably as from the pernicious effect of an intermixture of fresh water,
                    that openings in coral-reefs are always found to exist at points opposite the
                    mouths of rivers. It has been shown, however, by experiment, that corals will
                    flourish on a sandy bottom provided the water is free from sediment in
                    suspension.</p>

                <p>The geological history of the great group of the <hi rend="italic">Perforata</hi>
                    is shorter and less perfectly known than that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aporosa.</hi> Leaving out of sight forms of uncertain affinities, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Perforata</hi> are but represented in the great pile of Palaeozoic
                    deposits by some two or three genera, and they are absent or very poorly
                    represented in all the lower Mesozoic sediments. In the Cretaceous period they
                    for the first time begin to be more abundant, though still sparsely developed,
                    and it is not till the commencement of the Tertiary period that this group
                    assumes anything like its present proportions. In the vast series of Silurian
                    deposits the Perforate corals are only represented by two undoubted genera,
                    namely the <hi rend="italic">Protaraea</hi> of the Lower Silurian, which belongs
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Poritidae,</hi> and is nearly allied to the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Lüharaea,</hi> and the singular <hi rend="italic">Calostylis</hi>
                    of the Upper Silurian. The Lower Silurian genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Columñopora</hi> may perhaps be referred to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Madreporidae,</hi> and if the <hi rend="italic">Favositidae</hi> were
                    ultimately referred to the same family, then we should have to admit a very
                    considerable development of the <hi rend="italic">Perforata</hi> in Upper
                    Silurian times. In the succeeding period of the Devonian, rich as it is in
                    corals, no certain representative of the <hi rend="italic">Perforata</hi> is
                    known. The genus <hi rend="italic">Pleurodictyum</hi> has been referred here,
                    but is apparently founded upon casts of <hi rend="italic">Favosites.</hi> In the
                    great coralliferous deposits of the Carboniferous, again, no representative of
                    the group is known, save the single genus <hi rend="italic">Palaeacis,</hi>
                    which appears to be a <hi rend="italic">Madreporacean.</hi> In the Permian
                    rocks, the Trias, and the Lias, no single example of a Perforate coral has
                    hitherto been brought to light, and the group is represented in the Oolitic
                    series by the single genus <hi rend="italic">Microsolena,</hi> an aberrant
                    member of the <hi rend="italic">Poritidae.</hi> In the Cretaceous series the
                    Perforate corals are represented by members of all the existing families, <hi
                    rend="italic">Stephanophyllia</hi> amongst the <hi rend="italic">Eupsammidae,
                    Porites</hi> amongst the <hi rend="italic">Poritidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    takes place. The <hi rend="italic">Eupsammidae</hi> are now represented by <hi

                <p>In discussing the geological distribution of the Tabulate Corals, it will be
                    convenient to consider the group as a merely provisional assemblage of forms,
                    which cannot at present be finally systematized. The genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >IIeliopora</hi> and its allies <hi rend="italic">Heliolites,
                    Plasmopora,</hi><hi rend="italic">kc.,</hi> have been shown to be <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic">lcyonaria,</hi> and will be considered
                    under that head. Here, therefore, the order <hi rend="italic">Tabulata</hi> will
                    be taken as temporarily including the groups of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Milleporidae (Millepora, Axopora),</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Thecidae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic">Thecia),</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Favositidae (Favosites</hi> and its allies), the <hi rend="italic">Chaetetidae
                    (Chaetetes</hi> and its allies), and the <hi rend="italic">Halysitidae
                    (Halysitcs, Syringopora,</hi> Ac. ) Accepting the order in this provisional
                    aspect, it will be found that the <hi rend="italic">Tabulata</hi> are mainly,
                    indeed almost exclusively, confined to the Palaeozoic period. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Milleporidae,</hi> however, belong to the Tertiary and recent
                    periods; <hi rend="italic">Koninckia</hi> is Cretaceous; whilst <hi
                    rend="italic">Michelinia</hi> and some of the <hi rend="italic">Chaetetidae</hi>
                    have been stated to occur in the Oolitic series, though this determination is
                    not free from doubt. The family of the <hi rend="italic">Thecidae,</hi>
                    including the single genus <hi rend="italic">Thaecia,</hi> is exclusively Upper
                    Silurian. Amongst the <hi rend="italic">Favositidae,</hi> the type-genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Favosites</hi> is Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous, attaining
                    its maximum of development in the Devonian; <hi rend="italic">Emmonsia</hi> has
                    nearly the same range as <hi rend="italic">Favosites; Michelinia</hi> is found
                    in the Devonian and Carboniferous, and is doubtfully quoted from the Oolites;
                    <hi rend="italic">Striatopora</hi> belongs to the Upper Silurian and Devonian;
                    <hi rend="italic">Alveolites</hi> is abundant in the Silurian and. Devonian, and
                    disappears in the Carboniferous; <hi rend="italic">Rxmcria</hi> is Devonian, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Koninckia</hi> is only known from the White Chalk. Of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chaetetidae, Chaetetes, Monticulipora,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stenopora</hi> are three imperfectly separated and closely allied groups, which
                    are represented, collectively or separately, in all the Palaeozoic formations
                    from the Lower Silurian to the Permian, inclusive; and forms very similar, if
                    not identical, <hi rend="italic">(Heteropora, Neuropora)</hi> occur in deposits
                    of Mesozoic age. The genera <hi rend="italic">Dania</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conaetcllaria</hi> are closely allied to the preceding, and are Silurian. <hi
                    rend="italic">Labechia</hi> may be temporarily placed here also, and is likewise
                    Silurian. <hi rend="italic">Fiaetulipora</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Callopora</hi> are nearly related to the preceding and to one another (if not
                    identical), and they range from the Silurian to the Carboniferous. Lastly, <hi
                    rend="italic">Beaumontia</hi> is Carboniferous. Amongst the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Halysitidae,</hi> the type-genus <hi rend="italic">Halysitcs</hi> is Silurian;
                    <hi rend="italic">Syringopora</hi> ranges from the Silurian to the
                    Carboniferous, attaining its maximum in the Devonian; whilst the singular genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Flctchaeria,</hi> though typically Silurian, is said to bo
                    represented by a species in the Trias (Muschelkalk). Lastly, the aberrant family
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Milleporidae</hi> does not seem to have come into
                    existence till the Eocene Tertiary, where it is represented by the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Millepora.</hi> The remarkable genus <hi rend="italic">A
                    xopora</hi> also dates its ⅛st appearance from the Eocene. There remain some
                    other so-called Tabulate corals which have not been noticed in the above
                    summary, but they are not of sufficient importance to require special
                    mention.</p>
                <p>The small group of the <hi rend="italic">Tubulosa</hi> is confined exclusively to
                    the Palaeo ∙ zoic period. The type-genus <hi rend="italic">Aulopora</hi> is
                    found in the Lower and Upper Silurian,the Devonian, and the Carboniferous,
                    attaining its maximum in the Devonian. The genus <hi rend="italic">Pyrgia</hi>
                    is only known as occurring in the Carboniferous rocks.</p>
                <p>Regarding the geological history of the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sclerodermata</hi> in a summary form, it will be seen that the
                    Palaeozoic period is characterized by the exclusive possession of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tubulosa,</hi> the great development of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tabulata,</hi> and the very small number of <hi rend="italic">Aporosa</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Perforata,</hi> the place of these latter groups being taken
                    by the Tabulate and Rugose corals. The Mesozoic period is characterized by the
                    great development of the <hi rend="italic">Aporosa,</hi> and, towards its close,
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Perforata,</hi> though in a less degree; whilst the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tubulosa</hi> are wholly gone, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tabulata,</hi> along with the Rugose corals, have very nearly disappeared.
                    Finally, the Kainozoic period is characterized by the greatly increased
                    development of the <hi rend="italic">Perforata,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aporosa</hi> being proportionately diminished, though still remaining in great
                    force, and the great recent group of the Millepores <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tabulata</hi><hi rend="italic">I</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> now
                    for the first time making its appearance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Order</hi> II.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Rugosa.</hi></p>
                <p>The members of this order agree with the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia
                    sclerodermata</hi> in possessing a well-developed sclerodermic corallum, with a
                    true theca, and generally presenting both tabulae and septa combined. The septa,
                    however, are generally (though apparently not always) some multiple of <hi
                    rend="italic">four,</hi> and there is commonly a single predominant septum, or a
                    vacant space (fossula) representing such a septum. Some of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rugosa</hi> are simple, others are compound, but the latter are destitute of a
                    true caenenchyma.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n410/mode/1up"

                <p>As there are only two living genera which agree with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rugosa</hi> in the tetrameral arrangement of their septa, and as it is doubtful
                    whether we are justified in positively asserting on this ground that these
                    genera really <hi rend="italic">are</hi><hi rend="italic">Rugosa,</hi> this
                    great order of <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa</hi> requires to be considered simply
                    as regards the hard skeleton or corallum which alone has been preserved to us in
                    a fossil condition. The corallum of the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> is in most
                    essential respects identical in structure with that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hexacoralla,</hi> differing principally in the numerical law of the septa and
                    in the common conjunction of tabulae with the septa. It is very difficult to
                    entertain any doubt but that the corallum of the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi>
                    was secreted in a manner precisely similar to that of the existing <hi
                    rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic">sclerodermata,</hi> and that it
                    bore essentially, if not precisely, similar relations to the soft parts of the
                    animal which produced it. Thus, in both groups alike the corallum may be simple
                    or compound; in both alike the simple form of corallum consists of an outer wall
                    or “theca,” inclosing a central space or “visceral chamber,” which is divided
                    into compartments by a series of radiating lamellae, or “septa;” in both alike
                    the structures known as “dissepiments,” “tabulae,” and “columella” may be
                    developed; in both alike the compound corallum may be regarded as essentially
                    formed by an aggregation of “corallites,” similar in their fundamental structure
                    to the simple corallum. With these striking and substantial points of agreement
                    there are, nevertheless, not a few respects in which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rugosa</hi> differ from the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sclerodermata,</hi> and these will be best discussed by briefly considering the
                    different parts of the Rugose corallum in succession.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of the corallum, when simple, is usually more or
                    less conical, turbinate, cono-cylindrical, or cylindroidal, but it may be
                    discoidal <hi rend="italic">fPalaeoclycus, Microcyclus,</hi> &lt;fcc.); or even
                    everted (some species of <hi rend="italic">Ptychophyllum),</hi> or sometimes
                    prismatic <hi rend="italic">(Goniophyllum),</hi> whilst it is often irregularly
                    thickened by accretions of growth. The compound coralla necessarily vary much in
                    form, being massive, fasciculate, &lt;kc., according to the method in which new
                    corallites are produced. The principal modes in which the corallum becomes
                    compound amongstthe <hi rend="italic">Rugosaoxeι</hi> the following :—</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Simple calicular gemmation.—</hi> In this process the
                    original corallite, after growing for a certain length of time, sends up a
                    single bud from its calicine disc, which usually is continued in the same axis
                    as that of its parent. The primitive calice may or may not be more or less
                    completely obliterated by the gradual growth and extension of the epitheca over
                    it, and the secondary bud may or may not produce a tertiary bud in the same
                    manner in which it was itself produced. Not uncommonly several buds may be
                    produced successively, each from the oral disc of its predecessor, till the aged
                    corallum comes to consist of a series of short turbinate cups or inverted cones,
                    superimposed one upon the other, the younger upon the older. This singular mode
                    of gemmation is seen in various species of <hi rend="italic">Heliophyllum,
                    Cystiphyllum,</hi> &amp;c; and it cannot possibly be regarded as being merely
                    accidental; whilst it may not improbably be regarded as an advanced form of the
                    physiological process by which “accretions of growth” are produced. (2) <hi
                    rend="italic">Compound calicular gemmation.—</hi> In this process, the primitive
                    corallite throws up from its calicine disc two or more buds, which, after
                    reaching a certain size, in most cases repeat the process. The resulting form of
                    corallum differs in different cases. In such forms as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyathophyllum</hi><hi rend="italic">truncatum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C.
                    paracida,</hi> the parent corallite is destroyed by its buds, and these are in
                    turn destroyed by the buds which they put forth, all the corallites remaining
                    more or less separate, and the entire corallum assuming the form of an inverted
                    pyramidal mass, the base of which is formed by the primitive corallite. In other
                    cases, as in <hi rend="italic">Cyatlιophyllum</hi><hi rend="italic">regium,</hi>
                    the corallites become intimately united by their walls, and the corallum becomes
                    massive and astraeiform. In other cases, again, the corallum becomes
                    fasciculate, the budding corallites not being killed by their buds, but
                    continuing to grow upwards side by side with them, as is seen in some of the
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Cyathophyllum, Lonsdaleia, Endophyllum,</hi>
                    &amp;c. (3) <hi rend="italic">Parietal Gemmation.—</hi> This process consists in
                    the production of buds from the sides of the corallites at some point between
                    the base and the margin of the calice. It does not differ in its nature or
                    results from the same process as seen in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic">sclerodermata,</hi> and it generally gives
                    rise to a loosely fasciculate corallum, as is well seen in various forms of <hi
                    rend="italic">Diphy</hi><hi rend="italic">phyllum, Lithostrotion, kc.</hi> (4)
                    <hi rend="italic">Basal Gemmation.—</hi> This process consists in the formation
                    of buds by an extension of the substance of the original polype from the margin
                    of its base; but it is doubtful if this mode of increase occurs at all amongst
                    the true Rugose corals. (5) <hi rend="italic">Fission.—</hi> Increase by
                    spontaneous cleavage or fission is also of rare occurrence amongst the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rugosa,</hi> though it undoubtedly occurs occasionally, as in some
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Diphyphyllum.</hi></p>
                <p>However they may be produced, the corallites of the compound coralla of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> are never connected together by a true caenenchyma.
                    When the corallites are in close contact, so that the corallum becomes massive,
                    there is often fusion of the adjoining walls, but this is not necessarily the
                    case. At other times the walls are wanting, and the corallites are united
                    together by the extension and confluence of their septa <hi rend="italic"
                    >(shhillipsastraea, Syringophyllum, Smithia,</hi> &amp;c.), or by costae and
                    vesicular dissepiments <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic">Pachy</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">plιy</hi><hi rend="italic">llum).</hi> In other cases the
                    corallites are united by exothecal outgrowths (as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eridophylhιm).</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">wall</hi> is usually well developed, and is not perforate.
                    It is, however, often wanting altogether (as in <hi rend="italic">Chonaxis,
                    Phillipsastraea, Smithia,</hi> &amp;c.), or very feebly represented. In many
                    cases also there is a more or less strongly developed <hi rend="italic"
                    >accessory wall,</hi> or internal mural investment (“muraille interne”), which
                    is placed concentrically within the true wall, and thus divides the visceral
                    chamber into a central and a circumferential space. This accessory wall may be
                    present along with a well developed true wall (as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acervularia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cyclophyllum),</hi> or the accessory
                    wall alone may be present, the true wall may be absent, and the corallites may
                    be united with one another by the amalgamation of their septa and dissepiments
                    (as in <hi rend="italic">Pachyphyllum, Chonaxis,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">epitheca</hi> is usually well developed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rugosa,</hi> though sometimes very thin. It is closely applied as
                    a rule to the true wall, and when thickened, the latter may be very feebly
                    developed. In the compound coralla, there is often a general epitheca inclosing
                    the corallites basally and laterally. We may, perhaps, also regard as being of
                    an epithecal nature the extraordinary <hi rend="italic">opercular</hi>
                    structures which have been fully described by Lindstrom as occurring in certain
                    Rugose corals, such as <hi rend="italic">Goniophyllum, Calceola,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhizophyllum.</hi> In these forms the calice is closed completely
                    by a calcareous plate or operculum which is single in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calceola,</hi> but composed of four pieces in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Goniophyllum,</hi> and which must be supposed to have been capable of erection
                    and retraction,—the corallum thus becoming like a bivalve shell. Indeed, the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Calceola</hi> was long supposed to be referable to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Brachiopoda.</hi> It seems probable that some other Rugose
                    corals, more normal in their charac ∙ ters than the above mentioned forms, were
                    likewise provided with an operculum. Similar structures are observable in some
                    Tabulate corals (as in certain species of <hi rend="italic">Faυosites),</hi>
                    where the calices become closed in progress of growth by a false operculum; and
                    analogous structures have been recognized in certain living corals <hi
                    rend="italic">(Primuoa</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n411/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0411-0382"/> and <hi rend="italic">Paramuricea).</hi> Though
                    not strictly epithecal, we may also consider in this connection the remarkable
                    <hi rend="italic">root-like processes</hi> (“radiciform prolongations”) which
                    are so characteristic of many of the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g. Omphyma, Goniophyllum, Rhizophyllum, Pholidophyllum,
                    Ptychophyllum,</hi> &amp;c.) These processes may attain a length of several
                    inches, and they consist of a process of the epitheca and wall, inclosing a
                    diverticulum of the visceral chamber, and in some cases subdivided by
                    dissepiments. In the simple species (such as <hi rend="italic">Omphynuι)</hi>
                    they serve to attach the corallum to foreign objects; but similar processes
                    occur in various compound forms <hi rend="italic">(Eridophyllum,</hi> &amp;c.),
                    and serve to unite the various corallites with one another, being thus of the
                    same nature and function as the tubular connecting processes of the Tabulate
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Syringopora.</hi></p>
                <p>The epitheca of the Rugose corals is usually marked with numerous fine encircling
                    striae, and with longitudinal lines, grooves, or ridges. The latter, however,
                    are usually regarded as not being true <hi rend="italic">costae.</hi> They
                    differ, in fact, from tne costae of the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sclerodermata</hi> in not being placed opposite the septa, but
                    alternating with these structures, and thus corresponding with the interseptal
                    loculi. Not uncommonly (as in many species of <hi rend="italic">Zaphrentis,</hi>
                    in <hi rend="italic">Streptelasma,</hi> &amp;c.) there are two of these
                    pseudo-costae, which are pre-eminently developed and run along the dorsal
                    surface of the corallum, the other ridges converging towards this central pair
                    in a pinnate manner. This appearance seems to be due to the fact that the growth
                    of the cor-rallum was effected by the intercalation of successive septa along
                    the sides of the primary septum to which this principal pair of pseudo-costae
                    corresponds. In <hi rend="italic">Pholidophyllum</hi> the costae are double, and
                    are <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> covered by double longitudinal rows of small
                    imbricated scales of an epithecal nature. In genera in which the wall is absent
                    and the corallites are united together by the confluence of the septa <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Pachyphyllum, Smithia,
                    Phillipsastraed),</hi> it is impossible to determine whether true costae are
                    present or not. True costae are also certainly present in the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Holocystis.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">calice</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> varies
                    greatly in form, shape, depth, &amp;c. It is usually more or less circular, or
                    oval, sometimes semicircular or subtriangular in outline <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Rhizophyllum.),</hi> sometimes quadrilateral <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Goniophyllum).</hi> It may be very shallow, or very deep, and its edges may be
                    completely everted <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ptychophyllum patellatum).</hi> It may be at right angles to the axis of the
                    corallum, or it may have any degree of obliquity. In the simple and curved or
                    horn-shaped coralla, it is very common for the calice to be very oblique to the
                    axis of the coral; and in these cases the convex side of the corallum (dorsal
                    side) is the longest, and the concave side (ventral side) is the shortest.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">septa</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> are
                    substantially similar to those of the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sclerodermata</hi> in form and structure, forming, when well
                    developed, a series of vertical calcareous laminae which are primitively double,
                    spring from the inner surface of the wall, and radiate towards the centre of the
                    visceral chamber. They are rarely or never perforate, and they vary much in the
                    extent of their development. Sometimes they are almost wholly aborted, being
                    only recognizable as so many faint striae on the inner surface of the calice (as
                    in the typical examples of <hi rend="italic">Cystiphyllum).</hi> At other times,
                    they extend inwards only an extremely short distance from the wall, as in the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Amplexus.</hi> In other cases, again, they are well
                    developed towards the centre of the corallum, but have no connection with the
                    outer wall, from which they are separated by dissepimental vesicles, as in the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Lonsdaleia.</hi> In other instances, finally, they have
                    their normal arrangement, being attached externally to the wall, and extending
                    inwards ⅞o, or near to, the centre of the visceral chamber. In rare cases the
                    septa may be all of nearly the same size; more commonly they are markedly
                    different in size. Most of the forms in which the septa are well developed, show
                    a distinct tetrameral arrangement of the septa, though it does not appear
                    possible to assert positively that the primitive and first developed cycle of
                    septa consists of only four elements. In many cases, however, the septa of the
                    adult are a multiple of four, and their quadripartite disposition may be plainly
                    manifested by the fact that four of the septa are preeminently developed and
                    form a conspicuous cross <hi rend="italic">(Stauria),</hi> or by the presence of
                    four calicine depressions which have a similar cruciform arrangement <hi
                    rend="italic">(Omphyma).</hi> In the typical <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> the
                    septa, though undoubtedly not simultaneously developed, are nevertheless of only
                    two sizes, a larger and a smaller, alternating regularly with one another; and
                    they cannot, therefore, be distinguished according to their dimensions into a
                    series of regular cycles. The small or secondary septa also may be occasionally’
                    absent. The primary or larger septa, be their development what it may, are for
                    the most part equal in size; but, notwithstanding this fact, the corallum often
                    shows a very distinct bilateral symmetry, . , <hi rend="superscript"> ll</hi> θ
                    <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi><hi rend="subscript"> -</hi> PP <hi
                    rend="superscript"> aren</hi> tly to the primitive tetrameral disposition of the
                    septa. '1 his is especially shown in the general existence either of a single
                    septum of larger size than all the others (one of the four primitive septa), or
                    of an extraordinary vacant spa,. ⅛ representing this septum, and known as the
                    “septal fossula.” The septal fossula usually presents itself as a more or less
                    conspicuous depression or groove in the calice, and its position, though
                    apparently constant in any given form, is variable, being sometimes on the
                    convex side of the corallum in the simple forms, sometimes on the concave side,
                    and rarely situated laterally. In general it is a simple space or deficiency
                    caused by the absence or abortion of one of the four primary septa, and it is
                    seen in transverse sections to be occupied by from one to three short septa.
                    Sometimes it is accompanied by a tubular depression of the tabulae at that
                    point. Sometimes there are two smaller lateral fossulae, directed at right
                    angles to the main depression, and representing two others of the primitive
                    septa. At other times there may be four shallow fossulae arranged in a crucial
                    manner <hi rend="italic">(Omphyma),</hi> but it is not certain that these
                    correspond with the four primitive septa. Lastly, in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metriophyllum</hi> the septa are arranged in four groups, which are separated
                    from one another by vacant spaces or fossulae, though in this case also it is
                    not certain that these spaces are homologous with the true septal fossulae of
                    forms like <hi rend="italic">Zaphrentis.</hi> The precise physiological import
                    of the fossula is uncertain; but its presence gives rise to an irregularity in
                    the arrangement of the septa which is highly characteristic of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rugosa.</hi> Whilst in <hi rend="italic">Stauria</hi> all four of
                    the primitive septa are pre-eminently developed, only three are thus predominant
                    in <hi rend="italic">Anisopyllum,</hi> and only one in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hallia.</hi> The free edges of the septa, where they appear in the calice, are
                    in general plain and smooth, but they may bear granular tubercles <hi
                    rend="italic">(Palaeocyclus),</hi> or teeth <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Zaphrentis</hi><hi rend="italic">cornicula,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Heliophyllum).</hi> The sides of the septa are likewise generally smooth, but
                    they may be granulated <hi rend="italic">(Palaeocyclus),</hi> or they may be
                    adorned with arched and ascending striae <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Heliophyllum).</hi></p>
                <p>The axis of the corallum is very often occupied by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >columella,</hi> which varies much in structure in different cases. In forms
                    such as <hi rend="italic">Cyathaxonia, Lithostrotion, Koninckophyllum,</hi>
                    &amp;c., we have a proper or essential columella, which is developed
                    independently of the septa, occupies the centre of the visceral chamber, and
                    projects as a solid rod into the floor of the calice. In other cases the
                    columella is composed of twisted lamellae, which inosculate with one another so
                    as to give rise to a vesicular axis, as in <hi rend="italic">Lonsdaleia</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Axophyllum.</hi> In other cases, a false columella may be
                    produced by the twisting together of the inner edges of some of the primary
                    septa (as in some species of <hi rend="italic">Gyathophyllum).</hi> In other
                    cases, finally, the axis of the visceral chamber may be occupied by a series of
                    more or less complicated structures, which may occupy a considerable space, and
                    which have sometimes been regarded as representing a kind of columella <hi
                    rend="italic">(Clisiophyllum, Dibunophytlum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhodo-</hi><hi rend="italic">phyllum, Cyclophyllum,</hi> &amp;c). These axial
                    structures, however, can only in a very limited sense be regarded as
                    columellar.</p>
                <p>The continuity of the interseptal loculi in the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> is
                    generally more or less interfered with by the development of endothecal <hi
                    rend="italic">dissepiments;</hi> but in no case are synapticulae present. The
                    dissepiments vary greatly in character and amount. Sometimes they are wholly
                    wanting <hi rend="italic">(Cyathaxonidae</hi> and some species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Amplexus);</hi> at other times they may be present in small amount
                    <hi rend="italic">(Lophophyllum,</hi> somes species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amplexus,</hi> &amp;c.); at other times they are exceedingly abundant. In the
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Cyathophyllum,</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lithostrotion,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Koninckophyllum,</hi> and in other
                    forms, the dissepiments are so largely developed towards the circumference of
                    the visceral chamber as to give rise to a dense peripheral zone of vesicular
                    tissue. In longitudinal sections of the corallum this vesicular tissue is seen
                    to be composed of very minute lenticular cells arranged in oblique rows directed
                    upwards and outwards. In other forms, such as <hi rend="italic">Campophyllum,
                    Lonsdaleia,</hi> &amp;c., a similar zone of vesicular tissue exists, but the
                    cells which enter into its composition are of very large size. In the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Heliophyllum,</hi> and in certain other forms, there are found
                    singular dissepimental structures, which are attached to the sides of the septa,
                    but do not extend completely across the interseptal loculi. The structures in
                    question constitute a series of plates which are attached by their bases to the
                    sides of the septa, projecting freely into the interseptal loculi, and directed
                    inwards and upwards in an arched manner from the interior of the wall towards
                    the centre of the visceral chamber. These arched ridges are placed at
                    corresponding points on the opposite side of each septum; they consequently
                    appear on the free edges of the septa within the calice as so many spines, and
                    they communicate to cross-sections of the septa a characteristic cross-barred
                    appearance. In the <hi rend="italic">Cystiphyllidae,</hi> again, the entire
                    visceral chamber is filled with a vesicular tissue of convex and inclined cells,
                    which may be regarded as formed partly by dissepiments and partly by
                    tabulae.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tabulae</hi> are in general well developed amongst the Rugose
                    corals, and coexist with well developed septa. In some genera (such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Amplexus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zaphrentis)</hi> the tabulae
                    are “complete,” that is to say, they pass completely across the visceral chamber
                    from side to side, thus dividing it into a succession of distinct stories, of
                    which only the uppermost is occupied by the living tissues of the animal. In a
                    greater number of cases <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic">e.g.
                    Cyathophyllum, Lithostrotion, Lonsdaleia, Heliophyllum,</hi> &amp;c,), the
                    tabulae are “incomplete,” that is to say they do not extend across the visceral
                    chamber, but are confined to a larger or smaller central area. The central
                    tabulate area may or may not be pierced by a columella; and the septa <pb

                    of the tabulae to the centre of the corallum, or they may fall short of the
                    centre, and thus leave a larger or smaller area of the tabulae free to view, and
                    conspicuously visible in the floor of the calice. The tabulae may be well
                    developed, approximately horizontal, remote plates, as is usually the case in
                    <hi rend="italic">Zaphrentis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amplexus,</hi> or they
                    may anasto-moze in various ways, and become so intimately connected with one
                    another as to give rise to a species of vesicular tissue.</p>
                <p>As regards the <hi rend="italic">affinities</hi> of the Rugose corals, doubts
                    have of late years been expressed as to their systematic position and
                    relationships. By Professor Louis Agassiz the entire order of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> was transferred from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actinozoa</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa,</hi> but upon insufficient
                    evidence. It had been observed by Agassiz that the living animal of <hi
                    rend="italic">Millepora</hi> was apparently a hydroid, closely allied to <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydractinia,</hi> and it was upon the strength of this observation
                    alone that the distinguished American naturalist proposed this sweeping change.
                    The following considerations show, however, that this change cannot be accepted.
                    (1) <hi rend="italic">Millepora</hi> is not a Rugose coral, but belongs to the
                    so-called Tabulate corals, of which it constitutes a very aberrant member. Even,
                    therefore, were it satisfactorily proved that the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Millepora</hi> is a true <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoön,</hi> is to which
                    naturalists are not yet agreed, this would not affect the classification of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rugosa,</hi> which are very distinct in their structure from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tabulata,</hi> and have no affinities with them further
                    than is implied by the fact that tabulae are present in both. (2) It has been
                    shown that the group of the <hi rend="italic">Tabulata</hi> itself contains both
                    true <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi> and true <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcyonaria,</hi> so that the hydroid character of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mïllepora,</hi> if admitted, would not so much as cause the removal of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tabulata</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa.</hi> (3) It has
                    further been shown that tabulae are present in certain forms which are
                    unquestionably <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa,</hi> as shown by an examination of
                    the living animal <hi rend="italic">{Pocillopora</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lophohelia).</hi> It is evident, therefore, that the presence of tabulae in
                    itself should have no weight in determining the systematic position of any given
                    form, unless at the same time the structure of the living animal be known. (4)
                    Apart from the close similarity between the corallum of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rugosa</hi> and that of the recent <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sclerodermata,</hi> the Rugose corals are provided, almost
                    invariably, with structures which, so far as we know, are absolutely
                    irreconcilable with the belief in their Hydrozoal affinities. They possess,
                    namely, in almost all cases, well developed <hi rend="italic">septa,</hi> which,
                    if they do not absolutely imply the existence of <hi rend="italic"
                    >mesenteries</hi> in the living animal, are, at any rate, wholly unknown as
                    occurring amongst the recent <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa.</hi> We may, therefore
                    safely accept the conclusion of Verrill, Pourtales, Claus, Duncan, Milne
                    Edwards, and other distinguished authorities, that Agassiz has failed to bring
                    forward sufficient evidence in favour of his view that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rugosa</hi> are referable to the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa.</hi></p>
                <p>More lately Dr Lindstrom has endeavoured to show that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rugosa</hi> cannot be placed amongst the <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa,</hi> but
                    “must form a class of their own in the great division of the Radiated Animals.”
                    The chief grounds upon which this conclusion is reached are “the compact
                    imperforate structure of the calyx and septa (the septa originating from four
                    primary ones), the absence of costae, the strange septal fossae in the bottom of
                    the calyx, the processes resembling rootlets, the transverse floors or tabulae
                    in the interior, which often have a cellular or vesicular structure,” and the
                    occasional presence of an operculum. It is obvious, however, that none of the
                    above-mentioned peculiarities are of such fundamental importance as to justify
                    us in overlooking the substantial identity of structure which subsists between
                    the corallum of the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> and that of the Aporose
                    section of the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sclerodermata.</hi> The wall and septa are often compact amongst the latter;
                    the septa have a tetrameral arrangement in the unquestionable living <hi
                    rend="italic">Actinozoa,</hi><hi rend="italic">Haploplιyllia</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Guynia</hi><hi rend="italic">,∙</hi> the septal fossula is not
                    always recognizable amongst the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa;</hi> the presence of
                    rootlets and the nature of the costae are points of secondary importance;
                    tabulae are present in undoubted corals belonging to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic">sclerodermata</hi>; and the occasional
                    presence in some abnormal forms of an operculum would no more justify us in
                    removing the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actinozoa</hi> that we should be warranted for the same reason in removing the
                    living <hi rend="italic">Primnoae</hi> from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcyonaria.</hi> Upon the whole, then, there appears to be little danger in
                    accepting the conclusion reached by Professor Verrill, one of the most
                    distinguished of living authorities on the subject, that there can no longer be
                    any reasonable doubt but that the coralla of the great majority of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> were made by “true polypes essentially similar to
                    those of the existing corals.” Indeed, if any great change in our classification
                    is to be made, it would seem rather to be in the direction of more closely
                    approximating the <hi rend="italic">Rugυsa</hi> to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic">sclerodermata.</hi> The tetrameral arrangement
                    of the septa is by no means always very conspicuous amongst the <hi

                    classificatory value has been attached to it. Leaving this out of account, the
                    affinities of the typical <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aporosa</hi> are very close, and it may be doubted if it would not
                    be proper to establish a more intimate union between these groups. At the same
                    time, it must not be overlooked, as pointed out by Mosely, that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> have certain affinities with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcyonaria,</hi> and especially with singular recent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heliopora.</hi> Great stress, however, can hardly be laid upon the existence of
                    paired opercular structures in <hi rend="italic">Goniophyllum</hi> and in the
                    existing Alcyonarian genus <hi rend="italic">Primnoa,</hi> since <hi
                    rend="italic">Goniophyllum,</hi> if a Rugose coral at all, must be referred to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gystiphyllidae,</hi> a family in which all the more
                    characteristic features of the Rugose organization have disappeared.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">divisions</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi>
                    recognized and founded by Milne-Edwards and Jules H aime, and subsequently
                    generally adopted, are the following :—</p>
                <p>Fam. I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Stauridae.</hi> —The wall is well developed; the
                    septa lamellar, extending without interruption from the bottom to the top of the
                    visceral chamber, and showing a conspicuous quaternary arrangement. The
                    interseptal loculi are crossed by endothecal dissepiments, and there is a
                    central tabulate area. Of the five genera which form the family, <hi
                    rend="italic">Stauria</hi> has a compound corallum, astraeiform in shape, and
                    increasing by calicular gemmation; there is no columella; and the four primitive
                    septa form a conspicuous cross. <hi rend="italic">Holocystis</hi> is also
                    composite and astraeiform,—the corallites being united by well developed costae,
                    and a styliform columella being present. Of the simple genera, the Permian <hi
                    rend="italic">Polycaelia</hi> and the Tertiary <hi rend="italic">Conosmilia</hi>
                    are closely allied to one another; but rhe third, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metriophyllum,</hi> is so aberrant that it may require to be placed in a
                    separate family, as its septa are arranged in four distinct groups, separated
                    from one another by four distinct fossulae.</p>
                <p>Fam. II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyathaxonidae.</hi> —In this family the corallum is
                    simple, with a deep calice; the septa are well developed, and extend from the
                    bottom of the visceral chamber to the floor of the calice; the interseptal
                    loculi are completely open, and there are neither dissepiments nor tabulae.
                    Though exhibiting a quaternary arrangement, the four primaiy septa are not
                    conspicuously developed above the others. This family makes an exceedingly close
                    approach to the Aporose group of the <hi rend="italic">Turbinolidae,</hi> from
                    which it is separated by the tetrameral arrangement of the septa. Of the genera
                    of the family, <hi rend="italic">Cyathaxonia</hi> is Palaeozoic, whilst <hi
                    rend="italic">Haplophyllia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Guynia</hi> are recent. No
                    Secondary or Tertiary forms are as yet known.</p>
                <p>Fam. III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyathophyllidae.</hi> —In this family the corallum
                    is simple or compound; and the septa are always more or less interrupted, and do
                    not extend as complete lamellae from the bottom to the top of the visceral
                    chamber, being more or less imperfect either internally or externally. The four
                    primitive septa are not pre-eminently developed, so as to give rise to a
                    conspicuous cross. The interseptal loculi are generally more or less interrupted
                    by the development of dissepiments, and tabulae are invariably present. The
                    family of the <hi rend="italic">Cyathophyllidae</hi> is divided by Milne-Edwards
                    and Haime into the two tribes of the <hi rend="italic">Zaphrentinae</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cyathophyllinae.</hi><hi rend="italic">a. Zaphrentinae.—</hi>
                    In this tribe the corallum is simple and free; a well-developed septal fossula
                    is present, which may be formed by a tubular inflection of the tabulae on one
                    side, or may be replaced by a cristiform process. The septa usually fall short
                    of the centre of the visceral chamber, and, from the presence of a septal
                    fossula, are invariably more or less irregular in their arrangement. The tabulae
                    are complete, and pass from one side of the visceral chamber to the other; while
                    dissepiments are poorly developed, and there is usually nothing of the nature of
                    a columella. The <hi rend="italic">Zaphrentinae</hi> are exclusively Palaeozoic,
                    and the principal genera of the family are <hi rend="italic">Zaphrentis,
                    Amplexus, Mcnophyllum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Lopho∙</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >Streptelasma.</hi><hi rend="italic">b. Cyathophyllinae.—</hi> In this family
                    the septa do not exhibit the irregularity which is so conspicuous in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zaphrentinae,</hi> but are more or less regularly radiate in their
                    arrangement. In some <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n413/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0413-0384"/> cases, the septa may be equally divided into four
                    groups by four shallow fossae in the calice. A tine columella may be present or
                    absent, or there may be a pseudo-columella formed by the twisting together of
                    the inner edges of the septa. A more or less well-developed zone of vesicular
                    tissue, formed by endothecal dissepiments, is usually found on the exterior of
                    the visceral chamber; and the tabulae are not complete, but occupy a more or
                    less extensively developed central area. The corallum may be simple or compound.
                    All the <hi rend="italic">Cyathophyllidae</hi> are Palaeozoic, and the principal
                    genera are <hi rend="italic">Cyathophyllum, Campophyllum, Omphyma,

                <p>Fam. IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cystiphyllidae.</hi> —The corallum in this family
                    is simple, or rarely compound; the septa are rudimentary, and are generally only
                    recognizable as so many vertical striae within the calice. The outer wall is
                    complete, but the entire visceral chamber is filled with small convex vesicles,
                    sometimes arranged in infundibuliform layers, and formed by the dissepiments and
                    tabulae in combination. A distinct septal fossula may or may not be present. The
                    entire family is Palaeozoic, and the only undoubted genus is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cystiphyllum</hi> itself. In their internal structure, however, the singular
                    operculate corals of the genera <hi rend="italic">Goniophyllum,
                    Rhixophyllum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Calceola</hi> present striking
                    affinities with the <hi rend="italic">Cystiphyllidae,</hi> whilst a species of

                    prismaticum)</hi> has been described by Lindstrom as being furnished with an
                    operculum. We may, therefore, with great probability, refer the above mentioned
                    abnormal genera to this family of the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa.</hi> It should
                    be borne in mind that the <hi rend="italic">Cystiphyllidae,</hi> with or without
                    <hi rend="italic">Goniophyllum</hi> and its allies, are such abnormal forms that
                    it is difficult to assert positively that they belong to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rugosa,</hi> and it remains possible that they should be separated to form a
                    special group.</p>
                <p>As regards their <hi rend="italic">geological distribution,</hi> the Rugose
                    corals have a vast development in the seas of the Palaeozoic period, where they
                    seem to take the place, to a large extent at any rate, of the Aporose section of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia,</hi><hi rend="italic">sclerodermata.</hi> In
                    the Secondary period only one genus <hi rend="italic">(Jlolocystìs)</hi> of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> is known, and but one is known in the Tertiary
                    rocks <hi rend="italic">(Conosmilia),</hi> whilst the only two living genera
                    which could be referred here are the <hi rend="italic">Haplophyllia</hi> of
                    Florida and the <hi rend="italic">Guynia</hi> of the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>In the Silurian period the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> are very largely
                    developed, especially in the upper division. The principal genera of this period
                    are— <hi rend="italic">Cyathophyllum, Zaphrentis, Cystiphyllum, Streptelasma,
                    Acervularia, Strombodes, Omphyma, Palaeocyclus, Diphyphyllum, Amplexus,

                    >Columnopora</hi> is perhaps one of the <hi rend="italic">Perforata;</hi> and

                    >Amplexus.</hi> In the Carboniferous period the Rugose corals still remain very
                    abundantly represented by forms belonging to such genera as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cuathophyllum, Lithostrotion, Diphyphyllum, Lonsdaleia, Axophyllum,

                    be extremely uncoralliferous, no examples of the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa</hi>
                    are known save the genus <hi rend="italic">Polycaelia,</hi> so far at any rate
                    as Britain is concerned. In the great series of the Secondary formations no <hi
                    rend="italic">Rugosa</hi> are as yet known save two species of the single genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Holocystis</hi> of the Lower Cretaceous. In the treat series
                    of the Tertiary deposits, again, there has hitherto been iscovered only a single
                    Rugose genus, the <hi rend="italic">Conosmilia</hi> of the later Tertiaries of
                    Australia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Order</hi> III.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Alcyonaria</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(f)ctocorallf).</hi></p>
                <p>The members of this order are <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa</hi> in which the
                    polypes possess eight tentacles, which are fringed on their sides with lateral
                    pinnae, or papillae. As in the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia,</hi> the mouth
                    opens into a tubular stomach, which in turn communicates freely with the
                    body-cavity, and the stomach is connected with the body-wall by means of a
                    series of vertical membranous laminae or mesenteries. The mesenteries, however,
                    are only eight in number, and are not paired, one of the tentacles corresponding
                    with and opening into each inter-mesenteric chamber. As a general rule a
                    corallum is secreted, though this may be wanting, and its nature differs in
                    different cases. In some forms <hi rend="italic">(Alcyonium,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Xenia,</hi> &amp;c.) the corallum is sclerodermic, and consists of
                    variously-formed spicules of lime scattered in the soft tissues. In others <hi
                    rend="italic">(Tubipora)</hi> the corallum is external and sclerodermic, with
                    true thecae, but without septa or tabulae, and formed of fused spicules,
                    detached structures of the same nature existing in the soft parts. In others <hi
                    rend="italic">(Heliopora)</hi> the corallum is external and sclerodermic, with
                    true thecae provided with septa and tabulae. In others, finally <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gorgonia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Corallium, Pennatula,</hi>
                    &amp;c.), there is double corallum, the one consisting of a calcareous or horny
                    sclerobasis, over which the soft parts are spread, the other consisting of
                    sclerodermic spicules scattered in the integuments. With the exception of the
                    single genus <hi rend="italic">Haimeia,</hi> which is possibly not a mature
                    form, all the <hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic">lcyonaria</hi> are
                    composite. The tubular polypes are united by a caenosarc, and their
                    body-cavities are placed in communication by means of canals which ramify
                    through the coenosarc, and permit of a free circulation of nutrient fluids. The
                    form of the colony varies greatly in different cases, being usually more or less
                    branched, arborescent, or lobate, but being at other times massive, incrusting,
                    creeping, linear, &amp;c. None of them possess the power of independent
                    locomotion, most being rooted to foreign objects in their adult condition, but
                    some being simply sunk in the mud, and a few floating freely in the sea. Many of
                    them exhibit the most brilliant coloration, due in many instances to the
                    brightly-coloured spicules disseminated in their tissues. In some, lastly, it
                    has been shown that the colony normally consists of two kinds of polypes, one
                    sexual, the other sexless and permanently rudimentary. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcyonaria</hi> may be briefly discussed under the five following families
                    :—</p>
                <p>Fam. I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Alcyonidae.</hi> —The members of this family are all
                    fixed to foreign objects, and are more or less fleshy in their consistence,
                    owing to the fact that the corallum consists simply of sclerodermic spicules
                    scattered in the integuments, and there is no sclerobasis. The spicules are of
                    various forms, but principally fusiform, and they are scattered through the
                    coenosarc and the soft tissues generally, but are often specially aggregated at
                    the bases of the tentacles and along the tentacles themselves. The spicules may
                    be present in very small numbers (as in some species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spoggodes),</hi> but they may be present in such numbers as to render the
                    surface rough and prickly (as in <hi rend="italic">Nepthya, Paralcyonium,</hi>
                    and the typical species of <hi rend="italic">Spoggodes).</hi> The actinosoma may

                    the type of the family, there is a very well developed sclerodermic corallum,
                    with true thecae enclosing the polypes, but without septa. The corallum is
                    bright red in colour, and is composed of tubular, cylindrical thecae, usually
                    growing regularly side by side, but at a little distance from one another, and
                    united at intervals by horizontal epithecal expansions, which represent external
                    tabulae. There are no septa, nor internal tabulae; and Dr Perceval Wright has
                    shown that the tubes are really composed of fused spicules. The polypes are
                    green, with eight pinnate tentacles studded with lenticular spicules. The

                    tentacles, with a slightly elevated lip, and leads into a small stomach-sac.
                    There are eight mesenteries, within which the reproductive organs are contained.
                    The exothecal expansions, by which the tubes are united, appear to be produced

                    which is non-polypiferous, and is plunged in the sand and mud of the sea-bottom.
                    The upper portion of the colony carries the polypes, and varies much in shape.
                    Sometimes the polypes are borne on long lateral pinnae, which give the upper

                    >Pavonaria</hi> the polypes are non-retractile, and are disposed on one side of

                    also unilateral, but the polypiferous surface is thin and reniform. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Umbellularia,</hi> the polypes are carried in a cluster at the top
                    of the actinosoma. The corallum in the <hi rend="italic">Pennatulidae</hi> is
                    usually two-fold, consisting on the one hand of a slender, styliform, horny, or
                    calcareous axis (sclerobasis) concealed within the coenosarc, which it serves to
                    support, and, on the other hand, of small calcareous spicules scattered amongst
                    the soft tissues. In some cases the sclerobasis is rudimentary. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Pennatulidae</hi> often possess the power of phosphorescence in a
                    high degree, and they possess the same system of caeno-sarcal canals as is
                    characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">Alcyonaria</hi> generally. The polypes
                    have eight pinnately-fringed tentacles, and eight mesenteric folds. In many
                    cases, as originally shown by Kölliker, the colony consists of two classes of
                    zooids, the one composed of sexually mature polypes, the other, more numerous,
                    composed of sexless polypes, in which the tentacles are not developed.</p>
                <p>Fam. IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gorgonidae.</hi> —The “Sea-shrubs” possess a more
                    or less branched caenosarc, which is permanently rooted to some foreign object,
                    and is provided with a grooved or sulcate branched βclerobasis, with which are
                    associated true tissue-secretions in the form of variously shaped sclerodermic
                    spicules (“sclerites”). As regards their soft parts, the <hi rend="italic"

                    the polypes possessing eight fringed tentacles, with eight mesenteries, united
                    by a canal-system, which ramifies through a fleshy caenosarc. The caenosarc,
                    however, is always closely applied to, and supported by, a more or less branched
                    sclerobasis, over which it forms a thin fleshy expansion (“cortex ”), and the
                    polypes are capable of complete retraction within the caenosarc. The soft
                    tissues are also abundantly supplied with true sclerodermic secretions, In the

                    colours, which are in many instances so characteristic in their form that they
                    can be employed as a ground of generic distinction. The spicules (“sclerites’
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi>) are usually buried in the soft tissues, but they
                    may project beyond the surface of the caenosarc in such numbers as to render the

                    sclerobasis varies greatly both in texture and form. Sometimes it resembles that

                    its surface is always striate or grooved, whereas in the “Black Corals” it is
                    smooth or echinulate. Its form is usually more or less branched, dendroid, or
                    minutely arborescent (as in <hi rend="italic">Primnoa,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Muricea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gorgonia, Leptogorgia,</hi> &amp;c.), or it may

                    sclerobasis is branched and articulated, composed of alternating calcareous and
                    horny joints, and having the new branches produced from the calcareous nodes. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Melithaea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mopsea,</hi> again, the
                    corallum is likewise branched and articulated; but the joints are alternately
                    hard and soft; the hard joints being composed of fused calcareous spicules, and
                    the flexible joints of horny matter intermixed with calcareous spicules and
                    connective tissue, whilst the new branches are developed from the corneous
                    segments. Lastly, in Red Coral <hi rend="italic">(Corallium)</hi> the
                    sclerobasis is unjointed, more or less branched, and densely calcareous. It is
                    of a red or pink colour, and finely grooved upon Its surface; and it is really
                    composed of fused spicules, and thus differs very materially from the true
                    sclerodermic corallum. The calcareous axis is covered with a bright red
                    caenosar-cal crust or cortex, which is studded by the apertures for the polypes.
                    The polypes are milk-white in colour, with eight pinnately-fringed tentacles,
                    and completely retractile within the fleshy bark. The polypes are further placed
                    in direct communication by means of anastomozing canals channelled out of the
                    caenosarc and filled with a nutrient fluid. It has been shown by Lacaze-Duthiers
                    that the colonies of <hi rend="italic">Corallium</hi> are sometimes composed of
                    male polypes, sometimes of female, or occasionally all the polypes of some
                    branches of a colony may be of one sex, and all the polypes of other branches of
                    the opposite sex, whilst in some instances polypes occur which are hermaphrodite
                    and combine in themselves the organs of both sexes.</p>

                    to found this family for the reception of the existing genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heliopora</hi> and a number of extinct forms previously placed amongst the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tabulata.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Heliopora</hi> there exists a
                    well-developed sclerodermic corallum, of a composite nature, and composed of
                    corallites united by caenenchyma. The corallites are tubular, crossed regularly
                    by well-developed tabulae, and having their walls folded in such a manner as to
                    give rise to a variable number (generally twelve) of septal laminae. The
                    caenenchyma is composed of slender tubes, of smaller size than the true
                    corallites, and packed closely side by side. The caenenchymal tubuli are
                    destitute of septa, but, like the corallites, are crossed by regular transverse
                    tabulae. The sclerenchyma is not composed of fused spicules, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Corallium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tubipora,</hi> but of
                    fibro-crystalline calcareous tissue, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoantharia</hi><hi rend="italic">sclerodermata.</hi> The soft parts occupy only
                    the parts of the corallum above the uppermost tabulae, and therefore only a
                    surface-layer of the colony is actually alive. The polypes are. completely
                    retractile, with pinnately-fringed tentacles, which are introverted in
                    retraction. There are also eight lobed mesenteries, but these in no way
                    correspond with the <pb break="no"

                    septa are thus seen bo be pseudo-septa, and they cannot be regarded as
                    homologous with the septa of the <hi rend="italic">Zoantharia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sclerodermata.</hi> The caenenchymal tubes are occupied by sacs
                    lined by the endoderm, which are closed externally but communicate freely with
                    the somatic cavities of the polypes by means of transverse canals. Mr Mosely
                    su""ests, with great probability, that the sacs lining the caenenchymal tubes
                    are really of the nature of aborted polypes. (A similar suggestion was put forth
                    by the present writer with regard to the caenenchymal tubuli of <hi

                <p>The investigations and discoveries of Mr Mosely with regard to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heliopora</hi> are of special interest, as settling the true position of a
                    number of fossil corals, which had previously been placed in the Tabulate

                    >sclerodermata,</hi> but which must now be referred to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcyonaria.</hi> The discovery, also, of tabulae combined with a genuine
                    sclerodermic corallum in an undoubted <hi rend="italic">Alcyonarian</hi> further
                    raises a question as to the true affinities not only of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tabulata</hi> generally, but also of the <hi rend="italic">Rugosa;</hi> whilst
                    the discovery of septa which do not correspond with the mesenteries of the
                    living animal will produce important results in the study of the fossil corals
                    generally. Without entering into any of these questions here, there can be no
                    doubt but that the extinct genus <hi rend="italic">Heliolites</hi> and its
                    allies are so closely related to <hi rend="italic">Heliopora</hi> as to
                    necessitate their being placed in the <hi rend="italic">Aloyonaria</hi> as
                    members of the family <hi rend="italic">Helioporidae.</hi> In the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Heliolites</hi> there is a well-developed sclerodermic corallum,
                    the corallites being tubular, regularly tabulate, and usually with
                    well-developed septa, whilst the caenenchyma is composed of tabulate, geometric
                    tubuli, smaller than the corallites and without septa. In the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Plasmopora</hi> the corallum is very similar to that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Heliolites,</hi> differing chiefly in the fact that the
                    caenenchyma is more vesicular, and the tubuli are not so distinct. <hi
                    rend="italic">Propora,</hi> again, can hardly be separated from <hi
                    rend="italic">Plasmopora,</hi> its chief distinction being that the calices are
                    exsert. <hi rend="italic">Lyeilia,</hi> also, is closely related to <hi
                    rend="italic">Heliolites. Polytremacis,</hi> also, differs from <hi
                    rend="italic">Heliolites</hi> chiefly in its granular surface, and it is hardly
                    separable from <hi rend="italic">Heliopora</hi> except by the fact that its
                    septa are more developed. Finally, there are various extinct genera, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Fistulipora, Callopora,</hi> &amp;c., which have very close
                    relationships to <hi rend="italic">Heliolites,</hi> though they are destitute of
                    septa, and which very probably will have to be ultimately associated in the same
                    group.</p>
                <p>With regard to the <hi rend="italic">distribution in space</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alcyonaria, it</hi> is sufficient to say that they are very widely
                    spread over the globe, occurring in all seas from the warmest to the coldest,
                    and at almost all depths. The <hi rend="italic">Alcyonidae</hi> are for the most
                    part inhabitants of shallow water, but the <hi rend="italic">Pennatulidae</hi>
                    are represented up to almost the greatest depths yet sounded by the dredge. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Gorgonidae</hi> are principally shallow-water forms, and
                    attain their maximum of development in the seas of the tropics, abounding on
                    coral reefs, to the beauty of which they greatly contribute. The red coral of
                    commerce <hi rend="italic">{Corallium</hi><hi rend="italic">rubrum)</hi> is a
                    Mediterranean species, and occurs principally at depths of from 5 to 6 fathoms,
                    though extending its range up to 120 fathoms or more. It is very largely sought
                    after, and obtains a high price for ornamental purposes. The “coral fishery” is
                    carried on by means of machines of different construction, which are dragged
                    over the sea-bottom, and which usually injure more of the coral than they
                    actually bring to the surface. Hence many valuable coral-beds have been
                    completely exhausted, and the industry has no longer the importance that it
                    formerly possessed. The “Organ-pipe corals” (<hi rend="italic">Tubipora)</hi>
                    are confined to the warm seas of the “coral-reef region;” and the genus <hi

                    rend="italic">Helioporidae,</hi> is confined to the Pacific and Indian

                <p>As regards their <hi rend="italic">distribution in time,</hi> none of the <hi

                    to the living <hi rend="italic">Virgulariae,</hi> but it appears to be certainly
                    not of this nature, and is probably a graptolite. The family of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ilelioporidae</hi> is well represented in the Palaeozoic period;
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Heliolites</hi> being Silurian and Devonian, <hi
                    rend="italic">Propora</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lyeilia</hi> being Silurian,
                    and <hi rend="italic">Plasmopora</hi> Silurian and doubtfully Devonian. If <hi
                    rend="italic">Callopora</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fistulipora</hi> be referred
                    to this group, then we may also consider that we have Carboniferous and Permian
                    representatives of it. The genus <hi rend="italic">Polytremacis,</hi> again, is
                    confined to the Cretaceous period. The family of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gorgonidae</hi> is not known to be represented with certainty earlier than the
                    Eocene Tertiary, tw o genera <hi rend="italic">ſMopsea</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Websteria)</hi> being found in the London clay. The genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Corallium</hi> has been doubtfully quoted from the Upper Oolites
                    and Upper Cretaceous, and undoubtedly occurs as early as the Miocene. The
                    Miocene deposits have also yielded species of <hi rend="italic">Isis, Gorgonia,
                    Gorgonella,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Melithaea.</hi> The family of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pennatulidae</hi> is not represented earlier than the latest
                    Secondary or the earlier Tertiary deposits. The genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pavonaria</hi> is said to occur in the Pisolitic Limestone of France, whilst
                    <hi rend="italic">Graplιu-</hi><hi rend="italic">laria</hi> (and perhaps <hi
                    rend="italic">Virgularia)</hi> is found in the Eocene. The Miocene Tertiary has
                    also yielded species of <hi rend="italic">Virgularia, Graphularia,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Caelographula.</hi> The family of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tubiporidae</hi> has not been recognized at all in a fossil condition. Lastly,
                    the past existence of the <hi rend="italic">Alcyonidae</hi> has only been
                    recognized with any certainty in the Pliocene deposits, the Red and White Crags

                    utility and value as sources of lime, none of the corals presents any special
                    feature of industrial importance, excepting the red or precious coral <hi
                    rend="italic">(shorallvum</hi><hi rend="italic">rubrum)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the Mediterranean Sea. It, however, is and has been from remote times
                    very highly prized for jewellery, personal ornamentation, and decorative
                    purposes generally. About the beginning of the Christian era a great trade was
                    carried on in coral between the Mediterranean and India, where it was highly
                    esteemed as a substance endowed with mysterious sacred properties. It is
                    remarked by Pliny that, previous to the existence of the Indian demand, the
                    Gauls were in the habit of using it for the ornamentation of their weapons of
                    war and helmets; but in his day, so great was the Eastern demand, that it was
                    very rarely seen even in the regions which produced it. Among the Romans
                    branches of coral were hung around children’s necks to preserve them from
                    danger, and the substance had many medicinal virtues attιibuted to it. A belief
                    in its potency as a charm continued to be entertained throughout mediaeval
                    times; and even to the present day in Italy it is worn as a preservative from
                    the evil eye, and by females as a cure for sterility.</p>
                <p>The precious coral is found widespread on the borders and around the islands of
                    the Mediterranean Sea. The beds are generally from 2 to 10 miles from the land,
                    and in water of about 30 up to 130 fathoms deep; but it finds its most
                    favourable conditions in 80 fathoms water. The most important fisheries extend
                    along the coasts of Tunis, Algeria, and Morocco; but red coral is also obtained
                    in the vicinity of Naples, near Leghorn and Genoa, and on the coasts of
                    Sardinia, Corsica, Catalonia, and Provence. It is said that it attains greater
                    perfection in the east than in the south, and that it is rarely found in a
                    western and never in a northern aspect. It is found attached to rocks embedded
                    in a muddy sea bottom, in which it flourishes more than in' a clear or sandy
                    bed. In colour it varies through all shades of red, from a deep crimson to a
                    delicate rose pink or flesh colour, fine tints of which are very rare and highly
                    prized. It is also sometimes obtained of a milk white colour.</p>
                <p>From the Middle Ages downwards the securing of the right to the coral fisheries
                    on the African coasts was an object of considerable rivalry among the
                    Mediterranean communities of Europe. Previous to the 16th century they were
                    controlled by the Italian republics. For a short period the Tunisian fisheries
                    were secured by Charles V. to Spain; but the monopoly soon fell into the hands
                    of the French, who held the right till the Revolutionary Government in 1793
                    threw the trade open. For a short period (about 1806) the British Government
                    controlled the fisheries, and now they are again in the hands of French
                    authorities. Previous to the French Revolution much of the coral trade centred
                    in Marseilles; but since that period, both the procuring of the raw material and
                    the working of it up into the various forms in which it is used have become
                    peculiarly Italian industries, centring largely in Naples, Rome, and Genoa.
                    Although foreign crafts have to pay heavy dues for the right to fish on the
                    Algerian coasts, the great majority of the vessels and crews belong to Torre del
                    Greco. Two classes of boats engage in the pursuit,—a large size of from 12 to 14
                    tons, manned by ten or twelve hands, and a small size of 3 or 4 tons, with a
                    crew of five or six. The large boats, dredging from March to October, collect
                    from 650 to 850 lb of coral, and the small, working throughout the year, collect
                    from 390 to 500 lb. The Algerian reefs are divided into ten portions, of which
                    only one is fished annually,—ten years being considered sufficient for the
                    proper growth of the coral. No reliable estimates of the amount and value of
                    coral obtained annually exist; but in 1873 the Algerian fisheries alone,
                    employing 311 vessels, manned by 3150 sailors, yielded raw coral valued at
                    £113,000.</p>
                <p>The range of value of the various qualities of coral, according to colour and
                    size, is exceedingly wide, and notwithstanding the steady Oriental demand its
                    price is considerably affected by the fluctuations of fashion. While the price
                    of the finest tints of rose pink may range from £80 to £120 per oz., ordinary
                    red-coloured small pieces sell for about £2 per oz., and the small fragments
                    called <hi rend="italic">collette,</hi> used for children’s necklaces, cost
                    about 5s. per oz. In China large spheres of good coloured coral command high
                    prices, being in great requisition for the button of office worn by the
                    mandarins. It also finds a ready market throughout India and in Central Asia;
                    and with the negroes of Central Africa and of America it is a favourite
                    ornamental substance.</p>
