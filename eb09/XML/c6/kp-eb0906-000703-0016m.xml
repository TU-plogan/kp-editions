                    governor of New York, whose secretary hi became. At the same time he held the
                    office of secretary to the board of regents of the university, and to the
                    commissioners of fortifications. In 1797 he was elected member of the Assembly,
                    in 1798 member of the Senate of the State of New York, and in 1801 member of the
                    Senate of the United States. For twelve years, with two short breaks, which
                    amounted only to three years, he occupied the position of mayor of New York. He
                    was also again member of the Senate of New York from 1803 to 1811, and
                    lieutenant-governor of the State from 1811 to 1813. In 1812 he became a
                    candidate for the presidency; but he was defeated by Madison, and lost even his
                    lieutenantgovernorship. Throughout his whole career Clinton had been
                    distinguished by his intelligent support of all schemes of improvement, and he
                    now devoted himself to carrying out the proposal for the construction of canals
                    from Lakes Erie and Champlain to the River Hudson. The Federal Government
                    refused to undertake the work; but some time after, in 1815, the year in which
                    he finally lost the mayoralty, he presented a memorial on the subject to the
                    Legislature of New York, and the Legislature appointed a commission, of which he
                    was made a member, to make surveys and draw up estimates. Having thus recovered
                    his popularity, in 1816 Clinton was once more chosen governor of the State; in
                    1819 he was re-elected, and again in 1824 and 1826. In 1825 the Erie Canal was
                    completed; and he afterwards saw the work which owed so much to him carried on
                    by the construction of important branch canals.</p>
