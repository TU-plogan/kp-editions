                <p><label type="entry">CONTRACT</label> is a bargain or agreement enforceable by
                    law. The law of contract occupies so large a space in all civilized systems of
                    law, that only a few of its more leading principles can be conveniently stated
                    here. There is a general harmony in the jurisprudence of modern nations on this
                    subject which is not to be found in other departments of law. The following
                    definitions are taken from the Indian Contract Act, 1872 :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a.</hi> When one person signifies to another his willingness to

                    other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal.</p>
                <p>δ. When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the
                    proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal when accepted becomes a promise.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">c.</hi> The person making the proposal is called the promiser,
                    the person accepting the proposal the promisee.</p>

                    promise is called the consideration for the promise.</p>

                <p>These definitions, with some changes of expression in the direction of greater
                    precision, are in effect the same as those which are found in English law books.
                    The phrase “void contract,” which would be a contradiction in the Indian
                    definitions, is frequently used in English law.</p>
                <p>The exchange of proposals and acceptances by correspondence gives rise to some
                    peculiar difficulties. An offer or proposal may be revoked any time before
                    acceptance; and it is revoked when notice to that effect is given to the
                    promiser. So much is clear and free from difficulty. But when letters containing
                    proposals or acceptances are delayed or misdirected, it is not very easy to say
                    whether there has been a contract or not. When A wrote to B, “I offer you -800
                    tods of wether fleeces, &amp;c.,” “receiving your answer in course of post,” but
                    misdirected the letter, which arrived late, and B’s answer accepting the offer
                    not arriving at the expected time, A sold the goods to some one else, it was
                    held that as the delay was caused by A’s default, it must be taken as against
                    him that the answer did not arrive in course of post (Adams <hi rend="italic"
                    >v.</hi> Lindsell, 1 B. and Ald. 681). In cases following this some of the
                    judges seem to be inclined to hold that a proposer is bound by an acceptance
                    being posted to him whether it reaches him or not, and others that he is not
                    bound unless he actually receives the acceptance. An acceptance of a proposal
                    must be unqualified, otherwise there is no contract; the introduction of a new
                    condition by the acceptor, or a reference to something still to be done,
                    prevents the contract from being completed. To constitute a contract the terms
                    must be certain; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> an agreement to take a house, “if
                    it were put into thorough repair, and the drawing-rooms handsomely decorated
                    according to present style,” has been rejected as too vague. A contract of
                    course may be concluded by mere conduct, without the exchange of a single word,
                    and multitudes of contracts in small matters of constant occurrence are so
                    concluded. These are called <hi rend="italic">implied contracts—</hi> a phrase,
                    however, which covers two very different things—(1) a real contract which may be
                    inferred as a fact from the conduct of the parties, and (2) a quasi contract, in
                    which the law will treat the parties as if they had made a contract.</p>
                <p>Certain classes of persons are under peculiar disabilities in matters of
                    contract, viz., infants, lunatics, and married women. 1. As a general rule at
                    common law contracts made by an infant (a person under twenty-one years) are
                    voidable, unless they are in some way for his benefit, and in particular for
                    “necessaries.” By the Infants’ Relief Act, 1874, contracts for repayment of
                    money lent to infants, or for payment of goods other than “necessaries,” are
                    made absolutely void; and no action can be brought, even if they are ratified
                    after full age and for a new consideration. The question what are necessaries is
                    to be decided by the court and jury on the circumstances of the case, including
                    particularly the rank in life of the infant. The protection of infants has been
                    extended by the Court of Chancery to “expectant heirs” as they are called, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> persons who borrow money on the credit of their
                    expectations. The principle is a survival from the times when usury was
                    considered wrongful, and the preservation of great families a public duty, and
                    is utterly indefensible on any other considerations. 2. A married woman, being
                    in the eye of the law merged in her husband, cannot bind herself by contract. 3.
                    Contracts made by a lunatic are voidable, except where his state of mind was not
                    known to the other contracting party. The principle is extended to drunkenness.
                    For further information as to such disabilities see under the respective
                    headings. The general rule as to corporations is that they can only make binding
                    contracts under their common seal, excepting in cases of “convenience almost
                    amounting to necessity” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Corporations).</hi></p>
                <p>Of the technical terms mentioned above the most important, and certainly the most
                    characteristic, of English law is <hi rend="italic">consideration.</hi> A
                    consideration is essential to the validity of every contract unless it be made
                    in writing under seat The meaning of the word is quite accurately <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n352/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0352-0323"/> expressed by a phrase used in one of the earliest
                    cases on the subject—it is strictly a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo.</hi>
                    Something, whether it be in the nature of an act or a forbearance, must move
                    from one of the parties in order to support a promise made by the other. A mere
                    promise by A to give something to B cannot be enforced unless there is some
                    consideration “moving from B.” Such a promise the early lawyers called a nude or
                    naked promise—in imitation of the phrase in Roman law, <hi rend="italic">nudum
                    pactum,</hi> which does not, however, mean a promise unsupported by a
                    consideration, but a contract destitute of certain essential legal formalities.
                    But while every contract requires a consideration, it is held that the court
                    will not inquire into the adequacy thereof; any consideration will do.
                    Inadequacy of consideration, however, may be important where a contract is to be
                    set aside on the ground of fraud.</p>
                <p>Modem English law requires no formalities to make a contract enforceable, unless
                    in certain special cases. The ancient rule both in early English and Roman law
                    made certain formalities essential, unless in certain special cases. The ancient
                    rule is thus the modern exception. The exceptions to the general rule in English
                    law are the following :—</p>
                <p>1. Contracts within the Statute of Frauds, 29 Car. II. c. 3.—The fourth section
                    of this important Act specifies certain classes of contracts in which “no action
                    shall be brought” unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought,
                    or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing and signed by the party
                    to be charged therewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully
                    authorized. Such contracts are—(1) any special promise by an executor or
                    administrator to answer damages out of his own estate; (2) any promise to answer
                    for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another person; (3) any agreement made
                    on consideration of marriage; (4) any contract or sale of lands, tenements, or
                    hereditaments, or any interest in or concerning them; (5) any agreement that is
                    not to be performed within the space of one year from the making thereof. The
                    17th section enacts that no contract for the sale of any goods, wares, or
                    merchandize for the price of £10 sterling or upwards shall be allowed to be
                    good, except the buyer shall first accept part of the goods so sold, and
                    actually receive the same, or shall give something in earnest to bind the
                    bargain or in part payment; or unless some memorandum or note in writing of the
                    said bargain be made and signed by the parties to be charged, or their
                    authorized agents. The difference between the two sections should be noted.
                    Contracts under the 17th section are simply void; contracts under the 4th are
                    not void, but they are not enforceable. The 4th section is a law of procedure,
                    and therefore a contract of the kind specified therein validly made in a foreign
                    country could not be enforced in England, whereas a valid contract made abroad,
                    which would be wholly void if made in England, under the 17th section, might be
                    enforced in England. And again, money paid under an agreement made unenforceable
                    by section 4 could not be recovered back.</p>
                <p>2. Contracts of corporations, already alluded to.</p>
                <p>3. Negotiable instruments, which must, of course, be in writing.</p>
                <p>4. Other cases in which writing is required are transfer of ships, assignments of
                    copyright, and ratification of debts barred by the Statute of Limitations.</p>
                <p>To contracts made by deed <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> under seal) the law
                    attributes certain qualities which do not belong to simple contracts, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> contracts whether verbal or in writing without seal.
                    The peculiar properties of a deed are thus described :—“It works a merger; it
                    operates by way of estoppel; it requires no consideration to support it; it will
                    in some cases bind the heir of the covenanter or obligor; it can only be
                    discharged by an instrument under seal, by the judgment of a court of competent
                    authority, or by Act of Parliament.” The language of the law-books is that from
                    the solemnity of a deed the law itself will imply the existence of a
                    consideration, a formula designed to bring the exceptional case of deeds within
                    the general legal theory of consideration, and by no means to be accepted as an
                    historical explanation. The subordinate agreements in a deed are termed
                    covenants. The formal definition, as given in Platt on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Covenants,</hi> is “an agreement between two or more persons by an instrument
                    in writing sealed and delivered, whereby some of the parties engage, or one of
                    them engages with the other or others of them, that some act hath or hath not
                    been already done, or for the performance or non-performance of some specified
                    duty.” See <hi rend="smallcaps">Deed.</hi></p>
                <p>An agreement is said to be void for impossibility when the thing contemplated is
                    in itself impossible, as contrary to the course of nature, and when it is by
                    construction of law impossible, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> to create a new
                    manor. But when the thing is not in itself impossible, but is or becomes
                    impossible in fact, an unconditional agreement is not thereby void. Thus a
                    contract to load a full cargo of guano at a certain island does not become void
                    by the fact that there is not enough guano on the island to make a full cargo.
                    In a recent case (Thorn <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Lord Mayor of London) a
                    contractor, who had undertaken to build a bridge according to specifications
                    supplied by defendant, found it impossible to execute part of the work according
                    to specification, and it had to be executed in another way. It was held that
                    there was no condition that the plans should be reasonably practicable, and the
                    plaintiff was not allowed to recover for work executed in an impossible attempt
                    to comply with the specifications. In another case, a contractor bound himself
                    under penalties to finish some buildings within a certain time, with any
                    alterations and additions required by the defendants, and no extension of time
                    was to be allowed for such alterations, unless expressly granted by defendants.
                    It was held that the contractor could not excuse himself for non-completion
                    within the proper time by showing that the alterations and additions made it
                    impossible.</p>
                <p>Besides the contracts which are void through defect of form or want of capacity
                    in the parties, there is a large class of agreements which the law refuses to
                    recognize on account of the character of the contemplated action. These may be
                    reduced to three main divisions— <hi rend="italic">illegal</hi> contracts, when
                    the thing to be done is forbidden by law; <hi rend="italic">immoral</hi>
                    contracts, when the consideration belongs to the indefinite class of things
                    recognized as immoral; and contracts, <hi rend="italic">against public
                    policy,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> certain wide and more or less in
                    definite principles of government. In some cases, the act of agreement is in
                    itself a criminal offence, for which see <hi rend="smallcaps">Conspiracy.</hi>
                    An agreement to commit an offence, as to burn a house, or kill a man, or an
                    agreement to do a civil injury to another, would be illegal. Promises made in
                    consideration of illicit cohabitation in the future are void as immoral; if the
                    consideration is illicit cohabitation in the past, it is of course no
                    consideration, and a promise founded upon it will be void unless expressed in a
                    deed. Of agreements which are void as being against public policy, the most
                    important class is that of contracts in restraint of trade. The leading
                    authority on this subject is the case of Mitchell <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Reynolds (1 <hi rend="italic">Smiths Leading Cases).</hi> The law, it seems, is
                    so jealous of the freedom of the trader, that it will not allow him to part with
                    it on any consideration. “It is the privilege of a trader in a free country, in
                    all matters not contrary to law, to regulate his own mode of carrying it on
                    according to his own discretion and choice. If the law has regulated or
                    restrained his mode of doing this, the law must be obeyed. But no power short of
                    the general law ought to restrain his free discretion.” It has been suggested
                    that the rule dates from a time when a covenant by a man not to exercise his own
                    trade meant a covenant not to exercise any trade at all,—everyman being obliged
                    to confine himself to the trade to which he had been apprenticed. At any rate,
                    it is difficult to reconcile this protection of the individual will, carried to
                    the point of absolutely limiting its exercise in one class of cases, with modern
                    principles as to freedom of trade and contract. And the law itself breaks in
                    upon its own theory by admitting that contracts which are only in <hi
                    rend="italic">partial</hi> restraint of trade may be good. A contract not to
                    carry on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n353/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0353-0324"/> business of an ironmonger would be bad; but a
                    contract made by the seller of an ironmonger’s business not to compete with the
                    buyer would be good. It is held that to make such a promise binding, it must be
                    founded on a valuable consideration, must not be unlimited as to the area over
                    which the restriction is to extend, and must not otherwise go beyond what is
                    reasonably necessary for the protection of the other party. On the whole, it
                    would be simpler to leave individuals to make what contracts they please in this
                    as in other matters. The public policy which disallows contracts in restraint of
                    marriage depends on a different set of considerations. A contract not to marry
                    at all is void; in one case it is described as a contract to omit a moral duty,
                    and tending to depopulation, “the greatest of all political sins.” But
                    apparently a contract by a widow not to marry is not void. The whole doctrine of
                    public policy appears to have grown up out of the efforts of judges to
                    counteract the admission of wagers in the common law as legal contracts. In
                    their desire to avoid enforcing them in particular cases, they developed a
                    theory of state interests of startling wideness and originality. A wager about
                    the death of Napoleon I. was held void because it gave one party an interest in
                    keeping the king’s enemy alive, and the other an interest in putting him to
                    death. (See Pollock on <hi rend="italic">Contracts,</hi> p. 252.)</p>
                <p>Contracts may be vitiated by mistake, misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence,
                    &amp;c. Mistake, to avoid a contract, must be such that there was no real
                    agreement at all, or that the real agreement was erroneously expressed; and
                    money paid under a mistake as to fact may be recovered. The general rule is that
                    relief will be given against mistake as to fact, but not against mistake in law.
                    Contracts induced by fraud, misrepresentation, &amp;c., are in general not void
                    but voidable at the instance of the party injured or imposed upon.</p>
                <p>The common law did not permit the benefit of contracts to be assigned so as to
                    give the assignee a right of action in his own name—a right which was, however,
                    recognized in equity. By the Judicature Act, 1873, section 6, a legal right is
                    created in the assignee when the assignment is absolute and in writing, and
                    notice in writing given to the debtor.</p>
                <p>The only remedy for breach of contract given by the common law was an action for
                    the sum certain due by the defaulter, or for damages, to be ascertained by a
                    jury. The mere payment of damages would in many cases not be a complete
                    satisfaction to the other party, and the Court of Chancery accordingly gave in
                    certain cases decrees for the specific performance of the contract.</p>
                <p>The best English works on Contract are those by Addison, Chitty, and S. Martin
                    Leake. The <hi rend="italic">Principles of Contract at Law and in Equity,</hi>
                    by F. Pollock, is a recent work of great merit. (E. R.)</p>
