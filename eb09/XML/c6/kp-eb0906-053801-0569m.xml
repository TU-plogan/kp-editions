                    spawning; in the male the abdomen is much narrower and is somewhat triangular in
                    shape. Like all other Decapod Crustaceans crabs are furnished with ten legs, of
                    which the anterior pair are modified so as to form nippers—powerful prehensile
                    organs and principal weapons of offence. These are largest in the male, and the
                    right claw is generally larger than the left. The other limbs usually end in a
                    single claw, which in the posterior pair in swimming-crabs is more or less
                    flattened and paddle-like ( Plate X. fig. 2). Their eyes, which are compound,
                    are placed upon stalks, measuring in some instances an inch in length (Plate X.
                    fig. 3), and these when not in use fit into cavities in the carapace or shell
                    which covers the entire upper surface. Crabs, like insects, undergo
                    metamorphosis. On emerging from the egg they are provided with long tails,
                    swimming appendages, and sessile eyes, and bear so little resemblance to the
                    parent form that until half a century ago their connection with the crab was
                    altogether unsuspected. They were then known as <hi rend="italic">zoeas.</hi>
                    After moulting, the eyes appear on stalks and nippers on the anterior pair of
                    legs, but this form is still sufficiently uncrablike to have deceived early
                    zoologists, who described it as forming a distinct genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Megalops),</hi> and it is not till a further casting of the skin that the
                    creature assumes the perfect form. As its internal parts continue to grow its
                    external shell soon becomes too small, and is cast off,—the crab generally
                    concealing itself until its new and greatly enlarged covering gets sufficiently
                    hardened. This process of moulting takes place very frequently in the young
                    crab, and gradually becomes rarer as the creature approaches its full growth,
                    crabs being often found with oysters attached to the carapace which from their
                    size must have grown there for three or four years. A still more remarkable
                    power is that possessed by crabs of reproducing limbs which have been
                    voluntarily thrown off, or have been lost by accident. This renewal only takes
                    place when the limb has been severed at the second articulation; but when broken
                    at any point nearer the extremity the creature generally succeeds in throwing
                    off the part between.</p>
                <p>Among the numerous species of crabs which abound everywhere on or near the
                    sea-coast tho following may be noticed.</p>
                <p>(1) The Great or Edible Crab <hi rend="italic">(Cancer</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pagurus),</hi> the Carabus of the Romans and the Partan of Scotland. This is
                    one of the largest, and as an article of food is certainly the most valuable, of
                    the short-tailed Decapods, being everywhere esteemed for the delicacy of its
                    flavour. It abounds chiefly on the rocky parts of the coasts of Europe, and
                    often measures 12 inches across the carapace, weighing in the larger specimens
                    fully 12 lb. The principal British crab-fisheries are off the north-east coast
                    of Scotland, in the Firth of Forth, and off the coast of Cornwall; and the home
                    produce is largely supplemented by imports from Norway. In the capture of this
                    crustacean “crab-pots,” made of wicker-work, with the entrance at the top, and
                    baited with dead fish, are employed. These are sunk in the proper localities,
                    and their position indicated by a piece of cork attached to a line connected
                    with the wicker trap. In the sheltered bays of the west of Scotland this crab is
                    also caught in calm weather by poking it from behind with a long pole, which the
                    crustacean immediately seizes, and which is then gently shaken, making the crab
                    adhere all the more tenaciously, and giving the fisherman the opportunity he
                    seeks of hoisting it into his boat. When caught, crabs are kept alive till
                    wanted by being placed in perforated boxes which are then sunk at some
                    convenient spot in the sea. Those caught off Lizard Point are conveyed to
                    Falmouth Harbour, where they are individually branded, and put in boxes which
                    are then placed under water. Recently it was stated on good authority, that one
                    of those cases having gone to pieces, thus liberating the imprisoned crabs, many
                    of them were shortly after caught again on their old feeding-ground—a distance
                    of eleven miles from the place where they had been confined. As they had been
                    conveyed to Falmouth by boat, it is impossible with our present knowledge to say
                    by what sense they were thus unerringly guided on their return journey.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The male crab is generally
                    larger than the female, especially in its claws, and is more sought after as a
                    table delicacy; the flesh of both sexes immediately after the casting of the
                    shell is watery and unwholesome. During moulting the female is generally guarded
                    by a male, which if removed is shortly replaced by another, and it is after the
                    completion of the moulting process in the female that the union of the sexes
                    takes place. The spawn is carried for a considerable time on the abdominal
                    appendages before being deposited, an operation which takes place in spring and
                    summer. Recently fears were entertained that through over-fishing the stock of
                    crabs in British waters was being seriously diminished, and a commission at
                    present (1877) sitting was appointed to take evidence on this matter at the
                    principal seats of the crab fishery. Fr om the evidence already collected it
                    appears that these fisheries are now much less productive than formerly, and
                    that the size of the crabs has greatly diminished, while their cost has
                    enormously increased; for while forty years ago a dozen of the largest crabs
                    could be had for 10d∙, the same number of medium sized specimens now coβts 3s.
                    Those who have given evidence are generally in favour of a 5-inch gauge in order
                    to prevent the wanton destruction of young crabs, and also of a close time; but
                    great diversity of opinion exists as to the best season for this, although the
                    period from the beginning of June to the end of Augustis that most generally
                    recommended.</p></note></p>
                <p>(2) The Shore Crab <hi rend="italic">(Carcinus</hi><hi rend="italic">maenas)</hi>
                    is the species most commonly met with on all parts of the British coast.
                    Although found in deep water, its favourite haunts are beneath the stones that
                    lie between low and high water mark, and its awkward sidelong gait as it sidles
                    off to its place of concealment must be familiar to the most casual observer of
                    shore life. It is a shy creature, eluding observation beneath stones or buried
                    in the sand, its telescopic eyes alone visible, and feigning death when unable
                    otherwise to cope with danger. Unlike the former species, its legs, especially
                    the posterior pair, are flattened and ciliated so as to form swimming organs.
                    Owing probably to the small size of this species, it has obtained little
                    prominence as an article of food, although in flavour it is said to rival the
                    Great Crab. Large numbers, however, are eaten by the poorer classes in seaport
                    towns, and they are also to be had in the London fish markets. They feed chiefly
                    on the spawn of fish and the smaller crustaceans.</p>
                <p>(3) Pea Crabs <hi rend="italic">(Pinnotheres,</hi> Plate X. fig. 5) are small
                    crustaceans ii which the sexes so differ that the males and females were at one
                    time described as separate species. The female is larger than the male, and its
                    external covering is softer; and they are further remarkable in taking up their
                    residence in the shells of living bivalve mollusks, especially in the pinna, the
                    cockle, and the mussel. The soft-bodied female is never found outside of its
                    adopted shell, although the harder cased male is thus occasionally met with. The
                    Pinna Pea Crab <hi rend="italic">(Pinnotheres</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >veterum),</hi> which abounds in the Mediterranean, makes its home in the pinna
                    shell, and ancient writers have given highly imaginative descriptions of the
                    object of this alliance between crustacean and mollusk. It was believed that on
                    the entrance of food <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n572/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0572-0539"/> “within the gaping circuit of the shell,” the
                    active little crab pricked the tender sides of its sluggish partner, who
                    understanding the hint closed its shell upon the prey</p>
                <p>“Thus fed by mutual aid, the friendly pair Divide their gains, and all the
                    plunder share.”</p>
                <p>(4) The <hi rend="italic">Inachus</hi><hi rend="italic">Kempferi,</hi> found in
                    Japanese waters, is the largest of known crabs. It measures 10 feet between the
                    tips of its nippers, each of which is <hi rend="italic">5</hi> feet in length.
                    The body, however, is comparatively small and triangular in shape. It is said to
                    be eaten by the Japanese.</p>
                <p>(5) Land Crabs occur in various parts of the tropical world, and are especially
                    abundant in the West Indies. The Violet Land Crab <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gecarcinus</hi><hi rend="italic">ruricola,</hi> Plate X. fig. 1) of Jamaica
                    lives in communities and forms burrows in the ground, often two or three miles
                    from the sea. These crabs are provided with powerful pincers, which they are not
                    loath both to use and to lose, for when attacked they fix upon the enemy with
                    their great claw, which is then thrown off, and as the muscles connected with it
                    retain their tension for some time after the severance, the creature seeks to
                    make its escape while pain is still being inflicted by the now independent claw.
                    They remain in their burrows by day, and come forth at night in search of food,
                    running about with great speed and retiring, when possible, to their holes, in
                    the presence of danger. They renew their connection with the sea once a year,
                    visiting it in order to deposit their spawn. They travel by night, directed by a
                    powerful instinct which causes them to march straight for their destination,
                    surmounting whatever difficulties may be in their way. At this season they are
                    taken in great numbers, and their flesh is regarded as one of the chief
                    delicacies of the island. Like their marine congeners they cast their shell, but
                    unlike these, it is immediately after the moulting process that they are in best
                    condition for the table. The Calling Crab <hi rend="italic">(Gelasimus
                    tetragonon)</hi> of Ceylon has its left claw exceedingly small, while its fellow
                    is larger than all the rest of the body, and this it carries aloft as if
                    brandishing a weapon (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Crustacea,</hi> fig. 65); while
                    the Racer Crab <hi rend="italic">(Ocypoda ceratoph-thalma)</hi> digs deep
                    burrows in the sandy roads of that island, sufficient to render them dangerous
                    for horsemen, were the holes not regularly filled up by a band of labourers.</p>
                <p>(6) The Robber Crab <hi rend="italic">(Birgus</hi><hi rend="italic">latro)</hi>
                    belongs to that division <hi rend="italic">(Anomoura)</hi> of the Decapod
                    Crustaceans which forms a connecting link between crabs and lobsters, the
                    abdominal segments not being folded beneath the breast as in true crabs. It is
                    an inhabitant of the islands in the Indian Ocean, and makes its burrows under
                    the cocoa-nut trees, the fruit of which forms its principal food. It was
                    formerly supposed to ascend these trees and break off tho nuts, but the
                    researches of Darwin, Bennet, and others seem to prove that they only make use
                    of the nuts which they find already fallen. In order to get at the edible
                    contents of these, they strip off the fibrous envelope so as to lay bare the
                    eye-spots, into one of which they insert the sharp edge of a claw, and by
                    working this backward and forward they gradually scoop out the substance of the
                    nut. According to another authority, after inserting the claw, they sometimes
                    proceed to crack the hard shell by beating it against a stone. The fibre which
                    they remove from the nut is employed by them in lining their burrows; it is also
                    gathered by the natives and made into mats, &amp;c. The Robber Crab attains a
                    length of 2 feet, and has usually a mass of fat under the tail which, according
                    to Darwin, often yields when melted as much as a quart of limpid oil.</p>
                <p>(7) In the Hermit Crabs <hi rend="italic">(Paguridae,</hi> Plate X. fig. 7) the
                    abdomen is soft and pulpy and destitute of protecting plates, the safety of this
                    defenceless part being provided for by the entrance of those creatures into
                    univalve shells to which they become so closely attached by means of certain
                    hooked appendages of the abdomen, that it is impossible to drag a Hermit Crab
                    from its adopted shell without tearing the body asunder. The mouth of the shell
                    is guarded by the claw, the larger pincers of some of these crabs being, says
                    Darwin, “most beautifully adapted when drawn back to form an operculum to the
                    shell nearly as perfect as the proper one.” The most common and the largest of
                    the British species is the Soldier Crab <hi rend="italic">(Pagurus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bernhardus,</hi> Plate X. fig. 4), to be seen at all seasons on
                    our coasts, inhabiting a great variety of univalve shells from the tiny natica
                    to the largest whelk, the latter being the shell usually chosen by the adult
                    crab. It changes its residence so soon as it has outgrown the dimensions of the
                    place, and its new premises seem to be generally selected with a view to the
                    future growth of the creature. Dead shells appear in some cases to .be thus
                    employed, but it is believed that in most instances the crab kills the mollusk
                    in order to secure its shell. Hermit Crabs are largely used as bait. See <hi
