                <p><label type="entry">CONSTANTINOPLE</label>, the capital of Turkey and of the
                    Ottoman empire, is situated at the junction of the Bosphorus and the Sea of
                    Marmora, in 4l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 0' 16" N. lat. and 28° 59' 14" E.
                    long. It may be said to stand upon two promontories rather than upon two
                    continents, since the quarter now called Galata was reckoned in the time of
                    Arcadius tho 13th Region, whereas Kadikeui (Chalcedon) and Iskudar or Scutari
                    (Chrysopolis), situated on the opposite coast of Asia Minor, have been always
                    distinct cities. The promontories on which the capital lies are divided the one
                    from the other by the last and largest of those inlets which cut the western
                    shore of the channel known as the Bosphorus. This inlet is a large and important
                    harbour, running from east to north west, capable of floating 1200 ships. It
                    curls up in a course of little more than four miles to the foot of the hills
                    which, joining the heights on either side, seem to form a vast amphitheatre,
                    till it meets the united volume of two streams—the Cydaris and Bar-bysus of the
                    ancients—the two whelps of the oracle,—</p>
                <p>“Bless’d they who make that sacred town their home, By Pontus’ mouth upon the
                    shore of Thrace, There where two whelps lap up the ocean foam, Where hind and
                    fish find pasture at one place.”</p>
                <p>This peculiar harbour has always, by reason both of its form and its fulness,
                    been called the Golden Horn. It is “like a stag’s horn,” Strabo says, “for it is
                    broken into wavy creeks like so many branches, into which the fish pelamys
                    (τryλoφt,υς) running is easily snared.” In former times this fish was, and at
                    the present day might be, a source of rich revenue—ever from time immemorial
                    rushing down from the Sea of Azoff and the Black Sea, and when it approaches the
                    white rock, on which stands the Maiden’s (miscalled Leander’s) Tower, glancing
                    off it, and shooting straight into the Horn, but never enriching the rival city
                    on the coast of Asia—Chalcedon, “the City of the Blind.” If the figure of a
                    stag’s horn resembles the harbour, that of an ancient drinking-horn would
                    represent the general form of Constantinople proper—the Seraglio point being
                    turned inward like the sculptured mouth-piece. On this knot the Megarian city
                    stood gathered about its Acropolis, and occupying the easternmost hill on the
                    verge of Europe. Constantine aimed at building his new capital, after the old,
                    on seven hills; his wish was fulfilled—not at first, however, but a century
                    after its dedication,—and he wished <pb break="no"

                    of the ancient city. But it is the founder, not the model, that is commemorated
                    in the name <hi rend="italic">Constantinople,</hi> while its designation as “New
                    Rome” lingers nowhere but in the official language of the Orthodox Eastern
                    Church. Its Turkish name of Istamboul, ol ’ Stamboul, is said to be a corruption
                    of the Greek words cìç <hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fqv</hi> About the end of the 18th century it was corrupted by a fanatical
                    fancy into Islambol, or the city of Islam. Like the name, the emblem also of the
                    city was adopted from the Greeks by the Ottomans. The crescent and star formed
                    its device from the earliest times, and is found on Byzantine coins and on the
                    statues of Hecate. So the body-guard of the Sultan retain <hi rend="italic"
                    >insignia</hi> of the Varangian Guard of the Greek empire, of which traces seem
                    to have been discovered in the Crimea. The sign manual of the sultans, rudely
                    representing a left hand, originated with the action of a sultan who is said to
                    have signed with a bloody hand a treaty with the republic of Ragusa.</p>
                <p>Under Constantine, who founded it on the site of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Byzantium</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> the city was more than doubled.
                    His forum was fixed on the second hill; the walls were extended till a new
                    inclosure was made, which spanned the peninsula from about the end of the old
                    bridge to the mouth of the River Lycus in Vlanga Bostan; the line of his walls
                    was not direct, but made a compass round the Polyandrion, or Heroon. It is said
                    that 40,000 Goths were employed in first raising and afterwards manning these
                    works; the seven gates separated the eight cohorts, each of 5000 men. Being
                    Arians, the Goths were allowed no room within the city which they made safe for
                    the Orthodox, but had assigned to them a quarter outside, which was called,
                    either from several columns or from the one of Constantine that stood
                    thereabout, <hi rend="italic">Exokionion</hi> (the region without the columns),
                    and the Gothic inhabitants of the quarter were styled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exolcionitae.</hi> So noble was this body or guild accounted among their
                    countrymen, that many illustrious Goths were enrolled in it,—with others, the
                    kings of Italy. In the course of time, after Anastasius had drawn a longer line
                    of defences higher up, from the neighbourhood of Lake Dercon on the Euxine to
                    Selymbria on the Propontis, and many of the Gothic cohorts were called away to
                    defend these fortifications, the meaning of the name was by degrees forgotten,
                    until it was changed into Hexe-Kionia, or Hexe-Marmora (six marble columns); and
                    at last this corrupt form was rendered literally by the new occupants in their
                    tongue <hi rend="italic">Alti-Mermer</hi> (six columns), which name remains to
                    the present day. As this is a landmark showing the limit of Constantine’s walls
                    on the south, another sign is extant bearing witness to their extent on the
                    north. This is a mosque, once a church, which is visible from the Golden Horn.
                    Its Turkish name, Kahireh, or Kahrieh, is thought to have been formed into a
                    resemblance of that of the capital of Egypt from the Greek χωpα. The monastery
                    to which this church of the Saviour belonged was <hi rend="italic">'Ni.ovη
                    τrj&lt;s χωρaς,</hi> or, as we say, “in the fields.” This was an ancient
                    establishment, and its church, the oldest church in the city, dates from the 3d
                    century. Hither were brought, and entombed in sarcophagi, the remains of St
                    Babylas and two other martyrs who suffered under Decius in the persecution of
                    250 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> At the beginning of the 5th century the
                    Goths, being pressed by Attila and his Huns out of their settlements below the
                    Balkan, flocked towards Constantinople to join their countrymen there and find
                    refuge in its suburbs. It then became necessary to entrench this extra-mural
                    camp. Accordingly in 412, under Theodosius IL, the first Theodosian wall was
                    raised by the prefect Anthemius; and in 447 a second was added by the prefect
                    Cyrus Constantinus, who advanced the fosse, and of the earth dug out of it
                    formed an artificial terrace between two lines of defence. The Goths were long
                    subjected to exclusion from the city; Justinian exempted the Exocionites,
                    indeed, from the penalties which he exacted from all other Arians in the empire,
                    but required them still to meet for public worship outside the walls. Some
                    monuments to members of the body of <hi rend="italic">Faederati,</hi> found
                    outside the fifth gate, and perhaps the name Cerco-porta, a memento of their
                    round church, or one of their circular forts, may mark the residence, as they
                    intimate the heresy, of the noble guards of the Greek emperor. Arianism had died
                    out when this body was reinforced by the Varangians—Anglo-Danes—in the 11th
                    century; accordingly, it is not surprising to recognize in a Byzantine church in
                    a quarter called Bogdan-Serai, within the walls on the fifth hill, the church of
                    St Nicholas and Augustine, founded by an Anglo-Saxon who fled from the Normans
                    to take service under the Greek emperor. It is maintained that most of the
                    numbers distinguishing the cohorts attached to the several regions and walls
                    remain to this day, as Deuteron, Triton, Pempton, and Hebdomon. Upon the
                    completion of these Theodosian walls there ensħed a double arrangement of gates;
                    towngates, communicating with the public roads, alternated with military gates
                    which opened upon the terraces only. These town-gates, to the number of seven,
                    communicated with the seven gates of Constantine’s wall each by a broad street,
                    which separated the cohorts and their quarters. These gates were opened in peace
                    but shut in time of war, and then the bridges connecting them with the country
                    roads and crossing the fosse in front were taken down at the approach of the
                    enemy. The military gates had no such bridges leading from them; they served
                    only to give egress to that part of the garrison which was required to work the
                    engines of war planted upon the terraces outside and below. The city gates in
                    the Theodosian walls had for the most part the same names as the gates in the
                    wall of Constantine which corresponded to them—with this difference, that they
                    were styled “New.” Thus the gate “Roussion,” so named from the “demus” of the
                    “Reds,” in the latter, answered to the “New” Roussion in the former. It is on
                    this accouut that the existing gate is to this day called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yeni</hi> Kapu <hi rend="italic">(New</hi> gate) as well as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mevlanelι</hi> Kapusi (gate of the Dervishes). The gate of Adrianople (Edreneh
                    Kapusi) was formerly that of Polyandrion, and took its title from the
                    corresponding gate in the wall of Constantine, called so because it stood near
                    the Polyandrion or Heroon adjoining it, which was attached to the church of the
                    Holy Apostles; the site is now occupied by the mosque of Mahomet the Conqueror
                    (Mehmedieh).</p>
                <p>The landward walls of Constantinople bear marks of the labour of many hands, and
                    represent different and distant epochs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> At several points these walls have been repaired and
                    restored, and display the names of “rois constructeurs” from Theodosius to John
                    Palaeologus. They may be described roughly as four lines drawn across the
                    promontory -which they inclose for the distance of about four English miles, and
                    knotted at each end into a citadel. The work at each extremity is more recent
                    than what intervenes—that near the Sea of Marmora is to this day almost perfect;
                    and the Golden Gate remains with its flanking towers of marble, much as it
                    appeared in the 5th century, and fronted by the smaller arch which has generally
                    appropriated the name. Of the five towers at the other end near the Golden Horn
                    some remains exist, viz., the tower of Anema and that of Isaac Angelus. On the
                    north side the wall of Theodosius breaks off at the palace of the Hebdomon, and
                    the continuous fosse ceases where a later line has been thrown out with massive
                    towers—this is the wall of Heracl:us, supposed to have been raised to protect
                    the imperial quarter of Blachernae, containing the palace of that name and the
                    church of St Mary. Similarly a second wall was constructed to cover the church
                    of St Nicolas, in the time of Leo the Armenian, whence it is called the Leontine
                    wall. This line of defence, long impregnable, withstood siege after siege till
                    the new artillery made <pb corresp="kp-eb0906-0333-0304" xml:id="pbn9304"/>
                    three great breaches—the first between Tekfur-Serai and Edreneh Kapusi; the
                    second near the fifth military gate—that of Charisius, in the valley of the
                    Lycus; and the third between Selymbria gate and Mevlaneh gate.</p><p>The walls
                    on the western or land side of the city are connected with the continuous line
                    which defended it on the two sides that face the water, and which, with a few
                    breaks, is still standing. That part which runs parallel with the Golden Horn is
                    varied in Balata by the insertion of an arch, still preserving a Victory, and by
                    a pier now lying far back on the strand; built first by Zeno, it displays on its
                    successive towers the names of Michael and Theophilus. The other part which
                    turns the point shows the same names, but differs widely here and there in
                    construction from the portions across the land and by the Horn, being formed so
                    as to receive the beating of the waves indirectly, and strengthened with shafts
                    of marble so as to resist most effectually the corrosive action of sea-water.
                    This contrivance is especially to be noticed between Vlanga and Ahor-Kapusi, and
                    shows the foresight of the builders; the great tower which locks the sea-wall
                    with the land-walls is one mass of marble,—on the other hand the land-walls are
                    constructed for the most part of marble or stone and brick alternately, to
                    resist more easily, as it has been supposed, shocks of earthquake. In tracing
                    the course of the sea-wall from the Acropolis to the Seven Towers, the sites of
                    all and the ruins of some of the following places have been noted in order :—the
                    Orphanotrophaeum; the churches of St Demetrius, St Barbara, and the Hodegetria;
                    the Porta Carea (corrupted into Karacapu) beyond the palace and harbour of
                    Boucoleon; the imperial palace; the Porphyry Chamber (the origin of the epithet
                    “born in the purple” ); the palace of Hormisdas; the churches of Sts Sergius and
                    Bacchus; the Portus Julianus and Sophianus, now Caterga Liman, with the Sophiana
                    Palace; the Con-toscalium, Koum-Capu; the harbour of Theodosius—outer and inner—
                    now a garden called Vlanga Bostan,—its mouth flanked by two noble towers joined
                    by a wall before the last siege; the harbour of Aemilianus; St John of the
                    Studium; and at last the citadel called Hepta-pyrgion, the Seven
                    Towers.</p><p>The entire circuit of the walls is about 13 miles.</p></note>
                    Their construction is unique. If the <pb corresp="pbn9304"

                    quadruple; the two inner lines are furnished with a series of towers, the
                    smaller below, the larger above—round, octagonal, or square—at about 150 feet
                    apart. As the gaunt array of castles droops into the valley, or seems to climb
                    the hill beyond, one may decipher some of its now obscure inscriptions on marble
                    or in tile work (one seems to be a prayer to Christ), and wonder at the
                    contrivance which appears to defy a natural law. The great ditch, now a
                    productive vegetable garden, is divided into a number of compartments or open
                    cisterns, which used to be filled with water brought by pipes, carried along
                    each partition-wall, and furnishing the supply from cisterns from within and
                    without the city.</p>
                <p>Equally remarkable with these fortifications is the system of large cisterns,
                    which are said to have furnished water to 1,000,000 men during four months; they
                    were a necessity to a city subject to perpetual assault. One seems to have been
                    annexed to every considerable monastery and palace— imperial and patrician. They
                    may be reckoned the more ancient portion of the city, which is thus
                    subterraneous;— for while the buildings above ground are scarcely any of them,
                    in the condition now visible, older than the time of Justinian, the cisterns
                    that can be distinguished date from the times of Arcadius, Theodosius, and
                    Constantine.</p>
                <p>The position assigned to the old imperial palace is, generally speaking, that of
                    the mosque of Ahmed, which adjoins the Hippodrome. It was not one large edifice,
                    but a scattered group of buildings within gardens, spreading to the Hippodrome
                    on the one side, and on the other to the sea-shore; the northernmost point of
                    its inclosure reached the site occupied now by the fountain of Ahmed III., then
                    by the Geranion. This palace was gradually abandoned after the 12th century for
                    that of Blachernae within the Horn. It was separated from the church of St
                    Sophia by the Augusteum—the square in which stood the statue of Justinian
                    looking towards Persia, the Milliarium, and among other monuments the column
                    that bore the silver statue of the Empress Eudoxia, which occasioned the
                    remonstrances of St Chrysostom. Ma homet IL, built his new palace (the seraglio)
                    on the site of the Acropolis, about which ancient Byzantium had clustered, a
                    situation specially favourable to his purpose, as it afforded the combined
                    advantages of a lovely prospect, a perfect retreat from the noise of the city,
                    and a facility for observing all the movements in the harbour. In erecting it he
                    followed the three divisions of the palace of the Byzantine emperors—(1) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chalce,</hi> the defensive part held by the guards; (2) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Daphne,</hi> which touched the Hippodrome and was used for
                    receptions; and (3) the private chambers occupied by the imperial household. The
                    three corresponding portions of the Ottoman palace are distinguished by their
                    several gates :—(1) <hi rend="italic">Babi Houmaioum,</hi> the Imperial Gate,
                    opening into the court of the Janissaries; (2) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orta-Kapusi,</hi> Middle Gate, in which the sultan receives on high festivals;
                    and (3) <hi rend="italic">Babi Saadet,</hi> Gate of Felicity, where he formerly
                    received ambassadors. Of late years the sovereign has resided in winter at
                    Dolma-bakcheh or Tcheragan; in summer at Begler-beg on the Asiatic shore, or at
                    some inland kiosk.</p>
                <p>The main streets of the Stamboul of the present day follow the lines of the city
                    of Constantine; thus the tramway, which turns from the New Bridge towards Serai
                    Bournou, upon reaching the platform of St Sophia, enters upon the direction of
                    the M«n? (Mése, middle street), now called Divan Yoli. The Mése parted into two
                    branches, of which the one went to the gate Roussion ,or new gate, the other to
                    the Polyandrion. On the north of the middle street one branch passed along the
                    shore of the Golden Horn from the place where the railway station is, and issued
                    at the gate Xy]ocircus near Balata. On the south, another street passed through
                    the two Golden Gates. These three main lines were distinguished from the smaller
                    tortuous streets by their adornment as well as by their breadth. They were
                    bordered by rows or covered ways and arcades called <hi rend="italic"
                    >tμβoλoι,</hi> some of them double, with pavements above, decorated with
                    statues, &amp;c. A few traces of the <hi rend="italic">emboli</hi> still remain
                    <hi rend="italic">in silu,</hi> just as there are fragments of the ancient
                    bazaars, khans, and baths. Imperial gates closed the lines of these principal
                    thoroughfares.</p>
                <p>The following is an outline of the modern city, divided according to the seven
                    hills and the intervening valleys. On the 1st hill, the most easterly, are
                    situated the remains of the Seraglio, former palace of the Ottoman sultans; the
                    great church-mosque St Sophia; St Irene; the imperial mint; the Atmeidan
                    (Hippodrome), with three of its numerous monuments remaining; the mosque of
                    Ahmed, &amp;c. Along the 1st valley are traced the walls of the Seraglio on the
                    west, made up of ancient materials, and the Babi Ali or Sublime Porte. The
                    tramway runs along this valley. On the 2d hill stands the Burnt Column, that of
                    Constantine the Great (which stood in the centre of his forum, and under which
                    are said to be the instruments of the Crucifixion and a Palladium of Troy), and
                    the Mosque of Osman. The 2d valley is occupied by the bazaars, several khans,
                    and the mosque of Valideh Sultan, or Yeni Jami, overlooking the bridge and the
                    head of the tramway. On the 3d hill are the Seraskierat (War Office) on the site
                    of the cemetery of the Byzantines and the forum of Theodosius; the fire-tower,
                    and the mosque of Suliman. Along the 3d valley is carried the Aqueduct of
                    Valens, built out of the walls of Chalcedon destroyed for the citizens’
                    rebellion; near it is At-Bazar (horse-market). On the 4th hill rises the mosque
                    of Mahomet II., where stood the church of the Holy Apostles and the church of
                    the Pantocrator. South of this mosque, in a garden, is seen Kiz-tash, the
                    Maiden’s Column, or column of Marcian, once that of Venus. On the 5th hill
                    follows the mosque of Selim, on the edge of a large open cistern, south of which
                    is the covered cistern of Arcadius. Below <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0334-0305"/> on the north lies the Phanar (so named from a
                    lighthouse), the Greek quarter which reaches to the Golden Horn. This division
                    includes the church of the Patriarchate, the great school of the Greek nation,
                    the church-mosque Fetiyeh Jamisi (Pammacaristou), and the church of the Mongols
                    (Mougloutissa). The 6th hill is distinguished by the palace of the Hebdomon,
                    with its coronation hall, built, it is said, by Constantine I., and known
                    vulgarly as Tekfur-Serai—palace of the lord (τoυ <hi rend="italic">κvpiov).</hi>
                    At its foot appears the church-mosque Kahrieh, or Kahireh, formerly Mone tes
                    Choras (Mow) <hi rend="italic">της</hi> χωpας). Below this hill, the quarter
                    called Balata, from Palatium, now occupied by Jews, follows the Phanar, then the
                    ancient suburb of Blachernae. Here are seen some remains of the Pentapyrgion,
                    —five towers used by the Greeks of the Lower Empire as a political prison. This
                    quarter is succeeded by Eyoub, celebrated for its mosque—which no Christian may
                    enter— and for its cemetery. In this quarter, after Greek precedent, the
                    sovereign is invested. On the hill near, in the Cosmidion, the first crusaders
                    pitched their tents. The</p>
                <p>7th hill is to be looked for in the most southern corner of the city. It is
                    occupied by the fortress of the Seven Towers, the political prison of the
                    sultans. It is isolated by the River Lycus.</p>
                <p>Of the ecclesiastical buddings of Constantinople by far the most important is the
                    Mosque of St Sophia, or <hi rend="italic">Aya Sofia Jamisi,</hi> which ranks as
                    perhaps the finest example of the Byzantine style. In striking contrast with the
                    nobler specimens of Gothic architecture, it presents from the outside an uncouth
                    and disproportionate appearance, even the effect of its unusual dimensions being
                    destroyed by its lack of symmetry. But within the visitor cannot fail to be
                    impressed by the bold span of the arches and the still bolder sweep of the dome,
                    while his eye is at once bewildered and charmed by the rich, if not altogether
                    harmonious variety of decoration, from the many-coloured pillars down to the
                    mosaics and inscriptions on the walls. The dome is raised at the centre 180 feet
                    above the ground, and has a diameter of 107 feet; its curve is so slight that
                    the depth is only 46 feet, and round the rim it is relieved by a row of forty
                    windows. The arrangement of the building may be understood from the plan on next
                    page; and the magnificent volumes of Fossati and Salzenburg furnish all that can
                    be desired in the way of views of the different parts of the interior. The first
                    stone of St Sophia, or the Church of the Divine Wisdom, was laid in Õ32 on the
                    site of several successive churches of the same name, the first of which had
                    been erected by Constantine the Great. Anthemius of Tralles and Isidores of
                    Miletus were the architects employed by the emperor Justinian, at whose <pb

                    than 10,000 workmen are said to have been engaged under the direction of 100
                    master builders; and when the woιk was completed it had cost tho imperial
                    treasury about £1,000,000. The principal material of the walls was brick, but
                    the whole interior was lined with costly marbles; and to add to its spléndours
                    the temples of the ancient gods at Heliopolis and Ephesus, at Delos and Baalbec,
                    at Athens and Cyzicus, were plundered of their columns. To render the dome as
                    light as possible it was constructed of pumice-stone and Rhodian bricks, and to
                    secure the building from the ravages of fire no wood was employed except for the
                    doors. Not long after its completion the dome was shaken by an earthquake, but
                    it was repaired by Isidore, the grandson of the original architect. In 1453
                    Mahomet converted tho church into a mosque, arid since that date numerous minor
                    alterations have been made in the less essential parts of the building. A pretty
                    complete restoration was effected in 1847-49 by Fossati, who found that the
                    weight of the dome was too great for the Supporting walls, threatening the whole
                    with destruction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> The
                    churches of Constantinople in 1202 were, according to Alberich, 500. Of more
                    than 50 the remains or the sites have been identified. Six of these are in the
                    possession of Christians,—five being held by the Greeks and one by the
                    Armenians. The five ⅛urches are (1) Mougloutissa (Mongolian); (2) St George of
                    the Cypress in Psamathia; (3) the Ayasma (holy well) of St Mary in Blachernae;
                    (4) the Ayasma of the Sleep of St Mary, between the mosques Zeirek and Vefa; (5)
                    the Ayasma of St Therapon(a Cyprian martyr) in the Seraglio wall near Pasha
                    Kapusi. The church indicated as given to the Armenians is Perioleptou (Soulou
                    Monastir), Possibly another church similarly transferred might be named, in
                    Balata, to which a monastery was annexed. Three other churches, though not
                    turned into mosques, have passed out of the hands of the Christians— St Irene,
                    Sts Nicolas and Augustine, and St Juliana. In the sea-wall of the Seraglio
                    gardens is the eastern entrance of another church— perhaps St George of the
                    Mangana; to the north, is the Ayasma of the Saviour.</p></note></p>
                <p>The most remarkable of the church-mosques, besides St</p>
                <p>Sophia, are the following:—(1) <hi rend="italic">Kutfihuk Aya Sophia,</hi> the
                    original model of the great church. It was built for Justinian before his
                    accession, and dedicated to martyrs of his own Illyrian race—SS. Sergius and
                    Bacchus. The lower stage is the original fabric. Here, according to Mahometan
                    tradition, Messiah appeared among the worshippers. (2) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pqntocrator</hi> (the Almighty), now Zeirek Jamisi, a triple church of the
                    Comneni. Its monastery became the headquarters of the Latins in the 13th
                    century. (3) <hi rend="italic">St John of the</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Studium</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Emer-ahor—a basilica. Here was the famous
                    monastery of Acaemeti (watchers) and a school of church poets. (4) The <hi
                    rend="italic">Church of the Saviour,</hi> with the monastery of the Chora, as
                    being not only <hi rend="italic">ìv</hi><hi rend="italic">τfi χ&lt;μpa</hi> (“in

                    ζωvτωv</hi> the (land of the living), a gem of beauty still, even in its decay,
                    rich with mosaic of the 14th century of a style purer and more refined than that
                    which is more often seen and admired at Ravenna and Palermo. In this church,
                    alternately with the Hodegetria, was kept the Holy Robe of the Virgin, which was
                    wont to be carried in procession when the walls were threatened, and with which
                    the patriarch Photius is said to have scared away the first Russian fleet which
                    came against the city down the Bosphorus in the 9th century. (5) <hi
                    rend="italic">Pammacaristou—</hi> Fetiyeh Jamisi. The Greek patriarch moved
                    hither from the Church of the Holy Apostles which had been assigned him. One
                    dome of this church is still full of mosaic work.</p>
                <p>The mosques of Constantinople are reckoned variously from 350 to 500, mesjids
                    (chapels) included. Many of them retain the materials as well as occupy the
                    sites of ancient churches. The great mosque of Suliman was chiefly built of the
                    remains of the church of St Euphemia at Chalcedon, where the fourth Oecumenical
                    Council was held, 451. This church stood above the valley of Haidar-Pasha, near
                    Kadikeui; an ayasma belonging to it stands near the railway terminus at a little
                    distance from the shore. The imperial mosques, that of Eyoub included, are nine
                    in number. Most of them stand on high ground; and, with the harmonious contrast
                    of dome and minaret, they offer to the eye a more pleasing view than the
                    Christian churches of the past. The hills may be counted as these lordly
                    structures follow in stately order, and the monuments of Osman, Suliman,
                    Mahomet, and Selim seem to repeat the form fixed on the first hill by the
                    architects of Justinian; and on high festivals their soaring minarets, more airy
                    than the campaniles of the West, and beaming with festoons of light, shine out
                    like beacons over the neighbouring waters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Calata and Pera.—</hi> Along the north shore of the Golden Horn
                    spreads the quarter known as Galata, rising up to the crest of the hill and
                    including the massive tower which crowns it. Beyond and above Galata, Pera
                    stretches forward along the ridge that runs parallel with the shore. Both these
                    quarters are chiefly inhabited by Christians, native and foreign. Galata is the
                    seat of commercial establishments, Pera that of the diplomatic bodies. At the
                    foot of the great tower of Galata is gathered a cluster of English
                    institutions,—the consulate, consular court, consular prison, seamen’s hospital,
                    post-office, and sailors* home. Several institutions, native and foreign, have
                    been established of late years in Pera. The main street which connects these two
                    quarters winds up from the outer bridge. A little beyond the Municipality House,
                    it is crossed by another near the point where it separates the Russian Embassy
                    from the Hotel d’Angleterre; hence the Greek name of Pera <hi rend="italic"
                    >'½ravpo§póµ.iov</hi> (the cross roads). This street, rising tortuously from
                    above Tophaneh, is said to have been formed by the track of Mahomet’s fleet of
                    boats, which were rolled up to the crest of the hill and then down on the other
                    side to the inlet below Kassim-Pasha, on the edge of which the Divan-Haneh
                    (Admiralty) now stands. Before reaching the point of intersection this street,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n336/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0336-0307"/> called Koumbaraji Sokak (street of bombardiers),
                    passes beside the elegant English church (Crimean memorial church) which was
                    consecrated under the name of Christ Church in 1868. The great tower of Galata,
                    like that of the Seraskierat (War Office) on the opposite height in Stamboul, is
                    used as a fire-tower. In the times of Genoese occupation it was the main castle
                    or keep of the town; it was heightened, not founded, by those settlers from
                    Italy. The original tower was built about the end of the 5th century by the
                    emperor Anastasius Dicorus. Since that time it communicated with another huge
                    tower (long ago destroyed), which stood near the site of the present terminus of
                    the Adrianople Railway in Stamboul,—the tower of Eugenius. It was joined to this
                    tower in. time of war by an iron chain laid across the Golden Horn to keep out
                    enemies’ ships, while a similar chain, fastening the tower of Eugenius to a fort
                    replaced now by the Maiden’s tower (miscalled Leander’s), barred the passage of
                    the Bosphorus. From the tower of Galata there spread out, as spokes from an
                    axle, some three or four lines of wall, which ran downward till they met on the
                    right the line which guarded the quays, on the left a sweeping line which
                    embraced that extension of the town which had crept along the shore as far as
                    the modern Tophaneh. The inner line, which unequally divided the quarter that
                    lies between the bridges, was double. Some portions of this and of the others
                    still exist, with towers and gateways; but of the numerous tablets visible upon
                    them when they were standing, two only remain in their original place. Below the
                    double wall, which gave passage to troops from the great tower to the seaward
                    wall, stands the remarkable mosque called Arab-jamisi (Saracens’ mosque). Its
                    form and contents serve as a record of the history of Galata. Its minaret,
                    unlike the miftarets of Turkish mosques, is square, recalling the Moorish towers
                    of Spain. Remains of Genoese monuments on its floor and in the outer court
                    testify to its Christian use. Originally a Mahometan place of worship, it is not
                    orientated, nor has it an apsidal termination. It is said to have been first
                    built for the Arab colony that lingered here since the invasions of
                    Constantinople by the Arabs. When Galata, already occupied by the Genoese at the
                    commencement of the 13th century, was, from motives of gratitude or of policy,
                    given up entirely to that colony of daring merchants by Michael Palaeologus on
                    his recovery of the city from the Latins, this mosque became their chief church;
                    but when, nearly two centuries afterwards, the Ottoman Turks became masters of
                    Constantinople, it reverted to its first purpose, and Christian worship gave way
                    to Mahometan. Besides the great tower and some ruins of walls and towers, the
                    massive blocks of building that are now banks and merchants’ offices, the palace
                    of the podestà, the Lombard church known as St Benedict’s, which is at this day
                    a centre of French philanthropic and religious works, are existing memorials of
                    the settlements of those Genoese merchants, the active and successful rivals of
                    the Pisans and Venetians,—whose proper quarters lay at the foot of the tower of
                    Eugenius, now within the Seraglio wall—and the ancestors of the enterprizing
                    merchants of later times who are known and respected as the Greeks of the island
                    of Scio. The names Pera and Galata have not always been restricted to their
                    present limits. <hi rend="italic">Pera,</hi> like <hi rend="italic">Peraea,</hi>
                    is Greek, designating the region over the water, and was naturally employed as
                    from Constantinople to mark that quarter of the city which lay on the other side
                    of the Golden Horn. The name was accordingly first given to the lower portion of
                    the town, now called Galata and formerly Sycae (the fig-trees). This quarter of
                    the city was enlarged and adorned by Justinian, but before his time, under
                    Arcadius, it was reckoned one of the regions of Constantinople. The ground which
                    it covered seems to have been used still earlier as a cemetery of the Christian
                    citizens, and corresponded thus with the site of the Seraskierat in Stamboul, on
                    the third hill, which heathen monuments—discovered on the spot—show to have been
                    the burial-place of the citizens of Byzantium. As all Galata was in former times
                    called Pera, so Pera seems to have been sometimes included in Galata.
                    Galata-Serai, the palace of the Turkish governor of Galata (now a Franco-Turkish
                    lyceum), is situated in the centre of Pera. The name Galata, which has been the
                    subject of much dis cussion, appears to be the corruption of the Italian <hi
                    rend="italic">Calat&lt;e</hi> (descent), the name whereby that quarter of an
                    Italian seaport town is known which spreads over the sloping shore. Until a few
                    years ago Galata and Pera were separated by a dry moat. This has lately been
                    filled up with streets.</p>
                <p>Two bridges of boats span the Golden Horn and unite Galata to Stamboul. The inner
                    one, constructed of iron, though new, has, in taking the place, adopted the name
                    of a former bridge constructed in the reign of the-Sultan Mahmoud, and is still
                    called the Old Bridge. It stretches from the western end of Galata to the
                    quarter on the Stamboul side «. which is called Oun-Capou. The outer bridge is
                    known as that of Karakeui, as it extends from a part of Galata so named, and
                    also as the bridge of the Valideh Sultan, because the opposite end of it rests
                    on the shore below the mosque of the Valideh-Sultan, otherwise Yeni Jami, or the
                    new mosque. A third bridge, constructed during the Crimean -war between Hasskeui
                    and Aivan Serai, has disappeared. There is said to have existed in ancient times
                    one bridge—that of Justinian. The bridge built by Philip of Macedon seems to
                    have crossed the river at the head of the Horn.</p>
                <p>The climate of Constantinople is generally healthy, owing to the position of the
                    city, its natural drainage, and the currents of the Bosphorus, but the
                    temperature is subject to great and sudden changes.</p>
                <p>It is true of the capital, as of the country at large, that no point is so hard
                    to ascertain as the sum total of the inhabitants and the relative proportions of
                    its parts. Byzantius in 1851 reckoned the population of the city and its suburbs
                    at about one ⅛illion, viz.,—500,000 Turks, 220,000 or 300,000 Greeks, 50,000 or
                    120,000 Armenians, 70,000 Jews, 10,000 Franks, and 70,000 miscellaneous.
                    Official statistics return the population of the city and suburbs as not
                    exceeding 700,000 in 1877.</p>
                <p>The Mahometan public schools are of three classes :— (1) The primary district
                    schools— <hi rend="italic">Malιdleh</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> for boys and
                    girls mixed; (2) for boys, the provincial schools— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rushdiyelι</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> of a higher order; (3) for young men,
                    the mosque schools— <hi rend="italic">Medresselι,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a
                    sort of theological seminaries. There are said to be 500 medressehs in Stamboul
                    alone. In the first class of schools are taught the Turkish alphabet and the
                    reading of the Koran in Arabic; in the second, reading, elements of writing,
                    principles of arithmetic, and Turkish geography and history; in the third,
                    besides theology, Turkish, Arabic, and sometimes the Persian language. The age
                    of entrance into the first is about five years; into the second, ten. Most lads,
                    on leaving these secondary schools, at about sixteen years of age, proceed no
                    higher. Besides the public schools, which are open to all Mahometan youth
                    without distinction, there arø special Government schools. The five chief
                    establishments are the military, naval, and artillery schools, the school of
                    military engineering, and the medical school. To each of these is annexed a
                    preparatory school— <hi rend="italic">Idadìyelc.</hi> A few other special
                    schools are a training-school for teachers in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bushdiyeh,</hi> a school of languages for translators, and a school for
                    managers of woods and forests. The most Important institution for supplying good
                    secondary instruction is the metropolitan lyceum of Galata, which has <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n337/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0337-0308"/> generally been under French direction. A large
                    school for orphans of different nationalities was opened some years ago near the
                    mosque of Selim in Stamboul.</p>
                <p>Among the philanthropic establishments of the capital must be reckoned the <hi
                    rend="italic">Imarets,</hi> intended like the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >Xenones</hi> to be at once hospitals and poor-houses. They are attached to most
                    of the mosques, and may be about 300, though many are fallen into decay.</p>
                <p>The bazaars call for particular notice. They are large fire-proof buildings,
                    lighted from above, where the varied wares of the city are retailed.</p>
                <p>The city numbers, besides, about 180 khans (groups of offices and store-houses
                    for merchandize), and some 130 hammams, or baths.</p>
                <p>The trade of Constantinople carried on now, as under the Greek empire, by
                    foreigners, is not distinguished by any speciality. Its harbour is a convenient
                    centre to many lines of commerce, sheep’s wool, mohair, goat-skins, grain,
                    &lt;fcc., being transhipped from the coasts of Asia and the Black Sea. Great
                    improvements have been introduced of late. Besides the steamers which secure
                    communication with foreign ports, others ply between the city and its suburbs on
                    the Horn, the Bosphorus, and the Sea of Marmora.</p>
                <p>The streets, though ill paved, have been some of them enlarged, and many on the
                    Pera side are lighted with gas; but the greatest improvement of all is the
                    formation of an active and highly disciplined fire-brigade.</p>
                <p>It is sometimes said that modern Constantinople, after so many earthquakes in
                    earlier centuries, and conflagrations in all, retains few relics of the past;
                    but several monuments have been already named, and others might be added. They
                    are most numerous about the Hippodrome— that centre and focus of the city’s
                    life, and theatre of its revolutions, its festivities, and its crimes. Besides
                    the remains of six palaces, five columns entire or in fragments are pointed
                    out—memorials of the 1st, 3d, 4th, and 5th centuries, and associated with the
                    historical names of Claudius II and Constantine, Theodosius and Arius, Arcadius,
                    Eudoxia, Marcian, and Chrysostom. Tombs of the great lie about in various
                    corners and courts. It is to be remembered, moreover, that the greater part of
                    the Greek city is under ground,—that besides the ruins or remains of more than
                    20 churches, and of the colonnades that lined the streets or divided the
                    bazaars, and which still are met with by the passenger along its public
                    thoroughfares, there spread out of sight beneath his feet labyrinths of
                    passages, cisterns, and prisons of length and direction unknown, so that he may
                    be said to walk not so much on <hi rend="italic">terra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >firma,</hi> as on a continuous roof.</p>
                <p>The history of the city is almost a record of its sieges. About 100 years after
                    its enlargement or foundation by Constantine the Great (330 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.)</hi> began that series of assaults by sea and land before which it gave
                    way only thrice, when its gates were opened to Dandolo, Michael Palaeologus, and
                    Mahomet II. Michael, by the aid of his Varangians, recovered, 200 years before
                    its final capture, what the Latins had held nearly 60 years; and 100 years
                    before it surrendered, the Ottoman Turks profited by the divisions in the
                    empire, and were called into the east of Europe as the followers of the same
                    anti-Christian standard had been called into the west, till the last Constantine
                    fell in defending the city which the first had raised and named. Constantinople
                    was threatened by the Huns in the reign of Theodosius the Younger, 450; by the
                    Huns and Slavs in that of Justinian, 553; by the Persians and Avars in that of
                    Heraclius, 626. The Arabs besieged it in three different expeditions. They came
                    under Sophian in 668,and attacked it six times, once every year (672-679), when
                    Constantine Pogonatus was emperor. Leo the Isaurian repelled a second invasion
                    under Moslemeh in 717. They were finally led by Haroun-al-Rashid, who made peace
                    with Constantine and Irene in 782. The Russians assailed the sea-walls of the
                    capital four times from 865 to 1043, in the reigns of Michael III. and his
                    successors. Romanus Lecapenus, who beat them back when they were come down the
                    second time, had to repel another enemy—the Hungarians—in 924. It was not by
                    arms, but by the treachery of Gilpracht, the leader of the German guard, that
                    Alexius Comnenus entered one of the land-gates and seized the throne(1081); and
                    another Alexius, with his father Isaac Angelus, brought the Latins, who occupied
                    the city for 56 years, after the two sieges of 1203 and. 1204, until Michael
                    Palaeologus embossed bis name as conqueror on the bronze gates of St Sophia. In
                    the 15 th century Constantinople was attacked by the Turks twice; under Manuel
                    it resisted Amurath in 1422; but under Constantine Palaeologus it yielded to
                    Mahomet in 1453. The city has thus been often the aim, rarely the prize, of
                    invasion.</p>
                <p>The captures of the city by the Latins and the Turks brought loss to the East and
                    gain to the West. In an age when the Goths on the one side, and Arabs on the
                    other, had ruined traffic elsewhere, Constantinople was the greatest and almost
                    the only commercial town in the world, while Greek supremacy at sea secured a
                    flow of riches into the state; but, the citizens being dispersed during the
                    sixty years of Latin occupation, all commerce was transferred to the cities of
                    Italy. To that Latin conquest is mainly attributed the sudden development of the
                    formative arts in the 13th century, for then there arose more frequent
                    intercourse between the Greeks and the Italians, and many Greek artists were
                    established in Italy, especially at Venice, Siena, Pisa, and Florence. In like
                    manner, the fall of the city before the Turks scattered Greek learning among the
                    Latin and Teutonic races; when Greek libraries were burnt and the Greek language
                    proscribed, Greek MSS. of the Bible, sedulously copied by the monks of
                    Constantinople from the 5th to the 15th century, conveyed the text into Western
                    Europe; the overthrow of the capital of Greek literature synchronized with the
                    invention of printing, and in a great measure caused the revival of learning.
                    Since that last siege which introduced the Ottoman rule, the city from being the
                    object became the starting-point of invasion; for long ages the busy hive of
                    science and art, it was turned into a swarming nest of hornets. The mausoleum of
                    Haireddin (Barbarossa) at Beshiktash, a suburb of the city, is a memorial of the
                    subjugation of the Northern States of Africa; a ruin, beneath the Burnt Column,
                    once the residence of Busbek, in the 16th century, bears witness to the
                    privileges and the restraints of the ambassadors of Germany; and inscriptions
                    left on the inner walls of the Seven Towers, ranging in date from 1698 to 1800,
                    record the imprisonment and the liberation or death of captives, Venetians,
                    French, &lt;fcc., and the obstinate struggles in which the Ottomans engaged with
                    the different powers of Europe. The last European ambassador imprisoned there
                    was Le Brun, envoy of the French republic; he was thrown in on the news of the
                    French landing in Egypt, and remained three years. A fter the tide of fortune
                    turned on the repulse of the Turkish forces from Vienna in 1683, Constantinople
                    began to be once more the special mark for ambition or revenge. When the peace
                    of Carlowitz was signed in 1699 a new enemy was rising in the North; in 1770 the
                    city was threatened by tho Russian fleet joined by the English squadron. In 1807
                    Vice-Admiral Duckworth, having forced the passage of the Dardenelles, appeared
                    before Constantinople, but the Turks put themselves in a posture of defence, and
                    after eight days his squadron retreated. For further historical details, see <hi
