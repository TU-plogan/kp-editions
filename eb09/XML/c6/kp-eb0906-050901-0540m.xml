                    degree at the age of fifteen. His antiquarian tastes were early displayed in the
                    collection of ancient records, charters, and other manuscripts, which had been
                    dispersed from the monastic libraries in the reign of Henry VIII.; and
                    throughout the whole of his life he was earnestly engaged in gathering materials
                    for his library and museum of antiquities from all parts of England and the
                    Continent. Perhaps his first pamphlet is that maintaining the right of the
                    English ambassador to precedence over the envoy of Spain, which was written at
                    the request of Elizabeth. On the accession of J ames I. he was knighted, and
                    soon after he was employed in drawing up a <hi rend="italic">Memorial on Abuses
                    in the Navy,</hi> in consequence of which a navy commission was appointed, of
                    which he was made a member. He also presented to the king an historical <hi
                    rend="italic">Inquiry into the Crown Revenues,</hi> in which he speaks freely
                    about the expenses of the royal household, and asserts that tonnage and poundage
                    are only to be levied in war time, and to “proceed out of good will, not of
                    duty.” In this paper he proposed the creation of the order of baronets, each of
                    whom was to pay the Crown £1000; and in 1611 he himself received the title. In
                    1615 Cotton, as the intimate of the earl of Somerset, whose innocence he always
                    maintained, was placed in confinement on the charge of being implicated in the
                    murder of Overbury; nor did he obtain his release till he had paid £500 for a
                    pardon. Shortly before he had been examined before a royal commission, being
                    suspected of having made known to Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, the
                    intentions of the English court. The charge is supported by the despatches of
                    Gondomar to Madrid, though probably Cotton deserves no serious blame. From
                    Charles I. and Buckingham Cotton received no favour; he was the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ι</hi> intimate friend of Sir John Eliot, Sir Symonds d’ Ewes,
                    and John Selden. In 1626 he gave advice before the council against debasing the
                    standard; and in January 1628 he was again before the council, urging in courtly
                    language the summons of a Parliament. His arguments on the latter occasion are
                    contained in his tract entitled <hi rend="italic">The Danger in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ιvhiclι</hi><hi rend="italic">the Kingdom now standeth and the
                    Remedy.</hi> In October of the next year he was arrested, together with the
                    earls of Bedford, Somerset, and Clare, for having circulated a tract known as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Proposition to bridle Parliament,</hi> which had been
                    addressed some fifteen years before by Sir Robert Dudley to James I., advising
                    him to govern by force; the circulation of this by Parliamentarians was regarded
                    as intended to insinuate, that Charles’s government was arbitrary and
                    unconstitutional. Cotton was himself released the next month; but the
                    proceedings in the Star Chamber continued, and, to his intense vexation, his
                    library was sealed up by the king. The pain caused by a base attempt to extort
                    money by attacking his character further weakened his already failing health;
                    and on the 6th of May 1631 he died. He was buried in Conington Church, where a
                    monument is erected to his memory. His son, Sir Thomas, added considerably to
                    the Cottonian library; and Sir John, the fourth baronet, presented it to the
                    nation in 1700. In 1731 the collection, wdιich had in the interval been removed
                    to the Strand, and thence to Ashburnham House, was seriously damaged by fire. In
                    1757 it was transferred to the British Museum.</p>
