                    College in Rheims and at the College of Navarre in Paris, and early displayed
                    the most varied mental activity. His first public distinctions were gained in
                    the department of mathematics. At the age of sixteen, his performances in
                    analysis elicited high commendation from D’Alembert and Clairaut, and at the age
                    of twenty-two, he composed a treatise on the integral calculus which obtained
                    warm and general approbation from the most competent judges. With his many-sided
                    intellect and richly-endowed emotional nature, however, it was impossible for
                    him to be a mere specialist, and least of all to be a mere mathematician.
                    Philosophy and literature attracted him no less than geometry or the calculus,
                    and social action, work for the public weal, was dearer to him than any form of
                    intellectual exercise. In the year 1769 he was received as a member of the
                    Academy of Sciences. His contributions to its memoirs are numerous, and many of
                    them are on the most abstruse and difficult mathematical problems. Being of a
                    very genial, susceptible, and enthusiastic disposition, he was the friend of
                    almost all the distinguished men of his time, and a zealous propagator of the
                    religious and political views then current among the literati of France.
                    D’Alembert, Turgot, and Voltaire, for whom he had great affection and
                    veneration, and by whom he was highly respected and esteemed, contributed
                    largely to the formation of his opinions. His <hi rend="italic">Lettre d’un
                    laboureur de Picardie à Μ. Necker</hi> was written under the inspiration of
                    Turgot, in defence of free internal trade in com. His <hi rend="italic">Lettre
                    d’un théologien,</hi><hi rend="italic">&lt;kc.,</hi> was attributed to Voltaire,
                    being impregnated throughout with the Voltairian anti-religious spirit. He was
                    induced by D’Alembert to take an active part in the preparation of the <hi

                    eloquent and graceful writer. He was elected to the perpetual secretaryship of
                    the Academy of Sciences in 1777, and was received into the French Academy in
                    1782. Three years afterwards he published a work on the application of the
                    mathematical theory of probabilities to judicial decisions. This work is
                    admitted to have demonstrated that the calculus had a wider range than had
                    previously been suspected, and to have permanently secured for its author a
                    distinguished place in the history of the doctrine of probability. A second
                    edition of it greatly enlarged and completely recast and revised appeared in
                    1804, ten years after his death, under the title of <hi rend="italic"

                    Madame Cabanis. His wife, said to have been one of the most beautiful women of
                    her time, is known in literature by her excellent translation of Adam Smith’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Theory of Moral Sentiments.</hi> In 1786 Condorcet published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Vie de Turgot,</hi> and in 1787 his <hi rend="italic">Vie
                    de Voltaire.</hi> Both works were widely and eagerly read, and are, perhaps,
                    from a merely literary point of view, the best of Condorcet’s writings.</p>
                <p>The political tempest which had been long gathering over France, now began to
                    break and to carry everything before it. Condorcet was, of course, at once
                    hurried along by it into the midst of the conflicts and confusion of the
                    Revolution. He greeted with enthusiasm the advent of democracy, and laboured
                    hard to secure and hasten its triumph. He was indefatigable in writing
                    pamphlets, suggesting reforms, and planning constitutions. The first political
                    functions which he exercised were those of a member of the municipality of
                    Paris. He was next chosen by the Parisians to represent them in the Legislative
                    Assembly, and then appointed by that body one of its secretaries. In this
                    capacity he drew up most of its addresses, but seldom ascended the tribune, his
                    pen being a more effective weapon than his tongue. He was the chief author of
                    the address to the European powers when they threatened France with war. He
                    devised likewise a bold and comprehensive scheme for the organization of public
                    instruction, and not only brought it before the Assembly but published an
                    exposition of it in five elaborate memoirs. In the Convention he sat for the
                    department of the Aisne. At the trial of Louis XVI. he voted the king guilty of
                    conspiring against liberty, and worthy of any punishment short of death, but
                    recommended an appeal to the people. He took an active part in the framing of a
                    constitution, which was laid before the Convention in February 1793, with an
                    elaborate prefatory dissertation of Condorcet’s composition, but another was
                    introduced, adopted, and decreed. Condorcet’s severe criticism of this latter
                    document, hif denunciation of the arrest of the Girondists, and his opposition
                    to the violent conduct of the Mountain, led tc his being accused of conspiring
                    against the Republic. He was condemned and declared to be <hi rend="italic">hors
                    la loi.</hi> Friends sought for him an asylum in the house of a Madame Vernet.
                    Without even requesting to know his name, this truly heroic woman, as soon as
                    she was assured that he was an honest and virtuous man, said, “Let him come, and
                    lose not a moment, for while we talk he may be seized.” When the execution of
                    the Girondists showed him that his presence exposed his protectress to a
                    terrible danger, he resolved to seek a refuge elsewhere. “I am outlawed,” he
                    said, “and if I am discovered you will meet the same sad end as myself. I must
                    not stay.” Madame Vernet’s reply deserves to be immortal, and should be given in
                    her own words: “La Convention, Monsieur, a le droit de mettre hors la loi: elle
                    n’a pas le pouvoir de mettre hors de l’humanité; vous resterez.” From that time
                    she had his movements strictly watched lest he should attempt to quit her house.

                    by occupying it otherwise, that his wife and some of his friends, with the
                    co-operation of Madame Vernet, prevailed on him to engage in the composition of
                    the work by which he is best known—the <hi rend="italic">Esquisse dfun

                    de</hi><hi rend="italic">l'esprit humain.</hi> Certain circumstances having led
                    him to believe that the house of Madame Vernet, 21 Rue Servandoni, was suspected
                    and watched by his enemies, he, by a fatally successful artifice, baffled the
                    vigilance of his generous friend and escaped. Disappointed in finding even a
                    night’s shelter at the chateau of one whom he had befriended, he had to hide for
                    three days and nights in the thickets and stone-quarries of Clamart. On the
                    evening of the 7th April 1794—not, as Carlyle says, on a “bleared May
                    morning,”—with garments torn, with wounded leg, with famished looks, he entered
                    a tavern in the village named, and called for an omelette. “How many eggs in
                    your omelette?” “A dozen.” “What is your trade?” “A carpenter.” “Carpenters have
                    not hands like these, and do not ask for a dozen eggs in an omelette.” When his
                    papers were demanded he had none to show; when his person was searched a Horace
                    was found on him. The villagers seized him, bound him, haled him forthwith on
                    bleeding feet towards Bourg-la-Reine; he fainted by the way, was set on a horse
                    offered in pity by a passing peasant, and, at the journey’s end, was cast into
                    the cold damp prison-cell. When the jailers looked in on the morning his body
                    lay dead on the floor. Whether he had died from suffering and exhaustion, from
                    apoplexy, or from poison, is an undetermined question.</p>
                <p>Condorcet held many opinions which comparatively few will be found ready to
                    indorse, but he was undoubtedly a most sincere, generous, and noble-minded man.
                    He was eager in the pursuit of truth, ardent in his love of human good, and ever
                    ready to undertake labour or encounter danger on behalf of the philanthropic
                    plans which his fertile mind contrived and his benevolent heart inspired. He
                    lived at a time when calumny was rife, and various slanders were circulated
                    regarding him, but fortunately the slightest examination proves them to have
                    been inexcusable fabrications. That while openly opposing royalty he was
                    secretly soliciting the office of tutor to the Dauphin; that he was accessory to
                    the murder of the Due de la Rochefoucauld; or that he sanctioned the burning of
                    the literary treasures of the learned congregations, are stories which can be
                    distinctly shown to be utterly untrue.</p>
                <p>Condorcet’s philosophical fame is chiefly associated with the work which he wrote
                    when lying concealed from the emissaries of Robespierre in the house of Madame
                    Vernet. With the vision of the guillotine before him, with confusion and
                    violence around him, he comforted himself by trying to demonstrate that the
                    evils of life had arisen from a conspiracy of priests and rulers against their
                    fellows, and from the bad laws and institutions which they had succeeded in
                    creating, but that the human race would finally conquer its enemies and
                    completely free itself of its evils. His fundamental idea is that of a human
                    perfectibility which has manifested itself in continuous progress in the past,
                    and must lead to indefinite progress in the future. He represents man as
                    starting from the lowest stage of barbarism, with no superiority over the other
                    animals which does not result directly from superiority of bodily organization,
                    and as advancing uninterruptedly, at a more or less rapid rate, in the path of
                    enlightenment, virtue, and happiness. The stages which the human race has
                    already gone through, or, in other words, the great epochs of history, are
                    regarded as nine in number. The first three can confessedly be described only
                    conjecturally from general observations as to the development of the human
                    faculties, and the analogies of savage life. In the first epoch, men are united
                    into hordes of hunters and fishers, who acknowledge in some degree public
                    authority and the claims of family relationship, and who make use of an
                    articulate language. In the second epoch—the pastoral state— property is
                    introduced, and along with it inequality of conditions, and even slavery, but
                    also leisure to cultivate intelligence, to invent some of the simpler arts, and
                    to acquire some of the more elementary truths of science. In the third epoch—the
                    agricultural state—as leisure and wealth are greater, labour better distributed
                    and applied, and the means of communication increased and extended, progress is
                    still more rapid. With the invention of alphabetic writing the conjectural part
                    of history closes, and the more or less authenticated part commences. The fourth
                    and the fifth epochs are represented as corresponding to Greece and Rome. The
                    Middle Ages are divided into two epochs, the former of which terminates with the
                    Crusades, and the latter with the invention of printing. The eighth epoch
                    extends from the invention of printing to the revolution in the method of
                    philosophic thinking accomplished by Descartes. And the ninth epoch begins with
                    that great intellectual revolution, and ends with the great politicaΓ and moral
                    Revolution of 1789, and is illustrious, according to Condorcet, through the
                    discovery of the true system of the physical universe by Newton, of human nature
                    by Locke and Condillac, and of society by Turgot, Price, and Rousseau. There is
                    an epoch of the future—a tenth epoch,—and the most original part of Condorcet’s
                    treatise is that which is devoted to it. After insisting that general laws
                    regulative of the past warrant general inferences as to the future, he argues
                    that the three tendencies which the entire history of the past shows will be
                    characteristic features of the future are :—(1) the destruction of inequality
                    between nations; (2) the destruction of inequality between classes; and (3) the
                    improvement of individuals, the indefinite perfectibility of human nature
                    itself—intellectually, morally, and physically. These propositions have been
                    much misunderstood. The equality to which he represents nations and individuals
                    as tending is not absolute equality, but equality of freedom and of rights. It
                    is that equality which would make the inequality of the natural advantages and
                    faculties of each community and person beneficial to all. Nations and men, he
                    thinks, are equal, if equally free, and are all tending to equality because all
                    tending to freedom. As to indefinite perfectibility, he nowhere denies that
                    progress is conditioned both by the constitution of humanity and the character
                    of its surroundings. But he affirms that these conditions are compatible with
                    endless progress, and that the human mind can assign no fixed limits to its own
                    advancement in knowledge and virtue, or even to the prolongation of bodily
                    life.</p>
                <p>The book of Condorcet is pervaded by a spirit of excessive hopefulness, and
                    contains numerous errors of detail, which are fully accounted for by the
                    circumstances in which it was written. Its value lies entirely in its general
                    ideas. Its chief defects spring from its author’s narrow and fanatical aversion
                    to all philosophy which did not attempt to explain the world exclusively on
                    mechanical and sensational principles, to all religion whatever, and especially
                    to Christianity and Christian institutions, and to monarchy.</p>
