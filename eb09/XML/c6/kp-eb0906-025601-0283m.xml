                    conduct, <hi rend="italic">condurre,</hi> to lead; Latin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >conducere)</hi> were leaders of military companies, often numerous enough to
                    constitute a large army, which they used to hire out to carry on the wars of the
                    Italian states. The condottieri played a very important part in Italian history
                    during the 14th and 15th centuries, especially from the middle of the 14th to
                    the middle of the 15th. The explanation of their origin is to be sought in the
                    special circumstances of Italy towards the close of the Middle Ages. The
                    republics and lordships into which the country was divided were incessantly
                    engaged in war, while the arts of peace and luxury were cultivated to such a
                    degree that the military spirit of the people had greatly declined in comparison
                    with the rest of Europe. In many cities, such as Milan, tyrants had begun to
                    supersede the old republican governments, and they found it much safer to engage
                    a mercenary army to fight their battles than to arm their own subjects. Soldiers
                    of foreign armies, which then as afterwards not seldom overran the Italian soil,
                    did not always return, but often stayed with their feudal leaders, and lived at
                    free quarters. Montreal d’Albarno, a gentleman of the Provence, was the first to
                    give a definite form to these lawless bands. A severe discipline and an
                    elaborate organization were introduced within the company itself, while in their
                    relations to the people the most barbaric licence was permitted. Montreal
                    himself was put to death at Rome by Cola di Rienza, and Count Lando succeeded to
                    the command. The Grand Company, as it was called, soon numbered about 7000
                    cavalry and 1500 select infantry, and was for some years the terror of Italy.
                    They seem to have been Germans chiefly. On the conclusion (1360) of the peace of
                    Bretigny between England and France, Sir John Hawkwood, an able general, led an
                    army of English mercenaries, called the White Company, into Italy, which, in the
                    service of Pisa, and afterwards of Florence, took a prominent part in the
                    confused interminable wars of the next thirty years. Towards the end of the
                    century the Italians began to organize armies of the same description, the first
                    of importance being the company of St George, originated by Alberigo, count of
                    Barbiano. The defeat of the German emperor, Rupert, by the great condottiere,
                    Jacopo del Verme, due to the superior equipment and organization of the Italian
                    army, taught the northern barbarians to respect the skill of the south. Shortly
                    after, the organization of these mercenary armies was carried to the highest
                    perfection by Sforza Attendolo, condottiere in the service of Naples, who had
                    been a peasant of the Romagna, and by his rival Braccio di Montone in the
                    service of Florence. The army and the renown of Sfor/a were inherited by his son
                    Francesco Sforza, who married a natural daughter of one of the Visconti of
                    Milan, conducted the wars of that city against Venice, and eventually became
                    duke of Milan (1450), which his family continued to rule for some generations.
                    Less fortunate was another great condottiere, Carmagnola, who first served one
                    of the Visconti, and then conducted the wars of Venice against, his former
                    masters, but at last awoke the suspicion of the Venetian oligarchy, and was put
                    to death before the palace of St Mark (1432). Towards the end of the 15th
                    century, when the large cities had gradually swallowed up the small states, and
                    Italy itself was drawn into the general current of European politics, and became
                    the battle-field of powerful armies,—French, Spanish, and German,—the
                    condottieri disappeared. The soldiers of the condottieri were almost entirely
                    cavalry, and were clad in armour from head to foot. Not being connected with the
                    people among whom they fought by any of the ordinary ties of humanity, and given
                    up to all the licence of the worst profession in the world, they were a dreadful
                    scourge wherever they went.</p>
                <p>They were always ready to change sides at the prospect of higher pay. And as they
                    were connected with each other by the interest of a common profession, and the
                    possibility that the enemy of to-day might be the friend and fellowsoldier of
                    to-morrow, their battles were often as bloodless as they were theatrical.
                    Splendidly equipped armies of several thousand strong were known to fight for
                    several hours with hardly the loss of a man. (See Symonds’s <hi rend="italic"
