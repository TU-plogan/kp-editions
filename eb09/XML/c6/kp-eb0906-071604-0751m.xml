                <p>THIS subject is treated here from an historical point of view, for the purpose of
                    showing how the different leading ideas in the theory were successively arrived
                    at and developed.</p>
                <p>A curve is a line, or continuous singly infinite system of points. We consider in
                    the first instance, and chiefly, a plane curve described according to a law.
                    Such a curve may be regarded geometrically as actually described, or
                    kinematically as in course of description by the motion of a point; in the
                    former point of view, it is the locus of all the points which satisfy a given
                    condition; in the latter, it is the locus of a point moving subject to a given
                    condition. Thus the most simple and earliest known curve, the circle, is the
                    locus of all the points at a given distance from a fixed centre, or else the
                    locus of a point moving so as to be always at a given distance from a fixed
                    centre. (The straight line and the point are not for the moment regarded as
                    curves.)</p>
                <p>Next to the circle we have the conic sections, the invention of them attributed
                    to Plato (who lived 430 to 347 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.);</hi> the original
                    definition of them as the sections of a cone was by the Greek geometers who
                    studied them soon replaced by a proper definition <hi rend="italic">in
                    piano</hi> like that for the circle, viz., a conic section (or as we now say a
                    “conic ”) is the locus of a point suffi that its distance from a given point,
                    the focus, is in a given ratio to its (perpendicular) distance from a given
                    line, the directrix; or it is the locus of a point which moves so as always to
                    satisfy the foregoing condition. Similarly any other property might be used as a
                    definition; an ellipse is the locus of a point such that the sum of its
                    distances from two fixed points (the foci) is constant, &amp;c., &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>The Greek geometers invented other curves; in particular, the “conchoid,” which
                    is the locus of a point such that its distance from a given line, measured along
                    the line drawn through it to a fixed point, is constant; and the “cissoid” which
                    is the locus of a point such that its distance from a fixed point is always
                    equal to the intercept (on the line through the fixed point) between a circle
                    passing through the fixed point and the tangent to the circle at the point
                    opposite to the fixed point. Obviously the number of such geometrical or
                    kinematical definitions is infinite. In a machine of any kind, each point
                    describes a curve; a simple but important instance is the “three-bar curve,” or
                    locus of a point in or rigidly connected with a bar pivotted on to two other
                    bars which rotate about fixed centres respectively. Every curve thus arbitrarily
                    defined has its own properties; and there was not any principle of
                    classification.</p>
                <p>The principle of classification first presented itself in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Géométrie</hi> of Descartes (1637). The idea was to represent any curve
                    whatever by means of a relation between the coordinates <hi rend="italic">(x,
                    y)</hi> of a point of the curve, or say to represent the curve by means of its
                    equation.</p>
                <p>Descartes takes two lines <hi rend="italic">xx',</hi><hi rend="italic">yſ,</hi>
                    called axes of coordinates, intersecting at a point O called the origin (the
                    axes are usually at right angles to each other, and for the present they are
                    considered as being so); and he determines the position of a point P by means of
                    its distances OM (or <pb break="no"

                <p>Any relation whatever between <hi rend="italic">(x, y)</hi> determines a curve,

                    use of such determination of a curve by means of its equation. The Greek
                    geometers were perfectly familiar with the property of an ellipse which in the
                    Cartesian notation zç2 <hi rend="italic">∕y2</hi> is —+ ∣ <hi rend="subscript">
                    i</hi> = 1, the equation of the curve; but it was as one of a number of

                    property of the curve.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>
                    There is no exercise more profitable for a student than that of tracing a curve
                    from its equation, or say rather that of so tracing a considerable number of
                    curves. And he should make the equations for himself. The equation should be in
                    the first Instance a purelj’ numerical one, where <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is
                    given or can be found as an explicit function of <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> here,
                    by giving different numerical values to <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> the
                    corresponding values of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> may be found; and a <hi
                    rend="italic">suffirent</hi> number of points being thus determined, the curve
                    is traced by drawing a continuous line through these points. The next step
                    should be to consider an equation involving literal coefficients; thus, after
                    such curves as y=x, <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">=x(x-</hi> ∖ <hi
                    rend="italic">){x-</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript">
                    ζ</hi><hi rend="italic">L), y=(x-T)L</hi><hi rend="italic">x —</hi> 2, c., he
                    should proceed to trace such curves as <hi rend="italic">y=(x-a)(x-b)(x-c),
                    y-(x-a)</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">lx-b,</hi> c., and endeavour to ascertain for
                    what different relations of equality or inequality between the coefficients the
                    curve will assume essentially or notably distinct forms. The purely numerical
                    equations will present instances of nodes, cusps, inflexions, double tangents,
                    asymptotes, c.,—specialities which he should be familiar with before he has to
                    consider their general theory. And he may then consider an equation such that
                    neither coordinate can be expressed as an explicit function of the other of them
                    (practically, an equation such as <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">+
                    y</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi><hi rend="italic">3xy = 0,</hi> which requires the
                    solution of a cubic equation, belongs to this class); the problem of tracing the
                    curve here frequently requires special methods, and it may easily be such as to
                    require and serve as an exercise for the powers of an advanced
                    algebraist.</p></note></p>
                <p>We obtain from the equation the notion of an algebraical or geometrical as
                    opposed to a transcendental curve, viz., an algebraical or geometrical curve is
                    a curve having an equation F(z, y) = 0, where F(z, <hi rend="italic">y)</hi> is
                    a rational and integral function of the coordinates <hi rend="italic">(x,
                    y)</hi>; and in what follows we attend throughout (unless the contrary is
                    stated) only to such curves. The equation is sometimes given, and may
                    conveniently be used, in an irrational form, but we always imagine it reduced to
                    the foregoing rational anl integral form, and regard this as the equation of the
                    curve. And we have hence the notion of a curve of a <hi rend="italic">given,
                    order,</hi> viz., the order of the curve is equal to that of the term or terms
                    of highest order in the coordinates <hi rend="italic">(x, y)</hi> conjointly in
                    the equation of the curve; for instance, <hi rend="italic">xy</hi>- 1 = 0 is a
                    curve of the second order.</p>
                <p>It is to be noticed here that the axes of coordinates may be any two lines at
                    right angles to each other whatever; and that the equation of a curve will be
                    different according to the selection of the axes of coordinates; but the order
                    is independent of the axes, and has a determinate value for any given curve.</p>
                <p>We hence divide curves according to their order, viz., a curve is of the first
                    order, second order, third order, &amp;c., according as it is represented by an
                    equation of the first order, <hi rend="italic">ax</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>A curve of the first order is a right line; and conversely every right line is a
                    curve of the first order.</p>
                <p>A curve of the second order is a conic, or as it is also called a quadric; and
                    conversely every conic, or quadric, is a curve of the second order.</p>
                <p>A curve of the third order is called a cubic; one of the fourth order a quartic;
                    and so on.</p>
                <p>A curve of the order <hi rend="italic">m</hi> has for its equation (*$r, <hi
                    rend="italic">y,</hi> 1) = 0; and when the coefficients of the function are
                    arbitrary, the curve is said to be the general curve of the order <hi
                    rend="italic">m.</hi> The number of coefficients is ⅜(w⅛+l)(m +2); but there is
                    no loss of generality if the equation be divided by one coefficient so as to
                    reduce the coefficient of the corresponding term to unity, hence the number of
                    coefficients may be reckoned as ∣(w + l)(w + 2) - 1, that is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >jm(m</hi> + 3); and a curve of the order <hi rend="italic">m</hi> may be made
                    to satisfy this number of conditions; for example, to pass through <hi
                    rend="italic">⅛m(m</hi> + 3) points.</p>
                <p>It is to be remarked that an equation may <hi rend="italic">break up;</hi> thus a
                    quadric equation may be <hi rend="italic">(ax</hi><hi rend="italic">+ by +
                    c)(a'x + b'y</hi> + c') = 0, breaking up into the two equations αz + δy + c = 0,
                    <hi rend="italic">a'x</hi><hi rend="italic">+</hi><hi rend="italic">b'y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">+</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> = 0, viz., the original equation is
                    satisfied if either of these is satisfied. Each of these last equations
                    represents a curve of the first order, or right line; and the original equation
                    represents this pair of lines, viz., the pair of lines is considered as a
                    quadric curve. But it is an <hi rend="italic">improper</hi> quadric curve; and
                    in speaking of curves of the second or any other given order, we frequently
                    imply that the curve is a proper curve represented by an equation which does not
                    break up.</p>
                <p>The intersections of two curves are obtained by combining their equations; viz.,
                    the elimination from the two equations of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> (or <hi
                    rend="italic">x)</hi> gives for <hi rend="italic">x</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >y)</hi> an equation of a certain order, say the resultant equation; and then to
                    each value of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">y)</hi> satisfying
                    this equation there corresponds in general a single value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">x),</hi> and consequently a single point of
                    intersection; the number of intersections is thus equal to the order of the
                    resultant equation in <hi rend="italic">x</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >y).</hi></p>
                <p>Supposing that the two curves are of the orders <hi rend="italic">m, n,</hi>
                    respectively, then the order of the resultant equation is in general and at most
                    = <hi rend="italic">mn</hi>; in particular, if the curve of the order <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> is an arbitrary line <hi rend="italic">(n=</hi> 1), then
                    the order of the resultant equation is = <hi rend="italic">m,;</hi> and the
                    curve of the order <hi rend="italic">m</hi> meets therefore the line in <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> points. But the resultant equation may have all or any of
                    its roots imaginary, and it is thus not always that there are <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> real intersections.</p>
                <p>The notion of imaginary intersections, thus presenting itself, through algebra,
                    in geometry, must be accepted in geometry—and it in fact plays an all-important
                    part in modern geometry. As in algebra we say that an equation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">m-</hi> th order has wι roots, viz., we state this generally
                    without in the first instance, or it may be without ever, distinguishing whether
                    these are real or imaginary; so in geometry we say that a curve of the wι-th
                    order is met by an arbitrary line in <hi rend="italic">m</hi> points, or rather
                    we thus, through algebra, obtain the proper geometrical definition of a curve of
                    the rø-th order, as a curve which is met by an arbitrary line in <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> points (that is, of course, in <hi rend="italic">m,</hi>
                    and not more than <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> points).</p>
                <p>The theorem of the <hi rend="italic">m</hi> intersections has been stated in
                    regard to an <hi rend="italic">arbitrary</hi> line; in fact, for particular
                    lines the resultant equation may be or appear to be of an order less than <hi
                    rend="italic">m;</hi> for instance, taking m = 2, if the hyperbola <hi
                    rend="italic">xy</hi>- 1 = 0 be cut by the line <hi rend="italic">y = β,</hi>
                    the resultant equation in <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is <hi rend="italic">βx</hi>-
                    1 = 0, and there is apparently only the intersection <hi rend="italic">(x</hi> =
                    1, <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">= β)∙,</hi> but the theorem is, in
                    fact, true for every line whatever: a curve of the order <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> meets every line whatever in precisely <hi rend="italic">m</hi> points.
                    We have, in the case just referred to, to take account of a point at infinity on
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n753/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0753-0718"/> line <hi rend="italic">y = β',</hi> the two
                    intersections are the point <hi rend="italic">(x=~,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >P</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">= β),</hi> and the point at
                    infinity on the line <hi rend="italic">y = β.</hi></p>
                <p>It is moreover to be noticed that the points at infinity may be all or any of
                    them imaginary, and that the points of intersection, whether finite or at
                    infinity, real or imaginary, may coincide two or more of them together, and have
                    to be counted accordingly; to support the theorem in its universality, it is
                    necessary to take account of these various circumstances.</p>
                <p>The foregoing notion of a point at infinity is a very important one in modern
                    geometry; and we have also to consider the paradoxical statement that in plane
                    geometry, or say as regards the plane, infinity is a right line. This admits of
                    an easy illustration in solid geometry. If with a given centre of projection, by
                    drawing from it lines to every point of a given line, we project the given line
                    on a given plane, the projection is a line, <hi rend="italic">iae.,</hi> this
                    projection is the intersection of the given plane with the plane through the
                    centre and the given line. Say the projection is <hi rend="italic">always</hi> a
                    line, then if the figure is such that the two planes are parallel, the
                    projection is the intersection of the given plane by a parallel plane, or it is
                    the system of points at infinity on the given plane, that is, these points at
                    infinity are regarded as situate on a given line, the line infinity of the given
                    plane. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ∙</p>
                <p>Reverting to the purely plane theory, infinity is a line, related like any other
                    right line to the curve, and thus intersecting it in <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    points, real or imaginary, distinct or coincident.</p>
                <p>Descartes in the <hi rend="italic">Géométrie</hi> defined and considered the
                    remarkable curves called after him ovals of Descartes, or simply Cartesians,
                    which will be again referred to. The next important work, founded on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Géométrie,</hi> was Sir Isaac Newton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enumeratio linearum tertii ordinis</hi> (1706), establishing a classification
                    of cubic curves founded chiefly on the nature of their infinite branches, which
                    was in some details completed by Stirling, Murdoch, and Cramer; the work
                    contains also the remarkable theorem (to be again referred to), that there are
                    five kinds of cubic curves giving by their projections every cubic curve
                    whatever.</p>
                <p>Various properties of curves in general, and of cubic curves, are established in
                    Maclaurin’s memoir, “De linearum geometricarum proprietatibus generalibus
                    Tractatus” (posthumous, say 1746, published in the 6th edition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Algebra).</hi> We have in it a particular kind of <hi
                    rend="italic">correspondence</hi> of two points on a cubic curve, viz,, two
                    points correspond to each other when the tangents at the two points again meet
                    the cubic in the same point.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Géométrie</hi><hi rend="italic">Descriptive</hi> by Monge
                    was written in the year 1794 or 1795 (7th edition, Paris, 1847), and in it we
                    have stated, <hi rend="italic">in piano</hi> with regard to the circle, and in
                    three dimensions with regard to a surface of the second order, the fundamental
                    theorem of reciprocal polars, viz., “Given a surface of the second order and a
                    circumscribed conic surface which touches it . . . . then if the conic surface
                    moves so that its summit is always in the same plane, the plane of the curve of
                    contact passes always through the same point.” The theorem is here referred to
                    partly on account of its bearing on the theory of imaginaries in geometry. It is
                    in Brianchon’s memoir “Sur les surfaces du second degré” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Jour.</hi><hi rend="italic">Polyt.,</hi> t. vi. 1806) shown how for any given
                    position of the summit the plane of contact is determined, or reciprocally; say
                    the plane XY is determined when the point P is given, or reciprocally; and it is
                    noticed that when P is situate in the interior of the surface the plane XY does
                    not cut the surface: that is, we have a real plane XY Intersecting the surface
                    in the imaginary curve of contact of the imaginary circumscribed cone having for
                    its summit a given real point P inside the surface.</p>
                <p>Stating the theorem in regard to a conic, we have a real point P (called the
                    pole) and a real line XY (called the polar), the line joining the two (real or
                    imaginary) points of contact of the (real or imaginary) tangents drawn from the
                    point to the conic; and the theorem is that when the point describes a line the
                    line passes through a point, this line and point being polar and pole to each
                    other. The term “pole” was first used by Servois, and “polar” by Gergonne <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gerg.,</hi> t. i. and iii., 1810-13); and from the theorem we
                    have the method of reciprocal polars for the transformation of geometrical
                    theorems, used already by Brianchon (in the memoir above referred to) for the
                    demonstration of the theorem called by his name, and in a similar manner by
                    various writers in the earlier volumes of Gergonne. We are here concerned with
                    the method less in itself than as leading to the general notion of duality. And,
                    bearing in a somewhat similar manner also on the theory of imaginaries in
                    geometry (but the notion presents itself in a more explicit form), there is the
                    memoir by Gaultier, on the graphical construction of circles and spheres <hi
                    rend="italic">(Jour.</hi><hi rend="italic">Polyt.,</hi> t. ix., 1813). The
                    well-known theorem as to radical axes may be stated as follows. Consider two
                    circles partially drawn so that it does not appear whether the circles, if
                    completed, would or would not intersect in real points, say two arcs of circles;
                    then we can, by means of a third circle drawn so as to intersect in two real
                    points each of the two arcs, determine a right line, which, if the complete
                    circles intersect in two real points, passes through the points, and which is on
                    this account regarded as a line passing through two (real or imaginary) points
                    of intersection of the two circles. The construction in fact is, join the two
                    points in which the third circle meets the first arc, and join also the two
                    points in which the third circle meets the second arc, and from the point of
                    intersection of the two joining lines, let fall a perpendicular on the line
                    joining the centre of the two circles; this perpendicular (considered as an
                    indefinite line) is what Gaultier terms the “radical axis of the two circles;”
                    it is a line determined by a real construction and itself always real; and by
                    what precedes it is the line joining two (real or imaginary, as the case may be)
                    intersections of the given circles.</p>
                <p>The intersections which lie on the radical axis are two out of the four
                    intersections of the two circles. The question as to the remaining two
                    intersections did not present itself to Gaultier, but it is answered in
                    Poncelet’s <hi rend="italic">Traité des propriétés projectives</hi> (1822),
                    where we find (p. 49) the statement, “deux circles placés arbitrairement sur un
                    plan . . . ont idéalement deux points imaginaires communs à l’infini;” that is,
                    a circle <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> curve of the second order is met by the line
                    infinity in two points; but, more than this, they are the same two points for
                    any circle whatever. The points in question have since been called (it is
                    believed first by Dr Salmon) the circular points at infinity, or they may be
                    called the circular points; these are also frequently spoken of as the points I,
                    J; and we have thus the circle characterized as a conic which passes through the
                    two circular points at infinity; the number of conditions thus imposed upon the
                    conic is = 2, and there remain three arbitrary constants, which is the right
                    number for the circle. Poncelet throughout his work makes continual use of the
                    foregoing theories of imaginaries and infinity, and also of the before-mentioned
                    theory of reciprocal polars.</p>
                <p>Poncelet’s two memoirs “Sur les centres des moyennes harmoniques,” and “Sur la
                    théorie générale des polaires réciproques,” although presented to the Paris
                    Academy in 1824 were only published <hi rend="italic">(Grelle,</hi> t. iii. and
                    iv., 1828, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> More generally, in solid geometry
                    infinity is a plane,—its intersection with any given plane being the right line
                    which is the infinity oí this given plane.</p>

                <p>1829), subsequent to the memoir by Gergonne, “Considerations philosophiques sur
                    les élémens de la science de l’étendue” <hi rend="italic">(G</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">er</hi><hi rend="italic">g.,</hi> t. xvi., 1825-26). In this
                    memoir by Gergonne, the theory of duality is very clearly and explicitly stated;
                    for instance, we find “dans la géométrie plane, à chaque théorème il en répond
                    nécessairement un autre qui s’en déduit en échangeant simplement entre eux les
                    deux mots <hi rend="italic">points</hi> et <hi rend="italic">droites</hi>;
                    tandis que dans la géométrie de l’espace ce sont les mots <hi rend="italic"
                    >points</hi> et <hi rend="italic">plans</hi> qu’il faut échanger entre eux pour
                    passer d’un théorème à son corrélatif;” and the plan is introduced of printing
                    correlative theorems, opposite to each other, in two columns. There was a
                    reclamation as to priority by Poncelet in the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Universel</hi> reprinted with remarks by Gergonne <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gerg.,</hi> t. xix., 1827), and followed by a short paper by
                    Gergonne, “Rectifications de quelques théorèmes, &amp;c.,” which is important as
                    first introducing the word <hi rend="italic">class.</hi> We find in it
                    explicitly the two correlative definitions :—-“a plane curve is said to be of
                    the with degree (order) when it has with a line <hi rend="italic">m</hi> real or
                    ideal intersections,” and “a plane curve is said to be of the »nth class when
                    from any point of its’ plane there can be drawn to it <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    real or ideal tangents.”</p>
                <p>It may be remarked that in Poncelet’s memoir on reciprocal polars, above referred
                    to, we have the theorem that the number of tangents from a point to a curve of
                    the order <hi rend="italic">m,</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">or</hi> say the class of the curve, is in general and at most <hi
                    rend="italic">= m(m</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi> l),and that he mentions that
                    this number is subject to reduction when the curve has double points or
                    cusps.</p>
                <p>The theorem of duality as regards plane figures may be thus stated :—two figures
                    may correspond to each other in such manner that to each point and line in
                    either figure there corresponds in the other figure a line and point
                    respectively. It is to be understood that the theorem extends to all points or
                    lines, drawn or not drawn; thus if in the first figure there are any number of
                    points on a line drawn or not drawn, the corresponding lines in the second
                    figure, produced if necessary, must meet in a point. And we thus see how the
                    theorem extends to curves, their points and tangents: if there is in the first
                    figure a curve of the order <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> any line meets it in <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> points; and hence from the corresponding point in the
                    second figure there must be to the corresponding curve <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    tangents; that is, the corresponding curve must be of the class <hi
                    rend="italic">m.</hi></p>
                <p>Trilinear coordinates (to be again referred to) were first used by Bobillier in
                    the memoir, “Essai sur un nouveau mode de recherche des propriétés de l’étendue”
                    <hi rend="italic">(G</hi><hi rend="italic">erg.,</hi> t. xviii., 1827-28). It is
                    convenient to use these rather than Cartesian coordinates. We represent a curve
                    of the order <hi rend="italic">m</hi> by an equation (*§r, <hi rend="italic"
                    >y,</hi> z) <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> = 0, the function on the left hand
                    being a homogeneous rational and integral function of the order <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> of the three coordinates <hi rend="italic">(x, y, z);</hi>
                    clearly the number of constants is the same as for the equation (*§r, <hi
                    rend="italic">y,</hi> 1 )„ = 0 in Cartesian coordinates.</p>
                <p>The theory of duality is considered and developed, but chiefly in regard to its
                    metrical applications, by Chasles in the “Mémoire de géométrie sur deux
                    principes généraux de la science, la dualité, et l’homographie,” which forms a
                    sequel to the “Aperçu Historique sur l’origine et le développement des méthodes
                    en Géométrie” <hi rend="italic">(Mem. de Brux.,</hi> t. xi., 1837).</p>
                <p>We now come to Plücker; his “six equations” were given in a short memoir in <hi
                    rend="italic">Grelle</hi> (1842) preceding his great work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theorie der Algebraischen</hi><hi rend="italic">Curven</hi> (1844).</p>
                <p>Plücker first gave a scientific dual definition of a curve, viz., “A curve is a
                    locus generated by a point, and enveloped by a line,—the point moving
                    continuously along the line, while the line rotates continuously about the
                    point;” the point is a point (ineunt) of the curve, the line is a tangent of the
                    curve.</p>
                <p>And,assuming theabove theory of geometrical imaginari es, a curve such that <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> of its points are situate in an arbitrary line is said to
                    be of the order <hi rend="italic">m;</hi> a curve such that <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> of its tangents pass through an arbitrary point is said to be of the
                    class <hi rend="italic">n</hi>; as already appearing, this notion of the order
                    and class of a curve is, however, due to Gergonne. Thus the line is a curve of
                    the order 1 and class 0; and corresponding dually thereto, we have the point as
                    a curve of the order 0 and class 1.</p>
                <p>Plücker moreover imagined a system of line-coordinates (tangential coordinates).
                    The Cartesian coordinates <hi rend="italic">(x, y)</hi> and trilinear
                    coordinates <hi rend="italic">(x, y, z)</hi> are point-coordinates for
                    determining the position of a point; the new coordinates, say <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ſi,</hi><hi rend="italic">η, ζ)</hi> are line-coordinates for determining the
                    position of a line. It is possible, and (not so much for any application thereof
                    as in order to more fully establish the analogy between the two kinds of
                    coordinates) important, to give independent quantitative definitions of the two
                    kinds of coordinates; but we may also derive the notion of line-coordinates from
                    that of point-coordinates; viz., taking <hi rend="italic">ξx + ηy + ζz</hi> = 0
                    to be the equation of a line, we say that <hi rend="italic">(ξ, η, ζ)</hi> are
                    the line-coordinates of this line. A linear relation <hi rend="italic">aξ + bη +
                    cζ = O</hi> between these coordinates determines a point, viz., the point whose
                    point-coordinates are <hi rend="italic">(a, b,</hi> c); in fact, the equation in
                    question <hi rend="italic">aξ+bη + cζ=0</hi> expresses that the equation <hi
                    rend="italic">ξx + ηy + ζz=</hi> 0, where <hi rend="italic">(x, y, z)</hi> are
                    current point-coordinates, is satisfied on writing therein <hi rend="italic">x,
                    y, z</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c;</hi> or that the line in question passes through
                    the point <hi rend="italic">(a, b,</hi> c). Thus (£, <hi rend="italic">η,
                    ζ)</hi> are the line-coordinates of any line whatever; but when these, instead
                    of being absolutely arbitrary, are subject to the restriction <hi rend="italic"
                    >aξ + bη + cζ=0,</hi> this obliges the line to pass through a point <hi
                    rend="italic">(a, b, c)</hi>; and the last-mentioned equation <hi rend="italic"
                    >aξ+bη + cζ</hi> = 0 is considered as the line-equation of this point.</p>
                <p>A line has only a point-equation, and a point has only a line-equation; but any
                    other curve has a pointequation and also a line-equation; the point-equation
                    (*§r, <hi rend="italic">y&gt;</hi><hi rend="superscript"> ε</hi>)" = θ is the
                    relation which is satisfied by the point-coordinates <hi rend="italic">(x, y,
                    z)</hi> of each point of the curve; and similarly the line-equation (*$£, <hi
                    rend="italic">η, ζf</hi> = 0 is the relation which is satisfied by the
                    line-coordinates <hi rend="italic">(ſ,</hi><hi rend="italic">η, ζ)</hi> of each
                    line (tangent) of the curve.</p>
                <p>There is in analytical geometry little occasion for any explicit use of
                    line-coordinates; but the theory is very important; it serves to show that in
                    demonstrating by point-coordinates any purely descriptive theorem whatever, we
                    demonstrate the correlative theorem; that is, we do not demonstrate the one
                    theorem, and then (as by the method of reciprocal polars) deduce from it the
                    other, but we do at one and the same time demonstrate the two theorems; our <hi
                    rend="italic">(x, y, z)</hi> instead of meaning point-coordinates may mean
                    line-coordinates, and the demonstration is then in every step of it a
                    demonstration of the correlative theorem.</p>

                <p>2. The node: the point may in the course of its motion come to coincide with a
                    former position of the point, the two positions of the line not in general
                    coinciding.</p>

                    (conjugate or isolated point, or acnode), nor again the real double tangent with
                    two imaginary points of contact; but this is of little consequence, since in the
                    general theory the distinction between real and imaginary is not attended
                    to.</p>
                <p>The singularities (1) and (3) have been termed proper singularities, and (2) and
                    (4) improper; in each of the first-mentioned cases there is a real singularity,
                    or peculiarity in the motion; in the other two cases there is not; in (2) there
                    is not when the point is first at the node, or when it is secondly at the node,
                    any peculiarity in the motion; the singularity consists in the point coming
                    twice into the same position; and so in (4) the singularity is in the line
                    coining twice into the same position. Moreover (1) and (2) are, the former a
                    proper singularity, and the latter an improper singularity, <hi rend="italic">as
                    regards the motion of the point;</hi> and similarly (3) and (4) are, the former
                    a proper singularity, and the latter an improper singularity, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>But as regards the representation of a curve by an equation, the case is very
                    different.</p>
                <p>First, if the equation be in point-coordinates, (3) and (4) are in a sense not

                    y,</hi> 2), but if such values exist, then the point (a, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> c) is a node or double point; and (1) presents itself as a further
                    singularity or sub-case of (2), a cusp being a double point for which the two
                    tangents become coincident.</p>
                <p>In line-coordinates all is reversed :—(1) and (2) are not singularities; (3)

                <p>It is implied in Plücker’s theorem that, <hi rend="italic">m, n,</hi><hi

                <p>The expression ⅜ <hi rend="italic">m(m + 3)-δ-2κ</hi> is that of the number of
                    the disposable constants in a curve of the order <hi rend="italic">m</hi> with δ

                    of envelopes, as will appear further on.</p>
                <p>With regard to the demonstration of Plücker’s equations it is to be remarked that
                    we are not able to write down the equation in point-coordinates of a curve of
                    the order <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> having the given numbers δ and <hi
                    rend="italic">κ</hi> cf nodes and cusps. We can only use the general equation
                    (*$r, <hi rend="italic">y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z)" = 0,</hi> say for shortness
                    π = 0, of a curve of the <hi rend="italic">mth</hi> order, which equation, so
                    long as the coefficients remain arbitrary, represents a curve without nodes or
                    cusps. Seeking then, for this curve, the values <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> ι, τ
                    of the class, number of inflexions, and number of double tangents,—first, as
                    regards the class, this is equal to the number of tangents which can be drawn to
                    the curve from an arbitrary point, or what is the same thing it is equal to the
                    number of the points of contact of these tangents. The points of contact are
                    found as the intersections of the curve <hi rend="italic">u</hi> = 0 by a curve
                    depending on the position of the arbitrary point, and called the “first polar”
                    of this point; the order of the first polar is = ?n-l, and the number of
                    intersectionsis thus <hi rend="italic">=m(m-l).</hi> But it can be :’lown,
                    analytically or geometrically, that if the given curve has a node, the first
                    polar passes through this node, which therefore counts as two intersections, and
                    that if the curve has a cusp, the first polar passes through the cusp, touching
                    the curve there, and hence the cusp counts as three intersections. But, as is
                    evident, the node or cusp is not a point of contact of a proper tangent from the
                    arbitrary point; we have, therefore, for a node a diminution 2, and for a cusp a
                    diminution 3, in the number of the intersections; and thus, for a curve with δ
                    nodes and <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> cusps, there is a diminution 2δ + 3κ, and the
                    value of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic">=
                    m(m</hi>- 1) - 2δ - 3κ.</p>
                <p>Secondly, as to the inflexions, the process is a similar one; it can be shown
                    that the inflexions are the intersections of the curve by a derivative curve
                    called (after Hesse who first considered it) the Hessian, defined geometrically
                    as the locus of a point such that its conic polar in regard to the curve breaks
                    up into a pair of lines, and which has an equation H = 0, where H is the
                    determinant formed with the second differential coefficients of <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> in regard to the variables <hi rend="italic">(x, y,
                    z)</hi><hi rend="italic">∙</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> H = 0 is thus
                    a curve of the order 3(m - 2), and the number of inflexions is = <hi
                    rend="italic">3m(m</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 2). But if the given curve has a
                    node, then not only the Hessian passes through the node, but it has there a node
                    the two branches at which touch respectively the two branches of the curve; and
                    the node thus counts as six intersections; so if the curve has a cusp, then the
                    Hessian not only passes through the cusp, but it has there a cusp through which
                    it again passes, that is, there is a cuspidal branch touching the cuspidal
                    branch of the curve, and besides a simple branch passing through the cusp, and
                    hence the cusp counts as eight intersections. The node or cusp is not an
                    inflexion, and we have thus for a node a diminution 6, and for a cusp a
                    diminution 8, in the number of the intersections; hence for a curve with δ nodes
                    and <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> cusps, the diminution is = 6δ + 8κ, and the number
                    of inflexions is <hi rend="italic">ι = 3m(m</hi>- 2) - 6δ - 8κ.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, for the double tangents; the points of contact of these are obtained as
                    the intersections of the curve by a curve ∏ = 0, which has not as yet been
                    geometrically defined, but which is found analytically to be of the order <hi
                    rend="italic">(m -</hi><hi rend="italic">2)(m</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi> 9); the number of intersections is
                    thus <hi rend="italic">= m(m</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi> 2)(τn <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- 9); but if the given curve has a node then there is
                    a diminution = 4(wι <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- <hi rend="italic">m</hi>-
                    6), and if it has a cusp then there is a diminution = 6(τn <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- <hi rend="italic">m</hi>- 6), where, however<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n756/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0756-0721"/>, it is to be noticed that the factor <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(mz</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">-</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi>- 6) is in the case of a curve
                    having only a node or only a cusp the number of the tangents which can be drawn
                    from the node or cusp to the curve, and is used as denoting the number of these
                    tangents, and ceases to be the correct expression if the number of nodes and
                    cusps is greater than unity. Hence, in the case of a curve which has δ nodes and
                    <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> cusps, the apparent diminution <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >2(m⅛</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> 2</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi>- 6)(2δ + 3κ) is too great, and it has in fact to be
                    diminished by 2{2δ(δl) + 6δκ + ∣κ(κ-l)},orthehalf thereof is 4 for each pair of
                    nodes, 6 for each combination of a node and cusp, and 9 for each pair of cusps.
                    We have thus finally an expression for 2τ, = <hi rend="italic">m(m</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">2)(m⅛</hi><hi rend="superscript
                    smallcaps"> 2</hi>- 9) - &amp;c.; or dividing the whole by 2, we have the
                    expression for τ given by the third of Plücker’s equations.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that we cannot by consideration of the equation <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi> = 0 in point-coordinates obtain the remaining three of Plücker’s
                    equations; they might be obtained in a precisely analogous manner by means òf
                    the equation <hi rend="italic">v</hi> = 0 in line-coordinates, but they follow
                    at once from the, principle of duality, viz., they are obtained by the mere
                    interchange of <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> δ, <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> with <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi><hi rend="italic">τ, ι</hi> respectively.</p>
                <p>To complete Plücker’s theory it is necessary to take account of compound
                    singularities; it might be possible, but it is at any rate, difficult to effect
                    this by considering the curve as in course of description by the point moving
                    along the rotating line; and it seems easier to consider the compound
                    singularity as arising from the variation of an actually described curve with
                    ordinary singularities. The most simple case is when three double points come
                    into coincidence; thereby giving rise to a triple point; and a somewhat more
                    complicated one is when we have a cusp of the second kind, or node-cusp arising
                    from the coincidence of a node, a cusp, an inflexion, and a double tangent, as
                    shown in the annexed figure, which represents the singularities as on the point
                    of coalescing. The general conclusion (see Cayley, <hi rend="italic">Quart.
                    Math. Jour.,</hi> t. vii., 1866, “On the higher singularities of plane curves ”)
                    is that every singularity whatever may be considered as compounded of ordinary
                    singularities, say we have a singularity = δ' nodes, κ' cusps, τ' double
                    tangents, and ι' inflexions. So that, in fact, Plücker’s equations properly
                    understood apply to a curve with any singularities whatever.</p>
                <p>By means of Plücker’s equations we may form a table—</p>

                <p>The table is arranged according to the value of <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and we have <hi rend="smallcaps">mz = 0,</hi><hi

                    —</hi> 3, the cubic, there are three cases, the class being 6, 4, or 3,
                    according as the curve is without singularities, or as it has 1 node, or 1 cusp;
                    and so of <hi rend="smallcaps">mi</hi> = 4, the quartic, there are nine cases,
                    where observe that in <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of them the class is =6,—the
                    reduction of class arising from two cusps or else from three nodes. The nine
                    cases may be also grouped together into four, according as the number of nodes
                    and cusps (δ + κ) is = 0,1, 2, or 3.</p>
                <p>The cases may be divided into sub-cases, by the consideration of compound
                    singularities; thus when <hi rend="italic">m</hi> = 4, <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    = 6, =3, the three nodes may be all distinct, which is the general case, or two
                    of them may unite together into the singularity called a tacnode, or all three
                    may unite together into a triple point, or else into an oscnode.</p>
                <p>We may further consider the inflexions and double tangents, as well in general as
                    in regard to cubic and quartic curves.</p>
                <p>The expression for the number of inflexions <hi rend="smallcaps">3mz(mz</hi>- 2)
                    for a curve of the order <hi rend="italic">m</hi> was obtained analytically by
                    Plücker, but the theory was first given in a complete form by Hesse inthe two
                    papers “Ueber die Elimination, u.s. w.,” and “Ueber die Wendepuncte der Curven
                    dritter Ordnung” <hi rend="italic">(Grelle,</hi> t. xxviii., 1844); in the
                    latter of these the points of inflexion are obtained as the intersections of the
                    curve w = 0 with the. Hessian, or curve Δ = 0, where Δ is the determinant formed
                    with the second derived functions of <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> We have in the
                    Hessian the first instance of a covariant of a ternary form. The whole theory of
                    the inflexions of a cubic curve is discussed in a very interesting manner by
                    means of the canonical form of the equation <hi rend="italic">cd</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">+ y</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi> + z <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> + <hi rend="italic">fslxyz =</hi> 0; and in
                    particular a proof is given of Plücker’s theorem that the nine points of
                    inflexion of a cubic curve lie by threes in twelve lines.</p>
                <p>It may be noticed that the nine inflexions of a cubic curve are three real, six
                    imaginary; the three real inflexions lie in a line, as was known to Newton and
                    Maclaurin. For an acnodal cubic the six imaginary inflexions disappear, and
                    there remain three real inflexions lying in a line. For a crunodal cubic, the
                    six inflexions which disappear are two of them real, the other four imaginary,
                    and there remain two imaginary inflexions and one real inflexion. For a cuspidal
                    cubic the six imaginary inflexions and two of the real inflexions disappear, and
                    there remains one real inflexion.</p>
                <p>A quartic curve has 24 inflexions; it was conjectured by Salmon, and has been
                    verified recently by Zeuthen, that at most 8 of these are real.</p>
                <p>The expression <hi rend="italic">⅛m(m</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">2)(mz</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> 2</hi>- 9) for the
                    number of double tangents of a curve of the order <hi rend="italic">m</hi> was
                    obtained by Plücker only as a consequence of his first, second, fourth, and
                    fifth equations. An investigation by means of the curve Π = 0, which by its
                    intersections with the given curve determines the points of contact of the
                    double tangents, is indicated by Cayley, “Recherches sur l’élimina tion et la
                    théorie des courbes” <hi rend="italic">(Grelle,</hi> t. xxxiv., 1847), and in
                    part carried out by Hesse in the memoir “Ueber Curven dritter Ordnung” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Grelle,</hi> t. xxxvi., 1848). A better process was indicated by
                    Salmon in the “Note on the double tangents to plane curves,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phil. Mag.,</hi> 1858; considering the <hi rend="italic">m</hi>- 2 points in
                    which any tangent to the curve again meets the curve, he showed how to form the
                    equation of a curve of the order <hi rend="italic">(m —</hi> 2), giving by its
                    intersection with the tangent the points in question; making the tangent touch
                    this curve of the order <hi rend="italic">(m —</hi> 2), it will be a double
                    tangent of the original curve. See Cayley, “On the Double Tangents of a Plane
                    Curve” <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> t. cxlviii., 1858), and Dersch <hi

                    properties of the curve ∏ = 0, to distinguish one such curve from the several
                    other curves which pass through the points of contact of the double
                    tangents.</p>
                <p>A quartic curve has 28 double tangents, their points, of contact determined as
                    the intersections of the curve by a curve Π = 0 of the order 14, the equation of
                    which in a very elegant form was first obtained by Hesse (1849). Investigations
                    in regard to them are given by Plücker in the <hi rend="italic">Theorie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">der Algebraischen</hi><hi rend="italic">Curven,</hi> and in two
                    memoirs by Hesse and Steiner <hi rend="italic">(ſſrelle,</hi> t. xlv., 1855), in
                    respect to the triads of double tangents which have their points of contact on a
                    conic, and other like relations. It was assumed by Plücker that the number of
                    real double tangents might be 28, 16, 8, 4, or 0, but Zeuthen has recently found
                    that the last case does not exist.</p>
                <p>The Hessian Δ has just been spoken of as a covariant of the form <hi
                    rend="italic">u;</hi> the notion of invariants and covariants belongs rather to
                    the foιm <hi rend="italic">u</hi> than to the curve w = 0 represented by means
                    of this form; and the theory may be very briefly referred to. A curve <hi
                    rend="italic">u = 0</hi> may have some invariant] ve property, viz., a property
                    independent of the particular axes of coordinates used in the representation of
                    the curve by its equation; for instance, the curve may have á node, and in order
                    to this, a relation, say A = 0, must exist between the coefficients of the
                    equation; supposing the axes of coordinates altered, so that the equation
                    becomes <hi rend="italic">u</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi> 0, and writing A' — 0
                    for the relation between the new co-efficients, then the relations A = 0, A' =
                    0, as two different expressions of the same geometrical property, must each of
                    them imply the other; this can only be the case when A, A' are functions
                    differing only by a constant factor, or say, when A is an invariant of <hi
                    rend="italic">u.</hi> If, however, the geometrical property requires two or more
                    relations between the coefficients, say A = 0, B = 0, &amp;c., then we must have
                    between the new coefficients the like relations, A' = 0, B' = 0, &lt;fcc., and
                    the two systems of equations must each of them imply the other; when this is so,
                    the system of equations, A — 0, B = 0, &amp;c., is said to be invariantive, but
                    it does not follow that A, B, &amp;c., are of necessity invariants of <hi
                    rend="italic">u.</hi> Similarly, if we have a curve U = 0 derived from the curve
                    « ≈ 0 in a manner independent of the particular axes of oo-ordinates, then from
                    the transformed equation <hi rend="italic">u'≈</hi> 0 deriving in like manner
                    the curve U' — 0, the two equations U = 0, U' = 0 must each of them imply the
                    other; and when this is so, U will be a covariant of <hi rend="italic">u.</hi>
                    The case is less frequent, but it may arise, that there are covariant systems U
                    = 0, V = 0 &amp;c., and U ’ = 0, V ’ = 0, &amp;c., each implying the other, but
                    where the functions U, V, &amp;c., are not of necessity covariants of <hi
                    rend="italic">u.</hi></p>
                <p>The theory of the invariants and covariants of a ternary cubic function <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> has been studied in detail, and brought into connection
                    with the cubic curve <hi rend="italic">u</hi> = 0; but the theory of the
                    invariants and covariants for the next succeeding case, the ternary quartic
                    function, is still very incomplete.</p>
                <p>In further illustration of the Plückerian dual generation of a curve, we may
                    consider the question of the <hi rend="italic">envelope</hi> of a variable
                    curve. The notion is very probably older, bat it is at any rate to be found in
                    Lagrange’s <hi rend="italic">Théorie</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fonctions analytiques</hi> (1798); it is there remarked that the
                    equation obtained by the elimination of the parameter <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    from an equation <hi rend="italic">f (x, y,</hi> α) = 0 and the derived equation
                    in respect to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is a curve, the envelope of the series of
                    curves represented by the equation <hi rend="italic">f (x, y, a)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">=</hi> 0 in question. To develop the theory, consider the curve
                    corresponding to any particular value of the parameter; this has with the
                    consecutive curve (or curve belonging to the consecutive value of the parameter)
                    a certain number of intersections, and of common tangents, which may be
                    considered as the tangents at the intersections; and the so-called envelope is
                    the curve which is at the same time generated by the points of intersection and
                    enveloped by the common tangents; we have thus a dual generation. But the
                    question needs to be further examined. Suppose that in general the variable
                    curve is of the order <hi rend="italic">m</hi> with δ nodes and <hi
                    rend="italic">κ</hi> cusps, and therefore of the class <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    with τ double tangents and ι inflexions, <hi rend="italic">m, n,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">8, κ, τ, ι</hi> being connected by the Plückerian equations,—the
                    number of nodes or cusps may be greater for particular values of the parameter,
                    but this is a speciality which may be here disregarded. Considering the variable
                    curve corresponding to a given value of the parameter, or say simply the
                    variable curve, the consecutive curve has then also δ and <hi rend="italic"
                    >κ</hi> nodes and cusps, consecutive to those of the variable curve; and it is
                    easy to see that among the intersections of the two curves we have the nodes
                    each counting twice, and the cusps each counting three times; the number of the
                    remaining intersections is = τn <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- 2δ - 3κ.
                    Similarly among the common tangents of the two curves we have the double
                    tangents each counting twice, and the stationary tangents each counting three
                    times, and the number of the remaining common tangents is = re <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- 2τ - 3ι ( ≡ τn <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- 2δ -
                    3κ, inasmuch as each of these numbers is as was seen =» <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi><hi rend="italic">+</hi><hi rend="italic">n).</hi> At any one of the τn
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- 2δ - 3κ points the variable curve and the
                    consecutive curve have tangents distinct from yet infinitesimally near to each
                    other, and each of these two tangents is also infinitesimally near to one of the
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi>- 2τ - 3ι common
                    tangents of the two curves; whence, attending only to the variable curve, and
                    considering the consecutive curve as coming into actual coincidence with it, the
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >-2τ-</hi> 3ι common tangents are the tangents to the variable curve at the <hi
                    rend="italic">nι</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >-28-3κ</hi> points respectively, and the envelope is at the same time generated
                    by the <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">-28-3κ</hi> points, and enveloped by the n <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>-2τ-3ι tangents; we have thus a dual generation of the envelope, which
                    only differs from Plücker’s dual generation, in that in placé of a single point
                    and tangent we have the group of <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2</hi>- 2δ - <hi rend="italic">3κ</hi> points and n <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- 2τ - 3ι tangents.</p>
                <p>The parameter which determines the variable curve may be given as a point upon a
                    given curve, or say as a parametric point; that is, to the different positions
                    of the parmetric point on the given curve correspond the different variable
                    curves, and the nature of the envelope will thus depend on that of the given
                    curve; we have thus the envelope as a derivative curve of the given curve. Many
                    well-known derivative curves present themselves in this manner; thus the
                    variable curve may be the normal (or line at right angles to the tangent) at any
                    point of the given curve; the intersection of the consecutive normals is the
                    centre of curvature; and we have the evolute as at once the locus of the centre
                    of curvature and the envelope of the normal. It may be added that the given
                    curve is one of a series of curves, each cutting the several normals at right
                    angles. Any one of these is a “parallel” of the given curve; and it can be
                    obtained as the envelope of a circle of constant radius having its centre on the
                    given curve. We have in like manner, as derivatives of a given curve, the
                    caustic, catacaustic, or diacaustic, as the case may be, and the secondary
                    caustic, or curve cutting at right angles the reflected or refracted rays.</p>
                <p>We have in much that precedes disregarded, or at least been indifferent to,
                    reality; it is only thus that the conception of a curve of the rø-th order, as
                    one which is met by every right line in <hi rend="italic">m</hi> points, is
                    arrived at; and the curve itself, and the line which cuts it, although both are
                    tacitly assumed to be real, may perfectly well be imaginary. For real figures we
                    have the general theorem that imaginary intersections, &amp;c., present
                    themselves in conjugate pairs; hence, in particular, that a curve of an even
                    order is met by a line in an even number (which may be = 0) of points; a curve
                    of an odd order in an odd number of points, hence <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n758/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0758-0723"/> in one point at least; it will be seen further on
                    that the theorem may be generalized in a remarkable manner. Again, when there is
                    in question only one pair of points or lines, these, if coincident, must be
                    real; thus, a line meets a cubic curve in three points, one of them real, the
                    other two real or imaginary; but if two of the intersections coincide they must
                    be real, and we have a line cutting a cubic in one real point and touching it in
                    another real point. It may be remarked that this is a limit separating the two
                    cases where the intersections are all real, and where they are one real, two
                    imaginary.</p>
                <p>Considering always real curves, we obtain the notion of a branch; any portion
                    capable of description by the continuous motion of a point is a branch; and a
                    curve consists of one or more branches. Thus the curve of the first order or
                    right line consists of one branch; but in curves of the second order, or conics,
                    the ellipse and the parabola consist each of one branch, the hyperbola of two
                    branches. A branch is either re-entrant, or it extends both ways to infinity,
                    and in this case, we may regard it as consisting of two legs <hi rend="italic"
                    >(crura,</hi> Newton), each extending onê way to infinity, but without any
                    definite separation. The branch, whether re-entrant or infinite, may have a cusp
                    or cusps, or it may cut itself or another branch, thus having or giving rise to
                    crunodes; an acnode is a branch by itself,—it may be considered as an
                    indefinitely small reentrant branch. A branch may have inflexions and double
                    tangents, or there may be double tangents which touch two distinct branches;
                    there are also double tangents with imaginary points of contact, which are thus
                    lines having no visible connection with the curve. A re-entrant branch not
                    cutting itself may be everywhere convex, and it is then properly said to be an
                    oval; but the term oval may be used more generally for any re-entrant branch not
                    cutting itself; and we may thus speak of a once indented, twice indented oval,
                    fee., or even of a cuspidate oval. Other descriptive names for ovals and
                    re-entrant branches cutting themselves may be used when required; thus, in the
                    last-mentioned case a simple form is that of a figure of eight; such a form may
                    break up into two ovals, or into a doubly indented oval or hour-glass. A form
                    which presents itself is when two ovals, one inside the other, unite, so as to
                    give rise to a crunode—in default of a better name this may be called, after the
                    curve of that name, a limaçon. Names may also be used for the different forms of
                    infinite branches, but we have first to consider the distinction of hyperbolic
                    aud parabolic. The leg of an infinite branch may have at the extremity a
                    tangent; this is an asymptote of the curve, and the leg is then hyperbolic; or
                    the leg may tend to a fixed direction, but so that the tangent goes further and
                    further off to infinity, and the leg is then parabolic; a branch may thus be
                    hyperbolic or parabolic as to its two legs; or it may be hyperbolic as to one
                    leg, and parabolic as to the other. The epithets hyperbolic and parabolic are of
                    course derived from the conic hyperbola and parabola respectively. The nature of
                    the two kinds of branches is best understood by considering them as projections,
                    in the same way as we in effect consider the hyperbola and the parabola as
                    projections of the ellipse. If a line Ω cut an arc <hi rend="italic">ad,</hi> so
                    that the two segments <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">bal</hi> lie
                    on opposite sides of the line, then projecting the figure so that the line Ω
                    goes off to infinity, the tangent at <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is projected into
                    the asymptote, and the arc <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is projected into a
                    hyperbolic leg touching the asymptote at one extremity; the arc <hi
                    rend="italic">ba'</hi> will at the same time be projected into a hyperbolic leg
                    touching the same asymptote at the other extremity (and on the opposite side),
                    but so that the two hyperbolic legs may or may not belong to one and the same
                    branch. And we thus see that the two hyperbolic legs belong to a simple
                    intersection of the curve by the line infinity. Next, if the line Ω touch at δ
                    the arc <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> so that the two portions <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab',</hi><hi rend="italic">ba</hi> lie on the same side of the line Ω, then
                    projecting the figure as before, the tangent at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> that
                    is, the line Ω itself, is projected to infinity; the arc <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi> is projected into a parabolic leg, and at the same time the arc <hi
                    rend="italic">ba'</hi> is projected into a parabolic leg, having at infinity the
                    same direction as the other leg, but so that the two legs may or may not belong
                    to the same branch. And we thus see that the two parabolic legs represent a
                    contact of the line infinity with the curve,—the point of contact being of
                    course the point at infinity determined by the common direction of the two legs.
                    It will readily be understood how the like considerations apply to other
                    cases,—for instance, if the line Ω is a tangent at an inflexion, passes through
                    a crunode, or touches one of the branches of a crunode, &amp;c.; thus, if the
                    line Ω passes through a crunode we have pairs of hyperbolic legs belonging to
                    two parallel asymptotes. The foregoing considerations also show (what is very
                    important) how different branches are connected together at infinity, and lead
                    to the notion of a complete branch, or circuit.</p>
                <p>The two legs of a hyperbolic branch may belong to different asymptotes, and in
                    this case we have the forms which Newton calls inscribed, circumscribed,
                    ambigene, &amp;c.; or they may belong to the same asymptote, and in this case we
                    have the serpentine form, where the branch cuts the asymptote, so as to touch it
                    at its two extremities on opposite sides, or the conchoidal form, where it
                    touches the asymptote on the same side. The two legs of a parabolic branch may
                    converge to ultimate parallelism, as in the conic parabola, or diverge to
                    ultimate parallelism, as in the semi-cubical parabola <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">∙ = x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and the branch is said
                    to be convergent, or divergent, accordingly; or they may tend to parallelism in
                    opposite senses, as in the cubical parabola <hi rend="italic">y = x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >As</hi> mentioned with regard to a branch generally, an infinite branch of any
                    kind may have cusps, or, by cutting itself or another branch, may have or give
                    rise to a crunode, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>We may now consider the various forms of cubic curves, as appearing by Newton’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Enumeratio,</hi> and by the figures belonging thereto. The
                    species are reckoned as 72, which are numbered accordingly 1 to 72; but to these
                    should be added 10 <hi rend="superscript"> α</hi>, 13®, 22 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> a</hi>, and 22 <hi rend="superscript"> i,</hi>. It is not
                    intended here to consider the division into species, nor even completely that
                    into genera, but only to explain the principle of classification. It may be
                    remarked generally that there are at most three infinite branches, and that
                    there may besides be a re-entrant branch or oval.</p>
                <p>The genera may be arranged as follows :—</p>

                <p>and thus arranged they correspond to the different relations of the line infinity
                    to the curve. First, if the three intersections by the line infinity are all
                    distinct, we have the hyperbolas; if the points are real, the redundant
                    hyperbolas, with three hyperbolic branches; but if only one of them is real, the
                    defective hyperbolas, with one hyperbolic branch. Secondly, if two of the
                    intersections coincide, say if the line infinity meets the curve in a onefold
                    point and a twofold point, both of them real, then there is always one
                    asymptote: the line infinity may at the twofold point touch the curve, and we
                    have the parabolic hyperbolas; or the twofold point may be a singular
                    point,—viz., a crunode giving the hyρerbolisms of the hyperbola; an acnode,
                    giving <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n759/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0759-0724"/> the hyperbolisms of the ellipse; or a cusp,
                    giving the hyperbolisms of the parabola. As regards the so-called hyperbolisms,
                    observe that (besides the single asymptote) we have in the case of those of the
                    hyperbola two parallel asymptotes; in the case of those of the ellipse the two
                    parallel asymptotes become imaginary, that is, they disappear , and in the case
                    of those of the parabola they become coincident, that is, there is here an
                    ordinary asymptote, and a special asymptote answering to a cusp at infinity.
                    Thirdly, the three intersections by the line infinity may be coincident and
                    real; or say we have a threefold point: this may be an inflexion, a crunode, or
                    a cusp, that is, the line infinity may be a tangent at an inflexion, and we have
                    the divergent parabolas; a tangent at a crunode to one branch, and we have the
                    trident curve; or lastly, a tangent at a cusp, and we have the cubical
                    parabolae</p>
                <p>It is to be remarked that the classification mixes together non-singular and
                    singular curves, in fact, the five kinds presently referred to: thus the
                    hyperbolas and the divergent parabolas include curves of every kind, the
                    separation being made in the species; the hyperbolisms of the hyperbola and
                    ellipse, and the trident curve, are nodal; the hyperbolisms of the parabola, and
                    the cubical parabola, are cuspidal. The divergent parabolas are of five species
                    which respectively belong to and determine the five kinds of cubic curves;
                    Newton gives (in two short paragraphs without any development) the remarkable
                    theorem that the five divergent parabolas by their shadows generate and exhibit
                    all the cubic curves.</p>
                <p>The five divergent parabolas are curves each of them symmetrical with regard to
                    an axis. There are two nonsingular kinds, the one with, the other without, an
                    oval, but each of them has an infinite (as Newton describes it) <hi
                    rend="italic">campaniform</hi> branch; this cuts the axis at right angles, being
                    at first convex, but ultimately concave, towards the axis, the two legs
                    continually tending to become at right angles to the axis. The oval may unite
                    itself with the infinite branch, or it may dwindle into a point, and we have the
                    crunodal and the acnodal forms respectively; or if simultaneously the oval
                    dwindles into a point and unites itself to the infinit») branch, we have the
                    cuspidal form. Drawing a line to cut any one of these curves and projecting the
                    line to infinity, it would not be difficult to show how the line should be drawn
                    in order to obtain a curve of any given species. We have herein a better
                    principle of classification; considering cubic curves, in the first instance,
                    according to singularities, the curves are non-singdlar, nodal (viz., crunodal
                    or acnodal), or cuspidal; and we see further that there are two kinds of
                    non-singular curves, the complex and the simplex. There is thus a complete
                    division into the five kinds, the complex, simplex, crunodal, acnodal, and
                    cuspidal. Each singular kind presents itself as a limit separating two kinds of
                    inferior singularity; the cuspidal separates the crunodal and the acnodal, and
                    these last separate from each other the complex and the simplex.</p>
                <p>The whole question is discussed very fully and ably by Möbius in the memoir
                    “Ueber die Grundformen der Linien dritter Ordnung” <hi rend="italic">(Abh. der
                    K. Sachs. Ges. zu Leipzig,</hi> t. i., 1852). The author considers not only
                    plane curves, but also cones, or, what is almost the same thing, the spherical
                    curves which are their sections by a concentric sphere. Stated in regard to the
                    cone, we have there the fundamental theorem that there are two different kinds
                    of sheets: viz., the single sheet, not separated into two parts by the vertex
                    (an instance is afforded by the plane considered as a cone of the first order
                    generated by the motion of a line about a point), and the double or twin-pair
                    sheet, separated into two parts by the vertex (as in the cone of the second
                    order.) And it then appears that there are two kinds of non-singular cubic
                    cones, viz., the simplex, consisting of a single sheet, and the complex,
                    consisting of a single sheet and a twinpair sheet; and we thence obtain (as for
                    cubic curves) the crunodal, the acnodal, and the cuspidal kinds of cubic cones.
                    It may be mentioned that the single sheet is a sort of wavy form, having upon it
                    three lines of inflexion, and which is met by any plane through the vertex in
                    one or in three lines; the twin-pair sheet has no lines of inflexion, and
                    resembles in its form a cone on an oval base.</p>
                <p>In general a cone consists of one or more single or twinpair sheets, and if we
                    consider the section of the cone by a plane, the curve consists of one or more
                    complete branches, or say circuits, each of them the section of one sheet of the
                    cone; thus, a cone of the second order is one twin-pair sheet, and any section
                    of it is one circuit composed, it may be, of two branches. But although we thus
                    arrive by projection at the notion of a circuit, it is not necessary to go out
                    of the plane, and we may (with Zeuthen, using the shorter term <hi rend="italic"
                    >circuit</hi> for his <hi rend="italic">complete branch)</hi> define a circuit
                    as any portion (of a curve) capable of description by the continuous motion of a
                    point, it being understood that a passage through infinity is permitted. And we
                    then say that a curve consists of one or more circuits; thus the right line, or
                    curve of the first order, consists of one circuit; a curve of the second order
                    consists of one circuit; a cubic curve consists of one circuit or else of two
                    circuits.</p>
                <p>A circuit is met by any right line always in an even number, or always in an odd
                    number, of points, and it is said to be an even circuit or an odd circuit
                    accordingly; the right line is an odd circuit, the conic an even circuit. And we
                    have then the theorem, two odd circuits intersect in an odd number of points; an
                    odd and an even circuit, or two even circuits, in an even number of points. An
                    even circuit not cutting itself divides the plane into two parts, the one called
                    the internal part, incapable of containing any odd circuit, the other called the
                    external part, capable of containing an odd circuit.</p>
                <p>We may now state in a more convenient form the fundamental distinction of the
                    kinds of cubic curve. A non-singular cubic is simplex, consisting of one odd
                    circuit, or it is complex, consisting of one odd circuit and one even circuit.
                    It may be added that there are on the odd circuit three inflexions, but on the
                    even circuit no inflexion; it hence also appears that from any point of the odd
                    circuit there can be drawn to the odd circuit two tangents, and to the even
                    circuit (if any) two tangents, but that from a point of the even circuit there
                    cannot be drawn (either to the odd or the even circuit) any real tangent;
                    consequently, in a simplex curve the number of tangents from any point is two;
                    but in a complex curve the number is four, or none,—four if the point is on the
                    odd circuit, none if it is on the even circuit. It at once appears from
                    inspection of the figure of a non-singular cubic curve, which is the odd and
                    which the even circuit. The singular kinds arise as before; in the crunodal and
                    the cuspidal kinds the whole curve is an odd circuit, but in the acnodal kind
                    the acnode must be regarded as an even circuit.</p>
                <p>The analogous question of the classification of quartics (in particular
                    non-singular quartics and nodal quartics) is considered in Zeuthen’s memoir “Sur
                    les differentes formes des courbes planes du quatrième ordre” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Math.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi> t. vii., 1874). A non-singular quartic
                    has only even circuits; it has at most four circuits external to each other, or
                    two circuits one internal to the other, and in this last case the internal
                    circuit has no double tangents or inflexions. A very remarkable theorem is
                    established as to the double tangents of such a quartic:—distinguishing as a
                    double tangent of the first kind a real double tangent which either twice
                    touches <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n760/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0760-0725"/> the same circuit, or else touches the curve in
                    two imaginary points, the number of the double tangents of the first kind of a
                    non-singular quartic is = 4; it follows that the quartic has at most 8 real
                    inflexions. The forms of the nonsingular quartics are very numerous, but it is
                    not necessary to go further into the question.</p>
                <p>We may consider in relation to a curve, not only the line infinity, but also the
                    circular points at infinity; assuming the curve to be real, these present
                    themselves always conjointly; thus a circle is a conic passing through the two
                    circular points, and is thereby distinguished from other conics. Similarly a
                    cubic through the two circular points is termed a circular cubic; a quartic
                    through the two points is termed a circular quartic, and if it passes twice
                    through each of them, that is, has each of them for a node, it is termed a
                    bicircular quartic. Such a quartic is of course binodal (nt = 4, δ = 2, κ≈0); it
                    has not in general, but it may have, a third node, or a cusp. Or again, we may
                    have a quartic curve having a cusp at each of the circular points: such a curve
                    is a “Cartesian,” it being a complete definition of the Cartesian to say that it
                    is a bicuspidal quartic curve (nt = 4, δ = 0, <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> = 2),
                    having a cusp at each of the circular points. The circular cubic and the
                    bicircular quartic, together with the Cartesian (being in one point of view a
                    particular case thereof), are interesting curves which have been much studied,
                    generally, and in reference to their <hi rend="italic">focal</hi>
                    properties.</p>
                <p>The points called <hi rend="italic">foci</hi> presented themselves in the theory
                    ι f the conic, and were well known to the Greek geometers, but the general
                    notion of a focus was first established by I’lücker (in the memoir “Ueber solche
                    Puncte die bei Curven einer höheren Ordnung den Brennpuncten der Kegelschnitte
                    entsprechen” <hi rend="italic">(Grelle,</hi> t. x., 1833). We may from each of
                    the circular points draw tangents to a given curve; the intersection of two such
                    tangents (belonging of course to the two circular points respectively) is a
                    focus. There will be from each circular point λ tangents (λ, a number depending
                    on the class of the curve and its relation to the line infinity and the circular
                    points, — 2 for the general conic, 1 for the parabola, 2 for a circular cubic,
                    or bicircular quartic, &lt;fcc.); the λ tangents from the one circular point and
                    those from the other circular point intersect in λ real foci (viz., each of
                    these is the only real point on each of the tangents through it), and in λ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- λ imaginary foci; each pair of real foci determines
                    a pair of imaginary foci (the so called antipoints of the two real foci), and
                    the ∣λ (λ -1) pairs of real foci thus determine the λ <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>- λ imaginary foci. There are in some cases points termed centres, or
                    singular or multiple foci (the nomenclature is unsettled), whichare the
                    intersections of improper tangents from the two circular points respectively;
                    thus, in the circular cubic, the tangents to the curve at the two circular
                    points respectively (or two imaginary asymptotes of the curve) meet in a
                    centre.</p>
                <p>The notions of <hi rend="italic">distance</hi> and of lines <hi rend="italic">at
                    right angles</hi> are connected with the circular points; and almost every
                    construction of a curve by means of lines of a determinate length, or at right
                    angles to each other, and (as such) mechanical constructions by means of
                    linkwork, give rise to curves passing the same definite number of times through
                    the two circular points respectively, or say to circular curves, and in which
                    the fixed centres of the construction present themselves as ordinary, or as
                    singular, foci. Thus the general curve of three bar-motion (or locus of the
                    vertex of a triangle, the other two vertices whereof move on fixed circles) is a
                    tricircular sextic, having besides three nodes <hi rend="italic">(m</hi> = 6, δ
                    = 3 + 3 4 3, =9), and having the centres of the fixed circles each for a
                    singular focus; there is a third singular focus, and we have thus the remarkable
                    theorem (due to Mr S. Roberts) of the triple generation of the curve by means of
                    the three several pairs of singular foci.</p>
                <p>Again, the normal, <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> line at right angles to the
                    tangent, is connected with the circular points, and these accordingly present
                    themselves in the before-mentioned theories of evolutes and parallel curves.</p>
                <p>We have several recent theories which depend on the notion of <hi rend="italic"
                    >correspondence:</hi> two points whether in the same plane or in different
                    planes, or on the same curve or in different curves, may determine each other in
                    such wise that to any given position of the first point there correspond α'
                    positions of the second point, and to any given position of the second point α
                    positions of the first point; the two points have then an (α,α') correspondence;
                    and if a,a' are each = 1, then the two points have a (1, 1) or rational
                    correspondence. Connecting with each theory the author’s name, the theories in
                    question are—Riemann, the rational transformation of a plane curve; Cremona, the
                    rational transformation of a plane; and Chasles, correspondence of points on the
                    same curve, and united points. The theory first referred to, with the resulting
                    notion of Geschlecht, or <hi rend="italic">deficiency,</hi> is more than the
                    other two an essential part of the theory of curves, but they will all be
                    considered.</p>

                    of the rational transformation is as follows :—</p>
                <p>Taking <hi rend="smallcaps">μ,</hi> X,Y,Z to be rational and integral functions
                    (X,Y,Z all of the same order) of the coordinates <hi rend="italic">(x,y,z),</hi>
                    and «', X',Y',Z' rational and integral functions (X',Y',Z' all of the same
                    order) of the coordinates (af,y',z'), we transform a given curve u=0, by the
                    equations aſ: <hi rend="italic">y'</hi>: √ = X: Y: Z, thereby obtaining a
                    transformed, curve <hi rend="italic">u'</hi> =0, and a converse set of equations
                    <hi rend="italic">x:</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi>: z=X': Y': Z'; viz., assuming
                    that this is so, the point <hi rend="italic">(x,y,z)</hi> on the curve u=0 and
                    the point <hi rend="italic">(xt,f,z')</hi> on the curve <hi rend="italic"
                    >u'—fì</hi> will be points having a (1,1) correspondence. To show how this is,
                    observe that to a given point <hi rend="italic">(x,y,z)</hi> on the curve <hi
                    rend="italic">u~0</hi> there corresponds a single point <hi rend="italic"
                    >{A,y</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">,z</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">)</hi> determined, by
                    the equations aſ: y'1z'=X: Y: Z; from these equations and the equation <hi
                    rend="italic">u=0</hi> eliminating <hi rend="italic">x,y,z,</hi> we obtain the
                    equation <hi rend="italic">u</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">-0</hi> of the transformed
                    curve. To a given point <hi rend="italic">(x</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">,y</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">A)</hi> not on the curve <hi rend="italic">u'—O</hi> there
                    corresponds, not a single point, but the system of points <hi rend="italic"
                    >(x,y,z)</hi> given by the equations or <hi rend="italic">∙.y</hi> ’ ∖ <hi
                    rend="italic">z'=</hi> X: Y: Z, viz., regarding <hi rend="italic">x',f,z'</hi>
                    as constants (and to fix the ideas, assuming that the curves X = 0,Y = 0,Z=0
                    have no common intersections), these are the points of intersection of the
                    curves X: Y: Z <hi rend="italic">—ſ: if A,</hi> but no one of these points is
                    situate on the curve u = 0. If, however, the point (ae',i/',z') is situate on
                    the curve u'=0, then one point of the system of points in question is situate on
                    the curve <hi rend="italic">u = 0,</hi> that is, to a given point of the curve
                    u'=0 there corresponds a single point of the curve <hi rend="italic">u=0</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and hence also this point must be given by a system of
                    equations such as <hi rend="italic">x:</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi>: z = X': Y':
                    Z'.</p>
                <p>It is an old and easily proved theorem that, for a curve of the order <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> the number δ + κ of nodes and cusps is at most = ∖ <hi
                    rend="italic">(m</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi> 1)(∞ - 2); for a given curve the
                    deficiency of the actual number of nodes and cusps below this maximum number,
                    viz., ∣(m — 1)(∞ - 2) - δ - <hi rend="italic">κ,</hi> is the « Geschlecht,” or
                    “deficiency,” of the curve, say this is = D. When D = 0, the curve is said to be
                    unicursal, when = 1, bicursal, and so on.</p>
                <p>The general theorem is that two curves corresponding rationally to each other
                    have the same deficiency. [In particular a curve and its reciprocal have this
                    rational or (1,1) correspondence, and it has been already seen that a curve and
                    its reciprocal have the same deficiency.]</p>
                <p>A curve of a given order can in general be rationally transformed into a curve of
                    a lower order; thus a curve of any order for which D = 0, that is, a unicursal
                    ourve, can be transformed into a line; a curve of any order having the
                    deficiency 1 or 2 can be rationally transformed into a curve of the order D + 2,
                    deficiency D; and a curve of any order déficience = or &gt;3 can be rationally
                    transformed intoacurve of the order D + 3, deficiency D.</p>
                <p>Taking <hi rend="italic">x',y', z'</hi> as coordinates of a point of the
                    transformed curve, <pb break="no"

                    >al:</hi><hi rend="italic">↑f</hi>: z ’ =1: <hi rend="italic">θ</hi>: ¢&gt; we
                    have <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> a certain irrational function of <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ,</hi> and the theorem is that the coordinates <hi rend="italic">x,y,z</hi> of
                    any point of the given curve can be expressed as proportional to rational and
                    integral functions of <hi rend="italic">θ, φ,</hi> that is, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ</hi> and a certain irrational function of <hi rend="italic">θ.</hi></p>
                <p>In particular if D=0, that is, if the given curve be unicursal, the transformed
                    curve is a line, <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> is a mere linear function of <hi
                    rend="italic">θ,</hi> and the theorem is that the coordinates <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,y,z</hi> of a point of the unicursal curve can be expressed as proportional
                    to rational and integral functions of <hi rend="italic">θ</hi>; it is easy to
                    see that for a given curve of the order <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> these
                    functions of <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> must be of the same order <hi
                    rend="italic">m.</hi></p>
                <p>If D=l, then the transformed curve is a cubic; it can be shown that in a cubic,
                    the axes of coordinates being properly chosen, <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> can be
                    expressed as the square root of a quartic function of <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the theorem is that the coordinates <hi
                    rend="italic">x,y,z</hi> of a point of the bicursal curve can be expressed as
                    proportional to rational and integral functions of <hi rend="italic">θ,</hi> and
                    of the square root of a quartic function of <hi rend="italic">θ.</hi></p>
                <p>And so if D = 2, then the transformed curve is a nodal quartic; <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ</hi> can be expressed as the square root of a sextic function of <hi
                    rend="italic">θ,</hi> and the theorem is, that the coordinates <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,y,z</hi> of a point of the tricursal curve can be expressed as proportional
                    to rational and integral functions of <hi rend="italic">θ,</hi> and of the
                    square root of a sextic function of <hi rend="italic">θ.</hi> But D = 3, we have
                    no longer the like law, viz. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> is not expressible as the
                    square root of an octic function of <hi rend="italic">θ.</hi></p>
                <p>Observe that the radical, square root of a quartic function, is connected with
                    the theory of elliptic functions, and the radical, square root of a sextic
                    function, with that of the first kind of Abelian functions, but that the next
                    kind of Abelian functions does not depend on the radical, square root of an
                    octic function.</p>
                <p>It is a form of the theorem for the case D = 1, that the coordinates <hi
                    rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> of a point of the bicursal curve, or in particular
                    the coordinates of a point of the cubic, can be expressed as proportional to
                    rational and integral functions of the elliptic functions snw, cnw, dnw; in
                    fact, taking the radical to be <hi rend="italic">ſl</hi>- 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.1 - <hi rend="italic">E</hi><hi rend="italic

                    2</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and writing 0 = snw, the radical becomes = cnw.
                    dnw; and we have expressions of the form in question.</p>
                <p>It will be observed that the equations <hi rend="italic">x'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >: ſ</hi>: z = X: Y: Z before-mentioned do not of themselves lead to the other

                    Y': 'Z', and thus that the theory does not in anywise establish a (1, 1)
                    correspondence between the points <hi rend="italic">(x, y,</hi> ε) and <hi
                    rend="italic">(x', y'</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> z') of two planes or of the
                    same plane; this is the correspondence of Cremona’s theory.</p>
                <p>In this theory, given in the memoirs “Sulle Trasformazioni geome-triche delie
                    Figure piani,” <hi rend="italic">Mem. di Bologna,</hi> t. ii. (1863) and t. v.
                    (1865), we have a system of equations <hi rend="italic">xl: ſ</hi>: z <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> = X: Y: Z which <hi rend="italic">does</hi> lead to a

                    the same order, of the coordinates <hi rend="italic">x',fi,z',</hi> and there is
                    thus a (1,1) correspondence given by these equations between the two points <hi

                    one point <hi rend="italic">(al,ſsh),</hi> but that if <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    be the order of the functions X,Y,Z, then to a given point ae',y',z' there
                    would, if the curves X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0 had no common intersections, correspond
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> points <hi
                    rend="italic">(x,y,z).</hi> If, however, the functions are such that the curves
                    X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0 have <hi rend="italic">k</hi> common intersections, then
                    among the <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic

                    which are fixed points independent of the point (af,y ’,√); so that,
                    disregarding these fixed points, the number of points <hi rend="italic"
                    >(x,y,z)</hi> corresponding to the given point <hi rend="italic">(x’,ſA)</hi><hi

                    Eave one corresponding point; and hence the original system of equations <hi
                    rend="italic">al -.ſ</hi><hi rend="italic">∙.zt=X</hi>: Y: Z must lead to the
                    equivalent system <hi rend="italic">x:</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi>: z=X': Y':
                    Z'; and in this system by the like reasoning the functions must be such that the
                    curves X'=0, Y'=0, Z' = 0 have <hi rend="italic">n'</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi> 1 common intersections. The most
                    simple example is in the two systems of equations aſ: <hi rend="italic"
                    >ſ</hi><hi rend="italic">∙sh</hi><hi rend="italic">—ÿz :zx</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    intersections, and where obviously either system of equations leads to the other
                    system. In the case where X,Y,Z are of an order exceeding 2 the required number
                    n <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>-l of common intersections can only occur by
                    reason of common multiple points on the three curves; and assuming that the

                    satisfying these two equations. It may be added that the two equations together

                    which expresses that the curves X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0 are unicursal. The
                    transformation may be applied to any curve <hi rend="italic">u</hi> = 0, which
                    is thus rationally transformed into a curve √=0, by a rational transformation
                    such as is considered in Riemann’s theory: hence the two curves have the same
                    deficiency.</p>
                <p>Coming next to Chasles, the principle of correspondence is established and used
                    by him in a series of memoirs relating to the conics which satisfy given
                    conditions, and to other geometrical questions, contained in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Comptes Rendus,</hi> t. lviii. <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seq.</hi> (1864 to the present time). Tho theorem of united points
                    in regard to points in a right lino was given in a paper, June-July 1864, and it
                    was extended to unicursal curves in a paper of the same series (March 1866),
                    “Sur les courbes planes ou à double courbure dont les points peuvent se
                    déterminer individuellement—application du principe de correspondence dans la
                    théorie de ces courbes.”</p>
                <p>The theorem is as follows . if in a unicursal curve two points have an (a,£)
                    correspondence, then the number of united points (or points each corresponding
                    to itself) is = &lt;x + 0. In fact in a unicursal curve the coordinates of a
                    point are given as proportional to rational and integral functions of a
                    parameter, so that any point of the curve is determined uniquely by means of
                    this parameter; that is, to each point of the curve corresponds one value of the
                    parameter, and to each value of the parameter one point on the curve; and
                    the(α,j3) correspondence between the two points is given by an equation of the

                    >Proc. Lond. Math. Soc.,ï.</hi> i.(1866),—viz., taking P,P' as the corresponding
                    points in an (α,α ’) correspondence on a curve of deficiency D, and supposing
                    that when P is given the corresponding points P' are found as the intersections
                    of the curve by a curve Θ containing the coordinates of P as parameters, and
                    having with the given curve <hi rend="italic">k</hi> intersections at the point
                    P, then the number of united points is <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >=</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">+</hi><hi rend="italic">a!</hi>
                    + 2&amp;D; and more generally, if the curve Θ intersect the given curve in a set
                    of points P' each <hi rend="italic">p</hi> times, a set of points Q ’ each <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> times, &amp;c., in such manner that the points (P,P') the
                    points (P,Q ’) &amp;c., are pairs of points corresponding to each other
                    according to distinct laws; then if (P,P') are points having an (α,α')
                    correspondence with a number=α of united points, (P,Q') points having a <hi
                    rend="italic">(β,β!)</hi> correspondence with a number <hi rend="italic">=
                    b</hi> of united points, and so on, the theorem is that we have <hi

                    rend="italic">...</hi> = 2⅛D.</p>
                <p>The principle of correspondence, or say rather the theorem of united points, is a
                    most powerful instrument of investigation, which may be used in place of
                    analysis for the determination of the number of solutions of almost every
                    geometrical problem. We can by means of it investigate the class of a curve,
                    number of inflexions, &lt;fcc,,— in fact, Plücker’s equations; but it is
                    necessary to taka account of special solutions: thus, in one of the most simple
                    instances, in finding the class of a curve, the cusps present themselves as
                    special solutions.</p>
                <p>Imagine a curve of order <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> deficiency D, and let the
                    corresponding points P,P' be such that the line joining them passes through a
                    given point O; this is an <hi rend="italic">(ml,m-</hi> 1) correspondence, and
                    the value of <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is—1, hence the number of united points is
                    = 2m - 2 + 2D; the united points are the points of contact of the tangents from
                    O and (as special solutions) the cusps, and we have thus the relation <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic">+ κ = 2m</hi>- 2 + 2D; or, writing D = ∖
                    <hi rend="italic">(m</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi><hi rend="italic">V)(m</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">-</hi> 2) - δ - <hi rend="italic">κ,</hi> this is <hi
                    rend="italic">n=m(m</hi>-1) - 2δ - 3κ, which is right.</p>
                <p>The principle in its original form as applying to a right line was used
                    throughout by Chasles in the investigations on the number of the conics which
                    satisfy given conditions, and on the number of solutions of very many other
                    geometrical problems.</p>
                <p>There is one application of the theory of the (a, a') correspondence between two

                    of the independent variable, and the irrational functions thereof in the theory
                    of Abelian integrals, but the theory seems to be worthy of further
                    investigation.</p>
                <p>The researches of Chasles <hi rend="italic">(Comptes Rendus,</hi> t. lviii.,
                    1864, <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">seqſ)</hi> refer to the conics
                    which satisfy given conditions. There is an earlier paper by De Jonquieres,
                    “Théorèmes généraux concernant les courbes géométriques planes d’un ordre
                    quelconque,” <hi rend="italic">Liouv.,</hi> t. vi. (1861), which establishes the
                    notion of a system of curves (of any order) of the index N, viz., considering
                    the curves of the order <hi rend="italic">n</hi> which satisfy <hi rend="italic"
                    >⅛n(n</hi> + 3) - 1 conditions, then the index N is the number of these curves
                    which pass through a given arbitrary point. But Chasles in the first of his
                    papers (February 1864), considering the conics which satisfy four conditions,
                    establishes the notion of the two characteristics (μ., <hi rend="italic">v)</hi>
                    of such a system of conics, viz., <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> is the number of the
                    conics which pass through a given arbitrary point, and <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                    is the number of the conics which touch a given arbitrary line. And he gives the
                    theorem, a system of conics satisfying four conditions, and having the
                    characteristics <hi rend="italic">(μ, v)</hi> contains <hi rend="italic"
                    >2v</hi><hi rend="italic">- μ</hi> line-pairs (that is, conics, each of them a
                    pair of lines), and <hi rend="italic">2μ</hi><hi rend="italic">- v</hi>
                    point-pairs (that is, conics, each of them a pair of points,—coniques infiniment
                    aplaties), which is a fundamental one in the theory. The characteristics of the
                    system can be determined when it is known how many there are of these two kinds
                    of degenerate conics in the system, and how often each is to be counted. It was
                    thus that Zeuthen (in the paper <hi rend="italic">Nyt Bydrag,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> u</hi> Contribution to the Theory of Systems of
                    Conics which satisfy four Conditions,” Copenhagen, 1865, translated with an
                    addition in the <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Annales)</hi> solved the question of
                    finding the characteristics of the systems of conics which satisfy four
                    conditions of contact with a given curve or curves; and this led to the solution
                    of the further problem of finding the number of the conics which satisfy five
                    conditions of contact with a given curve or curves (Cayley, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comptes Rendus,</hi> t. lxiii., 1866), and “On the Curves which satisfy given
                    Conditions” <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> t. clviii., 1868).</p>
                <p>It may be remarked that although, as a process of investigation, it is very
                    convenient to seek for the characteristics of a system of conics satisfying 4
                    conditions, yet what is really determined is in every case the number of the
                    conics which satisfy 5 conditions; the characteristics of the system (4y&gt;) of
                    the conics which pass through <hi rend="italic">4p</hi> points are (5y&gt;), <hi
                    rend="italic">(4p,</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic">1),</hi> the number of the conics
                    which pass through 5 points, and which pass through 4 points and touch 1 line:
                    and so in other cases. Similarly as regards cubics, or curves of any other
                    order: a cubic depends on 9 constants, and the elementary problems are to find
                    the number of the cubics (9μ), <hi rend="italic">(8p, 11),</hi> &amp;c., which
                    pass through 9 points, pass through 8 points and touch 1 line, &amp;c.; but it
                    is in the investigation convenient to seek for the characteristics of the
                    systems of cubics <hi rend="italic">(8p)</hi><hi rend="italic">&amp;c.,</hi>
                    which satisfy 8 instead of 9 conditions.</p>
                <p>The elementary problems in regard to cubics are solved very completely by
                    Maillard in his <hi rend="italic">Thèse,</hi><hi rend="italic">Recherche</hi><hi

                    (1873), considers the problem in reference to curves of any order, and applies
                    his results to cubic and quartic curves.</p>
                <p>The methods of Maillard and Zeuthen are substantially identical; in each case the
                    question considered is that of finding the characteristics <hi rend="italic">(μ,
                    fi)</hi> of a system of curves by consideration of the special or degenerate
                    forms of the curves included in the system. The quantities which have to be
                    considered are very numerous. Zeuthen in the case of curves of any given order
                    establishes between the characteristics <hi rend="italic">μ,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">v,</hi> and 18 other quantities, in all 20 quantities, a set of 24
                    equations (equivalent to 23 independent equations), involving '(besides the 20
                    quantities) other quantities relating to the various forms of the degenerate
                    curves, which supplementary terms he determines, partially for curves of any
                    order, but completely only for quartic curves. It is in the discussion and
                    complete enumeration of the special or degenerate forms of the curves, and of
                    the supplementary terms to which they give rise, that the great difficulty of
                    the question seems to consist; it would appear that the 24 equations are a
                    complete system, and that (subject to a proper determination of the
                    supplementary terms) they contain the solution of the general problem.</p>
                <p>The remarks which follow have reference to the analytical theory of the
                    degenerate curves which present themselves in the foregoing problem of the

                    indefinitely small, we have what may be called the penultimate curve, and when 0
                    = 0 the ultimate curve. Regarding the ultimate curve as derived from a given
                    penultimate curve, we connect with the ultimate curve, and consider as belonging
                    to it, certain points called “summits” on the component curves P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = 0, P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 0, respectively;
                    a summit 2 is a point such that, drawing from an arbitrary point O the tangents
                    to the penultimate curve, we have 02 as the limit of one of these tangents. The
                    ultimate curve together with its summits may be regarded as a degenerate form of
                    the curve u*=0. Observe that the positions of the summits depend on the
                    penultimate curve <hi rend="subscript"> u</hi> = 0, viz., on the values of the
                    coefficients in the terms multiplied by 0,0 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>,. .;
                    they are thus in some measure arbitrary points as regards the ultimate curve P.

                <p>In conclusion a little may be said as to curves of double curvature, otherwise
                    twisted curves, or curves in space. The analytical theory by Cartesian
                    coordinates was first considered by Clairaut, <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur
                    les courbes à double courbure</hi> (Paris, 1731). Such a curve may be considered
                    as described by a point, moving in a line which at the same time rotates about
                    the point in a plane which at the same time rotates about the line; the point is
                    a point, the line a tangent, and the plane an osculating plane, of the curve;
                    <hi rend="italic">moreover</hi> the line is a generating line, and the plane a
                    tangent plane, of a developable surface or torse, having the curve for its edge
                    of regression. Analogous to the order and class of a plane curve we have the
                    order, rank, and class, of the system (assumed to be a geometrical one), viz.,
                    if an arbitrary plane contains <hi rend="italic">m</hi> points, an arbitrary
                    line meets <hi rend="italic">r</hi> lines, and an arbitrary point lies in <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> planes, of the system, then <hi rend="italic">m, r,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> are the order, rank, and class respectively. The system has
                    singularities, and there exist between <hi rend="italic">m, r,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> and the numbers of the several singularities equations
                    analogous to Plücker’s equations for a plane curve.</p>
                <p>It is a leading point in the theory that a curve in space cannot in general be
                    represented by means of two equations U = 0, V = 0; the two equations represent
                    surfaces, intersecting in a curve; but there are curves which are not the
                    complete intersection of any two surfaces; thus we have the cubic in space, or
                    skew cubic, which is the residual intersection of two quadric surfaces which
                    have a line in common; the equations U = 0, V = 0of the two quadric surfaces
                    represent the cubic curve, not by itself, but together with the line. <hi
