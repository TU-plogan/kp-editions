                <p><label type="entry">CUIRASS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Corslet</hi></label>, the
                    plate armour, whether formed of a single piece of metal or other rigid material
                    or composed of two or more pieces, which covers the front of the wearer’s
                    person. In a suit of armour, however, since this important piece would be worn
                    in connection with a corresponding defence for the back, the term <hi
                        rend="italic">cuirass</hi> commonly is understood to imply the complete
                    body-armour, including both the breast and the back plates. Thus this complete
                    body-armour appears in the Middle Ages frequently to have been described as a
                    “pair of plates.” The <hi rend="italic">corslet,</hi> a comparatively light
                    cuirass, is more strictly a breast-plate only. As parts of the military
                    equipment of classic antiquity, cuirasses and corslets of bronze, and at later
                    periods also of iron or some other rigid substance, were habitually in use; but
                    while some special kind of secondary protection for the breast had been worn in
                    earlier times by the men-at-arms in addition to their mail hauberks and their
                    “cotes” armed with splints and studs, it was not till the 14th century that a
                    regular body-defence of plate can be said to have become an established
                    component of mediaeval armour. As this century continued to advance, the cuirass
                    is found gradually to have come into general use, in connection with plate
                    defences for the limbs, until, at the close of the century the long-familiar
                    interlinked chain-mail is no longer visible in knightly figures, except in the
                    camail of the basinet and at the edge of the hauberk. The prevailing, and indeed
                    almost the universal, usage throughout this century was that the cuirass was
                    worn covered. Thus, the globose form of the breast-armour of the Black Prince,
                    in his effigy in Canterbury Cathedral, 1376, intimates that a cuirass as well as
                    a hauberk is to be considered to have been covered by the royalty-emblazoned
                    jupon of the Prince. The cuirass, thus worn in the 14th century, was always made
                    of sufficient length to rest on the hips; otherwise, if not thus supported, it
                    must have been suspended from the shoulders, in which case it would have
                    effectually interfered with the free and vigorous action of the wearer. Early in
                    the 15th century, the entire panoply of plate, including the cuirass, began to
                    be worn without any surcoat; but in the concluding quarter of the century the
                    short surcoat, with full short sleeves, known as the tabard, was in general use
                    over the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n726/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0726-0693"/> armour. At the same time that the disuse of
                    the surcoat became general, small plates of various forms and sizes (and not
                    always made in pairs, the plate for the right or sword-arm often being smaller
                    and lighter than its companion), were attached to the armour in front of the
                    shoulders, to defend the otherwise vulnerable points where the plate defences of
                    the upper-arms and the cuirass left a gap on each side. About the middle of the
                    century, instead of being formed of a single plate, the breast-plate of the
                    cuirass was made in two parts, the lower adjusted to overlap the upper, and
                    contrived by means of a strap or sliding rivet to give flexibility to this
                    defence. In the second half of this 15th century the cuirass occasionally was
                    superseded by the “brigandine jacket,” a defence formed of some textile fabric,
                    generally of rich material, lined throughout with overlapping scales of metal,
                    which were attached to the jacket by rivets, having their heads, like studs,
                    visible on the outside. In the l6th century, when occasionally, and by
                    personages of exalted rank, splendid surcoats were worn over the armour, the
                    cuirass—its breastpiece during the first half of the century globular in form’—
                    was constantly reinforced by strong additional plates attached to it by rivets
                    or screws. About 1550 the breast-piece of tho cuirass was characterized by a
                    central ridge, called the “tapul,” having near its centre a projecting point;
                    this projection, somewhat later, was brought lower down, and eventually the
                    profile of the plate, the projection having been carried to its base, assumed
                    the singular form which led to this fashion of the cuirass being distinguished
                    as the “peascod cuirass.” Corslets provided with both breast and back pieces
                    were worn by foot-soldiers in the 17th century, while their mounted comrades
                    were equipped in heavier and stronger cuirasses; and these defences continued in
                    use after the other pieces of armour, one by one, had gradually been laid aside.
                    The cuirass and the corslet also at last ceased to be worn, until their revival
                    in modern armies, in which mounted cuirassiers, armed as in earlier days with
                    breast and back plates, in some degree have emulated the martial splendour of
                    the body-armour of the era of mediaeval chivalry. Cuirasses had been worn for
                    some years by the modern soldiers of France before they were introduced into the
                    British army. It was after the era of Waterloo that certain historical cuirasses
                    were taken from their repose in the Tower of London, and adapted for service by
                    the Life Guards and the Horse Guards.</p>
