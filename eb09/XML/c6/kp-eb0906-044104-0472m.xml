                    command of St Domingo, but was prevented from joining the expedition by an
                    accident that happened to him in a love adventure. He next sought military
                    service under the celebrated Gonsalvo de Cordova, but a serious illness
                    frustrated his purpose. At last, in 1504, he set out, according to his first
                    plan, for St Domingo, where he was kindly received by Ovando. He was then only
                    nineteen, and remarkable for a graceful physiognomy and amiable manners, as well
                    as for skill and address in all military exercises. He remained in St Domingo,
                    where Ovando had successively conferred upon him several lucrative and
                    honourable employments, until 1511, when he accompanied Diego Velasquez in his
                    expedition to the island of Cuba. Here he became alcalde of St Iago, and
                    displayed great ability on several trying occasions. An opportunity was soon
                    afforded him of showing his powers as a military leader in an enterprize of the
                    first importance. Grijalva, lieutenant of Velasquez, had just discovered Mexico,
                    but had not attempted to effect a settlement. This displeased the governor of
                    Cuba, who superseded Grijalva, and intrusted the conquest of the newly
                    discovered country to Cortes. The latter hastened his preparations, and, on the
                    l8th of November 1518, he set cut from St Iago, with 10 vessels, 600 or 700
                    Spaniards, 18 horsemen, and some pieces of cannon. Scarcely had he set sail,
                    however, when Velasquez, probably apprehensive that his lieutenant would carry
                    off all the glory as well as the profit of the enterprize, recalled the
                    commission which he had granted to Cortes, and even ordered him to be put under
                    arrest; but the attachment of the troops, by whom he was greatly beloved,
                    enabled him to persevere in spite of the governor; and ou the 4th of March 1519
                    he landed on the coast of Mexico. Advancing along the gulf, sometimes taking
                    measures to conciliate the natives, and sometimes spreading terror by his arms,
                    he took possession of the town of Tabasco. The noise of the artillery, the
                    appearance of the floating fortresses which had transported the Spaniards over
                    the ocean, and the horses on which they fought, all new objects to the natives,
                    inspired them with astonishment mingled with terror and admiration; they
                    regarded the Spaniards as gods, and sent them ambassadors with presents. Cortes
                    here learned that the native sovereign was called Montezuma; that he reigned
                    over an extensive empire, which had lasted for three centuries; that thirty
                    vassals, called caciques, obeyed him; and that his riches were immense and his
                    power absolute. No more was necessary to inflame the ambition of the invader,
                    who did not hesitate to undertake the conquest of this great empire, which could
                    only be effected by combining stratagem and address with force and courage. He
                    laid the foundation of the town of Vera Cruz, caused himself to be elected
                    captain-general of the new colony, and, like Agathocles, burned his vessels to
                    cut off the possibility of retreat and show his soldiers that they must either
                    conquer or perish. He then penetrated into the interior of the country, drew to
                    his camp several caciques hostile to Montezuma, and induced these native princes
                    to facilitate his progress. The republic of Tlascala, which was hostile to
                    Montezuma, opposed him; but he routed its army, which had resisted all the
                    forces of the Mexican empire, dictated peace on moderate terms, and converted
                    the people into powerful auxiliaries. His further advance was in vain attempted
                    to be checked by an ambuscade laid by the inhabitants of Cholula, on whom he
                    took signal vengeance. Surmounting all other obstacles he arrived, with 6000
                    natives and a handful of Spaniards, in sight of the immense lake on which was
                    built the city of Mexico, the capital of the empire. Montezuma received him with
                    great pomp, and his subjects, believing Cortes to be a descendant of the sun,
                    prostrated themselves before him. The first care of Cortes was to fortify
                    himself in one of the beautiful palaces of the prince, and he was planning how
                    to possess himself of the riches of so opulent an empire.</p>

                <p>when intelligence reached him that a general of the emperor, who had received
                    secret orders, had just attacked the garrison of Vera Cruz and killed several of
                    his soldiers. The head of one of the Spaniards was sent to the capital. This
                    event undeceived the Mexicans, who had hitherto believed the Spaniards to be
                    immortal, and necessarily altered the whole policy of Cortes. Struck with the
                    greatness of the danger, surrounded by enemies, and having only a handful of
                    soldiers, he conceived and instantly executed a most daring project. Having
                    repaired with his officers to the palace of the emperor, he announced to
                    Montezuma that he must either accompany him or perish. Being thus master of the
                    person of the monarch, he next demanded that the Mexican general and his
                    officers who had attacked the Spaniards should be delivered into his hands; and
                    when this had been done he caused these unfortunate men, who had only obeyed the
                    orders of their sovereign, to be burned alive before the gates of the imperial
                    palace. During this cruel execution Cortes entered the apartment of Montezuma,
                    and caused him to be loaded with irons, in order to force him to acknowledge
                    himself a vassal of Charles V. The unhappy prince yielded, and was restored to a
                    semblance of liberty on presenting the fierce conqueror with 600,000 marks of
                    pure gold, and a prodigious quantity of precious stones. Scarcely had he reaped
                    the fruits of his audacity, however, when he was informed of the landing of a
                    Spanish army, under Narvaez, which had been sent by Velasquez to compel him to
                    renounce his command. In this emergency Cortes acted with his usual decision and
                    courage. Leaving 200 men at Mexico, under the orders of his lieutenant, he
                    marched against Narvaez, whom he defeated and made prisoner, and he then
                    enlisted under his standard the Spanish soldiers who had been sent to attack
                    him. On his return to the capital, however, he found that the Mexicans had
                    revolted against the emperor and the Spaniards, and that dangers thickened
                    around him. Montezuma perished in attempting to address his revolted subjects;
                    upon which the latter, having chosen a new emperor, attacked the head-quarters
                    of Cortes with the utmost fury, and, in spite of the advantage of fire-arms,
                    forced the Spaniards to retire, as the only means of escaping destruction. Their
                    rearguard, however, was cut in pieces, and they suffered severely during the
                    retreat, which was continued during six days. Elated with their success, the
                    Mexicans offered battle in the plain of Otumba. This was what Cortes desired,
                    and it proved their destruction. Cortes gave the signal for batt]e, and, on the
                    7th of July 1520, gained a victory which decided the fate of Mexico. Immediately
                    afterwards he proceeded to Tlascala, assembled an auxiliary army of natives,
                    subjected the neighbouring provinces, and then marched a second time against
                    Mexico, which, after a gallant defence of several months, was retaken on the
                    13th of August 1521. These successes were entirely owing to the geriius, valour,
                    and profound but unscrupulous policy of Cortes; and the account of them which he
                    transmitted to Spain excited the admiration of his countrymen. The extent of his
                    conquests, and the ability he had displayed, effaced the censure which he had
                    incurred by the irregularity of his operations; and public opinion having
                    declared in his favour, Charles V., disregarding the pretensions of Velasquez,
                    appointed him governor and captain-general of Mexico, at the same time
                    conferring on him the valley of Guaxaca, which was erected into a marquisate,
                    with a considerable revenue. But although his power was thus confirmed by royal
                    authority, and although he exerted himself to consolidate Spanish domination
                    throughout all Mexico, the means he employed were such that the natives, reduced
                    to despair, took arms against the Spaniards. This revolt, however, was speedily
                    subdued, and the Mexicans were everywhere forced to yield to the ascendency of
                    European discipline and valour. Guatimozin, who had been recognized as emperor,
                    and a great number of caciques, accused of having conspired against the
                    conquerors, were publicly executed, with circumstances of great cruelty, by
                    order of Cortes. Meanwhile the court of Madrid, dreading the ambition and
                    popularity of the victorious chief, sent commissioners to watch his conduct and
                    thwart his proceedings; and whilst he was completing the conquest of New Spain
                    his goods were seized by the fiscal of the Council of the Indies, and his
                    retainers imprisoned and put into irons. Indignant at the ingratitude of bis
                    sovereign, Cortes returned in person to Spain to appeal to the justice of the
                    emperor, and appeared there with great splendour. The emperor received him with
                    every mark of distinction, and decorated him with the order of St Iago. Cortes
                    returned to Mexico with new titles but diminished authority, a viceroy having
                    been intrusted with the administration of civil affairs, whilst the military
                    department, with permission to push his conquests, was all that remained to
                    Cortes. This division of powers became a source of continual dissension, and
                    caused the failure of the last enterprizes in which he engaged. Nevertheless, in
                    1536, he discovered the peninsula of California, and surveyed a part of the gulf
                    which separates it from Mexico. At length, tired of struggling with adversaries
                    unworthy of him, whom the court took care to multiply, he returned to Europe,
                    hoping to confound his enemies. But Charles V. received him coldly. Cortes
                    dissembled, redoubled the assiduity of his attendance on the emperor,
                    accompanied him in the disastrous expedition to Algiers in 1541, served as a
                    volunteer, and had a horse killed under him. This was his last appearance in the
                    field, and if his advice had been followed the Spanish arms would have been
                    saved from disgrace, and Europe delivered nearly three centuries earlier from
                    the scourge of organized piracy. Soon afterwards he fell into neglect, and could
                    scarcely obtain an audience. One day, however, having forced his way through the
                    crowd which surrounded the emperor’s carriage, and mounted on the door-step,
                    Charles, astonished at an act of such audacity, demanded to know who he was. “I
                    am a man,” replied the conqueror of Mexico proudly, “who has given you more
                    provinces than your ancestors left you cities.” This haughty declaration of
                    important services ill-requited could scarcely fail to offend a monarch on whom
                    fortune had lavished her choicest favours; and Cortes, overwhelmed with disgust,
                    withdrew from court, passed the remainder of his days in solitude, and died,
                    near Seville, on the 2d of December 1554, being then in the sixty-third year of
                    his age.</p>
                <p>The only writings of Cortes are five letters on the subject of his conquests,
                    which lie addressed to Charles V., and which have fortunately been given to the
                    world. The best edition of them is that of Don Francisco Antonio Lorenzana,
                    archbishop of Mexico, entitled <hi rend="italic">Historia,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    English translation of the letters, by George Folsom, was published at New York
                    in 1843. The conquests of Cortes have been described with pompous elegance by
