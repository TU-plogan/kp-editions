                    >Zênobie,</hi> which is one of the masterpieces of the French classical tragedy.
                    But his <hi rend="italic">Xerxes</hi> (1714) was only once played, and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Sémiramis</hi> w as an absolute failure. Meanwhile, in 1707,
                    Crébillon had married a girl without fortune, who had since died, leaving him an
                    infant son. His father also had died, insolvent. His three years’ attendance at
                    court had been fruitless. Envy had circulated innumerable slanders against him.
                    Oppressed with melancholy, he removed to a garret, -where he surrounded himself
                    with a number of dogs, cats, and ravens, which he had befriended; he became
                    utterly careless of cleanliness or food, and solaced himself with constant
                    smoking. But in 1731 he w as elected member of the French Academy, in 1735 he
                    was appointed royal censor; andin 1745 Mme. de Pompadour, in her enmity to his
                    rival Voltaire, presented him with a pension of 1000 francs and a post in the
                    royal library. In 174t&gt; his <hi rend="italic">Catilina</hi> was played with
                    great success before the court; and in 1754, eight years before his death,
                    appeared his last tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Le Triumvirat.</hi> Such was the
                    rivalry of Voltaire, that to prove his own superiority he took the subjects of
                    no less than five of Crébillon’s tragedies— <hi rend="italic">Semiramis,
                    Electre, Catilina,</hi><hi rend="italic">Le Triumvirat, Atrée—</hi> as subjects
                    for tragedies of his own. For vigour and passion Crébillon is unsurpassed in the
                    French classical drama; his faults are want of culture and the consequent
                    absence of classical correctness, and a want of care which displays itself in
                    his style and even in the mechanism of his verse.</p>
