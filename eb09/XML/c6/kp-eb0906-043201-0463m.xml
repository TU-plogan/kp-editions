                    members of the corporation have no rights therein. A corporation may owe money,
                    but the corporators as individuals are under no obligation to pay the debt. The
                    rights and duties descend to the successive members of the corporation. This
                    capacity of perpetual succession is regarded as the distinguishing feature of
                    corporations as compared with other societies. One of the phrases most commonly
                    met with in law-books describes a corporation as a society with perpetual
                    succession and a common seal. The latter point, however, is not conclusive of
                    the corporate character.</p>
                <p>The legal attributes of a corporation have been worked out with great fulness and
                    ingenuity in English law, but the conception has been taken full-grown from the
                    law of Rome. The technical term in Roman law corresponding to our corporation is
                    <hi rend="italic">collegium;</hi> a more general term is <hi rend="italic"
                    >universitas.</hi> A <hi rend="italic">collegium</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >corpus</hi> must have consisted of at least three persons, who were said to be
                    <hi rend="italic">corporati</hi><hi rend="italic">—habere corpus.</hi> They
                    could hold property in common and had a common chest. They might sue and be sued
                    by their agent <hi rend="italic">(syndicus</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >actor).</hi> There was a complete separation in Jaw between the rights of the
                    <hi rend="italic">collegium</hi> as a body and those of its individual members.
                    The <hi rend="italic">collegium</hi> remained in existence although all its
                    original members were changed. It was governed by its own by-laws, provided
                    these were not contrary to the common law. The power of forming <hi
                    rend="italic">collegia</hi> was restrained, and societies pretending to act as
                    corporations were often suppressed. In all these points the <hi rend="italic"
                    >collegia</hi> of Roman closely resemble the corporations of English law. There
                    is a similar parallel between the purposes for which the formation of such
                    societies is authorized in English and in Roman law. Thus among the Roman <hi
                    rend="italic">collegia</hi> the following classes are distinguished :—(1) Public
                    governing bodies, or municipalities, <hi rend="italic">civitates</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> (2) religious societies, such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >collegia</hi> of priests and Vestal Virgins; (3) official societies, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">scribae,</hi> employed in the
                    administration of the state; (4) trade societies, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">fabri, pictores, navicularii,</hi> &amp;c. This
                    class shades down into the <hi rend="italic">societates</hi> not incorporated,
                    just as our own trading corporations partake largely of the character of
                    ordinary partnerships. In the later Roman law the distinction of corporations
                    into civil and ecclesiastical, into lay and eleemosynary, is recognized. The
                    latter could not alienate without just cause, nor take land without a licence—a
                    restriction which may be compared with our statutes of mortmain. All these
                    privileged societies are what we should call <hi rend="italic">corporations
                    aggregate.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">corporation sole</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> consisting of only a single person) is a refinement of our own, for
                    although Roman law held that the corporation subsisted in full force,
                    notwithstanding that only one member survived, it did not impute to the
                    successive holders of a public office the character of a corporation. When a
                    public officer in our law is said to be a corporation sole, the meaning is that
                    the rights acquired by him in that capacity descend to his successor in office,
                    and not (as the case is where a public officer is not a corporation) to his
                    ordinary legal representative. The best known instances of corporation sole are
                    the king and the parson of a parish. The conception of the king as a corporation
                    is the key to many of his paradoxical attributes in constitutional theory— his
                    invisibility, immortality, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The Roman conception of a corporation was kept alive by ecclesiastical and
                    municipal bodies. When English lawyers came to deal with such societies, the
                    corporation law of Rome admitted of easy application. Accordingly, in no
                    department of our law have we borrowed so copiously and so directly from the
                    civil law. The corporations known to the earlier English law weremainly the
                    municipal, the ecclesiastical, and the educational and eleemosynary. To all of
                    these the same principles, borrowed from Roman jurisprudence, were applied. The
                    different purposes of these institutions brought about in course of time
                    differences in the rules of the law applicable to each. In particular, the great
                    development of trading companies under special statutes has produced a new class
                    of corporations, differing widely from those formerly known to the law. The
                    reform of municipal corporations effected by the Act of 1837 has also restricted
                    the operation of the principles of the older corporation law. These principles,
                    however, still apply when special statutes have not intervened. But the extent
                    and importance of .Parliamentary legislation on corporations have withdrawn the
                    attention of writers from corporation law pure and simple, and there has been no
                    book on that subject since Mr Grant’s, published in 1850. Two earlier treatises
                    by Mr Kyd and Mr Willcocks may be mentioned. American lawyers have dealt more
                    satisfactorily with corporations, and special reference may be made to Abbott’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Digest of Corporation</hi><hi rend="italic">Laιv.</hi></p>
                <p>The legal origin of corporation is ascribed by Grant to five sources, viz.,
                    common law, prescription, Act of Parliament, charter, and implication.
                    Prescription in legal theory implies a grant, so that corporations by
                    prescription would be reducible to the class of chartered or statutory
                    corporations. A corporation is said to exist by implication when the purposes of
                    a legally constituted society cannot be carried out without corporate powers.
                    Corporations are thus ultimately traceable to the authority of charters and Acts
                    of Parliament, The power of creating corporations by charter is an important
                    prerogative of the Crown, but in the present state of the constitution, when all
                    the powers of the Crown are practically exercised by Parliament, there is no
                    room for any jealousy as to the manner in which it may be exercised. The power
                    of chartering corporations belonged also to subjects who had <hi rend="italic"
                    >jura regalia, e.g.,</hi> the-bishops<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n464/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0464-0433"/> of Durham granted a charter of incorporation to
                    the city of Durham in 1565, 1602, and 1780, and the last was the charter in
                    operation up to the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act. The charter of a
                    corporation is regarded as being of the nature of a contract between the king
                    and the corporation. It will be construed more favourably for the Crown, and
                    more strictly as against the grantee. It cannot alter the law of the land, and
                    it may be surrendered, so that, if the surrender is accepted by the Crown and
                    enrolled in Chancery, the corporation is thereby dissolved. The use made of this
                    power of the Crown in the reigns of Charles II. and James II. will be familiar
                    to most readers, Chartered corporations were originally held to be <hi
                    rend="italic">ex necessitate</hi> immortal; only a statute could give a society
                    corporate privileges to ensue for a limited time. But now, by 1 Vict. c. 77 §
                    29, the Crown may incorporate for any period.</p>
                <p>Every corporation, it is said, must have a name, and it may have more names than
                    one, but two corporations cannot have the same name. And corporations cannot
                    change their name save by charter or some equivalent authority.</p>
                <p>The possession of a common seal, though, as already stated, not conclusive of the
                    corporate character, has been held to be an incident of every corporation
                    aggregate. The inns of courts have common seals, but they are only voluntary
                    societies, not corporations. Generally speaking, all corporate acts affecting
                    strangers must be performed under the common seal; acts of internal
                    administration affecting only the corporators, need not be under seal. The rule
                    has been defended by high judicial authority as following necessarily from the
                    impersonal character of a corporation; either a seal or something equivalent
                    must be fixed upon so that the act of the corporation may be recognized by all.
                    In the matter of contracts, however, the strict rule of law has been found
                    untenable. A large exception has long been recognized by the courts. In cases of
                    “convenience almost amounting to necessity,” the use of the seal will not be
                    necessary in order to bind a corporation. Examples given in the old cases of
                    such convenience are the retainer of an inferior servant, authority to make a
                    distress, or drive away cattle damage feasant, &amp;c. This exception has been
                    extended in different degrees in different classes of corporations. In trading
                    corporations it has been lately held that it will include all contracts entered
                    into for the purposes for which the society was incorporated, and will not be
                    limited to matters of constant occurrence or small importance. In other
                    corporations the same latitude does not appear to be encouraged by the
                    decisions. Goods of a kind which must have been necessary from time to time, and
                    actually supplied to a corporation under a contract not sealed, may be sued
                    upon. But an engagement as clerk to a workhouse was held not binding on a board
                    of guardians because not under their seal. And where a municipal corporation
                    caused some tolls to be let by auction, they were not allowed to recover on the
                    contract because it was not under their seal. And work done for local
                    improvements, ttnder an unsealed contract, was held to give no claim against a
                    corporation. In such cases the fact of the contract being executed makes no
                    difference as against the corporation, but where the corporation has executed an
                    unsealed contract, it may recover thereon.</p>
                <p>The somewhat unsatisfactory principles as to the dissolution of corporations are
                    not now of much practical importance. A corporation may of course be abolished
                    by statute, but not by the mere authority of the Crown. It is held that a
                    corporation may become extinct by the disappearance of all its members or of any
                    integral part, or by surrender of charter if it is a chartered society, or by
                    process of law for abuse of powers. In such cases, the real property of the
                    corporation will go to the heir of the founder, aud the personal property as <hi
                    rend="italic">bona vacantia</hi> to the Crown. Corporations created by statute
                    cannot surrender, nor will they be suffered to avoid elections so as to become
                    extinct for want of members.</p>
                <p>The power of the majority to bind the society is one of the first principles of
                    corporation law, even in cases where the corporation has a head. It is even said
                    that only by an Act of Parliament can this rule be avoided. The binding majority
                    is that of the number present at a corporate meeting duly summoned. Votes given
                    for an illegal purpose or a disqualified person are considered as thrown away,
                    and in an election votes must be given <hi rend="italic">for</hi> some
                    particular candidate,—if they are merely <hi rend="italic">against</hi> a
                    candidate, they are void.</p>
                <p>In corporations which have a head (as colleges), although the head cannot veto
                    the resolution of the majority, he is still considered an integral part of the
                    society, and his death suspends its existence, so that a head cannot devise or
                    bequeath to the corporation, nor can a grant be made to a corporation during
                    vacancy of the headship.</p>
                <p>A corporation has power to make such regulations (bylaws) as are necessary. for
                    carrying out its purposes, and these are binding on its members and on persons
                    within its local jurisdiction if it has any. Such by-laws must not be at
                    variance with the law of the land, nor retrospective in their operation,
                    nor.unreasonable. They must further be in harmony with the objects of the
                    society, and must not infringe or limit the powers and duties of its officers. A
                    bylaw to compel the giving of a dinner was held to be invalid unless it could be
                    shown that the interest of the corporation was to be promoted thereby.</p>
                <p>The power to acquire and hold land was incident to a corporation at common law,
                    but its restriction by the statutes of mortmain dates from a very early period.
                    The English law against mortmain was dictated by the jealousy of the feudal
                    lords, who lost the services they would otherwise have been entitled to, when
                    their land passed into the hands of a perpetual corporation. The vast increase
                    in the estates of ecclesiastical corporations constituted by itself a danger
                    which might well justify the operation of the restricting statutes. Accordingly,
                    in Magna Charta (9 Hen. III. c. 36) there is a clause against the granting of
                    land to religious houses. The statute 7 Edward I. st. 2, c. 1 <hi rend="italic"
                    >(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Religiosis),</hi> and the Statute of Westminster the
                    Second extended by 15 Richard II. c. 5,prohibited corporations from buying land
                    in mortmain under penalty of forfeiture. The next lord might enter within a
                    year, and each succeeding lord had half a year, and for default of intermediate
                    lord the king should have the lands for ever. If the king and the lords waived
                    their rights, the corporation could hold the land without question. Hence a
                    practice grew up for the king to grant to a corporation a licence to hold the
                    lands given to it; and this, although, strictly speaking, a waiving of the
                    king’s rights, was in course of time held sufficient to bar the mesne lord’s
                    right also. Its power to do so was expressly confirmed by 7 and 8 Will. III. c.
                    37, —not that there was any doubt about it in practice, but to avoid the hateful
                    example of anything like a power in the Crown to suspend the laws. A licensed
                    corporation can hold lands to the extent of its licence.</p>
                <p>The Mortmain Acts applied only to cases of alienation <hi rend="italic">inter
                    vivos.</hi> There was no power to devise lands by will until 32 Henry VIII. c. 1
                    (explained by 34 and 35 Henry VIII. c. 5), and when the power was granted
                    corporations were expressly excluded from its benefits. No devise to a
                    corporation, whether for its own use or in trust, was allowed to be good; land
                    so devised went to the heir, either absolutely or charged with the trusts
                    imposed upon it in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n465/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0465-0434"/> the abortive devise. A modification, however, was
                    gradually wrought by the judicial interpretations of the Charitable Trusts Act
                    43 Elizabeth c. 4, and it was held that a devise to a corporation for a
                    charitable purpose might be a good devise, and would stand unless voided by the
                    Mortmain Acts;—so that no corporation could take land, without a licence, for
                    any purpose or in any way; and no licensed corporation could take lands by
                    devise, save for charitable turposes. Then came the 9 George II. c. 36, commonly
                    ut improperly called the Mortmain Act. Its effect is generally to make it
                    impossible for land to be left by will for charitable uses, whether through a
                    corporation or a natural person.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    supersede the necessity for a licence in mortmain.</p></note> The new Wills Act
                    does not renew the old provision against devises to corporations, which
                    therefore fall under the general law of mortmain. The result is simply that
                    corporations cannot take land for any purpose without a licence, and that
                    neither corporations nor natural persons can take land by devise for charitable
                    uses (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Charities).</hi> The policy of the law of
                    mortmain may be compared with the rule against perpetuities—a rule which forbids
                    the operation of settlements purporting to regulate the devolution of land for
                    ever. The longest period for which the law will allow the future disposition of
                    land to be tied up is a life or lives in being, and twenty-one years
                    thereafter.</p>
                <p>• The power of corporations at common law to alienate their property is a
                    question of much greater difficulty, and no satisfactory solution of it is to be
                    found in the cases or text-books. Coke is understood to say in his report of
                    Sutton’s Hospital case that they have the power to alienate, but later
                    authorities are sometimes quoted on the other side. “All civil corporations,”
                    says Kyd, “such as the corporations of mayor and commonalty, bailiffs and
                    burgesses of a town, or the corporate companies of trades in cities and towns,
                    &amp;c., have and always have had an unlimited control over their respective
                    properties, and may alienate in fee, or make what estates they please for years,
                    for life, or in tail, as fully as any individual may do in respect of his own
                    property.” And he makes the same assertion as to the common law right of
                    colleges and ecclesiastical corporations. Grant, however, argues that no civil
                    corporation can be supposed to hold land otherwise than as “clothed with a
                    public purpose,” and that, therefore, there is no right of alienation. Recent
                    judicial decisions, however, seem to favour it. In a case before the late master
                    of the rolls (Evan <hi rend="italic">V.</hi> Corporation of Avon, 29 Beavan
                    144), it was held that a municipal corporation, apart from the Municipal
                    Corporations Act, has full power to dispose of all its property like a private
                    individual, and in the more recent case of Riche <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Ashbury Company <hi rend="italic">(Law Reports,</hi> 9 Exchequer, 224) Mr
                    Justice Blackburn, quoting the opinion of Coke in Sutton’s Hospital case, lays
                    it down that at common law a corporation might bind itself to anything to which
                    a natural person could bind himself, and deal with its property as a natural
                    person might, and that an attempt to forbid this by the king, even by express
                    negative words, does not bind the law. When land is held by a corporation for
                    charitable or other fiduciary purposes the Court of Chancery will interfere to
                    prevent any improper alienation.</p>
                <p>In the case of ecclesiastical and college property, the dangers incident to
                    unlimited power of alienation produced what are known as the restraining
                    statutes in the reign of Elizabeth. The first of these, 1 Elizabeth c. 19,
                    applies only to bishops, and forbids alienations whereby an estate should pass
                    other than for the term of twenty-one years or three lives, with accustomed
                    yearly rent or more reserved.</p>
                <p>The 13 Elizabeth c. 10 extends this principle to other ecclesiastical persons and
                    to colleges. The alienation of college and church property is now permitted by
                    modern statutes, under the supervision of commissioners. The Municipal
                    Corporations Act, 1835, deals with the alienation of municipal property in a
                    similar spirit.</p>
                <p>As already indicated, the more important classes of corporations are now governed
                    by special statutes which ex elude or modify the operation of the common law
                    principles. The most considerable class of societies still unaffected by such
                    special legislation are the Livery Companies; for an account of which see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Companies.</hi> Under the same heading will be found an account
                    of the important enactments regulating joint-stock companies.</p>
                <p>The question to what extent the common law incidents of a corporation have been
                    interfered with by special legislation has become one of much importance,
                    especially under the Acts relating to joint-stock companies. The most important
                    case on this subject is that of Riche <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> The Ashbury
                    Railway Carriage Company before mentioned, in which, the judges of the Exchequer
                    Chamber being equally divided, the decision of the court below was affirmed. The
                    view taken by the affirming judges, viz., that the common law incidents of a
                    corporation adhere unless expressly removed by the legislature, may be
                    illustrated by a short extract from the judgment of Mr Justice Blackburn;—</p>
                <p>“If I thought it was at common law an incident to a corporation that its capacity
                    should be limited by the instrument creating it, I should agree that the
                    capacity of a company incorporated under the Act of 1862 was limited to the
                    object in the memorandum of association. But if I am right in the opinion which
                    I have already expressed, that the general power of contracting is an incident
                    to a corporation which it requires an indication of intention in the legislature
                    to take away, I see no such indication here. If the question was whether the
                    legislature had conferred on a corporation, created under this Act, capacity to
                    enter into contracts beyond the provisions of the deed, there could be only one
                    answer. The legislature did not confer such capacity. But if the question be, as
                    I apprehend it is, whether the legislature have indicated an intention to take
                    away the power of contracting which at common law would be incident to a body
                    corporate, and not merely to limit the authority of the managing body and the
                    majority of the shareholders to bind the minority, but also to prohibit and make
                    illegal contracts made by the body corporate, in such a manner that they would
                    be binding on the body, jf incorporated at common law I think the answer should
                    be the other way.”</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the House of Lords, agreeing with the three dissentient judges
                    in the Exchequer Chamber, pronounced the effect of the Companies Act to be the
                    opposite of that indicated by Mr Justice Blackburn. “It was the intention of the
                    legislature, not implied but actually expressed, that the corporations should
                    not enter, having regard to this memorandum of association, into a contract of
                    this description. The contract in my judgment could not have been ratified by
                    the unanimous assent of the whole corporation.” In such companies, therefore,
                    objects beyond the scope of the memorandum of association are <hi rend="italic"
                    >ultra vires</hi> of the corporation. The doctrine of <hi rend="italic">ultra
                    vires,</hi> as it is called, is almost wholly of modern and judicial creation.
                    Its first emphatic recognition of it appears to have been in the case of
                    companies created for special purposes with extraordinary powers, by Act of
                    Parliament, and, more particularly, railway companies. Tlιe funds of such
                    companies, it was held, must be applied to the purposes for which they were
                    created, and to no other. Whether this doctrine is applicable to the older or,
                    as they are sometimes called, ordinary corporations, appears to be doubtful. A
                    recent author (Brice on <hi rend="italic">Ultra Vires)</hi> writes :—</p>
                <p>“Take, as a strong instance, a university or a London guild. Either can
                    undoubtedly manage, invest, transform, and expend the corporate property in
                    almost any way it pleases, but if they proposed to exhaust the same on the
                    private pleasures of existing members, or to abandon the promotion, the one of
                    education, the <pb break="no"

                    probable, if not absolutely certain, that the Court of Chancery would restrain
                    the same, as being <hi rend="italic">ultra viresC</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Municipal Corporations.—</hi> The introduction of corporations into cities and
                    towns does not appear to date farther back than the reign of Henry VI, although
                    they had long possessed what may be called a quasi∙corporate character. By that
                    time the corporate character of ecclesiastical and educational societies and
                    even of guilds had been recognized, and the great convenience of corporate
                    powers was, no doubt, the reason why they were demanded by the commonalties of
                    towns. The inhabitants of Plymouth appear to have petitioned for a corporation
                    in 13 Henry IV., and the charter of Kingston-on-Hull in 18 Henry VI. is said to
                    be the first charter of municipal incorporation in England. The ultimate effect
                    of these charters was in general to reduce the boroughs into close corporations,
                    the members of which engrossed the municipal and political powers to the
                    exclusion of the general body of the inhabitants. The legal dependence of such
                    corporations on the charter of the king suggested the measures above referred to
                    by which the Crow n attempted to get the control of the corporations. The
                    reversal of the judgments obtained in the proceedings against corporations
                    formed one of the first acts of the people after the Revolution of 1688, and
                    thereafter corporations shared with private persons the advantages of freedom
                    from arbitrary interference on the part of the Crow n. Freedom from state
                    control, however, means in the case of corporations the growth of abuses. The
                    Corporations Act of the reign of Charles IL, one of the measures forced on the
                    king by the jealousy of his Parliament for the rights of the church, provided
                    that no person should be elected to office in any corporate town, who should not
                    within one year previously have taken the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper
                    according to the rites of the church, and this enactment, although after a time
                    suspended by temporary statutes, was not finally abolished till 9 Geo. IV. c.
                    17, -which substituted for the test a declaration not to injure or weaken the
                    Church of England. The important powers, municipal, political, and judicial,
                    possessed by town corporations, the large ascertained amount of property in
                    their hands, their exclusiveness, secrecy, and almost total freedom from
                    responsibility,—all these abuses were acquiesced in till the reform of the House
                    of Commons in 1832 enabled Parliament to turn its attention to the reform of
                    other public institutions. The royal commissioners appointed in 1834 reported
                    that “there prevails among the inhabitants of a great majority of the
                    incorporated towns a general and in our opinion a just dissatisfaction with the
                    municipal institutions—a distrust of the self-elected municipal councils, whose
                    powers are subject to no popular control, and whose acts and proceedings, being
                    secret, are not checked by the influence of public opinion; a distrust of the
                    municipal magistracy, tainting with suspicion the local administration of
                    justice; a discontent under the burthen of local taxation, while revenues are
                    diverted from their legitimate use.” The publication of this report was followed
                    by the Municipal Corporations Act, 5 and 6 Will. IV. c. 26, by which, in all the
                    boroughs named in the schedules to the Act, the laws, customs, charters,
                    theretofore in force, are repealed where inconsistent with the provisions of the
                    Act. Section 2 reserves all rights of property and beneficial exemptions to
                    freemen, their wives and children; but freedom is not in future to be acquired
                    by gift or purchase. The body corporate in such borough shall be called the
                    mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of such borough, and by that name shall have
                    perpetual succession, and shall be capable in law by the council hereinafter
                    mentioned to-do and suffer all things which now lawfully they and their
                    successors respectively may do and suffer by any name or title of incorporation.
                    It has been held that this Act does not create new corporations, although it
                    alters the name, title, and constitution of the governing body. All corporate
                    funds, after payment of debts, salaries, &lt;fcc., as specified in the Act, are
                    expressly appropriated to public purposes. Advowsons in the possession of the
                    body corporate are to be sold under the direction of the ecclesiastical
                    commissioners, and the proceeds invested in securities for the use of the
                    corporation. The general regulations of municipalities under this and subsequent
                    Acts no't affecting them in their character as corporations, belong to the
                    subject of Municipal Government.</p>
                <p>This beneficial Act was unfortunately limited in its operation. London and all
                    its corporations were left out, and the municipal government of the metropolis
                    is at this moment a medley of independent jurisdictions in striking contrast
                    with the orderly corporations of other large towns. And on the other hand, many
                    small boroughs were omitted in the original Act, which still exhibit in the
                    mismanagement of their property and powers the abuses against which that Act was
                    directed. In 1875 and 1876 resolutions on the subject were laid before the
                    Parliament, and from a return procured by Government, it appeared that the
                    number of unreformed corporations was 102. Many of these were places of some
                    importance, and in possession of considerable property. Government yielded to
                    the general feeling that inquiry was desirable, and a royal commission was
                    appointed to consider the subject. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. r.)</hi></p>
