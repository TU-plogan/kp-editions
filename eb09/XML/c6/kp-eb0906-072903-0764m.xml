                    commodities, and rank among the most ancient, as they continue to prevail as one
                    of the most common modes, in all countries, of levying revenue for public
                    purposes. In an insular country like the United Kingdom customs duties came in
                    process of time to be levied only or chiefly in the seaports, and thus applied
                    only to the foreign commerce, where they may be brought under the control of
                    fair and reasonable principles of taxation. But this simplification of customs
                    duties was only reached by degrees; and during a long period special customs
                    were levied on goods passing between England and Scotland; and the trade of
                    Ireland with Great Britain and with foreign countries was subjected to fiscal
                    regulations which could not now stand in the light of public reason. The taxes
                    levied, on warrant of some ancient grant or privilege, upon cattle or goods at a
                    bridge or a ferry or other point of passage from one county or province to
                    another, of which there are some lingering remains even in the United Kingdom,
                    and those levied at the gates of cities on the produce of the immediate country
                    —a not uncommon form of municipal taxation on the European continent—are all of
                    the nature of customs dues. It is from the universality of this practice that
                    our English term of “customs” appears to have been derived. In countries of
                    extensive land frontiers the system of taxation by duties on foreign commodities
                    becomes still more complicated. Custom-houses have to be established along the
                    land borders and at particular points on the rivers or the railways; and the
                    foreign and domestic tax-collectors are brought into immediate contact. Some
                    European Governments distinguish in their rates of duty between “dry” or land
                    ports and “wet” or sea ports; and others vary their dues on foreign commodities
                    according to the zones of the globe from which the commodities come. Nothing has
                    consequently been more perplexing to the merchant than customs duties. They are
                    a labyrinth through which he has had to steer with caution and circumspection;
                    while, atthe same time, it has offered to the more unscrupulous traders
                    temptations to fraud. The smuggling which proceeds under customs duties is only
                    to be checked by the most careful administration, by a system proceeding as far
                    as possible on the simplicity of generally recognized principles, and by duties
                    so moderate in amount as to reduce to a minimum the temptation of fraud.</p>
                <p>A customs duty on the <hi rend="italic">import</hi> of commodities has to be paid
                    by the domestic consumers of the commodities. The foreign producer will not sell
                    them at less than they cost, and the importing merchant will not bring them in
                    unless he obtain this cost, his own fair profit, and the import duty <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n765/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0765-0730"/> over and above these essential constituents of
                    the transaction. An import duty is thus in some cases a tax which consumers may
                    pay lightly or heavily as they choose, and has accordingly a flexibility that is
                    not unimportant in taxation. But if the commodity be one of domestic as well as
                    foreign supply, the effect of the customs duty is to raise the price of the
                    domestic supply in some proportion to the duty; and the consumer, in so far as
                    the commodity is one of necessity to him, has no choice. He has to pay the tax,
                    with the further dissatisfaction of knowing that it goes to no public purpose,
                    but only into the pockets of some of his own private neighbours. A customs duty
                    on the <hi rend="italic">export</hi> of commodities, on the other hand, has to
                    be paid by the foreign consumers, one of the most agreeable forms of taxation to
                    be conceived. But this desire of taxing foreigners for domestic revenue is met
                    by the competition of general commerce, and nations have to be chary of levying
                    duties on the export of the products of their own industry. It is only where
                    they have some special monopoly of the product that they can enter upon such a
                    course without the gravest disadvantage to themselves.</p>
                <p>Wherever the principle of free trade is recognized, these distinctions have to be
                    strictly observed; and in the past thirty years’ regime of free trade in the
                    United Kingdom, the whole system of customs duties, in its principles, its rates
                    of duty, and its administration, has undergone a complete revolution. Of many
                    hundreds of articles on which customs duty was levied in the seaports, only five
                    or six, of exclusively foreign origin, now remain to yield the customs revenue
                    of the kingdom. Yet this revenue has never declined. It is much larger than when
                    the whole elaborate system of customs duties was in force. The best literature
                    of this interesting subject, apart from the standard works of British, French,
                    and German economists, is to be found in the Budgets of the British Parliament
                    since 1842; in the Acts consolidating and reforming the custom-house
                    administration, particularly the Act of 1853 drawn by Mr Wilson, editor of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Economist,</hi> and then secretary of the treasury; in the
                    reports of the Hon. David Wells, late commissioner of revenue in the United
                    States; and in the annual reports of the British custom-house commissioners, in
                    which alone there is a magazine of the most valuable facts. Of recent years the
                    only controversy of the British public with the custom-house relates to what has
                    been deemed the too careless admission of adulterated or worthless commodities,
                    in respect to which there may have to be a further reform in the future. In the
                    case of commodities on which a duty is levied, aud must be paid before they pass
                    into consumption, there would seem to be a responsibility on the part of the
                    duty-levying power to ascertain that the commodity is what it is professed to
                    be.</p>
