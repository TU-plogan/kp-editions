                    >Marie-Anne-Charlotte</hi></label>, born in 1768, at St Saturnin near Séez in
                    Normandy, was descended from a noble family, and numbered among her ancestors
                    the dramatist Corneille. She was educated in a convent, and then sent to live
                    with an aunt at Caen. Here she saw hardly any one but her relative, and passed
                    her lonely hours in reading the works of the <hi rend="italic">philosophes,</hi>
                    especially Voltaire and the Abbé Raynal. Another of her favourite authors was
                    Plutarch, from whose pages she doubtless imbibed the idea of classic heroism and
                    civic virtue which prompted the act that has made her name famous. On the
                    outbreak of the Revolution she began to study current politics, chiefly through
                    the medium of the papers issued by the party afterwards known as the Girondins.
                    On the downfall of this party, on May 31, 1793, many of the leaders took refuge
                    in Normandy, and proposed to make Caen the headquarters of an army of
                    volunteers, at tho head of whom Wimpfenn, the commandant of Cherbourg, w as to
                    have marched upon Paris. Charlotte attended their meetings, and heard them
                    speak; but we have no reason to believe that she saw any of them privately, till
                    the day when she went to ask for introductions to friends of theirs in Paris.
                    She saw that their efforts in Normandy were doomed to fail. She had heard of
                    Marat as a tyrant and the chief agent in their overthrow, and she had conceived
                    the idea of going alone to Paris and assassinating him,—doubtless thinking that
                    this would break up the party of the Terrorists and be the signal of a
                    counter-revolution. Apparently she had thought of going to Paris in April,
                    before the fall of the Girondins, for she had then procured a passport which she
                    used in July. Jt contained the usual description of the bearer, and ran thus:
                    “Laissez passer la citoyenne Marie, &amp;c., Corday, agée de 24 ans, taille de 5
                    pieds 1 pouce, cheveux et sourcils châtains, yeux gris, front élevé, nez long,
                    bouche moyenne, menton rond fourchu, visage ovale.” Arrived in Paris she first
                    attended to some business for a friend at Caen, and then she wrote to Marat:
                    —“Citizen, I have just arrived from Caen. Your love for your native place
                    doubtless makes you desirous of learning the events which have occurred in that
                    part of the republic. I shall call at your residence in about an hour; have the
                    goodness to receive me, and to give me a brief interview. I will put you in a
                    condition to render great service to France.” On calling she was refused
                    admittance, and wrote again, promising to reveal important secrets, and
                    appealing to Marat’s sympathy on the ground that she herself was persecuted by
                    the enemies of the republic. She was again refused an audience, and it was only
                    when she called a third time (July 15) that Marat, hearing her voice in the
                    antechamber, consented to see her. He lay in a bathing tub, wrapped in towels,
                    for he was suffering from a horrible disease which had almost reduced him to a
                    state of putrefaction. Our only source of information as to what followed is
                    Charlotte’s own confession. She spoke to Marat of what was passing at Caen, and
                    his only comment on her narrative was that all the men she had mentioned should
                    be guillotined in a few days. As he spoke she drew from her bosom a dinner knife
                    (which she had bought the day before for two francs) and plunged it into his
                    left side. It pierced the lung and the aorta. He cried out, “<hi rend="italic">A
                    moi, ma</hi><hi rend="italic">chère amie!"</hi> and expired. Two women rushed
                    in, and prevented Charlotte from escaping. A crowd collected round the house,
                    and it was with difficulty that she was escorted to the prison of the Abbaye. On
                    being brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal she gloried in her act, and when
                    the indictment against her was read, and the president asked her what she had to
                    say in reply, her answer was, “Nothing, except that I have succeeded.” Her
                    advocate, Chaveau Lagarde, put forward the plea of insanity, but of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n418/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0418-0389"/> course he could not sustain it. She was sentenced
                    to death, and calmly thanked her counsel for his efforts on her behalf, adding,
                    however, that the only defence worthy of her was an avowal of the act. She was
                    then conducted to the Conciergerie, where at her own desire her portrait (now in
                    the museum of Versailles) was painted by the artist Hauer. She preserved her
                    perfect calmness to the last. There was a momentary shudder when she saw the
                    guillotine, but she recovered immediately, and placed herself in position under
                    the fatal blade without assistance from any one. The knife fell, and one of the
                    executioners held up her head by the hair, and had the brutality to strike it
                    with his fist. Many believed they saw the dead face blush,—probably an effect of
                    the red stormy sunset. It was the 17th of July 1793. It is difficult to analyze
                    the character of Charlotte Corday, we know so little of her; but there was in it
                    much that was noble and exalted. Her mind had been formed by her studies on a
                    pagan type. To Barbaroux and the Girondins of Caen she wrote from her prison,
                    anticipating happiness “with Brutus in the Elysian Fields” after her death, and
                    with this letter she sent a simple loving farewell to her father, revealing a
                    tender side to her character that otherwise we would hardly have looked for in
                    such a woman.</p>
                <p>Every writer on the Revolution has dwelt at more or less length on Charlotte
                    Corday. Many of the current versions of her life are very incorrect and even
                    absurd. Of biographies we may mention that of Couet de Gironville, published in
                    1796, that of Alphonse Esquiros which attempts a defence of Marat, and Adolphe
                    Huard's <hi rend="italic">Mémoires sur</hi><hi rend="italic">Charlotte
