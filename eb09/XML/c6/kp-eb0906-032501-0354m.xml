                    pursuant to a royal writ, whenever the Parliament of the realm is summoned, and
                    which is also continued or discharged, as the case may be, whenever the
                    Parliament is prorogued or dissolved. This assembly of the spirituality, which
                    is at present summoned only in pursuance of a writ from the Crown, differs in
                    its constitution and in the purport for which it is summoned from an ordinary
                    provincial council, such as the two metropolitan archbishops of England have
                    also been in the habit of summoning from time to time; for whereas the ordinary
                    provincial councils of the metropolitans have comprised only the bishops of
                    their respective provinces, with whom, however, the deans and the abbots and
                    other governing dignitaries of the church have been on occasions associated, the
                    Convocations of the two provinces have always comprised a definite number of
                    representatives of the clergy of the chapters and of the beneficed cbrgy of the
                    several dioceses. Further, whereas the purport of an ordinary provincial council
                    is to consult on matters which concern the faith or the peace of the church as a
                    religious body, the Convocations are called together to treat of matters which
                    concern the Crown, and the security and defence of the Church of England, and
                    the tranquillity, public good, and defence of the realm itself. All these
                    subjects are specified as probable matters for deliberation in the royal writs,
                    under which the archbishops are commanded to call together their respective
                    Convocations. These assemblies would thus appear to be integral parts of the
                    body politic of the realm of England; but when and how they originated, and when
                    and how they became so incorporated in it is not historically clear. This much
                    is known from authentic records, that the present constitution of the
                    Convocation of the prelates and clergy of the province of Canterbury was
                    recognized as early as in the eleventh year of the reign of Edward I. (1283) as
                    its normal constitution; and that in extorting that recognition from the Crown,
                    which the clergy accomplished by refusing to attend unless summoned in lawful
                    manner <hi rend="italic">(debito</hi><hi rend="italic">modo)</hi> through their
                    metropolitan, the clergy of the province of Canterbury taught the laity the
                    possibility of maintaining the freedom of the nation against the encroachments
                    of the royal power. It had been a provision of the Anglo-Saxon period, the
                    origin of which is generally referred to the Council of Cloveshoo (747), that
                    the possessions of the church should be exempt from taxation by the secular
                    power, and that it should be left to the benevolence of the clergy to grant such
                    subsidies to the Crown from the endowments of their churches as they should
                    agree to in their own assemblies. It may be inferred, however, from the language
                    of the various writs issued by the Crown for the collection of the “aids” voted
                    by the <hi rend="italic">Commune Concilium</hi> of the realm in the reign of
                    Henry III., that the clergy were unable to maintain the exemption of church
                    property from being taxed to those “aids” during that king’s reign; and it was
                    not until some years had elapsed of the reign of Edward I. that the spirituality
                    succeeded in vindicating their constitutional privilege of voting in their own
                    assemblies their free gifts or “benevolences,” and in insisting on the Crown
                    observing the lawful form of convoking those assemblies through the metropolitan
                    of each province.</p>
                <p>The form of the royal writ, which it is customary to issue in the present day to
                    the metropolitan of each province, is identical in its purport with the writ
                    issued by the Crown in 1283 to the metropolitan of the province of Canterbury,
                    after the clergy of that province had refused to meet at Northampton in the
                    previous year, because they had not been summoned in lawful manner; whilst the
                    mandates issued by the metropolitans in pursuance of the royal writs, and the
                    citations issued by the bishops in pursuance of the mandates of their respective
                    metropolitans, are identical in their purport and form with those used in
                    summoning the Convocation of 1283, which met at the New Temple in the city of
                    London, and voted a “benevolence” to the Crown, as having been convoked in
                    lawful manner. The existing constitution of the convocation of the province of
                    Canterbury—and the same observation will apply to that of the province of
                    York—in respect of its comprising representatives of the chapters and of the
                    beneficed clergy, in addition to the bishops and other dignitaries of the
                    church, would thus appear to be of even more ancient date than the existing
                    constitution of the Parliament of the realm; for the council of the realm, to
                    which representatives of the counties and of the boroughs were for the first
                    time summoned to the same place with the barons, to meet the king at Shrewsbury
                    in the same year (1283) in which the Convocation of the province of Canterbury
                    was summoned to the New Temple, differed in several important particulars from
                    the Parliament of the realm, as at present constituted, although it is sometimes
                    styled the Parliament of Shrewsbury, or of Acton Burnell. It was, in fact, an
                    extraordinary council, to which the prelates, who were a constituent part of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Commune Concilium</hi> of the realm, were not. summoned, its
                    object being to try David, the brother of Llewelyn, prince of Wales, who had
                    surrendered himself a prisoner, on a charge of high treason against the Crown of
                    England. The barons alone appear to have tried and condemned the prisoner, as
                    far as may be inferred from the language of the annalists, although the commons
                    may have been allowed a consultative voice. At all events the commons agreed
                    with the barons in voting an “aid” of a thirtieth to support the king’s
                    expedition into Wales, and the issuing of the ordinance known as the “Statutum
                    de Mercatoribus” concluded the business for which the council was summoned. The
                    settled constitution of Parliament as it exists in the present day was not
                    completed until 1295 (23 Edward I.), when the representatives of the commons
                    were summoned to the same place with the barons, and the clergy as a body were
                    also convened with the laity, under a novel clause known as the “praemunientes”
                    clause, which was inserted in the writs issued by the Crown directly to the
                    bishops.</p>
                <p>From this period down to the eleventh year of the reign of Edward III. there were
                    continual contests between the spirituality of the realm and the Crown,—the
                    spirituality contending for their constitutional right to vote their subsidies
                    in their provincial Convocations; the Crown, on the other hand, insisting on the
                    immediate attendance of the clergy in Parliament. The resistance of the clergy
                    to the innovation of the “praemunientes” clause had so far prevailed in the
                    reign of Edward II. that the Crown consented to summon the clergy to Parliament
                    through their metropolitans, and a special form of provincial writ was for that
                    purpose framed; but the clergy protested against this writ, and the struggle was
                    maintained between the spirituality and the Crown until 1337 (11 Edward III.),
                    when the Crown reverted to the ancient practice of commanding the metropolitans
                    to call together their clergy in their provincial assemblies, where their
                    subsidies were voted in the manner as accustomed before the “praemunientes”
                    clause was introduced. The “praemunientes” clause, however, was continued in the
                    Parliamentary writs issued to the several bishops of both provinces, whilst the
                    bishops were <pb break="no"

                    execution of the writs. It is a moot question, in which of the two Houses of
                    Parliament the representatives of the chapters and of the beneficed clergy sat,
                    when summoned to Parliament, and whether they had a deliberative vote, or only a
                    consultative voice. According to the “Modus tenendi Parliamentum” the proctors
                    of the clergy sat and voted in the Lower House of Parliament. ’ But the
                    authority of that treatise has been impugned by many writers, because the
                    introductory paragraph announces it to be a description of the manner of holding
                    a Parliament in the time of King Edward, the son of Ethelred, and of William the
                    Conqueror and his successors. The treatise itself, however, is not a mere
                    imposture, as Dr Hody has contended in his <hi rend="italic">History of English
                    Councils and Convocations.</hi> It is found in several MSS. of the 14th century,
                    and the Parliamentary writs and records of the reign of Edward II. warrant us in
                    regarding it as a treatise framed after the actual constitution of Parliament in
                    the reign of that king.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>
                    Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy, who edited this treatise for the Record Commissioners
                    in 1846, places it somewhere between 1294 and 1327.</p></note> This treatise
                    contains a chapter entitled “De Auxilio Regi,” in which it is explicitly stated
                    that the proctors of the clergy sat in the Lower House, and voted as members of
                    the Commons on all questions which required the consent of Parliament. " Ideo
                    oportet, quod omnia quae affirmari vel infirmari, concedi vel negari, vel fieri
                    debent per Parliamentum, per communitatem Parliamenti concedi debent, quae est
                    ex tribus gradibus sive generibus Parliamenti, scflicet ex procuratoribus cleri,
                    militibus comitatuum, civibus et burgensibus, qui repraesentant totam
                    communitatem; et non de magnatibus, quia quilibet eorum est pro sua propria
                    persona ad Parliamentum, et pro nulla alia.” This view is borne out by the
                    language of the petition of the Lower House itself in the Convocation of 1547 (1
                    Edward VI.), that “according to the ancient custom of this realm and the tenor
                    of the king’s writs for the summoning of the Parliament, which be now, and ever
                    have been, directed to the bishops of every diocese, the clergy of the Lower
                    House of Convocation may be adjoined and associated with the Lower House of
                    Parliament” (Cardwell’s <hi rend="italic">Synodalia,</hi> p. 421). The weight of
                    evidence would thus seem to be in favour of the view that the proctors of the
                    clergy, when summoned to Parliament under the “praemunientes” clause, sat and
                    voted in the Lower House of Parliament, which is not altogether irreconcilable
                    with the statement in Lord Coke’s Fourth Institute, that the proctors of the
                    clergy never had a voice in Parliament, “because they were no lords of
                    Parliament.” The reason alleged in this passage of the Fourth Institute is
                    clearly inadequate as regards the Lower House, inasmuch as the magnates were
                    excluded from it; but if the compiler of the Fourth Institute had in view the
                    Upper House he is justified in saying that the proctors of the clergy did not
                    vote in that House.</p>
                <p>It has been matter of controversy between divines’and lawyers, whether the
                    Convocations of the two provinces are properly to be regarded as high courts of
                    the spirituality of the realm of England, or as ecclesiastical councils of their
                    respective metropolitans. The divines prefer to regard them as provincial
                    councils, although perhaps in so doing they unconsciously depreciate them. It
                    may be admitted that there is nothing in the constitution of either Convocation
                    which is inconsistent with its being a provincial council <hi rend="italic">sui
                    generis,</hi> as the constituent elements of provincial councils vary
                    indefinitely according to the custom of different national churches,—for
                    instance the parochial clergy, whose presence by their representatives is a
                    remarkable feature of the Convocation of the two provinces, have been allowed to
                    appear by their representatives in more than one provincial council of the
                    ancient Gallican Church; but the Convocations of the province of Canterbury and
                    of York, as summoned in pursuance of a royal writ, are assuredly something more
                    than ecclesiastical councils of their respective metropolitans. There is the
                    high authority of Lord Coke for regarding the Convocations of the two provinces
                    as courts of the spirituality, and the Upper House of Convocation is by statute
                    (24 Henry VIII. ch. 12) constituted the high court of appeal in matters in which
                    the Crown is a party in any cause before an ecclesiastical court. Perhaps the
                    true solution of the controversy will be found in distinguishing' the Upper
                    House of Convocation from the Lower House, and just as the Upper House of
                    Parliament is the High Court of Parliament which exercises the judicial
                    functions of the Parliament, so the Upper House of Convocation is the High Court
                    of Convocation^ the Lower House having the right to make presentments to the
                    Upper House in like manner as the Lower House of Parliament has the right to
                    prefer impeachments before the Upper House of Parliament, but not to take part
                    in adjudicating upon them. There is, indeed, an instance on record of a kind of
                    cumulative vote of the Lower House of Convocation in 1640, when it added its
                    voice to that oi the Upper House in suspending a member of the Upper House (the
                    bishop of Gloucester) from his office and benefice; but this was rather a
                    question touching the privileges of the two Houses in a business which they
                    considered to have brought scandal on the proceedings of the Convocation, the
                    bishop of Gloucester having refused to conform himself to a resolution of both
                    Houses in a matter of subscription to certain new canons. This, however, is not
                    a precedent of a safe period. There is, indeed, another point of view from which
                    the Convocation appears to have all the attributes of a high court of the
                    metropolitan, inasmuch as the metropolitan, when he presides, or his commissary
                    in the absence of the metropolitan, has the coercive power of an ecclesiastical
                    judge in respect of the members of the Convocation: he directs absolutely the
                    course of business; he may pronounce the members contumacious and punish their
                    contumacy by suspension from office, or by sequestration of benefice, and at his
                    pleasure may remit the penalties, and upon submission absolve the offender. He
                    may further suspend the sittings of Convocation when he sees fit, and may
                    continue them to such times as he thinks proper; and a schedule, or written
                    sentence of continuation and prorogation at the termination of each session, is
                    signed by the archbishop or his commissary, in which he is described as
                    “judicially sitting.” A curious argument has been raised in modern times upon
                    the wording of certain ancient schedules in which it is recited that the
                    archbishop has continued and prorogued the Convocation to acertain day “cum
                    consensu confratrum suorum.” It has been contended that these recitals are not
                    consistent with the claim of the metropolitan to prorogue the Convocation at his
                    pleasure. But this argument is founded on a total misconception of the object of
                    these recitals, which was to save the legal right of the metropolitan to
                    pronounce the bishops and clergy contumacious, if they should not attend on the
                    day to which the Convocation was continued. Of strict right the members of
                    Convocation were not liable to be pronounced in contempt, unless they had been
                    cited in lawful manner to attend upon the archbishop on a given day; but if they
                    were consenting parties to the continuation of the sittings of the Convocation
                    to a future day, and their consent was recorded in the instrument of
                    continuation, which is read aloud before it is signed by the metropolitan, they
                    would thereby be perempted of all excuse for non-attendance on the plea that
                    they had not been duly cited. Such we conceive to be the true meaning of this
                    clause, which is rarely found in the older schedules, but occurs <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n356/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0356-0327"/> frequently in the schedules of the most turbulent
                    period of the history of Convocation, namely, during the reign of Queen Anne. It
                    was probably inserted in those schedules, <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">majori cautela,</hi> after an ancient precedent with which the
                    registrar of the Convocation was familiar. This much, however, is certain, that
                    the phrase does not occur in any schedule of prorogation, which is not also a
                    schedule of continuation of the sittings of Convocation to a further day.</p>
                <p>The history of the Convocation of the province of Canterbury, as at present
                    constituted, is full of stirring incidents, and it resolves itself readily into
                    five periods. The first period, by which is meant the first period which dates
                    from an epoch of authentic history, is the period of its greatest freedom, but
                    not of its greatest activity. It extends from the reign of Edward I. (1283) to
                    that of Henry VIII. The second period is the period of its greatest activity and
                    of its greatest usefulness, and it extends from the twenty-fifth year of the
                    reign of Henry VIII. to the reign of Charles II. The third period extends from
                    the fifteenth year of the reign of Charles II. (1664) to the reign of George I.
                    This was a .period of turbulent activity and little usefulness, and the anarchy
                    of the Lower House of Convocation during this period has created a strong
                    prejudice against the revival of Convocation in the mind of the laity. The
                    fourth period extends from the third year of the reign of George I. (1716) to
                    the fifteenth year of the reign of Queen Victoria. This was a period of torpid
                    inactivity, during which it was customary for Convocation to be summoned and to
                    meet <hi rend="italic">pro forma,</hi> and to be continued and prorogued
                    indefinitely. The fifth period may be considered to have commenced in the
                    fifteenth year of the reign of Queen Victoria (1852), and it would be premature
                    to pronounce an opinion upon its character. It has not hitherto had to pass
                    through any severe ordeal of political strife.</p>
                <p>During the first of the five periods above mentioned, it would appear from the
                    records preserved aí Lambeth and at York that the metropolitans frequently
                    convened congregations (so-called) of their clergy without the authority of a
                    royal writ, which were constituted precisely as the Convocations were
                    constituted, when the metropolitans were commanded to call their clergy together
                    pursuant to a writ from the Crown. As soon, however, as King Henry VIII. had
                    obtained from the clergy their acknowledgment of the supremacy of the Crown in
                    all ecclesiastical causes, he constrained the spirituality to declare, by what
                    has been termed the Act of Submission on behalf of the clergy, that the
                    Convocation “is, always has been, and ought to be summoned by authority of a
                    royal writ;” and this declaration was embodied in a statute of the realm (25
                    Henry VIII, c. 19), which further enacted that the Convocation “should
                    thenceforth make no provincial canons, constitutions, or ordinances without the
                    royal assent and licence.” The spirituality was thus more closely incorporated
                    than heretofore in the body politic of the realm, seeing that no deliberations
                    on its part can take place unless the Crown has previously granted its licence
                    for such deliberations. It had been already provided during this period by 8
                    Henry VI. c. 1, that the prelates and other clergy, with their servants and
                    attendants, when called to the Convocation pursuant to the king’s writ, should
                    enjoy the same liberty and defence in coming, tarrying, and returning as the
                    magnates and the commons of the realm enjoy when summoned to the king’s
                    Parliament.</p>
                <p>The second period, which dates from 1533 to 1664, has been distinguished by four
                    important assemblies of the spirituality of the realm in pursuance of a royal
                    writ—the two first of which occurred in the reign of Edward VI., the third in
                    the reign of Qαeen Elizabeth, and the fourth in the reign of Charles II. The two
                    earliest of these Convocations were summoned to complete the work of the
                    reformation of the Church of England, which had been commenced by Henry VIII.;
                    the third was called together to reconstruct that work, which had been marred on
                    the accession of Mary, the consort of Philip II. of Spain; whilst the fourth was
                    summoned to re-establish the Church of England, the framework of which had been
                    demolished during the great rebellion. On all of these occasions the
                    Convocations worked hand in hand with the Parliament of the realm under a
                    licence and with the assent of the Crown. Meanwhile the Convocation of 1603 had
                    framed a body of canons for the governance of the clergy. Another Convocation
                    requires a passing notice, in which certain canons were drawn up in 1640, but by
                    reason of an irregularity in the proceedings of this Convocation (chiefly, on
                    the ground that its sessions were continued for some time after the Parliament
                    of the realm had been dissolved), its canons are not held to have any binding
                    obligation on the clergy. The Convocations had up to this time maintained their
                    liberty of voting the subsidies of the clergy in the form of “benevolences,”
                    separate and apart from the “aids” granted by the laity in Parliament, and one
                    of the objections taken to the proceedings of the Convocation of 1640 was that
                    it had continued to sit and to vote its subsidies to the Crown after the
                    Parliament itself had been dissolved. It is not, therefore, surprising on the
                    restoration cf the monarchy in 1661 that the spirituality was not anxious to
                    retain the liberty of taxing itself apart from the laity, seeing that its
                    ancient liberty was likely to prove of questionable advantage to it. It voted,
                    however, a benevolence to the Crown on the occasion of its first assembling in
                    1661 after the restoration of King Charles 11., and it continued so to do until
                    1664, when an arrangement was madebetween Archbishop Sheldon and Lord Chancellor
                    Hyde, under which the spirituality silently waived its long asserted right of
                    voting its own subsidies to the Crown, and submitted itself thenceforth to be
                    assessed to the “aids” directly granted to the Crown by Parliament. An Act was
                    accordingly passed by the Parliament in the following year (16 and 17 Car. II.
                    c. 1), entitled An Act to grant a Royal Aid unto the King’s Majesty, to which
                    aid the clergy were assessed by the commissioners named in the statute without
                    any objec-being raised on their part or behalf,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> It had always been the practice, when the
                    clergy voted their subsidies in their Convocation, for Parliament to authorize
                    the collection of each subsidy by the same commissioners who collected the
                    Parliamentary aid.</p></note> there being a proviso that in so contributing the
                    clergy should be relieved of the liability to pay two subsidies out of four,
                    which had been voted by them in the Convocation of a previous year. There was
                    also a further proviso inserted in the same Act, that “nothing therein contained
                    shall be drawn into example to the prejudice of the ancient rights belonging to
                    the lords spiritual and temporal, or clergy of this realm, &lt;fcc.,” which Mr
                    Hallam considers to be a saving of the rights of the clergy to tax themselves,
                    if they think fit <hi rend="italic">(Constitutional History,</hi> ed. 1842, ii.
                    p. 395). But the spirituality has never reasserted its ancient liberty of
                    selftaxation. In consequence of this practical renunciation of their separate
                    <hi rend="italic">status,</hi> as regards their liability to taxation, the
                    clergy have assumed and enjoyed in common with the laity the right of voting at
                    the election of members of the House of Commons, in virtue of their
                    ecclesiastical freeholds, and thi⅛ right has been recognized by subsequent
                    statutes, such for instance as 10 Anne c. 23, and 18 George II. c. 18. According
                    to a note of Speaker Onslow’s, appended to Burnet’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    his Own Times</hi> (Oxford ed. vol. iv. p. 308), the matter was first settled by
                    a private agreement between Sheldon and Clarendon, and tacitly assented to by
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n357/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0357-0328"/> the clergy. Onslow says, “Gibson, bishop of
                    London, said to me that it was the greatest alteration in the constitution ever
                    made without an express law.”</p>
                <p>The most important and the last work of the Convocation during this second period
                    of its activity was the revision of the Book of Common Prayer, which was
                    completed in the latter part of 1661. The revised book, after it had been
                    sanctioned by the Convocation of the province of York, was presented to the
                    Crown for its approval. The Crown having approved the book, sent it forthwith to
                    the Upper House of Parliament, with a recommendation that the book, as reviewed
                    by the Convocation, should be appointed by an Act of Uniformity; and accordingly
                    the two Houses of Parliament after a conference accepted the revised book, and
                    enacted that it should be the book which should be appointed to be used in all
                    places of public worship in the realm. It was believed for some considerable
                    time that the original book which had been attached to the Act of Uniformity on
                    this occasion had been lost from the archives of the House of Lords. It was,
                    indeed, missing for some time, but in consequence of a more careful search
                    having been instituted in 1870 by Dr A. P. Stanley, the dean of Westminster, the
                    original book has been discovered detached from the Act of Uniformity in the
                    library of the House of Lords, and a fac-simile of the book with the MS.
                    revision was made under the authority of the lords of the treasury for the use
                    of the royal commissioners on ritual in 1871.</p>
                <p>The Revolution in 1688 is the most important epoch in the third period of the
                    history of the synodical proceedings of the spirituality, when the Convocation
                    of Canterbury, having met in 1689 in pursuance of a royal writ, obtained a
                    licence under the great seal, to prepare certain alterations in the liturgy and
                    in the canons, and to deliberate on the reformation of the ecclesiastical
                    courts. A feeling, however, of panic seems to ha ze come over the Lower House,
                    which took up a position of violent antagonism to the Upper House. This
                    circumstance led to the prorogation of the Convocation and to its subsequent
                    discharge without any practical fruit resulting from the king’s licence. Ten
                    years elapsed during which the Convocation was prorogued from time to time
                    without any meeting of its members for business being allowed. The next
                    Convocation which was permitted to meed for business, in 1700, was marked by
                    great turbulence and insubordination on the part of the members of the Lower
                    House, who refused to recognize the authority of the archbishop to prorogue
                    their sessions. This controversy was kept up until the discharge of the
                    Convocation took place concurrently with the dissolution of the Parliament in
                    the autumn of that year. The proceedings of the Lower House in this Convocation
                    were disfigured by excesses which were clearly violations of the constitutional
                    order of the Convocation. The Lower House refused to take notice of the
                    archbishop’s schedule of prorogation, and adjourned itself by its own authority,
                    and upon the demise of the Crown it disputed the fact of its sessions having
                    expired, and as Parliament was to continue for a short time, prayed that its
                    sessions might be continued as a part of the Parliament under the
                    “praemunientes” clause. The next Convocation was summoned in the first year of
                    Queen Anne, when the Lower House, under the leadership of Dean Aldrich, its
                    prolocutor, challenged the right of the archbishop to prorogue it, and presented
                    a petition to the queen, praying Her Majesty to call the question into her own
                    presence. The question was thereupon examined by the Queen’s Council, when the
                    right of the president to prorogue both Houses of Convocation by a schedule of
                    prorogation was held to be proved, and further, that it could not be altered
                    except by an Act of Parliament. This decision of the Queen’s Council is of great
                    importance in its bearing upon the constitution of the Convocation as a part of
                    the body politic of the realm, and is in striking contrast to a legal opinion
                    which was circulated in print in 1855 with the names of two eminent lawyers
                    subscribed to it, to the effect that the Convocation has the power of altering
                    its own constitution, provided only that it has the licence of thg Crown to make
                    a canon to that effect, and such canon is subsequently approved by the Crown.
                    During the remaining years of the reign of Queen Anne the two Houses of
                    Convocation were engaged either in internecine strife, or in censuring sermons
                    or books, as teaching latitudinarian or heretical doctrines; and, when it had
                    been assembled concurrently with Parliament on the accession of King George 1.,
                    a great breach was before long created between the two Houses by the Bangorian
                    controversy. Dr Hoadly, bishop of Bangor, having preached a sermon before the
                    king, in the Royal Chapel at St James’s Palace in 1717, against the principles
                    and practice of the non-jurors, which had been printed by the king’s command,
                    the Lower House, which was offended by the sermon and had also been offended by
                    a treatise on the same subject published by Dr Hoadly in the previous year, lost
                    no time in representing the sermon to the Upper House, and in calling for its
                    condemnation. A controversy thereupon arose between the two Houses which was
                    kept up with untiring energy by the Lower House, until the Convocation was
                    prorogued in 1717 in pursuance of a royal writ; from which time until 1861 no
                    licence from the Crown has been granted to Convocation to proceed to business.
                    During this period, which may be regarded as the fourth distinguishing period in
                    the history of the Convocations of the Church of England, it was usual for a few
                    members of the Convocation to meet when first summoned with every new
                    Parliament, in pursuance of the royal writ, for the Lower House to elect a
                    prolocutor, and for both Houses to vote an address to the Crown, after which the
                    Convocation was prorogued from time to time, pursuant to royal writs, and
                    ultimately discharged when the Parliament was dissolved. There were, however,
                    several occasions between 1717 and 1741 when the Convocation of the province of
                    Canterbury transacted certain matters, by way of consultation, which did not
                    require any licence from the Crown, aud there was a short period in its session
                    of 1741 when there was a probability of its being allowed to resume its
                    deliberative functions, as the Lower House had consented to obey the president’s
                    schedule of prorogation; but the Lower House having declined to receive a
                    communication from the Upper House, the Convocation was forthwith prorogued,
                    from which time until the middle of the present century the Convocation was not
                    permitted by the Crown to enjoy any opportunity even for consultation. The
                    spirituality at last aroused itself from its long repose in 1852, and on this
                    occasion the Upper House took the lead. The active spirit of the movement was
                    Samuel, bishop of Oxford, but the master mind was Henry, bishop of Exeter. On
                    the Convocation assembling several petitions were presented to both Houses,
                    praying them to take steps to procure from the Crown the necessary licence for
                    their meeting for the despatch of business, and an address to the Upper House
                    was brought up from the Lower House, calling the attention of the Upper House to
                    the reasonableness of the prayer of the various petitions. After some discussion
                    the Upper House, influenced mainly by the argument of Henry, bishop of Exeter,
                    consented to receive the address of the Lower House, and the Convocation was
                    thereupon prorogued, shortly after which it was discharged concurrently with the
                    dissolution of Parliament. On the assembling of the next Convocation of the
                    province of Canterbury, no royal writ of exoneration having been sent by the
                    Crown to the metropolitan, the sessions of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n358/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0358-0329"/> Convocation were continued for several days; and
                    from this time forth Convocation may be considered to have resumed its action as
                    a consultative body, whilst it has also been permitted on more than one occasion
                    to exercise its functions as a deliberative body. Its first action as a
                    deliberative body commenced in 1861, in pursuance of a licence from the Crown
                    granted to it upon its prayer, to amend the twentyninth of the canons of 1603 on
                    the subject of sponsors at baptism. Its deliberations, however, on this subject
                    have not yet been brought to a final conclusion. Both Houses came to an
                    agreement as to the form of a canon to be substituted in place of the existing
                    canon, and the Convocation of the province of York having consented to the
                    amended canon, it was submitted to the Crown for its approval pursuant to the
                    terms of the royal licence, under which the new canon could only acquire the
                    validity of law by its confirmation under letters patent of the Crown. On this
                    occasion, however, the new canon appeared to Her Majesty’s Government to exceed
                    in its terms the royal licence, and to be likely to cause greater perplexity to
                    the clergy than the existing canon. It was accordingly sent back to the
                    Convocation in 1865 for further amendment. The Upper House thereupon made a
                    further amendment in the proposed form of canon, and sent it down to the Lower
                    House for its concurrence, but the Lower House, in the Convocation of 1867,
                    resolved to defer the consideration of the further amendment of the canon, until
                    a committee, which has been appointed to consider the whole body of the canons
                    of 1603 shall have made its report. This is a proceeding which cannot be
                    considered of good augury to the Convocation as a deliberative body, seeing that
                    the licence of the Crown to amend the particular canon was granted to
                    Convocation at its own request. The proceedings of the Convocation on the second
                    occasion have been of more favourable augury. A royal licence was granted to the
                    Convocation of 1865 in response to an address on its part to the Crown,
                    authorizing it to make a new canon in the place of the thirty-sixth, and to
                    amend the thirtyseventh and the thirty-eighth canons so as to be in harmony with
                    the new canon, and also to amend the fortieth canon; and certain alterations and
                    amendments in those canons having been accordingly made by the Convocation of
                    the province of Canterbury, and agreed to by the Convocation of the province of
                    York under a similar licence from the Crown, the royal assent was given to the
                    amended canons in the Convocation of 1866. On this occasion the Convocations
                    acted with becoming promptness and decision, as there was a pressing emergency
                    for their co-operation with the Parliament in relieving the clergy from certain
                    subscriptions and oaths, and in altering the forms of declarations to be made by
                    them on their admission to office or benefice (28 and 29 Vict. c. 122.) With
                    regard to the twenty-ninth canon there was no corresponding emergency, and it
                    may be said of it, as of other canons which have been abrogated by custom—“ubi
                    consuetudo loquitur, lex manet sopita.” It appears, however, that the report of
                    the committee of the Lower House on the subject of an amended code of canons
                    ecclesiastical was laid on the table of the Upper House in the session of 1874,
                    but no further action has been taken upon it.</p>
                <p>The order of convening the Convocation of the province of Canterbury is as
                    follows. <hi rend="italic">A</hi> writ issues from the Crown, addressed to the
                    metropolitan archbishop of Canterbury, commanding him “by reason of certain
                    difficult and urgent affairs concerning us, the security and defence of our
                    Church of England, and the peace and tranquillity, public good, and defence of
                    our kingdom, and our subjects of the same, to call together with all convenient
                    speed, and in lawful manner, the several bishops of the province of Canterbury,
                    and deans of the cathedral churches, and also the archdeacons, chapters, and
                    colleges, and the whole clergy of every diocese of the said province, to appear
                    before the said metropolitan in the cathedral church of St Paul. London, on a
                    certain day, or elsewhere, as shall seem most expedient, to treat of, agree to,
                    and conclude upon the premises and other things, which to them shall then at the
                    same place be more clearly explained on our behalf.” In case the metropolitical
                    see of Canterbury should be vaeant, the writ of the Crown is addressed to the
                    dean and chapter of the metropolitical church of Canterbury in similar terms, as
                    being the guardians of the spiritualities of the see during a vacancy. Thereupon
                    the metropolitan, or as the case may be, the dean and chapter of the
                    metropolitical church, issue a mandate to the bishop of London, as dean of the
                    province, and if the bishopric of London should be vacant, then to the bishop of
                    Winchester as subdean, which embodies the royal writ, and directs the bishop to
                    cause all the bishops of the province to be cited, and through them the deans of
                    the cathedral and collegiate churches, and the archdeacons and other dignitaries
                    of churches, and each chapter by one, and the clergy of each diocese by two
                    sufficient proctors, to appear before the metropolitan or his commissary, or, as
                    the case may be, before the dean and chapter of the metropolitical church or
                    their commissary, in the chapter-house of the cathedral church of St Paul,
                    London, if that place be named in the mandate, or elsewhere, with continuation
                    and prorogation of days next following, if that should be necessary, to treat
                    upon arduous and weighty affairs, which shall conceιn the state and welfare,
                    public good, and defence of this kingdom and the subjects thereof, to be then
                    and there seriously laid before them, and to give theiι good counsel and
                    assistance on the said affairs, and to consent to such things as shall happen to
                    be wholesomely ordered and appointed by their common advisement, for the honour
                    of God and the good of the church.</p>
                <p>The provincial dean, or the subdean, as the case may be, thereupon issues a
                    citation to the several bishops of the province, which embodies the mandate of
                    the metropolitan or of the dean and chapter of the metropolitical church, as the
                    case may be, and admonishes them to appear, and to cite and admonish their
                    clergy, as specified in the metropolitical mandate, to appear at the time and
                    place mentioned in the mandate. The bishops thereupon either summon directly the
                    clergy of their respective dioceses to appear before them or their commissaries
                    to elect two proctors, or they send a citation to their archdeacons, according
                    to the custom of the diocese, directing them to summon the clergy of their
                    respective archdeaconries to elect a proctor. The practice of each diocese in
                    this matter is the law of the Convocation, and the practice varies indefinitely
                    as regards the election of proctors to represent the beneficed clergy. As
                    regards the deans, the bishops send special writs to them to appear in person,
                    and to cause their chapters to appear severally by one proctor. Writs also go to
                    every archdeacon, and on the day named in the royal writ, which is always the
                    day next following that named in the writ to summon the Parliament, the
                    Convocation assembles in the place named in the archbishop’s mandate. Thereupon,
                    after the Litany has been sung or said, and a Latin sermon preached by a
                    preacher appointed by the metropolitan, the clergy are praeconized or summoned
                    by name to appear before the metropolitan or his commissary; after which the
                    clergy of the Lower House are directed to withdraw and elect a prolocutor, to be
                    presented to the metropolitan for his approbation. The Convocation thus
                    constituted resolves itself at its next meeting into two Houses, and it is in a
                    fit state to proceed to business. The regular forms of proceeding have been
                    carefully kept up in the Convocation of the province of Canterbury, which
                    consists of 20 bishops, exclusive of the metropolitan, 24 deans, 56 archdeacons,
                    23 proctors for the chapter clergy, and 42 proctors for the beneficed
                    clergy.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the proceedings of the Convocation of the province of York
                    have been less regular, and no prolocutor of the Lower House of the Convocation
                    appears to have been appointed since 1661, until the recent resuscitation of the
                    Convocation as a consultative body. Its constitution differs slightly from that
                    of the Convocation of the province of Canterbury, as each archdeaconry is
                    represented by two proctors, precisely as in Parliament formerly under the
                    Praemunientes clause. It consists of 6 bishops, including the bishop of Sodor
                    and Man and exclusive of the metropolitan, 6 deans, 15 archdeacons, 6 proctors
                    of the chapter clergy, and 30 proctors for the beneficed clergy. There are some
                    anomalies in the diocesan returns of the two Convocations, but in all such
                    matters the <hi rend="italic">consuetudo</hi> of the diocese is the governing
                    rule.</p>
