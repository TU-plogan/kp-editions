                    (1650-1726), a learned English nonjuring divine, born at Stow-cum-Quy,
                    Cambridgeshire, in 1650, and was educated at Caius College, Cambridge. His first
                    appointment was to the small rectory of Ampton, near Bury St Edmunds, which,
                    after six years, he resigned in order to proceed to London, where in 1685 he was
                    made lecturer of Gray’s Inn. The change of Government at the Revolution,
                    however, soon rendered the public exercise of his function impracticable. He was
                    committed to Newgate for writing in favour of the dethroned monarch, and again
                    on a charge of carrying on a treasonable correspondence with the enemies of the
                    popular movement; but he was released on both occasions without trial, by the
                    intervention of his friends. So far did he carry his scruples at this period,
                    that he submitted to confinement rather than make a tacit acknowledgment of the
                    jurisdiction of the court by accepting his liberty upon bail. In the two
                    following years he continued to harass the Government by his publications; but
                    for his boldness in granting absolution at their execution to Sir John Friend
                    and Sir William Perkins, who had attempted the assassination of William, he was
                    obliged to flee, and for the rest of his life continued under sentence of
                    outlawry. When the storm had blown over he returned to London, and employed his
                    leisure in literary works, which were less political in their tone. In 1697
                    appeared the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Essays on Several Moral
                    Subjects,</hi> to which a second was added in 1705, and a third in 1709. All
                    three series enjoyed great popularity at the time of their appearance. It was in
                    1798, however, that Collier produced the book by which he is best known, and for
                    which he has been most justly praised, the famous <hi rend="italic">Short View
                    of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage.</hi> Its publication
                    involved him in a lengthened controversy with Congreve, Vanbrugh, and the other
                    wits of the day. The book abounds in hypercriticism and in useless display of
                    learning, neither intrinsically valuable nor conducive to the argument. Yet, in
                    the words of Macaulay, who gives an admirable account of the discussion in bis
                    essay on the Comic Dramatists of the Restoration, “when all deductions have been
                    made, great merit must be allowed to the work. There is hardly any book of that
                    time from which it would be possible to select specimens of writing so excellent
                    and so various.” The <hi rend="italic">Short View</hi> was followed by a <hi
                    rend="italic">Defence,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Second Defence,</hi> and a <hi
                    rend="italic">Farther Vindication,</hi> and in 1703 by <hi rend="italic">Mr
                    Collier's Dissuasive from the Playhouse, in a Letter to a Person of
                    Quality.</hi> The fight lasted in all some ten years; but Collier had right on
                    his side, and triumphed; and the reformation of the English stage, so greatly
                    needed, may be said to date from the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Short
                    View.</hi> From 1701 to 1721 Collier was employed in the translation and
                    publication (in six volumes folio) of Moreri’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire
                    Historique,</hi> and in the compilation and issue of the two volumes folio of
                    his own <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain.</hi> The
                    latter work was attacked by Burnet and others, but the author showed himself as
                    keen a controversialist as ever. Many attempts were made to shake his fidelity
                    to the lost cause of the Stuarts, but he continued indomitable to the end. His
                    last work was a volume of <hi rend="italic">Practical Discourses,</hi> published
                    in 1725. He died April 26, 1726.</p>
