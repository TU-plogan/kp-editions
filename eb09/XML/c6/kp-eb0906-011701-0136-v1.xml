                <p><label type="entry">COIMBRA</label>, a city of Portugal, capital of the province
                    of Beira, on the north bank of the Mondego, 115 miles N.N.E. of Lisbon, in 40°
                    14' N. lat. and 8° 24' W. long. It is built for the most part on rising ground,
                    and presents from the other side of the river a picturesque and imposing
                    appearance; though in reality its houses have individually but little
                    pretension, and its streets are, almost without exception, narrow and mean. It
                    derives its present importance from being the seat of the only university in the
                    kingdom,—an institution which was originally established at Lisbon in 1291, was
                    transferred to Coimbra in 1306, was again removed to Lisbon, and was finally
                    fixed at Coimbra in 1527. There are five faculties,—theology, law, medicine,
                    mathematics, and philosophy, with fifty-two professors and twenty-one
                    substitutes; and in 1874-5 the number of students was 667, of whom 15 came from
                    the Azores and 11 from Brazil. The library contains 80,000 volumes, and the
                    museums and laboratories are on an extensive scale. In connection with the
                    medical faculty there are regular hospitals; the mathematical faculty maintains
                    an observatory from which an excellent view can be obtained of the whole valley
                    of the Mondego; and outside of the town there is a botanic garden (especially
                    rich in the flora of Brazil), which also serves as a public promenade. Among the
                    other educational establishments are a military college, a royal college of
                    arts, and an episcopal seminary. The city is the seat of a bishop, suffragan to
                    the archbishop of Braga; and it possesses two cathedrals, eight parish churches,
                    and several conventual buildings. The new cathedral is of little interest; but
                    the old is a fine specimen of the Romanesque style, and retains portions of the
                    mosque which it replaced. The principal churches are Santa Cruz, of the 16th
                    century, and San Salvador, founded by Esterão Martinez in 1169. On the bank of
                    the Mondego stand the ruins of the once splendid monastery of Santa Clara,
                    established by Don Mor Dias in 1286; and on the other side of the river, crossed
                    by a fine bridge of several arches, is the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Quinta
                        das lagrimas,</hi> or Villa of Tears, where Inez de Castro is believed to
                    have been murdered. The town is supplied with water by means of an aqueduct of
                    20 arches. The trade is purely local, as the river is navigable only in flood,
                    and the port of Figueira is 20 miles distant; but there are manufactures of
                    pottery, linen, cloth, and articles of horn; and a three days’ market is held
                    yearly in front of the Clara monastery. The country to the south is the most
                    fertile and salubrious in Portugal, and the neighbourhood is accordingly thickly
                    studded with farm-houses and villas. The population of the city in 1864 was
                    18,147.</p>
                <p>Coimbra is identified with the ancient <hi rend="italic">Conembτica,</hi> the
                    site of which, however, seems to have been a little to the south. The city was
                    for a long time a Moorish stronghold, but in 1064 it was captured by Ferdinand
                    the Great and the Cid. Previous to the 16th century it was the capital of the
                    country, and no fewer than seven kings—Sancho I. and II., Alphonso I., II., and
                    III., Pedro, and Ferdinand—were born within its walls. In 1755 it suffered
                    considerably from the earthquake. In 1810 a division of the French army, under
                    Massena, were made prisoners by the English in tli£ neighbourhood. In 1834 Don
                    Miguel made the city his headquarters; and in 1846 it was the scene of a
                    Miguelist insurrection.</p>
