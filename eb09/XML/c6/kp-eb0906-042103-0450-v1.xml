                <p><label type="entry">CORNELIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Peter von</hi></label>, the
                    leader of the German art revival, was born in Düsseldorf in 1784, and died in
                    Berlin, March 6, 1867.</p>
                <p>Cornelius, like other great painters, is reported to have manifested his artistic
                    talent at a very early age. His father, who was inspector of the Düsseldorf
                    Gallery, dying whilst the painter was yet a boy, the young Cornelius was stiιη
                        <hi rend="subscript"> k</hi> ulated to extraordinary exertions. The reasons
                    for this he has himself pathetically expressed in a letter to the Count
                    Raczynski. “I was in my sixteenth year,” he writes, “when I lost my father, and
                    it fell to the lot of an elder brother and myself to watch over the interests of
                    a numerous family. It was at this time that it was attempted to persuade my
                    mother that it would be better for me to devote myself to the trade of a
                    goldsmith than to continue to pursue painting—in the first place, in consequence
                    of the time necessary to qualify me for the art, and in the next, because there
                    were already so many painters. My dear mother, however, rejected all this
                    advice, and I felt myself impelled onward by an uncontrollable enthusiasm, to
                    which the confidence of my mother gave new strength, which was supported by the
                    continual fear that I should be removed from the study of that art I loved so
                    much.”</p>
                <p>His earliest work of importance was the decoration of the choir of St Quirinus
                    Church at Neuss. At the age of twenty-six he produced his designs from <hi
                        rend="italic">Faust.</hi> On October 14, 1811, he arrived in Rome, were he
                    soon became one of the most promising of that brotherhood of young German
                    painters which included Overbeck, Schadow, Veit, Schnorr, Pforr, Vogel, and
                    Wächter,—a member of a fraternity (some of whom selected a ruinous convent for
                    their home) who were banded together for resolute study and mutual criticism.
                    Out of this association came the men who, though they were ridiculed at the
                    time, were destined to found a new German school of art.</p>
                <p>At Rome Cornelius participated, <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> with other members
                    of his fraternity, in the decoration of the Casa Bartoldi and the Villa Massimi,
                    and while thus employed he was also engaged upon designs for the Nibelungenlied.
                    From Rome he was called to Düsseldorf to remodel the Academy, <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0451-0422"/> and to Munich by the then crown-prince of
                    Bavaria, after wards Louis I., to take the direction of those decorations which
                    his royal highness had projected for the Glyptothek. Cornelius, however, soon
                    found that attention to such widely separated duties was incompatible with the
                    just performance of either, and most inconvenient to himself; eventually,
                    therefore, he resigned his post at Düsseldorf to throw himself completely and
                    thoroughly into those works for which he had been commissioned by the
                    crown-prince. He therefore left Düsseldorf for Munich, where he was joined by
                    those of his pupils who elected to follow and to assist him. At the death of
                    Director Langer, 1824-25, he became director of the Munich Academy.</p>
                <p>The fresco decorations of the Ludwigskirche, which were for the most part
                    designed and executed by Cornelius, are perhaps the most important mural works
                    of modern times. The large fresco of the Last Judgment, over the high altar in
                    that church, measures 62 feet in height by 38 feet in width. The frescoes of the
                    Creator, the Nativity, and the Crucifixion in the same building are also upon a
                    large scale.</p>
                <p>Amongst his other great works in Munich may be included his decorations in the
                    Pinakothek and in the Glyptothek; those in the latter building, in the hall of
                    the gods and the hall of the hero-myths, are perhaps the best known. About the
                    year 1839-40 he left Munich for Berlin to proceed with that series of cartoons,
                    from the Apocalypse, for the frescoes for which he had been commissioned by
                    Frederick William IV., and which were intended to decorate the Campo Santo, or
                    Royal Mausoleum, forming one of the wings of the new cathedral. These were his
                    final works.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to convey to the English reader any adequate notion of the
                    important position which this great designer and master spirit held in
                    contemporary art; for Cornelius, as an oil painter, possessed but little
                    technical skill, nor do his works exhibit any instinctive appreciation of
                    colour. Even as a fresco painter his manipulative power was not great. And in
                    critically examining the execution in colour of some of his magnificent designs,
                    one cannot help feeling that he was, in this respect, unable to do them full
                    justice. This criticism will even hold after making due allowance, in works of a
                    high intellectual aim, for the claims of form over those of colour. Cornelius
                    and his associates formed their styles on the study of the great Italian
                    masters, or rather, we should say, endeavoured to follow in their own works the
                    spirit of the Italian painters. But as in family descent so in the works of
                    genius we may sometimes detect the indications of several distinct formative
                    influences. Thus in Cornelius the Italian strain is to a considerable extent
                    modified by the Dürer heritage. This is true not only of Cornelius but of all
                    the original members of the Munich school of thirty years since. This Dürer
                    influence is manifest in a tendency to overcrowding in composition, in a degree
                    of attenuation in the proportions of and a poverty of contour in the nude
                    figure, and also in a leaning to the selection of Gothic forms for draperies.
                    These peculiarities are even noticeable in Cornelius’s principal work of the
                    Last Judgment, in the Ludwigskirche in Munich. The attenuation and want of
                    flexibility of contour in the nude are perhaps most conspicuous in his frescoes
                    of classical subjects in the Glyptothek, especially in that representing the
                    contention for the body of Patroclus. But notwithstanding these peculiarities
                    there is always in his works a grandeur and nobleness of conception, as all must
                    acknowledge who have inspected his designs for the Ludwigskirche, for the Campo
                    Santo, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The difficulty which many have of understanding how a painter of such
                    comparatively slight technical skill could materially influence the art of his
                    age lies in their want of ability to estimate the value of a dominant or leading
                    mind. They are alive only to those practical matters which come within the
                    compass of their own understandings. Yet that mental calibre, that grasp of
                    thought, that knowledge of principles, and that power of directing other men
                    which Cornelius possessed, are the very qualities which are of the greatest
                    value, since for one man who possesses them, there are thousands who have the
                    capacity either for acquiring technical skill, for observing facts, or for
                    administrative routine. Cornelius was a man of that far rarer order of regal
                    minds who transform wastes into kingdoms. If he were not dexterous in the
                    handling of the brush, he could conceive and design a subject with masterly
                    purpose. If he had an imperfect eye for colour, in the Venetian, the Flemish, or
                    the English sense, he had vast mental foresight, and could direst the German
                    school of painting into those paths which promise to make it, at no distant
                    date, the first on the continent of Europe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p> There were, of course, other distinguished artists
                            besides Cornelius who contributed to the success and the glory of the
                            German art revival —notably Overbeck, who was his fast ally in that
                            art-loving fraternity of his early manhood, Schnorr von Carolsfeld,
                            Heinrich Hess, Wilhelm von Kaulbach, Veit, Scbadow, <hi rend="italic"
                                >c.</hi>; also those scholars who assisted in the execution of the
                            great mural works in Munich and elsewhere, some of whom themselves
                            became eminent, whilst others esteemed it a sufficient privilege to be
                            permitted to help in the great and national work.</p></note> He had
                    great political prevision, too; his favourite motto of “Deutschland fiber Alles”
                    indicates the direction and the strength of his patriotism.</p>
                <p>Carl Hermann was one of Cornelius’s earliest and most esteemed scholars, a man of
                    simple and fervent nature, painstaking to the utmost, a very type of the finest
                    German student nature; Kaulbach and Eberle were also amongst his valued
                    scholars. The reader may here be reminded that the vast importance of the
                    practice of mural painting to the fine arts of a country consists in the
                    necessity which it involves of obtaining the assistance of scholars in the
                    carrying out, within reasonable time, of extensive mural works. Hence the
                    institution of scholarship in Germany as in the great Italian art epoch. Every
                    public edifice in Munich and other German cities which was embellished with
                    frescoes, became, as in Italy, a school of art of the very best kind; for the
                    decoration of a public building begets a practical knowledge of design. The
                    development of this institution of scholarship in Munich was a work of time. The
                    cartoons for the Glyptothek were all by Cornelius’s own hand. In the Pinakothek
                    his sketches and small drawings sufficed; but in the Ludwigskirche the invention
                    even of some of the subjects was intrusted to his scholar Hermann.</p>
                <p>To comprehend and appreciate thoroughly the magnitude of the work which Cornelius
                    accomplished for Germany, we must remember that at the beginning of this century
                    Germany had no national school of art. Germany was in painting and sculpture
                    behind all the rest of Europe. Yet in less than half a century Cornelius founded
                    a great school, revived mural painting, and turned the gaze of the art world
                    towards Munich. The German revival of mural painting had its effect upon
                    England, as well as upon other European nations, and led to those famous cartoon
                    competitions being held in Westminster Hall, and ultimately to the partial
                    decoration of the Houses of Parliament. When the latter work was in
                    contemplation, Cornelius, in response to invitations, visited England (November
                    1841). His opinion was in every way favourable to the carrying out of the
                    project, and even in respect of the durability of fresco in the climate of
                    England.</p>
                <p>Cornelius, in his teaching, always inculcated a close and rigorous study of
                    nature, but he understood by the study of nature something more than what is
                    ordinarily implied by <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n452/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0452-0423"/> that expression, something more than
                    constantly making studies from life; he meant the study of nature with an
                    inquiring and scientific spirit. “Study nature,” was the advice he once gave,
                    “in order that you may become acquainted with its <hi rend="italic"
                        >essential</hi> forms.”</p>
                <p>The personal appearance of Cornelius could not but convey to those who were
                    fortunate enough to come into contact with him the impression that he was a man
                    of an energetic, firm, and resolute nature. He was below the middle height and
                    squarely built. There was evidence of power about his broad and overhanging
                    brow, in his eagle eyes and firmly gripped attenuated lips, which no one with
                    the least discernment could misinterpret. Yet there was a sense of humour and a
                    geniality which drew men towards him; and towards those young artists who sought
                    his teaching and his criticism he always exhibited a calm patience.</p>

                    contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Art Journal</hi> in 1865, and Dr Forster’s
