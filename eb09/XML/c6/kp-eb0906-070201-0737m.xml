                    (1732-1811), a dramatic and miscellaneous writer, was born in the Master’s Lodge
                    of Trinity College, Cambridge, on the 19th of February <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0738-0703"/> 1732. He was the great-grandson of his namesake,
                    the bishop of Peterborough; and his father, Dr Denison Cumberland, became
                    successively bishop of Clonfert and of Kihnore. His mother was Joanna, the
                    youngest daughter of the great Bentley, and the heroine of John Byrom’s once
                    popular little eclogue, <hi rend="italic">Colin and Phoebe.</hi> Of the great
                    Master of Trinity his grandson has left a kindly account; he afterwards
                    collected all the pamphlets bearing on the <hi rend="italic">Letters of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Phalaris</hi> controversy, and piously defended the reputation of
                    his ancestor in a <hi rend="italic">Leiter</hi> to Bishop Lowth, who had called
                    him “aut caprimulgus aut fossor.” Cumberland was in his seventh year sent to the
                    grammarschool at Bury St Edmunds , and he relates how, on the head-master Arthur
                    Kinsman undertaking, in conversation with Bentley, to make the grandson as good
                    a scholar as the grandfather himself, the latter retorted: “Pshaw, Arthur, how
                    can that be, when I have forgot more than thou ever knewest 1” Bentley died
                    during his grandson’s Bury school-days; and in 1744 the boy, who, while rising
                    to the head of his school, had already begun to “try his strength in several
                    slight attempts towards the drama,”’ was removed to Westminster, then at the
                    height of its reputation under Dr Nicholls. Among his schoolfellows here were
                    Warren Hastings, George Colman (the elder), Lloyd, and (though he does not
                    mention them as such) Churchill and Cowper. From Westminster Cumberland passed,
                    in his fourteenth year, to the familiar Trinity, where at first he was,
                    according to custom, left to study on his own account. Afterwards, however,
                    under the advice of the master, Dr Smith, he applied himself closely to
                    mathematics, and in 1750 he took his degree as tenth wrangler. His account of
                    his degree examination, as well as that for a fellowship at his college (part of
                    which he underwent in the “judges’ chamber,” where he was born), is curious; he
                    was (by virtue of an alteration in the statutes) elected to his fellowship in
                    the second year of his degree.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile his projects of work as a classical scholar had been interspersed with
                    attempts at imitating Spenser— whom, by his mother’s advice, he “laid upon the
                    shelf ’’— and a dramatic effort (unprinted) on the model of Mason’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Elfrida,</hi> called <hi rend="italic">Caraetaeus.</hi> He had
                    hardly abandoned these pursuits in order to read for his fellowship, when he was
                    offered the post of private secretary by the earl of Halifax, First Lord of
                    Trade and Plantations in the duke of Newcastle’s ministry. His family persuaded
                    him to accept the office, to which he returned after his election as fellow. It
                    left him abundant leisure for literary pursuits, which included the design of a
                    poem in blank verse on India. He was fortunate enough to obtain a lay fellowship
                    at Trinity, but this he not long afterwards resigned on his marriage—in 1759—to
                    Miss Elizabeth Ridge, to whom he hid paid his addresses on receiving through
                    Lord Halifax “a small establishment as crown-agent for Nova Scotia.” In 1761 he
                    accompanied his patron (who had been appointed lord-lieutenant) to Ireland as
                    Ulster secretary; aud in acknowledgment of his services was afterwards offered a
                    baronetcy. By declining this he thinks he gave offence; at all events, when in
                    1762 Halifax became secretary of state, Cumberland in vain applied for the post
                    of under-secretary, and could only obtain the clerkship of reports at the Board
                    of Trade under Lord Hillsborough. While he takes some credit to himself for his
                    incorruptibility when in Ireland, he showed zeal for his friends, and obtained a
                    bishopric for his father. On the accession to office of Lord George Germaine
                    (Sackville) in 1775, Cumberland was appointed secretary to the Board of Trade
                    and Plantations, which post he held till the abolition of that board in 1782 by
                    Burke’s economical reform. Before this event he had, in 1780, been sent on a
                    confidential mission to Spain, to negotiate a separate treaty of peace with that
                    power; but though he was well received by King Charles III. and his minister
                    Floridablanca, the question of Gibraltar proved a stumbling-block, and the
                    Gordon riots at home a most untoward occurrence. He was recalled in 1781, and
                    was refused repayment of the expenses he had incurred, and for which only £1000
                    had been advanced to him. He thus found himself £4500 out of pocket; in vain, he
                    says, “I wearied the door of Lord North till his very servants drove me from
                    it;” his memorial remained unread or unnoticed either by the prime minister or
                    by secretary Robinson,through whom the original promise had been made. Soon
                    after this experience he lost his office, and had to retire on a compensation
                    allowance of less than half-pay. He now took up his residence at Tunbridge
                    Wells; but during his last years he mostly lived in London, where he died May 7,
                    1811.</p>
                <p>Cumberland’s literary productions are spread over the whole of his long life;
                    they are very numerous, but it is only by his contributions to the drama, and
                    perhaps by his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> that he is likely to be
                    remembered. In the latter, however, he dwells with more or less of paternal
                    fondness on a great number of other productions. Among these should in the first
                    instance be mentioned the collection of essays and other pieces entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Observer IſL</hi> vols., 1785; afterwards republished in 5
                    vols., and in 6, including a translation of <hi rend="italic">The Clouds</hi> of
                    Aristophanes). This collection found a place, as the author complacently points
                    out, among <hi rend="italic">The British Essayists.</hi> For the accounts given
                    in <hi rend="italic">The Observer</hi> of the Greek writers, especially the
                    comic poets, Cumberland availed himself of Bentley’s MSS. and annotated books in
                    his possession; his translations from the Greek fragments, which are not
                    inelegant but lack closeness, are republished in Bailey’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comicorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Graecorum</hi> (part i., 1840) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Hermesianactis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Archilochi,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Pratince</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Fragmenta.</hi> Cumberland also produced <hi rend="italic">Anecdotes of Eminent
                    Painters in Spain</hi> (2 vols., 1782); with a <hi rend="italic">Catθr</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">logue of the King of Spain's Paintings</hi> (1787); two novels,
                    <hi rend="italic">Arundel</hi> (2 vols., 1789,—a story in letters “hastily put
                    together during a few idle weeks at Brighthelmstone ”) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Henry</hi> (4 vols., 1795,·—a “diluted comedy” on the construction and
                    polishing of which he seems to have expended great care); and a religious epic,
                    <hi rend="italic">Calvary, or the Death of Christ,</hi> in 8 books (1792); and
                    (as his last publication) a poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Retrospection.</hi>
                    He is also said to have been concerned in an epic, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exodiad</hi> (with Sir James Bland Burges) and in <hi rend="italic">John de
                    Lancaster,</hi> a novel in 3 vols. Besides these he wrote the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letter to the Bishop of</hi><hi rend="italic">O[xfor]d</hi> in vindication of
                    Bentley; another <hi rend="italic">to the Bishop of Llandaff</hi> on his
                    proposal for equalizing the revenues of the Established Church (1783); a <hi
                    rend="italic">Character</hi> of Lord Sackville, whom in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs</hi> he vindicates from the stigma of cowardice; and an anonymous
                    pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Curtius</hi><hi rend="italic">rescued from the
                    Gulf,</hi> against the redoubtable Dr Parr. He was also the author of a version
                    of fifty of the Psalms of David; of a tract on the evidences of Christianity;
                    and of other religious exercises in prose and verse, the former including “as
                    many sermons as would make a large volume, some of which have been delivered
                    from the pulpits.’ Lastly, he edited a short-lived critical journal called <hi
                    rend="italic">The London Review,</hi> conducted on a principle to which
                    Cumberland doubtless attached high importance,—that the articles should bear the
                    names of the contributors.</p>
                <p>Cumberland’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> which he begun at the close of 1804
                    and concluded in September 1805, were published in 1806, and a supplement was
                    afterwards added. This sufficiently ample narrative of his public and private
                    life (which includes a long account of his Spanish mission) contains some
                    interesting reminiscences of several persons of note,—more especially Bubb
                    Dodington, Single-Speech Hamilton, and Lord George Sackville among politicians,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n739/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0739-0704"/> and of Garrick, Foote, and Goldsmith; but the
                    accuracy of some of the anecdotes concerning the last-named is not beyond
                    suspicion. In general the book exhibits its author as an amiable egotist,
                    careful—though not arrogantly so— of his own reputation, given to prolixity, and
                    little remarkable for wit, but a good observer of men and manners. The uneasy
                    self-absorption which Sheridan immortalized in the character of Sir Fretful
                    Plagiary in <hi rend="italic">The Critic</hi> is apparent enough in this
                    autobiography, but presents itself there in no offensive form. The comparative
                    estimates of the author’s own works and the development of their designs are
                    harmless if uninteresting; the long quotations from unpublished or forgotten
                    productions almost ask to be skipped; on the other hand the incidental
                    criticisms of actors have been justly praised, for Cumberland was possessed of
                    theatrical instinct, though not of dramatic genius. Lastly, his morality and
                    piety are here at least free from affectation in their expression, though not
                    less effusive than in his comedies themselves.</p>
                <p>Cumberland was hardly warranted in the conjecture that no English author had yet
                    equalled his list of dramas in point of number; but as the plays, published and
                    unpublished, which he produced have been computed to amount to a number
                    exceeding by four that of the sons of Priam, he must be allowed to have been
                    fairly pro! ific as a dramatist. About 35 of these are regular plays, to which
                    have to be added <hi rend="italic">4</hi> operas and a farce; and about half of
                    the whole list are comedies. Among these again the best-known, upon which the
                    literary reputation of their author virtually rests, belong to what he was
                    pleased to term “legitimate comedy,” and to that species of it known as
                    “sentimental.” The two terms are in point of fact mutually contradictory; but
                    this was precisely the proposition Cumberland was at so much pains to disprove,
                    though his most successful works remain among the most striking illustrations of
                    its truth. He asserted, with some show of reason, that in his sentimental comedy
                    he was following in the footsteps of the new comedy of. the Greeks; he was less
                    willing to confess that he was in truth an imitator of native models; for he was
                    by no means the creator in our dramatic literature of the species he so
                    assiduously cultivated. The essential characteristic of these plays is the
                    combination of plots of domestic interest with the rhetorical enforcement of
                    moral precepts, and with such comic humour (and it is usually but little) as the
                    author possesses. These comedies are primarily, to borrow Cumberland’s own
                    phraseology, designed as “attempts upon the heart;” and British hearts are
                    “hearts that feel.” He takes great credit to himself for weaving his plays out
                    of “homely stuff, right British drugget,” and for eschewing “the vile refuse of
                    the Gallic stage;” on the other hand, he borrowed (often perhaps unconsciously)
                    from the sentimental literature of his own country, including Richardson,
                    Fielding, and Sterne. The favourite theme of his plays is virtue in distress or
                    danger, but safe of its reward in the fifth act; their most constant characters
                    are men of feeling and young ladies who (to quote a retort of Goldsmith upon the
                    sentimental dramatists) are either prudes or coquettes. Cumberland’s comic
                    power—such as it was—lay in the invention of comic characters taken from the
                    “outskirts of the empire,” and professedly intended to vindicate from English
                    prejudice the good elements in the Scotch, the Irish, and the colonial
                    character. For the rest, patriotic sentiment (such as became one who in his old
                    age was a major of volunteers) liberally asserts itself by the side of general
                    morality. If Cumberland’s dialogue never approaches the brilliancy of
                    Sheridan’s, and if his characters have about them that air of unreality which in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Retaliation</hi> Goldsmith satirized with so exquisite a
                    grace, the construction of the plots is as a rule skilful, and the situations
                    are contrived with what Cumberland indisputably possessed—a thorough insight
                    into the secrets of theatrical effect. In this respect at all events he was the
                    “Terence of England,” that there is hardly one of <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi>
                    his principal plays in which the audience is not allowed to enjoy that most
                    thrilling of theatrical emotions which is produced by a meeting between parent
                    and child after long years of separation or ignorance of one another’s
                    existence. It should be added that, though Cumberland’s sentimentality is often
                    wearisome, his morality is generally sound; that if he was without the genius
                    requisite for elevating the national drama, he did his best to keep it pure and
                    sweet; and that if he borrowed much, as he undoubtedly did, it was not the
                    vicious attractions of other dramatists of which he was the plagiary.</p>
                <p>After making his <hi rend="italic">debut</hi> as a dramatic author with a
                    tragedy, <hi rend="italic">The Banishment of Cicero</hi> (of which the plot,
                    though inspired by Middleton, rather strikingly deviates from history),
                    published in 1761 after its rejection by Garrick; and producing in 1765 a
                    musical drama, <hi rend="italic">The Summer's Tale,</hi> which was performed for
                    a few nights and afterwards compressed into an afterpiece, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amelia</hi> (1768), Cumberland first essayed sentimental comedy in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Brothers</hi> (1769). This comedy has more vigour than some of
                    its author’s later works; its theme is inspired by <hi rend="italic">Tom
                    Jones;</hi> its comic characters are the jolly old tar Captain Ironsides, and
                    the henpecked husband Sir Benjamin Dove, whose progress to self-assertion is
                    perhaps as genuinely comic a notion as Cumberland ever executed, though, as he
                    confesses, not altogether an original one. The epilogue paid a compliment to
                    Garrick, who accordingly interestèd himself in the production of Cumberland’s
                    second and by far most successful comedy, <hi rend="italic">The West-Indian</hi>
                    (1771). The hero of this comedy is a young scapegrace fresh from the tropics,
                    “with rum and sugar enough belonging to him to make all the water in the Thames
                    into punch,”—a libertine with generous instincts, which in the end prevail. The
                    chief comic character is Major O’Flaherty, an honest Irish adventurer, in whom
                    Cumberland took no little pride, but who is in truth neither particularly Irish
                    nor particularly humorous. This comedy was received with the utmost favour; it
                    was afterwards translated into German by Boden, and Goethe acted in it at the
                    Weimar court. The next play of some importance was <hi rend="italic">The
                    Fashionable Lover</hi> (1772), a sentimental comedy of the most pronounced type,
                    with an ill-used heroine and a man of feeling exhibiting the very prurience of
                    sentimentality; “who dreams,” he exclaims, “that I am the lewd fool of pity, and
                    thou my pandar, Jarvis, my provider!” The comic characters are an honest Scotch
                    steward, whose Scotch iß if anything more doubtful than O’Flaherty’s Irish, and
                    an antiquarian Welsh tutor Doctor Druid, less creditable to the “outskirt of the
                    empire” represented by him. <hi rend="italic">The Choleric Man</hi> (1775),
                    founded on the <hi rend="italic">Adelphi</hi> of Terence, but not, as the author
                    in his long “dedication " protests, on Shadwell’s <hi rend="italic">Squire of
                    Alsatia,</hi> is of a similar type, the comic element rather predominating, but
                    philanthropy being duly represented by a virtuous lawyer called Manlove. Among
                    subsequent comedies may be mentioned <hi rend="italic">The Natural Son</hi>
                    (1785), in which Major O’Flaherty, now divested of all humour, makes his
                    reappearance; <hi rend="italic">The Impostors</hi> (1789), a comedy of intrigue
                    noteworthy for the absence of sentiment, but marred in one of the scenes by an
                    indelicacy of feeling which is unlike Cumberland,—the heroine, “a pleasant child
                    of nature,” must have admirably suited Mrs Jordan; <hi rend="italic">The Box
                    Lobby Challenge</hi> (1794), a mere protracted farce, where there is likewise no
                    sentiment, except in Lindamira’s novel; <hi rend="italic">The Jew</hi> (1794),
                    an essentially serious play creditable to Cumberland’s good feeling, and highly
                    effective when the character of Sheva is played as it was by the great German
                    actor Döring; <hi rend="italic">The Wheel of For</hi><pb break="no"

                    vague resemblance to Kotzebue’s <hi rend="italic">Stranger</hi> (not produced on
                    the English stage till 1798), and in which the character of the misanthropist
                    Penruddock, who cannot forget but learns to forgive, was a celebrated part of
                    John Kemble, while the lawyer Timothy Weasel was made comic by Suett; <hi
                    rend="italic">First Love</hi> (1795); <hi rend="italic">The Last of the
                    Family</hi> (1795); <hi rend="italic">False Impressions</hi> (1797), in which,
                    as the hero instead of the heroine is the injured innocent, the sentimentality
                    is less formidable,—the diction of the apothecary Scud will startle readers of
                    Dickens by its striking resemblance to that of Mr Alfred Jingle; <hi
                    rend="italic">The Sailor’s Daughter</hi> (1804); and a <hi rend="italic">Hint to
                    Husbands</hi> (1806), which, unlike the rest, is in blank verse. These appear to
                    be all the comedies by Cumberland printed in his lifetime, during which were
                    also published his farce of <hi rend="italic">The Note of Hand</hi> (1774); the
                    songs of his musical comedy, <hi rend="italic">The Widow of Delphi</hi> (1780);
                    his tragedies of <hi rend="italic">The Battle of Hastings</hi> (1778); and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Carmelite</hi> (1784), a romantic domestic drama in blank
                    verse, in the style of Home’s <hi rend="italic">Douglas,</hi> furnishing some
                    effective scenes for Mrs Siddons and John Kemble as mother and son, but
                    ill-constructed, inasmuch as the hero reveals himself several times in
                    succession; the domestic drama (in prose) of <hi rend="italic">The Mysterious
                    Husband</hi> (1783), in which the chief character, the bigamist Lord Davenant,
                    is, for so incredible a scoundrel, prematurely remorseful, and is ultimately got
                    rid of by suicide, but the intricate plot is cleverly contrived; and some minor
                    pieces.</p>
                <p>His posthumously printed plays include the comedies of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Walloons</hi> (acted 1782—Henderson, who afterwards performed Lord Davenant,

                    Brutus</hi> (afterwards amalgamated with other plays on the subject into a very

                    theme already treated by an earlier English dramatist, and destined to be the
                    last which occupied the genius of Schiller. Beside these and other dramatic
                    productions of more or less originality, Cumberland, as already stated,
                    translated the <hi rend="italic">Clouds</hi> of Aristophanes (1797), and altered
                    for the stage Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic">Timon</hi><hi rend="italic">of
