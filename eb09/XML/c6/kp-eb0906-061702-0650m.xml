                    rend="italic">Corvus),</hi> a name most commonly applied in Britain to the bird
                    properly called a Rook <hi rend="italic">(Corvus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >frugilegus),</hi> but perhaps originally peculiar to its congener, now-a-days
                    usually distinguished as the Black or Carrion-Crow <hi rend="italic">(C.
                    corone).</hi> By ornithologists it is also used in a far wider sense, as under
                    the title Crows, or <hi rend="italic">Corvidae,</hi> is included a vast number
                    of birds from almost all parts of the world, and this family is probably the
                    most highly developed of the whole Class <hi rend="italic">Aves.</hi> Leaving
                    out of account the best known of these, as the Raven, Rook, Daw, Pie, and Jay,
                    with their immediate allies, our attention will here be con fined to the Crows
                    in general; and then the species of the Family to which the appellation is more
                    strictly applicable may be briefly considered. Of the limits and subdivisions of
                    this Family it is at present desirable to speak with great caution, if not
                    doubt. All authorities admit that it is very extensive, and is capable of being
                    parted into several groups, but scarcely any two agree on either head.
                    Especially must reserve be exercised as regards the group <hi rend="italic"
                    >Streperinae, or</hi> Piping Crows, belonging to the Australian Region, and
                    referred by some writers to the Shrikes <hi rend="italic">(Laniidae):</hi> and
                    the Jays too have been erected into a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0651-0618"/> distinct Family <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Garrulidae),</hi> though it seems hardly possible to separate them even as a
                    Subfamily from the Pies <hi rend="italic">(Pica</hi> and its neighbours), which
                    lead almost insensibly to the typical Crows <hi rend="italic">(Corvinae.)</hi>
                    Dismissing these subjects for the present, it will perhaps be most convenient to
                    treat of the three groups which are represented by the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyrrhocorax</hi> or Choughs, <hi rend="italic">Nvaeifraga</hi> or Nutcrackers,
                    and <hi rend="italic">Corvus</hi> or True Crows in the most limited sense.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pyrrhocorax</hi> comprehends at least two very good species,
                    which have been needlessly divided generically. The best known of them is the
                    Cornish Chough <hi rend="italic">(P. graculus),</hi> formerly a denizen of the
                    precipitous cliffs of the south coast of England, of Wales, of the west and
                    north coasts of Ireland, and some of the Hebrides, but now greatly reduced in
                    numbers, and only found in such places as are most free from the intrusion of
                    man or of Daws <hi rend="italic">(Corvus</hi><hi rend="italic">monedula),</hi>
                    which last seem to be gradually dispossessing it of its sea-girt strongholds,
                    and its present scarcity is probably in the main due to its persecution by its
                    kindred. In Britain, indeed, it would appear to be only one of the survivors of
                    a more ancient fauna, for in other countries where it is found it has been
                    driven inland, and inhabits the higher mountains of Europe and North Africa. In
                    the Himalayas a larger form occurs, which has been specifically distinguished
                    <hi rend="italic">(P.</hi><hi rend="italic">lιimdlayanus),</hi> but whether
                    justifiably so may be doubted. The general colour is a glossy black with
                    steel-blue reflections, and it has the bill and legs bright red.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> Hence the “russet pated
                    choughs” of Shakespeare, an expression which has much exercised many of his
                    commentators, who did not see that “pated” meant “patted” or footed (c∕. the
                    heraldic <hi rend="italic">croix pâtée),</hi> instead of having anything to do
                    with the bird’s head, which is as black as that of a Raven. See <hi
                    rend="italic">Nature,</hi> v. p. 160.</p></note> The remaining species <hi
                    rend="italic">(P. alpinus)</hi> is altogether a mountaineer, and does not affect
                    a sea-shore life. Otherwise it frequents much the same kind of localities, but
                    it does not occur in Britain. The Alpine Chough is somewhat smaller than its
                    congener, and is easily distinguished by its shorter and bright yellow bill.
                    Remains of both have been found in French caverns, the deposits in which were
                    formed during the “Reindeer Age.” Commonly placed by systematists next to <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyrrhocorax</hi> is the Australian genus <hi rend="italic">Cor cor
                    ax,</hi> represented by a single species <hi rend="italic">(C.
                    m,elanorhamphus),</hi> but osteologists must be further consulted before this
                    assignment of the bird, which is chiefly a frequenter of woodlands, can be
                    admitted without hesitation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nucifraga</hi> is another very distinct form of <hi
                    rend="italic">Corvidae,</hi> peculiar to the Old World, and best exemplified by
                    the European Nutcracker (Λ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                    >caryocatactes),</hi> while in the New World it is somewhat remotely represented
                    by the genus <hi rend="italic">Picicorvus,</hi> of which only one species <hi
                    rend="italic">(P. columbianus),</hi> until lately very rare in collections, and
                    only inhabiting the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains, is known. The Common
                    Nutcracker has a wide range in the Palaearctic Region, chiefly keeping to
                    subalpine or subarctic pine-forests, and feeding on the seeds of one or another
                    species of fir. It seems nowhere to be numerous, though roving bands of seventy
                    or a hundred have been occasionally observed. It has long been known as a rare
                    straggler to the British Islands, but little was ascertained of its economy till
                    some fifteen years ago. It has now been discovered to breed, though in small
                    numbers, in some of the denser forests of Middle Sweden, on the island of
                    Bornholm, and in the Bavarian and Tyrolese mountains. It appears to build its
                    nest and lay its eggs very early in the year, long before the snows have
                    disappeared, and this fact, coupled with that of its becoming in the breeding
                    season one of the most silent of birds, when at other times it is rather noisy
                    than not, will account for the mystery which enwrapped its domestic arrangements
                    not having been sooner dispelled.</p>
                <p>Considerable difference has been observed in the form and size of the bill of
                    examples of this species, but this is now supposed to depend on the sex—that of
                    the cock being stout and short, while in the hen it is long and thin.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> An exactly similar sexual
                    distinction is observable in the Huia of New Zealand <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Heterolocha),</hi> which was for a long time included among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corvidae,</hi> but is now referred to the Starlings <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sturnidae.)</hi></p></note> The bird is about the size of a Jay,
                    and of a dark sooty-brown colour spangled with white, nearly each body-feather
                    ending in a tear-shaped patch of that colour. Besides the European species,
                    which also extends into Northern or Central Asia, three others, very nearly akin
                    to it, have been described from the Himalayas. Of their American cousin,
                    Clarke’s Crow, as it is called <hi rend="italic">(Picicorvus columbianus),</hi>
                    an excellent account has been given by Dr Coues <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi>
                    1872, pp. 52-59).</p>
                <p>Coming now to what may be literally considered Crows, attention must be mainly
                    directed to the Black or Carrion-Crow <hi rend="italic">(Corvus corone)</hi> and
                    the Grey, Hooded, or Royston Crow <hi rend="italic">(C. cornix).</hi> Both these
                    inhabit Europe, but their range and the time of their appearance are very
                    different. Without going into minute details, it will suffice to say that the
                    former is, speaking generally, a summer visitant to the south-western part of
                    this quarter of the globe, and that the latter occupies the north-eastern
                    portion—an irregular line drawn diagonally from about the Firth of Clyde to the
                    head of the Adriatic roughly marking their respective distribution. But both are
                    essentially emigrants, and hence it follows that when the Black Crow, as summer
                    comes to an end, retires southward, the Grey Crow moves downward, and in many
                    districts replaces it during winter. Further than this, it has now been
                    incontestably proved that along or near the boundary where these two birds march
                    they not infrequently interbreed, and it is believed that the hybrids, which
                    sometimes wholly resemble one or other of the parents and at other times assume
                    an intermediate plumage, pair indiscriminately among themselves, or with the
                    pure stock. Hence it has of late seemed to many ornithologists who have studied
                    the subject, that these two birds, so long unhesitatingly regarded as distinct
                    species, are only local races of one and the same dimorphic species. No
                    structural difference—or indeed any difference except that of range (already
                    spoken of) and colour—can be detected, and the problem they offer is one of
                    which the solution is exceedingly interesting if not important to zoologists in
                    general.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> As bearing
                    upon this question may be mentioned the fact that the Crow of Australia <hi
                    rend="italic">(C. australis)</hi> is divisible into two forms or races, one
                    having the irides white, the other of a dark colour. It is stated that they keep
                    apart and do not intermix.</p></note> The mode of life of the Crows needs not to
                    be described. Almost omnivorous in their diet, there is little edible that comes
                    amiss to them, and, except in South America, they are mostly omnipresent. The
                    number of species described is considerable, but doubtless should and will be
                    ruthlessly curtailed when a revision cf the group is undertaken by any
                    ornithologist working with proper materials. The Fish-Crow of North America <hi
                    rend="italic">(C.</hi><hi rend="italic">ossifragus)</hi> demands a few words,
                    since it betrays a taste for maritime habits beyond that of other species, but
                    our own Crows of Europe are not averse on occasion to prey cast up by the
                    waters, though they will hardly draw it thence for themselves. The so-called
                    “Hooded Crow” of India <hi rend="italic">(C. splendens)</hi> is not very nearly
                    allied to its European namesake, from which it can be readily distinguished by
                    its smaller size and the lustrous tints of its darkest feathers, while its
                    confidence in the human race has been so long encouraged by its intercourse with
                    an unarmed and inoffensive population, that it becomes a plague to the European
                    abiding or travelling where it is abundant. Hardly a station or camp in British
                    India is <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n652/mode/1up"

                    species, ready to dispute with the Kites and the cooks the very meat at the
                    fire; and when any lengthened settlement is established the Crows will build
                    their nests of the wire from the Englishman’s soda-water bottles. <hi
