                <p>COSTUME, as defined for the present inquiry, is limited to personal attire, but
                    with the exclusion of armour, which has been dealt with under a separate
                    heading.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Greek Costume,</hi></p>
                <p>The inquiry begins with Greek costume, as to which, so far as it consists of
                    dress, the general remark may be made that its history is for the most part free
                    from what is known as the changes of fashion, for this reason that the Greeks
                    did not attempt to reconcile the two opposite principles of covering and at the
                    same time displaying the figure, that is to say, of cutting the dress to fit the
                    body. There are changes which will be noted between the dress worn after 450 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and that of an earlier date, when the material was
                    heavier and the figure more closely enveloped, suggesting a difference of
                    climate in these different periods.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Female Dress.—</hi> The chief and indispensable article of
                    female dress was the <hi rend="italic">chiton,</hi> consisting of one piece of
                    material sewed together in the form of a sack open at top and 'bottom, in height
                    reaching from the neck to the feet of the wearer, and in width equal to that of
                    the extended arms. Within this stands the figure, and first it is girt round
                    under the breasts, to keep it from falling, by a girdle <hi rend="italic"
                    >(zoster).</hi></p>
                <p>Next, the upper edges are fastened together on the top of the shoulders by a
                    brooch <hi rend="italic">(fibula),</hi> and the arms are either left bare,
                    pressing down into folds at each side the masses of material, or these masses
                    may be gathered round each arm, and fastened down the outside with buttons and
                    loops so as to form sleeves <hi rend="italic">(chiton cheiridotos).</hi> The
                    chiton could be left open down one side for convenience in dancing, and was then
                    called <hi rend="italic">chiton schistos.</hi> To secure greater warmth on the
                    breast and shoulders the chiton was made long enough to be doubled back from the
                    top, and this part reaching to the waist was called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >diploïs</hi> or <hi rend="italic">diplóidion.</hi> It could be also made of a
                    separate piece. Underneath the chiton was worn a band of cloth <hi rend="italic"
                    >(t&lt;εnia)</hi> to support the breasts, and in addition to this a cord was
                    sometimes crossed round the breasts outside the chiton to assist either in
                    supporting them or in bringing out their form. Round the loins was worn, perhaps
                    not always, either a short petticoat of thick woollen stuff or a sort of bathing
                    drawers, ωα λoυτpις, such as acrobats wore. So far we have mentioned all the
                    dress that was necessary for indoor wear, which, also, since it had to be got
                    into, was called εvδυ∕zα, as opposed to other parts of dress, which were thrown
                    round the body, and were called <hi rend="italic">πt,pιβ</hi> ∖ <hi
                    rend="italic">riiχa,τa.</hi> To the latter class belongs the next article of
                    importance in female dress, the <hi rend="italic">himation,</hi> a garment worn
                    also by men. While the chiton was generally made of linen, of which there was a
                    variety of fabrics <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> those of Amorgos, Tarentum,
                    Sicily, Crete, and Phrygia), or of cannabis (made from hemp), or of byssos (flax
                    from India and Egypt chiefly), or of silk <hi rend="italic">(serica),</hi> the
                    himatioιrconsisted of woollen stuff, and was worn like a plaid. It was first
                    thrown over the left shoulder, leaving the short end to hang dowmin front; the
                    long end was then gathered round the back with the right hand, brought under the
                    right arm, and across the body in front, and finally held in this position by
                    being thrown over the left fore arm. Or instead of being passed under the right
                    arm it could be brought over the right shoulder so as to envelop the right arm,
                    then carried closely round the neck, and finally thrown over the left shoulder
                    with an end hanging down behind <hi rend="italic">; or</hi> again, it could be
                    still further drawn up over the back of the head to form a hood. As regards
                    colours, it will be found, when we have taken away black for the use of mourners
                    (τα δ∈ <hi rend="italic">μiλava ιp,aτιa 0pφavιva iκaλow),</hi> that the others
                    were employed in a great variety of combinations. Au important point was always
                    to have a deep border round the foot of the chiton, either of some uniform
                    colour which suggests solidity and heaviness, so as to weigh down the dress, or
                    of some pattern which would suggest strength to prevent the dress from being
                    torn when striding. Strong contrasts of colours were used, such as a white
                    chiton with a pink himation, or a white chiton with a broad blue border round
                    the foot. Besides embroidery, another kind of ornament consisted of designs
                    beaten out in thin gold and stitched on the dress. Great numbers of those have
                    been found in tombs where the dress itself has entirely perished. Greek vases
                    and sculptures represent Amazons and Persians wearing trousers <hi rend="italic"
                    >(anaxyrides),</hi> but this article of dress did not come into use among the
                    Greeks themselves.</p>
                <p>While the chiton and himation, as above described, continued to be the standard
                    dress from about 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> onwards, it is the rule to
                    find in figures of an earlier date the himation worn as in fig. 3, where it has
                    more of the appearance of a chiton, having like it a diploïdion, and enveloping
                    the greater part of the figure, so that the chiton proper appears as distinctly
                    an under garment. It is a himation of this kind that the archaic figure of
                    Athena wears, and since we know that the name for this garment of hers was <hi
                    rend="italic">peplos,</hi> it would perhaps be more correct to use this word
                    instead of himation for the upper garment of the earlier period. Among other
                    reasons also for this is the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n485/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0485-0454"/> negative evidence that the word peplos does not
                    occur in the inventory of female dresses on an inscription from Athens in the
                    British Museum, in which the latest date given is 335 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Pollux, it is true (vii. 47), cites it in his list of names for
                    dresses worn by women.</p>
                <p>Returning to the dress after 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> we find that the
                    chiton could be tucked up under the girdle till the skirt reached only to the
                    knees, as in the figures of Artemis. A short linen chiton, reaching half way
                    down the thighs, was called <hi rend="italic">kypassis.</hi> The diploïdion,
                    when once made of a separate piece, could have the form of a sleeveless jacket
                    reaching nearly to the knees. A diploïdion worn only in front was called a <hi
                    rend="italic">hemidiplóidion.</hi> A chiton worn to leave one breast bare was
                    called <hi rend="italic">heteromaschalos;</hi> worn without a girdle, as by
                    priests and old women, it was <hi rend="italic">orthostadios,</hi> or perhaps
                    <hi rend="italic">zoma.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">ampechonion</hi> appears to
                    have been a small shawl. The <hi rend="italic">kimbarikon</hi> was a transparent
                    under-chiton. The following names of dresses are still undetermined— <hi
                    rend="italic">kandys</hi> or <hi rend="italic">kandyke, epomis, pharos,
                    phaenole,</hi><hi rend="italic">xystis</hi><hi rend="italic">(xyston), heanos,
                    mandye, ephestrides,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">amphiestrides.</hi></p>
                <p>As regards the covering of the head, that was perhaps most generally accomplished
                    by drawing the himation up over the back of the head like a hood; or, instead of
                    this, a separate piece of cloth was made to perform this service, the end of it
                    falling under the himation. This was the <hi rend="italic">kalyptra,</hi> or
                    veil. A cap merely intended to cover in the hair and hold it together was called
                    <hi rend="italic">kekryphalos.</hi> When hats were worn they were of circular
                    shape, and either of some stiff material, as the Thessalian or Boeotian hat
                    (Θeσσαλιs <hi rend="italic">κvvrfi),</hi> observed in terra-cottas from Tanagra
                    in Baeotia and in Pompeian paintings, or of pliant material which could be bent
                    down at the sides like the <hi rend="italic">petasus</hi> worn by Atalanta.
                    Similar to this seems to have been the <hi rend="italic">kausia</hi> or
                    Macedonian hat. The <hi rend="italic">kyrbasia,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >kidaris,</hi> was a high pointed hat of Persian origin, as was also the <hi
                    rend="italic">tiara,</hi> which served the double purpose of an ornament and a
                    covering for the head. When the object was only to hold up the hair from the
                    neck, the <hi rend="italic">sphendone</hi> was used, which, as its name implies,
                    was in the form of a sling; but in this case it was called more particularly <hi
                    rend="italic">opistho-sphendone,</hi> as a distinction from the sphendone when
                    worn in the front of the head. The head ornaments include the <hi rend="italic"
                    >diadema,</hi> a narrow band bound round the hair a little way back frona the
                    brow and temples, and fastened in the knot of the hair behind; the <hi
                    rend="italic">ampyx,</hi> a variety of the diadem; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stephane,</hi> a crown worn over the forehead, its highest point being in the
                    centre, and narrowing at each side into a thin band which is tied at the back of
                    the head. Different from this is the <hi rend="italic">Stephanos,</hi> which is
                    a crown of the same breadth and design all round, as on the coins of Argos with
                    the head of Hera, who is expressly said by Pausanias to wear a stephanos. This
                    word is also employed for crowns of laurel, olive, or other plant, when the form
                    would be the same all round the head. Crowns made of wicker-work <hi
                    rend="italic">(poloi kalathoi)</hi> were also worn (see Gerhard, <hi
                    rend="italic">Antike Bildwerke,</hi> pls. 303-305). When the hair, as was most
                    usual, was gathered back from the temples and fastened in a knot behind, hair
                    pins were required, and these were mostly of bone or ivory, mounted with gold or
                    plain. So also when the hair was tied in a large knot above the forehead, as in
                    the case of Artemis, or of Apollo as leader of the Muses. The early Athenians
                    wore their hair so, with a pin representing a grasshopper <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(tctti£),</hi> in allusion totheir claim of having originally sprung from the
                    soil (Thucyd. i. 6). Whether this knot was the <hi rend="italic">krobylos</hi>
                    is not determined. In archaic figures the hair is most frequently arranged over
                    the brow and temples in parallel rows of small curls which must have been kept
                    in their places by artificial means, probably by small spirals of gold wire,
                    such as are found in early Etruscan tombs lying near the head of the skeleton.
                    Ear-rings (cVωτια, ∈λλo∕3ιa, ∈λικτηpeς) of gold, silver, or bronze plaited with
                    gold, and frequently ornamented with pearls, precious stones, or enamel, were
                    worn attached to the lobes of the ear. For necklaces (opμ∙oι), bracelets
                    (õ≠eiç), brooches (ττepovαι), and finger-rings (δακτυ <hi rend="superscript">
                    z</hi> λιoι or σ≠paγιδ∈ς) the same variety and preciousness of material was
                    employed. The gold used was always very thin; the intrinsic value, for example,
                    of tho famous Milo necklace in the British Museum is very slight, while the
                    extraordinary amount of skilled work manship in it would represent a very high
                    value in labour. This is the rule in the best period of Greek art, that the
                    jewellery is of value according to its workmanship; but in later times
                    preciousness of material determined the value. In the earliest jewellery, amber
                    is conspicuous, alternating with pale gold or electrum. For the feet .-the
                    sandal (σ⅛δαλov, τr∈διλa) was the usual wear; in exceptional cases, as for the
                    bath, shoes, and for hunting, high boots were worn. The hunting boot was laced
                    up the front, and reached to the calves. Gloves <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cheirides)</hi> were worn by the Persians, but apparently never by the Greeks
                    unless to protect the hands when working <hi rend="italic">(Odyssey,</hi> xxiv.
                    230).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Male dress.—</hi> Fig. 4 represents the dress of a Greek
                    citizen, such as it appears, for example, on the frieze of the Parthenon. It
                    consists of nothing more than a himation such as that already described for
                    women, but worn differently; and from the simplicity of this attire it may be
                    seen in how ridiculously awkward a position Blepyrus was placed by his wife’s
                    having carried off his himation and shoes (Aristoph., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eccles.,</hi> 310 <hi rend="italic">sqq.)</hi> But underneath the himation was
                    sometimes also a short linen chiton similar to that worn by armed men under
                    their armour; and with this chiton on, the himation could be laid aside on
                    occasion. Workmen of all kinds wore only a short chiton girt round the waist,
                    and let loose from the right shoulder to leave the arm free. In this case the
                    material varied according to the necessary exposure to cold,—a fisherman, for
                    example, having a chiton of hide, as had also slaves; but the slave’s chiton was
                    more like a jacket with sleeves reaching to the wrist, and corresponding to the
                    σvσ∈ιpα as defined by Pollux (vii. 70), who mentions further the <hi
                    rend="italic">βaiτη</hi> and <hi rend="italic">σiσvρa</hi> as garments of hide
                    worn by peasants in the form of mantles. The same class of persons wore at other
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n486/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0486-0455"/> times the <hi rend="italic">κaτωvdκη,</hi> a
                    mantle of woollen stuff with border of sheepskin. But among the citizen class
                    where the himation, as in fig. 4, was the proper dress for a man of mature
                    years, younger men and youths appear to have worn it only as a sort of undress
                    to wrap round them when heated in the palaestra or at the bath. In public
                    appearances they wore a linen chiton girt at the waist, and reaching half-way
                    down the thighs, and on their shoulders a purple <hi rend="italic">chlamys</hi>
                    of woollen stuff fastened with a brooch on the right shoulder as in fig. 5. The
                    <hi rend="italic">chlamys</hi> was properly a military mantle, and is said to
                    have been introduced from Macedonia, as was also the <hi rend="italic"
                    >kausia,</hi> worn along with it by Athenian youth, a round hat with flat pliant
                    brim resembling the <hi rend="italic">petasus</hi> of Hermes. In winter a mantle
                    of thick stuff, the <hi rend="italic">chl&lt;xna,</hi> was sometimes worn, while
                    in summer the himation could be replaced by the thin linen <hi rend="italic"
                    >chlanis.</hi> For official or priestly dignity an ungirt chiton reaching to the
                    feet <hi rend="italic">(chiton orthostadios)</hi> was worn. Sandals, shoes, or
                    high boots were used as occasion required. The citizen of mature years wore no
                    covering for the head. That was confined to youth, work men, and slaves. His
                    hair was cut short on the top, and lay on the head without parting. At the sides
                    and round the neck it was allowed to fall a short way. His beard was of moderate
                    size. Before Alexander’s time only the Spartans shaved the upper lip, but after
                    that shaving became more general. Except a finger ring, a brooch to fasten the
                    chlamys, or on occasion a wreath, the citizens usually wore no ornaments. While
                    with this class there was no limit to the display of limbs, it was on the other
                    hand the object of the slave’s dress to conceal the limbs as far as possible,
                    and for this purpose he wore, besides the jacket with long sleeves already
                    noticed, closefitting hose reaching to the ankles. For his head he had, like
                    fishermen and other workmen, a pointed cap <hi rend="italic">(pilos).</hi></p>
                <p>The constancy to one fashion observed in the dress of the Greeks is not
                    remarkable when we remember that the fashions with which they were familiar in
                    other nations must have shared in their minds the association with servitude and
                    lower civilization which attached to these nations. Yet if it is true that they
                    entered Greece from the north, and had previously permanent settlements in that
                    region, it is curious that they did not retain in their costume some evidence of
                    the colder climate in which they had lived, unless, indeed, the hose relegated
                    to slaves furnish such evidence. This same difficulty occurs with regard to the
                    Etruscans, whose dress is peculiarly the natural one for an Oriental climate;
                    and it is the more remarkable in their case since the cold of the north of Italy
                    would, it might be supposed, have induced them to retain part of the dress
                    peculiar to the north, had they, as is argued, been previously settled
                    there.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Etruscan.</hi></p>
                <p>The female dress of the Etruscans consisted, like that of the Greeks, jn (1) a
                    <hi rend="italic">chiton</hi><hi rend="italic">poderes,</hi> reaching to the
                    feet, and girt at the waist; (2) a himation, worn in the fashion of a shawl, as
                    occasionally on early Greek figures, or as a plaid; (3) a hat <hi rend="italic"
                    >(tutulus)</hi> rising to a high point; and (4) pointed shoes. The chiton, with
                    diploïdion on the breast, which is so conspicuous in Greek art after 450 B.c.,
                    does not so far as we know occur in pure Etruscan representations of dress; nor
                    is the himation found wrapped round the body as in Greek figures of this period
                    (see fig. 2 above). It seems to have been much narrower as used by the
                    Etruscans, and more like a shepherd’s plaid. Instead of a himation a
                    close-fitting jacket of thick stuff is worn by an archaic Etruscan female figure
                    in the British Museum, fig. 6. The pointed hat <hi rend="italic">(tutulus)</hi>
                    re semblés the Persian <hi rend="italic">kidaris,</hi> and from its Oriental
                    appearance has been cited as a survival of part of the national dress from the
                    time when the Etruscans inhabited Lydia. On a celebrated terracotta sarcophagus
                    in the British Museum the female figure reclining on the lid wears a Greek
                    chiton of a thin white material, with short sleeves fastened on the outside of
                    the arm, by means of buttons and loops; a himation of dark purple thick stuff is
                    wrapped round her hips and legs; on her feet are sandals, consisting of a sole
                    apparently of leather, and attached to the foot and leg with leather straps;
                    under the straps are thin socks which do not cover the toes; she wears a
                    necklace of heavy pendants; her ears are pierced for ear-rings; her hair is
                    partly gathered together with a ribbon at the roots behind, and partly hangs in
                    long tresses before and behind; a flat diadem is bound round her head a little
                    way back from the brow and temples. Purple, pale green, and white, richly
                    embroidered, are favourite colours in the dresses represented on the painted
                    tombs.</p>
                <p>No less essentially identical with the Greek are the representations of male
                    dress on works of Etruscan art dating from the period of national independence.
                    The chief article of male dress was called the <hi rend="italic">tebenna.</hi>
                    On the other hand there are the statements of ancient writers that the <hi
                    rend="italic">toga prcetexta,</hi> with its purple border <hi rend="italic"
                    >(τrepιπ6pφvpo&lt;i τηβevva),</hi> as worn by Roman magistrates and priests, had
                    been derived from the Etruscans (Pliny, <hi rend="italic">N.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">IL,</hi> ix. 63, <hi rend="italic">prcetextae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">apud Etruscos originem invenere)</hi>; and the Roman toga, though
                    placed round the body much in the same way as the Greek himation, yet differed
                    from it in shape so far that, while the latter was an oblong, the toga was a
                    circular piece of stuff <hi rend="italic">(toga rotunda),</hi> of which a large
                    segment was doubled back so as to reduce the whole to little more than a
                    semicircle. By this means a greater profusion of folds was obtained, and this at
                    first sight is the characteristic difference between the Greek and Roman male
                    dress. But though the toga, worn as it was by the Romans, does not occur in
                    early Etruscan art, there is sufficient likeness between it and the tebenna
                    which does occur, to justify the statement of the Roman toga being derived from
                    the earlier costume of the Etruscans. It would have been equally, perhaps more,
                    correct to have <pb break="no"

                    been worn in Argos and Arcadia (Foilux, vii. 61) apparently from early times.
                    Under the tebenna, or toga, which was necessary only for public appearance, the
                    Etruscans wore a short tunic similar to the Greek chiton. For workmen and others
                    of inferior occupation this appears to have been the only dress. Youths, when
                    engaged in horsemanship and other exercises, wore a chlamys round the shoulders,
                    just as the youths similarly engaged on the Parthenon frieze. But the Etruscan
                    chlamys, again, is semicircular in cut, and was fastened on the breast by
                    buttons and a loop, or tied in a knot, whereas the Greek chlamys was oblong and
                    fastened on the shoulder by a brooch <hi rend="italic">(péroné).</hi> On public
                    or festal occasions the Etruscan noble wore, besides the tebenna, a <hi
                    rend="italic">bulla,</hi> or necklace of <hi rend="italic">bullae,</hi> and a
                    wreath, <hi rend="italic">corona</hi><hi rend="italic">Etrusca.</hi> The bulla
                    was a circular gold locket containing a charm of some kind against evil. On the
                    later sarcophagi the male figures wear not only a wreath, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >corona</hi> proper, but also a garland of flowers hung round the neck. The
                    Roman manner of wearing occasionally the toga, with the end thrown over the left
                    shoulder, and wrapped round the waist <hi rend="italic">(Gabino cinctu),</hi>
                    was derived, it was said, from Etruria. The upper fold of the tebenna could be
                    drawn up over the head if needed. As a separate male head-dress there was the
                    <hi rend="italic">galerus,</hi> a hat of leather, said to have been worn by the
                    Lucumos in early times, or the <hi rend="italic">apex,</hi> a pointed hat
                    corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">tutulus</hi> worn by females. The fashion
                    of shoes worn by Roman senators was said to have been derived from Etruria.
                    Etruscan shoes were prized both in Greece and in Rome.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Roman.</hi><hi rend="italic">Male dress. —</hi> Fig. 7
                    represents the full Roman dress of tunica and toga, the former being visible
                    only on the right shoulder and breast. The toga as here worn is, when spread
                    out, a nearly elliptical piece of cloth, its greatest length being three times
                    the height of the person who wears it, and its greatest breadth equal to at
                    least twice the height of the wearer. It is, therefore, correctly called <hi
                    rend="italic">toga rotunda.</hi> The first step is to double back a segment of
                    this ellipse so that it may nearly resemble a semicircle, and thus also justify
                    the other definition of the toga as semicircular (τr∈pι∕30λαιov <hi
                    rend="italic">ημικvκλιov).</hi> With the long straight edge so obtained, and
                    with the smaller segment on the outside, the toga is thrown over the left
                    shoulder, one end hanging down in front and over the left arm to the ground. The
                    long end is then gathered round the back with the right hand, brought under the
                    right arm and across the body, and finally thrown again over the left shoulder
                    so that it may hang down the back some distance. The segment which was doubled
                    back may be drawn over the back of the head like a veil, or, more generally, is
                    drawn up as far as the neck and round the right shoulder, from which it forms a
                    sweep in front of the body resembling the curve of a bay, whence it is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">sinus.</hi> The end, at first allowed to fall down in
                    front, is drawn up a little and hangs over the edge, which passes round the
                    waist in front. This is perhaps what is called the <hi rend="italic">umbo.</hi>
                    Instead of the loose end of the toga being thrown over the left shoulder, as
                    here, it was sometimes carried round under the left arm and tied tightly round
                    the waist. This was called the <hi rend="italic">cinctus Gabinus,</hi> and from
                    having been once, it appears, a common fashion of citizens when engaged in war,
                    was retained as the official form in certain ceremonies arising out of war, as
                    at the opening of the temple of Janus. The toga was of a thin woollen stuff, and
                    as to colour was always white for the ordinary burgesses. A white toga with a
                    purple border <hi rend="italic">(toga praetexta)</hi> was worn as a distinction
                    by those holding public offices, entitling them to the curule chair and the
                    fasces, by the great colleges of priests (Flamen Dialis, Pontifices, Augurs,
                    Septemviri, Quindecimviri, and Arvales), but in this case only during the act of
                    performing their offices, and by boys up to their sixteenth year, when they
                    assumed the <hi rend="italic">toga</hi><hi rend="italic">virilis.</hi> The
                    tribunes and aediles of the plebs and the quaestors were denied the right to the
                    praetexta. A purple toga <hi rend="italic">(toga purpurea)</hi> was always the
                    mark of high office, and as such was worn by the magistrates of republican
                    times, though not except on public occasions, as well as by the emperors. The
                    purple toga was sometimes embroidered with gold <hi rend="italic">(toga</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">picta),</hi> and it could only bo worn with an under-dress of the
                    same colour <hi rend="italic">(tunica</hi><hi rend="italic">palmata).</hi> The
                    praetexta, on the other hand, with its purple border, could only be worn along
                    with a white tunic under it with a purple stripe <hi rend="italic"
                    >(clavus).</hi> The praetexta was laid aside when the wearer retired from
                    office, but the clavus, or purple stripe on the tunic, was retained, and became
                    in consequence the distinguishing mark of the senatorial order.</p>
                <p>The tunica corresponds exactly to the Greek chiton, reaching, like it, half way
                    down the thigh, and being girt round the waist, but with the apparent difference
                    that the Greeks rarely brought the stuff pressed down by both arms up round the
                    arms so as to form sleeves down to the elbows, as did the Romans frequently.
                    Further, it was a custom of the Romans to wear two tunics,—Augustus is said to
                    have worn four. The one next the skin was known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >subucula,</hi> and the other as the <hi rend="italic">supparus,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">intusium.</hi> Only the latter had sleeves <hi rend="italic"
                    >(tunica</hi><hi rend="italic">manicata),</hi> and over it passed the girdle <hi
                    rend="italic">(cinctura).</hi> The tunic of the senatorial order had, as has
                    been said, a broad purple stripe, <hi rend="italic">latus clavus,</hi> woven
                    into it down the front, whence it was called <hi rend="italic">tunica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">laticlavia.</hi> That of the knightly order had two narrow purple
                    stripes and was known as <hi rend="italic">tunica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >angusticlavia.</hi> Tunics with two narrow stripes, one passing over each
                    shoulder before and behind, are seen on Roman bronze statuettes of boys
                    represented acting as Camilli at sacrifices. The tunic was usually of linen,
                    just as the toga was of wool, and the national colour for ordinary purposes was
                    white. Poor persons were doubtless content with the natural colour of the linen
                    or wool, and when in mourning the higher classes wore a dark-coloured toga <hi
                    rend="italic">(toga</hi><hi rend="italic">palla</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >sordida),</hi> though this was not always the rule.</p>
                <p>More convenient than the toga, but retaining a general likeness to it, was the
                    <hi rend="italic">pallium,</hi> an adaptation of the Greek himation. Among other
                    substitutes for the toga were (1) the <hi rend="italic">trabea,</hi> which
                    formed the official dress of the Augurs and Salii, resembling in shape the
                    Etruscan tebenna, and being purple in colour; (2) <hi rend="italic"
                    >paludamentum,</hi> an adaptation of the Greek chlamys, worn by the emperor as
                    head of the army, purple in colour, though white was also allowed; (3) <hi
                    rend="italic">sagum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sagulum,</hi> similar to the
                    last, but worn only by soldiers; it differs from the <hi rend="italic"

                    when folded out; (4) <hi rend="italic">pcenιda,</hi> worn in rainy weather to
                    cover the dress, and made of thick flaxen material <hi rend="italic"

                    piece of stuff with a round hole in the middle for the head to pass through; (5)
                    <hi rend="italic">lacerna,</hi> a sort of <hi rend="italic">chlamys</hi> of
                    expensive material and colours, worn in the theatre or circus in presence of the
                    emperor. As regards covering for the head, there was the hood of the paenula in
                    rough weather <hi rend="italic">{cucullus</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >cucullio),</hi> or the toga could be drawn up over the head, or there was a
                    separate article—the <hi rend="italic">ricinium</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> in
                    the form of a veil, as worn by the Arval Brothers. Workmen and others wore hats
                    or caps corresponding to the Greek pilus <hi rend="italic">(pileus)</hi> and
                    petasus. As an ornament for the head the diadem was only occasionally used till
                    the time of Constantine. It was declined by Caesar. After Caracalla the most
                    usual mark of an emperor was a crown of radii. The heavy garments worn out of
                    doors, or officially, were replaced at dinner by <hi rend="italic"
                    >vestes</hi><hi rend="italic">coenatorioe</hi> of thin material. Trousers <hi
                    rend="italic">(braccae)</hi> were not worn till after the Parthian and Celtic
                    wars, and even then only by soldiers who were exposed to northern climates. The
                    legs were protected by flat bands <hi rend="italic">(fasciae)</hi> laced round
                    them up to the knees. On the feet senators wore shoes of red leather <hi
                    rend="italic">(mulleus, calceus senatorius),</hi> ornamented with knobs of ivory
                    or brass, and having a high sole. The patrician order wore shoes of black

                    crescent, and hence called <hi rend="italic">lunula.</hi> For unofficial
                    occasions, and for persons not belonging to these orders, there were the sandals
                    <hi rend="italic">(soleae).</hi> The <hi rend="italic">compagus,</hi> said to
                    have been introduced from Etruria by Romulus, appears to have been a high
                    hunting boot laced up the front, while the <hi rend="italic">caliga</hi> appears
                    to have been a sort of shoe. For personal ornament finger-rings of great variety
                    in the material and design were worn, sometimes to the extent of one or more on
                    each finger, many persons possessing small cabinets of them. But at first the
                    Roman citizen wore only an iron signet ring. A gold ring was introduced for
                    persons sent on foreign embassies, but by degrees the√tts <hi rend="italic"
                    >annuli</hi><hi rend="italic">aurei</hi> was extended to all classes of
                    citizens. In the case of baldness, a wig <hi rend="italic">(capillamentum)</hi>
                    was allowed to men as well as women during the empire. Till 290 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it was the custom of men to let the hair and beard
                    grow long. From that time shaving and short hair were the fashion, till under
                    Hadrian, when long beards were again grown.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Female Dress.—</hi> The proximity of wealthy Greek towns in the
                    south of Italy, and the extensive intercourse between the Romans and Greece and
                    the East even in republican times, offered tempting facilities to Roman ladies
                    for the supply of dress, and the result is that in artistic representations
                    their dress does not differ in any important particulars from that of the Greeks
                    as already described. Still the names for the main articles of dress remain
                    Roman, from which it may be inferred that the differences between the original
                    Roman and the imported Greek dress were not essential as regards shape. Next the
                    skin was worn the <hi rend="italic">tunica interior</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">strophium.</hi> Then came the <hi rend="italic">tunica</hi>
                    proper, generally called <hi rend="italic">stola,</hi> girt at the waist, and
                    with sleeves fastened down the arms as in the chiton. Over this was thrown for
                    out-door wear the <hi rend="italic">palla,</hi> or plaid, identical with the
                    Greek himation. A veil over the back of the head <hi rend="italic"
                    >(flammeum</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi><hi rend="italic">ricinium)</hi> was the
                    mark of a well-to-do matron. In rainy weather a hood like the Etruscan tutulus
                    was worn. To cover or hold up the hair, nets were used <hi rend="italic">(mitra
                    calantica,</hi><hi rend="italic">calvatica),</hi> but this simple article was
                    far from common among the Roman ladies, whose chief characteristic in works of
                    art is the elaborateness of their manner of braiding and twining the hair. After
                    the Germanic wars a blond colour of hair became fashionable, and to get this
                    dyeing was resorted to. Generally the eyebrows and eyelashes were painted <hi
                    rend="italic">; even</hi> the veins on temples were sometimes touched with
                    delicate blue colour. The complexion was improved by various powders and washes.
                    The teeth were carefully looked after, false ones making up the deficiency of
                    nature. For the feet sandals, but by preference shoes, were made use of,
                    generally of bright colours and embroidered with gold or pearls; socks or
                    stockings were confined to ceremonial appearances. Personal ornaments consisted
                    of brooches <hi rend="italic">(fibulae),</hi> bracelets <hi rend="italic"
                    >(armillae),</hi> armlets <hi rend="italic">(bracchialia),</hi> ear-rings <hi

                    worn round the neck, was introduced from Gaul. A profusion of precious stones,
                    and absence of skill or refinement in workmanship, distinguish Roman from Greek
                    or Etruscan jewellery; but in the character of the designs there is no real
                    difference.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Egyptian and Assyrian.</hi><hi rend="italic">Egyptian.—</hi>
                    The ordinary male dress of the Egyptians, previous to about 1600 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> consisted of a piece of linen cloth tied round the
                    loins, with occasionally an upper garment or skin of a tiger or leopard thrown
                    round the body. Though this continued even to much later times to be the dress
                    of many, yet from the date just given distinctions of grade in society began to
                    be marked by different ways of girding the loins, by greater size of the cloth,
                    by twining it up round the body, and by wearing two or more loin cloths of
                    different materials (Weiss, <hi rend="italic">Kostümkunde,</hi> i. fig. 18, p.
                    33). The peculiarly Ethiopian dress was in the form of a sleeveless skirt with
                    fringe round the lower edge, hanging loose except among poorer people, who wore
                    it fitting close to the body. The rule in early times was to go barefooted
                    except on occasions of ceremonial, when a sort of hose of network or greaves
                    were worn. But under the new empire, after 1600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    covering for both feet and head came into general use, the former consisting of
                    sandals, the latter of a cap made of leather, or of what some call cotton.
                    Magistrates and others of rank wore from the earliest times sandals, and on the
                    head a square of cloth folded diagonally with its three points gathered together
                    at the back of the neck. The dress of a king was distinguished by a triangular
                    projecting skirt (fig. 8) of leather and ornamented with gold. Over this he wore
                    a chiton and a sash round the waist. On his head was a crown, <hi rend="italic"
                    >pshent,</hi> which could be of three kinds, either that of Lower or of Upper
                    Egypt, or a combination of these two, the latter having nearly the appearance of
                    a mitre. A queen wore a long, thin, and richly ornamented chiton, with sash
                    round waist and shoulders (fig.</p>
                <p>9). A broad collar round neck and over breast was worn both by men and women who
                    could afford it. The taste for ornament was general, men wearing armlets,
                    bracelets, anklets, and finger-rings, while women not only wore these articles
                    in greater size, number, and richness, but also diadems, girdles, and bands of
                    ornament round the breasts and hips. The national dress, however, for poorer
                    women was a simple close-fitting <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n489/mode/1up"

                    straps over the shoulders. Woollen garments were worn chiefly by the poor, and
                    occasionally by the rich, or by priests, who were permitted an upper dress of
                    this material. Next the skin it was unlawful to wear it, nor could any one be
                    buried in a dress of this material (Herod, ii. 81). A priest had to put off the
                    woollen part of his dress before entering a temple. Cotton (eìpioiaei ατro
                    ⅛υλoυ, Herod, iii. 47) appears to have been manufactured in Egypt, but to have
                    been less used than linen, or <hi rend="italic">byblus,</hi> which was made from
                    flax and cotton.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Assyrian.—</hi> In weaving, embroidery, and dyeing the
                    Assyrians surpassed the other ancient nations, as is known from tradition and
                    may be seen in theirexistingsculptures. While the characteristic dress of an
                    ordinary Egyptian was a cloth girt round the loins, that of an Assyrian was a
                    long skirt worn close round the body and with short sleeves. This was worn by
                    all classes, and apparently by women as well as by men. Only royal and priestly
                    persons were allowed an upper garment, at least during the early and flourishing
                    period of Assyria. By the time of Herodotus a considerable variety of other
                    dresses had been introduced among the different classes. The king’s dress, as
                    will be seen in fig. 10, consists of a long chiton, or skirt, with short
                    sleeves, and above this a mantle with heavy fringes passing over one shoulder,
                    or in other cases over both shoulders.</p>
                <p>The dress of a priest consisted of an under-chiton, and over it a sort of long
                    narrow plaid with fringe wrapped spirally round the figure (Weiss, i. fig. 119,
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> p. 202). Diadems variously ornamented were worn by
                    officers of the court and by certain priests, as were also sandals. Hose did not
                    come into use till a late period, and then chiefly as part of the military
                    dress. Necklaces, armlets, bracelets, and finger-rings were worn in abundance by
                    Assyrians of rank. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. s. μ.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Jewish.</hi></p>
                <p>Of the dress generally worn in ancient Israel there are known to exist no
                    original authentic representations, nor is it possible to refer to any minute
                    descriptions of it either in the one great source of Jewish history or in the
                    pages of Josephus. Certain paintings and sculptures, it is true, in Egypt and
                    Assyria, have been supposed to represent captive Israelites; but, even should
                    this supposition be correct, in the figures thus represented there is nothing
                    whatever which could be accepted as typical of national costume. On the other
                    hand, while in certain details and accessories of the dress adopted by the
                    different classes of the Israelite community, there doubtless arose from time to
                    time both fresh modifications and decided changes of fashion and adjustment, the
                    general essential typical characteristics of dress may be assumed to have
                    continued the same in Israel,—the same, also, as in no slight degree continue
                    todistinguish the Oriental costume still worn in Palestine. The garments,
                    certainly, were loose and flowing; the girdle was in universal use; and a
                    primary motive in the headgear was protection for the wearer from the hot
                    sunshine of the East. The garments, in whatever manner or degree they may have
                    been affected by varieties of material and adornment, certainly may be divided
                    into two distinct groups, the under and the outer garments,—the former being
                    light and specially adapted to a hot climate, and the latter being of heavier
                    materials and suited to the colder seasons. As in the case of their arts, so in
                    their costume the Israelites must be considered to have been influenced by
                    usages prevalent in Egypt and Phoenicia; subsequently, by those of Assyria; and,
                    still later, by those of the Bomans. Again, it is more than probable that local
                    influences introduced fashions of their own into the costume of the dwellers in
                    the more mountainous districts of Palestine. For peculiar classes among them the
                    Israelites had costumes specially appointed. For the priesthood there were their
                    own official vestments, for which regulations were laid down with extreme
                    minuteness, and enforced by supreme authority. The kings and princes had their
                    “royal apparel,” and for the warriors appropriate appointments were provided.
                    Different ranks of persons, too, in various ways were distinguished by the
                    richness, the costliness, the simplicity, or the meanness of their attire. So
                    far as externals went, the episode in the Gospel of the rich man clothed in
                    purple and fine linen with a Lazarus at his gate, so true a picture of Oriental
                    life, would have been equally consistent had it found a place in some one of the
                    earlier chapters in the same national history. Of the distinctive
                    characteristics of female costume in Israel nothing is known, beyond the general
                    fact that it was rich and delicate as far as circumstances would admit, and that
                    personal ornaments were highly prized. Thus much is certain that the veil, a
                    modern fashion now so prevalent in the East, in its modern acceptation was
                    unknown among the women of ancient Israel, with certain exceptions only that are
                    altogether at variance with the uses and associations of the Oriental veil at
                    the present day. Furs, used both for warmth and adornment, with cloth woven from
                    camels’ and from goats’ hair, including the “sackcloth” of sorrow and
                    humiliation, were in use from an early period; so also, doubtless, was woollen
                    cloth, the natural material for the clothing of a pastoral people. Familiarity
                    with fabrics of linen, cotton, and silk, with those of various materials of
                    foreign manufacture, may be considered to have been acquired by the Israelites
                    in and from Egypt. There, too, they became familiar with the process of dyeing,
                    and with the use of coloured threads, and of gold-thread or fine wire, for
                    textile purposes; and there they learned both to introduce various figures and
                    devices into their woven fabrics, and to enhance their effectiveness with the
                    needle. Needlework and embroidery, indeed, were extensively used by them in the
                    production of various decorative fabrics. Whatever may have been the use in
                    Israel of fabrics and decorations that were coloured, those that were white (the
                    natural hue of any material, as well as actual whiteness, being understood to be
                    implied by this term “white ”) were in general use by the Israelites for their
                    dress, and also were held by them in the highest estimation. This preference
                    possibly may be traced to the provision in the Mosaic law which, apparently with
                    the view to impress on the mind of the Israelites the idea of <pb break="no"

                    effects of Oriental luxury and extravagance, forbade the use of mixed textures
                    such as would be produced by wool and flax in combination.</p>
                <p>The particular garments of the Israelites, of which express mention is made,
                    include the following :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Under Garments.—</hi> (1.) The <hi rend="italic">sadin,</hi>
                    a light wrapper, worn next to the person. (2.) The <hi rend="italic"
                    >cetoneth,</hi> or under-tunic, either sleeveless or having open sleeves,
                    moderately loose, varying in length, and adjusted about the waist in such a
                    manner as to form a pocket from an overlapping fold. Corresponding with the
                    modern <hi rend="italic">kaftan,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">cetoneth</hi> was
                    habitually in use, worn either with or without the <hi rend="italic">sadin,</hi>
                    by both sexes, and by persons of all ranks. (3.) The <hi rend="italic"
                    >miel,</hi> or over-tunic, made with sleeves, longer and somewhat thicker in
                    substance than the <hi rend="italic">cetoneth,</hi> and, like it, in general
                    use. To both these garments the term ’ ‘ coat” is applied in our version of the
                    ancient Scriptures.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Outer Garments.—</hi> To all these garments, alike in being
                    designed only for occasional use or for use under exceptional conditions and
                    circumstances, in their generic character the term “cloak,” as understood by
                    ourselves, appears to have been applicable. Of these cloaks, robes, mantles, or
                    wrappers there were several varieties, which differed from each other as well in
                    form as in material, substance, and ornamentation; fringes, however, seem to
                    have been generally attached to them; and they were worn with various modes of
                    adjustment. The word <hi rend="italic">malbush</hi> distinguished a robe of
                    state. Express mention is made, but unattended with any precise descriptive
                    notices, of more than one variety of shawl, worn by women, which might be so
                    adjusted as to form a head-covering in addition to enveloping the person. To
                    very light female robes also, which were long and flowing, occasional references
                    are made. Of the male head-dresses worn by Israelites, distinct from such
                    coverings for the head as might act as hoods formed by wrapping the mantle or
                    cloak about the head, we have no exact knowledge. Though no such relics are
                    known to be still in existence, goldsmiths’ work and jewellery certainly enjoyed
                    a high degree of estimation in ancient Israel, as always has been the case with
                    all Eastern races; and they constituted important elements in the decoration of
                    Jewish costume.</p>
                <p>The passages of chief importance in the Old Testament, in which the vestments of
                    the priesthood are enumerated and described, occur in Exodus xxviii., xxix., and
                    xxxix., and in Leviticus viii. and xvi. In the Apocryphal books also reference
                    may be made to Ecclesiasticus xlv., and to 1 Maccabees X. 21, in which last
                    passage the entire investiture of the high priest is designed to be understood.
                    Very full descriptive notices of the sacerdotal vestments of the Jewish
                    priesthood are given by Josephus, in his <hi rend="italic">Antiquities,</hi>
                    iii. 7, and in his <hi rend="italic">Wars, v. v.</hi> 7. Further illustration on
                    the same subject is given in his <hi rend="italic">Epistle to</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fabiola,</hi> ii. 574, written at Bethlehem by St Jerome, 396 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>An “order” or <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> change of garments,” for a man—
                    always in the East highly esteemed as both an honourable and a valuable
                    present—among the Israelites consisted of a <hi rend="italic">cenoneth</hi> and
                    a <hi rend="italic">miel,</hi> with perhaps a <hi rend="italic">sadin,</hi> and
                    certainly one or more of the occasional outer robes, mantles, or cloaks. In
                    presents of this kind, the number of the “changes of garments,” which from their
                    loose and flowing character would not fail to adapt themselves to general use,
                    was studiously adjusted to the degree of estimation in which the recipient was
                    held, and not without an indirect and yet significant reference to the dignity
                    of the giver. The expression “naked,” when applied to an Israelite, denoted, not
                    a condition of actual nudity, but the fact of being attired only in a single
                    under garment, and consequently implied the being in readiness for active
                    exercise or violent exertion. The strongly marked and comprehensive distinction
                    between the East and the West receives a characteristic illustration in the
                    Oriental usage of uncovering the feet and covering the head, in token of respect
                    and even of adoration. The “rending the garments,” generally the outer garment
                    only, an act so strange to us in the West, to the Israelites, in common with
                    other Orientals, was peculiarly significant of grief, indignation, humiliation,
                    and despair.</p>
                <p>Among the figures painted in the very ancient tomb at Beni Hassan, in Egypt,
                    occurs a group of figures from which the annexed woodcut has been drawn (fig.
                    11), conjectured to represent the arrival of Joseph’s brethren when they went to
                    purchase corn in the land of the Pharaohs. Again, considerably later, but as
                    early as the days of the Pharaoh - Necho by whom Josiah was defeated and slain
                    at Megiddo, among some figures sculptured in one of the tombs discovered by
                    Belzoni, near Thebes, which represent captives of different nations brought
                    before their Egyptian conqueror, four Jews are supposed to have been introduced
                    after the manner shown in fig. 12. The fringe commanded by Moses, Num. xv. 38,
                    to be worn ’by his people, and which probably was a relic of a still more
                    ancient usage in the family of Jacob, may be considered to have been shown in
                    both these groups. In the almost total absence of other not less improbable
                    ancient examples, these figures may be accepted as contemporary representations
                    of persons whose attire, such as it is shown to have been, at any rate may be
                    considered to represent corresponding articles of dress in use in ancient
                    Israel. Captive Jews, once more, are undoubtedly represented in the fine series
                    of Assyrian bas-reliefs commemorating the capture of Lachish by Sennacherib,
                    discovered and described by Mr Layard <hi rend="italic">(Nineveh and
                    Babylon,</hi> p. 152; and 2d series of <hi rend="italic">Monuments of
                    Nineveh,</hi> plates xx. toxxiv.) The physiognomy of these Jewish captives is
                    strikingly indicated in the sculptures in question, but of their national
                    costume but very little-is shown; for “they had been stripped of their ornaments
                    and their fine raiment, and were left barefooted and half-clothed. From the
                    women, too, had been removed the ‘ splendor of the foot ornaments, and the caps
                    of network, and the crescents; the ear pendents, and the bracelets, and the thin
                    veils; the head-dresses, and the ornaments of the legs, and the girdles, and the
                    perfume boxes, and the amulets; the rings and the jewels of the nose; the
                    embroidered robes, and the tunics, and the cloaks, and the satchels; the
                    transparent garments, and the fine linen vests, and the turbans, and the
                    mantles; ’ for they wore, ‘ instead of a girdle, a rope; and, instead of a
                    stomacher, a girding of sackcloth.’” (See Isa. iii. 18, &amp;c.; and Ezek. xvi.
                    10, &amp;c.) Upon the exceedingly interesting description of the dress worn in
                    ancient times by the women of Israel, as given by the two great prophets, Mr
                    Layard remarks that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n491/mode/1up"

                    ornaments enumerated, probably, indeed, the whole of them, if we were acquainted
                    with the exact meaning of the Hebrew words, are still to be traced in the
                    costumes of Eastern women inhabiting the same country. Many appear to be
                    mentioned in the Assyrian inscrip tions among objects of tribute and spoil
                    brought to the king.” With this deference to the dress and ornaments of the
                    female inhabitants of Syria at the present day, of whom twogroupsare represented
                    in figs. 13 and 14, the following brief but graphic passage from the same
                    writer’s <hi rend="italic">Nineveh and Babylon</hi> (p. 472) may consistently be
                    associated. On approaching Baghdad, the low banks of the Tigris — the river
                    itself gradually becoming wider and wider, and its stream being almost
                    motionless—were seen to “swarm with Arabs,—men, women, and naked children.
                    Horsemen and riders on white asses were hurrying along the river side. Turks in
                    flowing rcbes and broad turbans; Persians in high black caps and close-fitting
                    tunics; the Bokhara pilgrim in his white head-dress and way-worn garments; the
                    Bedouin chief in his tasselled <hi rend="italic">keſſieh</hi> and striped <hi
                    rend="italic">aba</hi>; Baghdad ladies, with their scarlet and white draperies
                    fretted with threads of gold, and their black horse-hair veils concealing even
                    their eyes; Persian women wrapped in their sightless garments; and Arab girls in
                    their simple blue shirts,—all were mingled together in one motley crowd.” In the
                    costume in common and constant use at the present day, as well by men—such as is
                    exemplified in the groups shown in figs. 15 and 16—as by women in the towns and
                    villages of Syria, may be discerned the transmitted representations of the
                    general character and aspect of the attire of the same regions in remote
                    centuries; as, in like manner, the patriarchal dress of ancient Israel may be
                    assumed to have had its primitive type in a great measure reproduced in our own
                    times in the long coarse shirt, the ample striped <hi rend="italic">aba</hi> of
                    camels’ hair (the coloured stripe that alternates with the white one, denoting
                    the wearer’s tribe), 'and the red and yellow <hi rend="italic">kefiîeh,</hi>
                    folded and tied in hereditary fashion about his swarthy face and over his neck
                    and shoulders by the Bedouin Arab of the desert (fig. 17).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Oriental.</hi></p>
                <p>If it may be said, as it may certainly be said with truth, of Oriental costume
                    both in its general character and its specific details, that it is
                    distinguished, in contrast to that of the ever-changing West, by the pervading
                    and characteristic unchangeableness of the East, equally true it is that the
                    vast populations which throng the wide expanse of the earth’s surface included
                    in “The East,” comprehend in their numbers the inheritors and the wearers of
                    costumes exhibiting in many peculiar and distinctive features an almost endless
                    variety. At the same time, precisely as a distinct recognition as well of the
                    range as of the applicability and the significance of the one term “The East”
                    suggests no confusion of ideas respecting different Eastern realms and peoples,
                    so also all Oriental costume so far bears the impress of Eastern requirement and
                    association as in a certain degree to admit of a single general classification.
                    Thus, unlike to each other in not a few of their personal qualities as any two
                    human beings well could be, and differing also in many decidedly marked
                    particulars in regard to their costume, the nomad Bedouin of Arabia in every
                    essential respect is no less a true and truly typical Oriental than the most
                    gorgeously attired and, after his fashion, the most refined of the native
                    potentates of Hindustan. So, also, notwithstanding the points of difference
                    between their costumes, the costume as well of the one as of the other is
                    unmistakably Oriental. The same may be said of the dresses of the different
                    races that inhabit Hindustan. And they all share an equally true Oriental
                    brotherhood, and especially in externals, in however decided a manner and degree
                    each race may bear its own distinctive impress even in those very externals,
                    with the natives of Japan and China and Burmah, of Persia, Arabia, Modern Egypt,
                    Armenia, and Turkey, and with other Eastern races also that need not to be here
                    particularized. Unless when circumstances reduce their attire to proportions so
                    scanty as scarcely, if at all, to exceed that of the savage tribes who inhabit
                    some tropical districts, or when influenced by some exceptional conditions, all
                    Orientals are more or less inclined to wear loose and long and flowing garments;
                    their trousers, when any are worn, are very large and gathered in at the ankles;
                    they have their heads habitually covered, whether with a turban, fez, or some
                    variety of cap of a local hereditary style; their feet, when not bare, are very
                    lightly equipped; they delight in white fabrics, mingled with such as exhibit
                    the most brilliant colours and the richest designs; and they indulge in an
                    abundance and variety of personal ornaments. Also a general resemblance prevails
                    between the costumes of the two sexes. The decorative arts of China and Japan,
                    always national both in the selection and the treatment of their subjects, in
                    connection with certain universally esteemed varieties of their manufactures,
                    have familiarized the world with the typical characteristics of the costumes
                    worn by all ranks and classes in those countries. Recent events have caused the
                    more remarkable costumes of India to become well known through several popular
                    publications; and the same may also be said concerning the costumes of other
                    Oriental nations, and those of them more particularly which are nearest to
                    Europe and have the closest relations <pb break="no"

                    the costume of the modern Greeks exhibits semi-Oriental qualities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ecclesiastical.</hi></p>
                <p>Without extending to any notice of the ordinary attire habitually worn in
                    everyday life, at successive periods, by ecclesiastical personages of all ranks
                    and orders in the Christian church, <hi rend="italic">ecclesiastical
                    costumes</hi> here may be considered to imply and consequently to include the
                    vestments, distinctively official and ministerial in their character and use,
                    which such personages would wear only when actually engaged in the functions of
                    their respective offices, or on occasions of special state and solemnity. The
                    habits, which with the advance of time came to be assumed by the members of the
                    monastic orders, may most appropriately and advantageously be treated apart by
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>That ministering vestments, properly so called, and with them ecclesiastical
                    insignia, were unknown among Christians of the apostolic age may be considered
                    as unquestionably certain; and, in like manner, in the three succeeding
                    centuries only the faintest traces, if indeed any authentic traces whatever of
                    such vestments can be said either to exist, or to have left indications of ever
                    having existed. The long and flowing garments, suggestive of peaceful repose and
                    enjoyment, and always in some degree endowed with dignified associations,
                    whenever the circumstances of the times would permit, doubtless, were worn by
                    the primitive Christian ministers when discharging their official duties; but it
                    also is no less certain that on the same occasions precisely similar garments
                    were generally worn by Christian worshippers, whose condition justified their
                    appearing in them. During the prolonged stormy period of the second group of
                    four centuries in the Christian era the primitive ecclesiastical costume—the
                    costume, be it remembered, at times of joyous festival and solemn ceremonial
                    adopted by <hi rend="italic">all</hi> persons of comparatively high social
                    standing—still was retained unchanged in its general style and aspect, and
                    having experienced only such slight modifications and additions as naturally
                    would have their development with the course of events. As time passed on,
                    keeping pace both with innovations upon primitive doctrine and with vicissitudes
                    of political position, in various ways these modifications became modified, and
                    to these additions fresh novelties gradually were added. Even at the
                    commencement of the 9th century, when the true historic era of ecclesiastical
                    costume may be defined to have commenced with it, the two most remarkable
                    circumstances in connection with ecclesiastical costume were, on the one hand,
                    its approximately unchanged character, and, on the other hand, its close general
                    resemblance, amounting almost to identity, to the old civil costume, which in
                    the state dresses of the Roman official dignitaries survived the sweeping
                    changes of barbarian revolution. It is worthy of especial remark that the
                    earliest evidence of the introduction of any insignia distinctive of rank and
                    dignity in ecclesiastical costume is to be derived from the presence of two dark
                    strips of varying width on the long white tunics in which certain early figures,
                    certainly to be regarded as habited in ecclesiastical vestments, are
                    represented; and these strips can be considered in no other light than as
                    adaptations from the <hi rend="italic">clavi,</hi> some broad and others narrow,
                    so well known in classic attire to distinguish the Roman senatorial and
                    equestrian ranks. Equally remarkable is the fact that the Christian hierarchy
                    should have derived the insignia of their rank in the church, through the high
                    position of civil power in the state exercised by the early bishops of Rome,
                    from the official decorations of the Roman magistracy as well of the republic as
                    of the empire. It will be borne in mind that all changes in ecclesiastical
                    vestments, and all additions to those of early date, made by authority during
                    the Middle Ages, were designed to be suggestive of some symbolical motive and to
                    convey some doctrinal significance—considerations, however important in many
                    respects in themselves, which it would be out of place here to discuss even
                    superficially, when treating of all ecclesiastical vestments simply in their
                    capacity as “costume.” In connection also with the full development in the llth
                    and 12th centuries of that type of vestments which, when once it had been
                    formally established, has been maintained with but slight modifications in the
                    Roman Church to the present time, no unimportant part was taken by the attempts,
                    first contemplated in the 9th century, that were made to assimilate such
                    vestments as might be distinctive of the Christian ministry with those appointed
                    in the Mosaic law for the priesthood in Israel. The idea that any such
                    similitude might exist, or should be made to attain to existence, once having
                    arisen would naturally take a strong íiold on the minds of the more ambitious
                    and also of the more learned ecclesiastics of those times. So, when in the first
                    instance the points of difference between the two types of vestments were found
                    to be far more decided than those of resemblance, a process of deliberate
                    assimilation was decreed, which brought about as close an approximation between
                    the two types as was held to be desirable—an approximation, it scarcely is
                    necessary to add, that removed the elaborate and ornate vestments of mediaeval
                    Christendom as far as possible from retaining any affinity to the dignified
                    simplicity of Christian ministerial costume in primitive times.</p>

                    the bishop, the <hi rend="italic">orarium,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">ring,</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">staff;</hi> of the presbyter, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >orarium</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">planeta;</hi> and of the deacon, the <hi
                    rend="italic">orarium</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">alba</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">alb.</hi> In this definition it may be assumed to have been
                    implied that the <hi rend="italic">alb</hi> was common to the three orders, as
                    the <hi rend="italic">planeta</hi> was worn by bishops as well as by presbyters.
                    Its name abbreviated from <hi rend="italic">tunica alba,</hi> and at first the
                    simple and yet dignified white linen tunic that in the primitive ages was held
                    to be the costume appropriate for the Christian ministry, in the 9th century the
                    <hi rend="italic">alb</hi> began to have its loose and flowing proportions
                    contracted; and these changes were continued until the vestment was made to fit
                    with comparative closeness about the person of the wearer, when it was confined
                    about the waist by a narrow girdle. The pure simplicity of the early white tunic
                    also was superseded by the addition of rich “orfreys'’ <hi rend="italic"
                    >(aurifrigia)</hi> of embroidery and goldsmiths’ work. These “apparels” <hi
                    rend="italic">(parurae),</hi> in the form of masses and stripes, were attached
                    to the lower part of the alb and to the wrists of its sleeves. In the second
                    half of the 14th century the wrist-apparels of albs, instead of encircling the
                    sleeves as previously had been the custom, appear only upon the upper part of
                    them.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Stole,</hi> the name in the 9th century given to the
                    ancient <hi rend="italic">orarium,,</hi> itself as it would seem having its
                    prototypes in the Roman <hi rend="italic">clavi,</hi> is a narrow scarf adjusted
                    about the neck so as to have its extremities hanging down in front of the
                    wearer. Originally white and without ornament, stoles after a time were made of
                    various colours, were enriched with orfreys and fringed at their ends. Worn
                    immediately over the alb, the stole is crossed upon the breast of the wearer,
                    being retained in that position by passing under the girdle. When the chasuble
                    is worn, and worn without the episcopal dalmatic and tunic, the ends of the
                    stole appear issuing from beneath it. In some few early ecclesiastical effigies,
                    which are without a chasuble, but in its stead have a cope open in front, the
                    entire adjustment of tiιe stole is distinctly shown, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n493/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0493-0462"/> as in fig. 18 drawn from a brass at Horsham, This
                    effigy also shows in what manner the alb, amice, and maniple are worn, and it
                    may advantageously be compared with fig. 20, also drawn from a brass to Peter de
                    Lacy, rector of Northfleet, in Northfleet Church, in which the stole for the
                    most part is covered by the chasuble. Its ancient name <hi rend="italic"
                    >orarium,</hi> equivalent to our “handkerchief,” shows the mediaeval stole to
                    have been designed as well to wipe the face as, in accordance with primitive
                    usage, to cover it when offering prayer. For deacons it was appointed to wear
                    the stole depending from over the left shoulder only, so as to show but one end
                    of it on the front of their persons (fig. 19). The idea of a connection in the
                    significance of the stole to denote dignity with the ribband worn as a knightly
                    distinction is obvious.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Maniple.—</hi> A short species of stole, the
                    representative of the ancient <hi rend="italic">mappula</hi> and its successor,
                    the maniple, which is worn so as to hang from the left wrist, may be considered
                    to have been substituted in the first instance for the purposes to which the
                    stole itself originally had been applied. Like the stole, however, the maniple,
                    regarded as one of the ecclesiastical vestments as early as the 9th century,
                    soon became merely a decorative accessory'· of the official costume of
                    ecclesiastics (see figs. 18, 20).</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">Chasuble.—</hi> This super-vestment, worn over the alb
                    and the stole, and by ecclesiastics of episcopal rank also over the dalmatic and
                    tunic, which in the 11th century was expressly associated with the
                    ecclesiastical office, is identical with the <hi rend="italic">casula</hi> of
                    the 9th century and, through it, derived from the <hi rend="italic">plancta</hi>
                    of still earlier times. Both <hi rend="italic">plancta</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">casula,</hi> however, as over-garments furnished with a hood which
                    would envelop the entire person, were worn by laymen, the chief if not the only
                    distinction between these two garments being that the former from its greater
                    costliness was in use by persons of rank and wealth, while the latter was
                    adopted by the humbler and poorer classes. In form and general character both
                    the <hi rend="italic">plancta</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">casula</hi> appear
                    to have resembled the ancient <hi rend="italic">paenula,</hi> an outer garment
                    worn in Italy long before our era, and of which the memory still survives in the
                    title of the ecclesiastical super-vestment of the East. Circular or oval in
                    form, and having in the centre an aperture for the head of the wearer to pass
                    through, the chasuble covers the arms as well as the body, so that when they are
                    raised it falls over the arms both before and behind. Made of various materials
                    and of different colours, in early representations of it this vestment is
                    constantly found to have been elaborately adorned with embroideries and other
                    decorative accessories, also with a profusion of orfreys in gold and silver work
                    enriched with gems (fig.</p>
                <p>20). A favourite form of chasuble-orfrey, evidently an imitation of the
                    archiépiscopal pall, encircles the head-aperture and, passing over the shoulders
                    of the wearer, falls in a straight line down both the back and the front of his
                    person.</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">Amice.—</hi> First mentioned as a vestment in the 9th
                    century, and from the following century enriched with apparels, when opened out
                    the <hi rend="italic">amice</hi> was square in shape, and it was adjusted
                    precisely after the manner of its present adjustment, beneath both alb and
                    chasuble, about the throat and over the shoulders. In monumental effigies the
                    apparel of this vestment is represented either falling back from the throat of
                    the wearer, or, in the later examples, standing up somewhat stiffly around it;
                    and this position over the chasuble sometimes has suggested the mistaken idea
                    that the apparel of the amice forms a collar to the chasuble itself. By holding
                    it for a few moments over the head at the time of putting it on, the amice in
                    course of time was considered to symbolize the Christian helmet (see fig.
                    20).</p>
                <p>6. ’ lhe <hi rend="italic">Dalmatic,</hi> a full-sleeved tunic reaching about to
                    the knees. Long after its adoption as an ecclesiastical vestment, the dalmatic
                    continued in use in Rome as a garment appropriate for secular officials on
                    occasions of ceremony and state; and at the present time it continues, as it
                    continued through the Middle Ages, to be a royal robe as well in England as on
                    the Continent. _ Like the other ancient vestments, originally white and plain,
                    in the 10 th century the dalmatic assumed various colours, and in the 12th and
                    the succeeding centuries it followed t he colour of the chasuble. Appointed to
                    bo worn by deacons over the alb as the distinctive vestment of their order, when
                    made of costly materials and richly adorned the dalmatic was added to their
                    official costume by prelates, by them to be worn immediately under the chasuble.
                    In early episcopal effigies the lower part of the dalmatic is represented,
                    appearing beneath the chasuble, richly fringed and partially slit up at the
                    sides, as in fig. 21, drawn from the corresponding part of the brass to Thomas
                    Cranley, archbishop of Dublin, in the chapel of New College, Oxford, 1417.
                    Nearly a century earlier (1325), in the cathedral of St Nazairβ at Carcassonne
                    in France, the statue of Bishop Pierre de Roquefort, which is without the
                    chasuble, shows with admirable distinctness the form and adjustment of the
                    episcopal dalmatic, with the tunic appearing beneath it, the ends of the stole
                    being visible issuing from beneath them both. The large sleeves of the dalmatic
                    and the tight sleeves of the tunic are shown at the wrists, and from the left
                    wrist the maniple hangs down (fig. 22). Over the other vestment (as in fig. 18)
                    is a cope, fastened across the breast with a morse charged with an <hi
                    rend="italic">Agnus Dei.</hi> The prelate wears his mitre, and in his hand he
                    holds his pastoral-staff. In England, in Norwich Cathedral, there is a similar
                    example of the episcopal habit in the effigy of Bishop Goldwell (1498), which re
                    presents both dalmatic and tunic as shorter than in the French statue; the
                    dalmatic also has a broad central vertical band of rich embroidery, and at the
                    wrists the sleeves of the alb, tunic, and dalmatic are shown. Figures of
                    deacons, rare in mediaeval art, when they occur generally profess to represent
                    St Lawrence, with the instrument of his martyrdom. In fig. 23, reduced from a
                    drawing on vellum in a MS. of the 13th century in the Lambeth Library, the
                    dalmatic, which is nearly as long as the unusually short alb, is shown as it was
                    ornamented and worn at that period. Another good example, much later in date,
                    also a figure of St Lawrence, is sculptured in one of the canopied compartments
                    of the monumental chantry of Prince Arthur Tudor in Worcester Cathedral. Fig.
                    19, from the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Pontificalis</hi> of
                    Landolfus, a MS. of the 9th century, shows how the stole was disposed over the
                    left shoulder by a deacon wearing an alb and a dalmatic.</p>
                <p>7. The <hi rend="italic">Tunic.—</hi> The vestment distinguished by this name,
                    worn by prelates between the alb and the dalmatic, is rather longer than the
                    vestment last named, and its sleeves also are somewhat longer and not quite so
                    full. As the vestments increased in number, and at the same time became less
                    simple and more splendid, the gradual addition of one tunic after another, to be
                    traced from the 9th century downwards, was strictly in keeping with the spirit
                    of the times. Early in the 14th century it had a remarkable parallel in the
                    succession of surcoats, with which, regardless of their palpable inconvenience,
                    the knights covered their armour. It is specially curious to observe how
                    studiously the men-at-arms carried out their imitation of the ecclesiastical
                    vestments of their day, by making each one of their successive surcoats in front
                    of their persons shorter than the one beneath it, so displaying them all. In the
                    case of the ecclesiastical vestments, the tunic proper, become distinctively <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n494/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0494-0463"/> the <hi rend="italic">alb</hi> or under-tunic,
                    was covered by the <hi rend="italic">tunic,</hi> a rich and splendid vestment;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">dalmatic,</hi> shorn of its ancient length in order to
                    leave the second or middle tunic visible, followed, third in order, and became
                    the super-tunic of the group. The tunic, like the dalmatic, partially slit at
                    its sides and generally fringed, is well represented in monumental effigies and
                    other early works (see fig· 21).</p>
                <p>8. The <hi rend="italic">Cope,</hi> a voluminous cloak or outer garment,
                    originally furnished with a hood for covering and protecting the head, and of
                    sufficient size to envelop the entire person of the wearer, would naturally
                    admit of every possible variety in material, colour, and ornamentation, and it
                    also would be used as well by laymen, as by ecclesiastics of all orders and by
                    monks. Richly adorned copes, however, appear in mediaeval times to have been
                    considered as almost exclusively ecclesiastical vestments of stately dignity, to
                    be worn ∕∣ι processions and on those ceremonial occasions which would be
                    distinguished from the service of the altar. Such copes, having splendid
                    border-apparels into which canopied figures of sainted personages frequently
                    were introduced with heraldic and other devices, were fastened across the breast
                    by a morse, often of costly material and highly artistic workmanship (see fig.
                    22).</p>
                <p>9. The <hi rend="italic">Almuce</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aumuce,</hi> a hood of
                    fur, was apparently introduced in the 13th century, its object being to afford
                    protection from cold in processions, &amp;c., and in the 15th century a cape and
                    pendants also of fur were added to it.</p>
                <p>10. The <hi rend="italic">Surplice,</hi> an alb, almost of primitive form, ample
                    and flowing, and closely resembling the surplice of the present day, was in use
                    in the Middle Ages in processions and on certain occasions of ceremony. An
                    excellent example of a surplice of the 15th century is given in the noble brass
                    to Prior Nelond, at Cowfold, Sussex, 1433.</p>
                <p>11. The <hi rend="italic">Mitre.—</hi> First mentioned among ecclesiastical
                    vestments about the middle of the 12th century, though some kind of dignified
                    episcopal head-gear certainly had been in use considerably earlier, the mitre
                    originally was made of linen embroidered; and it does not appear in its
                    well-known double or cleft form until the 12th century had made a considerable
                    advance, when it began to be constructed of some rich material and to receive
                    costly adornment. Previous to the 14th century, when they attained to the
                    perfection of their form, mitres were very low, their contour then being concave
                    Subsequently they became more and more elevated, and their contour was changed
                    from concave to convex. Two short bands of some rich material, fringed at the
                    ends, form the <hi rend="italic">infulae</hi> of a mitre, and depend from it,
                    one on either side.</p>
                <p>12. The <hi rend="italic">Crosier</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pastoral-Staff.—</hi> The former, having a cross-head, is appropriated to
                    archbishops; and the latter, the official pastoral-staff of bishops and abbots,
                    has a crook-head, like the head of a shepherd’s staff. Expressly mentioned as
                    the ensign of the episcopal office in the first half of tne 7th century, as
                    early as the 10th century the pastoral-staff became enriched with elaborate and
                    precious ornamentation, and was adorned with a <hi rend="italic">vexillum,</hi>
                    or scarf, attached to the staff immediately below the cross or crookhead. The
                    idea that some special signification is conveyed by the position in which in
                    monumental effigies and in other episcopal figures the pastoral-staff is
                    represented to be held appears to be without any foundation.</p>
                <p>13. The episcopal <hi rend="italic">Ring, Gloves,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Boots.—</hi> Early in the 7th century, and probably still earlier, a ring of
                    large size, to be worn on the right hand, formed a regular part of the episcopal
                    insignia; and in the full development of the vestments which took place in the
                    12th century, embroidered gloves, made with an opening to display the ring, and
                    corresponding boots or shoes were included as components of the full official
                    attire of the hierarchy.</p>
                <p>14. The <hi rend="italic">Pall (“Pallium").—</hi> This remarkable vestment, sent
                    by the Pope to prelates of archiépiscopal rank, and restricted to their order,
                    being in fact a peculiar form of the orarium or stole, consists of a narrow band
                    of white lamb’s wool, forming a circle to rest on the chasuble around the throat
                    and over the shoulders, from which circle depend two other bands of the same
                    fabric and width to hang down, the one on the front and the other on the back of
                    the prelate, thus, whether seen in front or behind, presenting the appearance of
                    the letter Y. The depending bands, which terminate in fringes and appear
                    occasionally to have been fastened with golden pins to the chasuble, like the
                    circular band, are charged with crosses pattée-fitchée of black or purple silk.
                    This pall, constantly represented in early works of Christian art through
                    successive centuries, and blazoned among ourselves in the armorial insignia of
                    the archiépiscopal see of Canterbury, is seen to have varied but slightly in
                    either its form or its adjustment from the 9th century to the 16th. An apparel,
                    evidently designed to represent the pall, is found constantly to have been
                    adopted for the ornamentation of mediaeval chasubles. The pall still in use in
                    the Roman Church has the pendant bands considerably shorter than they appear in
                    the early representations (see fig. 21).</p>

                    distinctively for episcopal use, and also after the Reformation to have been
                    allied to the full lawn-sleeves well known at the present day, from being well
                    suited to be worn under another vestment. By prelates of the Reformed Church a
                    short cassock of black silk is worn with their ordinary attire. A long loose
                    black cassock also was commonly worn by ecclesiastics during the 17th and 18th
                    centuries.</p>

                    what has been said of the vestments in use in Western Christendom, and
                    particularly in reference to their use during the first eight centuries of our
                    era, with comparatively slight modifications, is also applicable to the official
                    vestments of the church in the East,—the chief distinctions between the
                    vestments of the East and the West, in addition to such as may in a great degree
                    be traced to the influences of climate and to certain local associations, being
                    a closer adherence in the former than in the latter to the earliest usages. The
                    Greek Church also, being very tenacious in its own usages, to the present day
                    retains everywhere its mediaeval vestments, their forms, names, and uses
                    remaining unchanged—the <hi rend="italic">sticharion</hi> corresponding with the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Dominicans,</hi> or “Black Friars.”—Same habit as that worn by

                    girded with a cord; hood or cowl and cloak of the same.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carmelites,</hi> or “White Friars. ”—Habit white throughout;
                    but from about 1240 to about 1290, their cloaks were party-coloured, white and
                    red.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Austin Friars,</hi> or “Eremites.”—White cassock girded with a
                    leather thong, with short tunic and hood; and over these, long, black gown with
                    wide sleeves and hood.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Crossed (“Crutched ”) Friars.—</hi> Blue habit, with plain red

                    with eight-pointed cross of red and blue.</p>
                <p>The monastic garment named “scapulary,' ’ the exact character of which has not
                    been decidedly determined, appears to have been a short super-tunic, sleeveless,
                    but having a hood or cowl.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Academic.</hi></p>
                <p>In the Middle Ages, professors or doctors and bachelors of divinity, and
                    graduates of the universities above the rank of bachelor in the faculties of
                    arts and law, in addition to the customary costume of their time and station, in
                    connection with their academic rank wore long flowing gowns having slits at the
                    sides for their arms to pass through, with large capes or tippets and hoods, the
                    latter having pendant streamers, these capes and hoods in many instances forming
                    parts of the same article of dress. Graduates of the highest rank also wore
                    round caps, pointed in the crown, and of a dark colour. In the 15th century,
                    when distinctions appear first to have been introduced into the costumes of
                    masters and bachelors of arts, the gowns of the latter were shorter than those
                    of masters, and had <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0495-0464"/> full sleeves reaching to the wrists and pointed
                    at the back. The capes and hoods of bachelors also were bordered with white fur
                    or wool. By various peculiarities of form, colour, and lining, the gowns, capes,
                    and hoods of graduates of all the higher ranks certainly were distinguished; but
                    in the comparatively rare examples of monumental effigies represented in
                    academic habit, which almost without exception are destitute of colour, these
                    distinctions are not shown in any regular or marked and decided manner.
                    Throughout the last two hundred years, if not for a still longer period, the
                    academic habits of the University of Oxford have retained their forms unaltered.
                    They may generally be classified in two groups—ecclesiastical and civil. The
                    gowns of the former, worn by all graduates in both divinity and arts, and also
                    by all members on the foundation of any college, have loose sleeves, are
                    destitute of collars and gathered in in small plaits at the back, and bear a
                    general resemblance to what is known of the more ancient habits, the sleeves of
                    the masters’ gowns still having slits (now cut horizontally, instead of
                    vertically) for the passage of the arms. On the other hand, the gowns of
                    graduates in law and the other faculties, and of undergraduates who are not on
                    the foundation of any college, besides being of less ample proportions, have
                    falling collars and closer sleeves, which latter in the undergraduates’ gowns
                    have dwindled into mere strips; and they evidently derive their origin from
                    parts of the ordinary dress of civilians in the 16th and 17th centuries. The
                    gowns of graduates of the University of Cambridge for the most part are the same
                    as those worn in the sister university; but at Cambridge the undergraduates, not
                    being on the foundation, of almost every college have a gown appropriated to
                    their own college. The hoods of their degrees worn by graduates in the faculties
                    of divinity and arts are distinguished as follows:— D.D., Oxford scarlet cloth,
                    lined with black silk; Cambridge, scarlet cloth, lined with lilac blossom or
                    pink silk , Μ.A., Oxford, black, lined with cherry-colour or crimson; Cambridge,
                    black, lined with white; Dublin, lined with blue; Durham, lined with purple;
                    London, lined with brown. B.A. hoods are black and bordered with white fur.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Early European and Mediaeval.</hi></p>
                <p>For the purpose of the present article the terms “early European” and “mediaeval”
                    may be considered to apply to the period ranging from the withdrawal of the
                    Romans from Britain to the accession of the Stuarts to the thròne of Great
                    Britain—that is, from about the close of the first quarter of the 5th century to
                    the commencement of the 17th century; and the latter term, “mediaeval,” may date
                    the commencement of its application from the establishment of his Anglo-Saxon
                    dynasty by Egbert at the opening of the 9th century.</p>
                <p>A prolonged period of total darkness having passed away, at first, and for a
                    considerable time, in addition to written descriptions and indirect notices
                    which frequently are far from being intelligible, and to such actual relics as
                    originally were deposited with the remains of the dead without any view either
                    to monumental commemoration or to historical illustration, the authorities are
                    restricted to the illuminated compositions which so happily are associated with
                    early MSS. After a while, the earliest seals and some ivory carvings lend such
                    aid as may lie within the compass of their power Next follow those invaluable
                    illustrators of costume, monumental effigies of every class, with which may be
                    allied figures represented in architectural sculpture and painting, upon seals
                    also and coins. Actual relics throughout the era of monumental effigies
                    gradually increase in both number and variety, until at length the ages of
                    personal portraiture, properly so called, are duly reached. It will be borne in
                    mind that until some years after the close of the 15 th century, defensive
                    armour occupied a most important position in what strictly was the “costume” of
                    the men of the higher classes, whose effigies, with rare exceptions only, appear
                    sculptured, engraven, or painted in their armour, precisely as the men
                    themselves had been armed and equipped when in life. In the Middle Ages in
                    Europe, costume, considered as dress distinct and distinguished from armour, was
                    affected in no slight degree by the prevailing character of the armour of each
                    successive period, so long as a defensive equipment of any kind continued to be
                    generally adopted. Dresses that had been devised expressly to be worn, some of
                    them under defences of mail or plate, and others over them, suggested much in
                    the way of garments that never would, have any direct connection with armour.
                    Again, when not armed, nobles, knights, and men-at-arms naturally would adopt
                    such loose and flowing garments as would combine the greatest degree of ease
                    with a dignified aspect; and their example in this respect would be certain to
                    be very widely followed. The feudal system, also, powerfully aided by the
                    heraldic sentiment that at once grew up in the feudal era and gave to it its
                    tone and colour, exercised a powerful influence upon the costume of the various
                    classes who, under varying conditions, were dependent upon a common feudal
                    superior. And this influence, while adapting itself in matters of detail to
                    personal considerations, in its general bearing acted with uniform effect upon
                    the entire community. Of the extravagance of so many of the diverse costumes
                    that followed each other in rapid succession during the 14th and 15th centuries,
                    much may be directly traced to the development of heraldry in those ages, and to
                    the enthusiastic delight in armorial devices and insignia then universally
                    prevalent. The singular resemblance in many marked particulars between the
                    dresses of the two sexes, observable in the Middle Ages, undoubtedly was
                    stimulated by the science and art of the contemporary heralds; as the strange
                    and often wildly fantastic crests and the mantlings displayed upon their helms
                    and basinets by the one sex were parodied, and sometimes were fairly outdone, by
                    the equally strange and no less wildly fanciful head-gear adopted by the other
                    sex, with a view either to conceal or to enhance the natural glory of their
                    hair. Mediaeval costume, once more, would experience both changes and
                    modifications arising out of the introduction of fresh manufactures, and
                    necessarily resulting from the constantly expanding range of the foreign
                    commercial relations of different coun tri es. Costume, moreover, would be
                    certain to be attracted by the progressive phases of national civilization,
                    culture, and refinement, even though it might not consistently keep pace with
                    them. Fashion, too, always arbitrary and often inexplicable, would not fail to
                    do its work effectually, under the diversified conditions and aspects of
                    advancing centuries, among races by whom to costume it is assigned, not merely
                    to clothe the persons of both sexes, but also to display and adorn the human
                    figure.</p>
                <p>It will be observed that, in all countries among civilized races, in the degree
                    that climate is more temperate, in that same degree is costume more liable to
                    changes and fluctuations, and more completely under the sway of fashion. In
                    regions that are very hot or very cold, fashion, however quaint and eccentric,
                    is long-lived and tenacious of its hold, so that the costume of one generation
                    for the most part is reflected in that of its successor. In like manner,
                    costume, and especially in its general character, is comparatively permanent
                    among mountaineers. The history of costume, it must be added, approximately
                    complete and explicit as it may be, can contain but little more than scant
                    notices of <pb break="no"

                    considerable proportion of the laborious population in every country .and at
                    every period.</p>
                <p>Subjugation by the Romans in the first centuries of the Christian era naturally
                    was followed by a general conformity among the conquered populations to the
                    costume of their more civilized as well as more powerful rulers, so that after a
                    while Roman dress may be considered to have become European. And, as Rome
                    herself through her Eastern connections had yielded in no slight degree to
                    Oriental influences in matters connected with costume, so also Roman influence
                    in the West carried with it much that was strongly marked with the
                    characteristics of the East. This singular association also in after times
                    derived fresh impulses, as well in peaceful costume as in armour and other
                    military matters, through the direct agency of the crusades, acting in concert
                    with an artistic current flowing westwards continually in the Middle Ages from
                    Byzantium.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Anglo-Saxon.</hi> —Generally simple in its character and
                    designedly adapted both to the tastes and sentiments and to the usages and
                    requirements of a hardy and temperate race, the prevailing costume of the
                    Anglo-Saxons consisted of a sleeved tunic, varying in length, but generally
                    comparatively short, partly open at the sides, and confined about the waist by a
                    girdle. Over this tunic, which was made of various colours, and both plain and
                    occasionally enriched with varied ornamentation, a short cloak was worn by the
                    young, while in its stead a mantle of ampler dimensions and greater length was
                    adopted by persons more advanced in age. Similar mantles, not assumed as
                    wrappers for extra warmth or protection against the weather, were in general use
                    at ceremonies and festivals. Trews or drawers, continued to form hose for the
                    lower limbs, with shoes or low boots, completed the ordinary attire of the men,
                    who wore their beards, and delighted in having long and flowing hair. Ornaments,
                    many of them of gold and remarkable for beauty of design and excellence of
                    workmanship, were freely used by the Anglo-Saxons of both sexes; and the
                    numerous fibulae, brooches, armlets, and other personal ornaments that have been
                    discovered in their graves attest the attainment of the Anglo-Saxons to an
                    advanced condition of civilization and refinement. A peculiarity in the dress of
                    the men of all ranks was the cross-gartering of their hose, or their simply
                    covering their legs below the knee with crossed swathing bands fastened at the
                    knee. The females wore long tunics or gowns, made loose and high, and girt in
                    about the waist. Over these they had shorter tunics, often much enriched, and
                    with sleeves, unlike the close-fitting sleeves of their under tunics, that were
                    very wide, and widest at the wrist. Over all, mantles of ample size and provided
                    with hoods to cover the head were thrown, and disposed with effective
                    gracefulness. Coverchefs also were habitually in use, to cover the head when the
                    mantle would not be assumed; and they often were so adjusted as to encircle the
                    face and to cover both the throat and the shoulders; so that they may correctly
                    be regarded as prototypes of the wimple, so popular in somewhat later times. The
                    girdle, it may be added, as worn by both sexes, was rather a swathing band,
                    folded for doing girdle duty, than a girdle proper. The costume of the princes,
                    the nobles, and the wealthy, while in its general character the same as that
                    already described, was distinguished by greater richness of material and more
                    costly adornment. As if to parody the universal fashion of cross bandages for
                    the legs, the Anglo-Saxons habitually wore upon their arms twisted bracelets or
                    <hi rend="italic">torques,</hi> or, in their stead, a number of simple
                    bracelets—a custom common to them and all their kindred of Scandinavian
                    descent.</p>

                    Century.</hi><hi rend="italic">Century XI. —</hi> During the brief rule of the
                    Danes, the national cos· tume does not appear to have experienced any change in
                    England. The advent of the Normans brought with it to England the establishment
                    of that luxury in dress, with which the Anglo-Saxons previously had become in
                    some degree acquainted, and which was destined to so great an extent to
                    supersede the still prevailing simplicity of their hereditary attire. The Norman
                    conquerors, however, with their short cloaks and shaven faces, were not slow to
                    adopt so much of the Saxon style of dress as led them to wear tunics of ample
                    proportions, and in many ways to assume whatever in that dress was most graceful
                    and dignified. Still, as in other things, so in costume, until the 12th century
                    had made a considerable advance the powerful and wealthy Anglo-Normans preserved
                    an external visible distinction between themselves and their Anglo-Saxon
                    fellow-subjects. And yet, the ordinary costume of the people of England appears
                    to have undergone no characteristic change during the second half of the 11th
                    century, seeing that short tunics and capes, cloaks with hoods, cross-bandaged
                    chausses or hose, shoes or low boots, and caps pointed in the crown continued in
                    general use. But it was not so with the nobles, who speedily indulged in every
                    species of ostentatious display upon their persons, covering their rich dresses
                    with ornamentation, introducing gorgeous novelties in fabrics, with costly furs,
                    lengthening their garments till they swept the ground, and widening their
                    sleeves till they hung down open-mouthed from their wrists. To these wide and
                    open-mouthed sleeves the Norman ladies speedily added long pendant lappets, in
                    which extravagant form this portion of their dress was commemorated in the
                    heraldic “maunche” of later times (fig. 24). Tunics richly adorned, made to fit
                    closely about the figure, but with long and loosely flowing skirts, and having
                    the “maunche” sleeves, with splendid mantles of ample size which were fastened
                    on one of the shoulders and were furnished with hoods, enjoyed the highest
                    favour with the Norman ladies, who also wore their hair in heavy and long
                    braids, when the century of the Conquest came to its termination.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Century XII.—</hi> Like their armour—if to their defensive
                    equipment the term armour may be applicable—and weapons, the costume of the
                    Normans when they established themselves in England, while exhibiting
                    significant tokens of affinity to that worn by their own Scandinavian
                    contemporaries, had become assimilated to the dress prevalent among the races
                    with whom they were familiar more to the south. As a matter of course, also,
                    through what remained of the 11th century, and until the succeeding century had
                    far advanced, the distinctive characteristics of Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman
                    attire were retained, and appeared simultaneously in use; nor can they be
                    considered to have become blended in what might claim to be accepted as a single
                    national costume before the reign of Henry III. Many circumstances appear to
                    have combined to have caused the same general character of costume, unless under
                    special local circumstances, to have prevailed throughout Europe during the
                    period of mediaeval armour—from the second half of the 12th century, that is,
                    till the end of the 16th—the same general uniformity in essentials being further
                    observable in the armour itself. It may here be remarked, that both the armour
                    and the costume represented in the monumental effigies of the Middle Ages are
                    alike in being distinguished by a pervading simplicity and an absence of
                    excesses, which in a signal degree qualify them to be accepted as typical rather
                    than as exceptional examples and authorities. This is especially the case with
                    the monumental effigies of various kinds, second to none as works of mediaeval
                    art, that abound throughout England. It but too frequently happens, however,
                    that in forming their estimate of costume, reversing the judicious and sound
                    principles adopted by the monumental artists of the Middle Ages, writers permit
                    themselves to select as their types the occasional eccentricities and vagaries
                    of fashion or of individual extravagance.</p>
                <p>The first sculptured representations of English sovereigns that are known to
                    exist in England appear at the sides of the great west doorway-arch of Rochester
                    Cathedral, and they show the costume worn by Henry I. and his queen Matilda of
                    Scotland. The king, in whose reign beards and long hair again came into fashion,
                    has gathered about his person a flowing tunic, worn under a dalmatic and a
                    mantle; his queen also wears corresponding garments, the sleeves of her dalmatic
                    (or over-tunic) being even wider than those of her consort. Her hair she wears
                    in two very long braids, one of them hanging down on either side on the front of
                    her person. Under and upper tunics, girdles, and mantles, both with and without
                    hoods, pointed caps and low hats with wide <pb break="no"

                    the various illuminations of this era, which convey very clear and well-defined
                    ideas of the costume then in use by various classes and both sexes. Towards the
                    close of this century the costume of Henry II. and of his Queen Eleanor, as
                    represented in their effigies, may be accepted as characteristic illustrations
                    of a period in which considerable luxury in dress was becoming generally
                    prevalent. The king is attired in an under-tunic reaching to his feet, and a
                    blue tunic almost of the same length, both garments having comparatively tight
                    sleeves reaching to the wrists; over the upper-tunic is a dalmatic of crimson
                    enriched with a floral pattern in gold, long but not very full, and without any
                    front-opening being apparent, its full sleeves shorter than those of the tunic;
                    over all, a purple mantle, fastened with a morse on the right shoulder, covers
                    the left arm, and is drawn up on the right side so as partly to cover the figure
                    also on the right side below the girdle. The gloves are jewelled, and the boots,
                    green in colour, enriched with gold and armed with golden spurs, are broad and
                    slightly pointed. Over a white under-tunic, visible only at the throat where it
                    is fastened by a circular brooch, the queen wears a long tunic or gown, loose
                    throughout, its sleeves tight at the wrists and enlarging upwards to the
                    shoulders, which is secured about the waist by a buckled girdle. The pattern
                    upon this dress, which is represented to have been worn uncovered by a dalmatic,
                    and is white, consists of golden crescents in pairs, set reversed and contained
                    within the meshes of an interlaced lozenge-work also golden. The mantle of blue,
                    studded with golden crescents, is secured across the breast with a cord, and,
                    falling back from the shoulders, it is gathered up on both sides and drawn
                    partly across the figure in front. About her face the queen has a plain wimple;
                    and beneath her crown her head is covered with a coverchef, which falls in folds
                    on either shoulder. The king also is crowned; but his sceptre has been broken
                    away from his right hand. In her illuminated portraits, Eleanor of Aquitaine is
                    represented with a wimple, which is fastened with a circlet of gems; her
                    under-tunic, or cote-hardi, fitting closely and having tight sleeves, is
                    gathered into a rich collar about her throat; over this dress is a loose tunic,
                    long and flowing, guarded with fur, its full and open sleeves also being lined
                    with fur: and, over all, there is the ever-present mantle, generally of some
                    light material, so adjusted that at the pleasure of the wearer it might be drawn
                    over the head. Henry II. is not known to have been represented wearing the short
                    cloak of Anjou, familiarly associated with his name. A few years later the same
                    royal attire is represented in the effigy of Richard I. Here, over a white
                    under-tunic, the long tunic and the almost equally long crimson dalmatic are
                    shown to be slit up at the sides; the latter garment has very full sleeves,
                    which hang down from a little above the wrists,‘and the rich girdle, covered by
                    the mantle in his father’s effigy, is shown. The mantle, of royal blue and gold,
                    has a different adjustment, being fastened in the centre over the chest by a
                    large morse, from which it falls back over the right shoulder, but on the left
                    side it is drawn forward so as partly to cover the person and to hang down in
                    folds over the arm; and on the right side also this mantle is drawn forward
                    below the girdle. The king is crowned; he wears gloves, jewelled at the back of
                    the hand; and to his enriched boots, which in their form and adornment resemble
                    his father’s, his spurs are attached by buckled straps. In all these royal
                    effigies it is certain that a faithful representation is given of 1 he remains,
                    attired as had been the custom of these personages inlife, when lying in state
                    before interment. In that warlike and turbulent age, when the possession of good
                    arms and armour and the means of effecting improvements in them were objects of
                    supreme importance, the peaceful population appear to have been content to
                    retain the system and style of dress in use shortly after the establishment of
                    the Norman dynasty A tunic, worn over some under-garment, generally made to
                    reach about to the knees, but sometimes very .short, constantly made with a cape
                    and occasionally also with a hood, loose chausses or trews and light hose and
                    pointed boots or shoes, with some kind of cap for head-gear, and a hood to the
                    favourite cloak or mantle, formed the prevalent male dress. The nobles and other
                    men of rank, when not in their armour, aspired to rival the princes in the
                    richness of their attire; and, in addition to such costumes as might be habitual
                    to them when engaged in active occupations, wealthy citizens were not slow to
                    follow the higher and perhaps still richer classes as closely as might be
                    permitted to them, by indulging in long and flowing gown-like tunics when in
                    repose or on occasions of ceremony and festivity. The long tunics which came
                    into use by men early in the century at first had long sleeves very wide at the
                    wrists; and at the same time the sleeves of their tunics were worn of
                    extravagant length and proportions by ladies of rank. This extravagance,
                    particularly in the male attire, however, had almost disappeared before the
                    close of the century. On the whole, the female attire may be said in its common
                    use to have been subjected to but little of decided change, except that in its
                    general aspect it exhibited somewhat less of an Oriental character than it had
                    done at the commencement of the century. The powerful influence exercised by the
                    East through the crusades on the armour and military appointments of the
                    warriors of the West, did not take effect till the next century in matters
                    connected with Western female fashions and usages.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Century</hi><hi rend="italic">XIII.—</hi> As in the century
                    next succeeding, in both the first and the second half of the 13th century,
                    royal costume, which may be accepted as the most perfect example of the dress of
                    the higher and wealthier classes, is happily exemplified with the highest
                    contemporary authority. King John, upon whose monument (itself a work of the
                    Tudor era) in Worcester Cathedral rests the earliest of the royal portrait
                    effigies that are in existence in England, is attired in a loose tunic reaching
                    from the throat almost to the ankles, having tight sleeves, and its colour being
                    golden. Over this is a loose full-sleeved crimson dalmatic, shorter than the
                    tunic, bordered about the throat-opening and at the very wide extremities of the
                    sleeves with richly gemmed gold embroidery, and secured about the waist by a
                    buckled girdle having a long pendant end. The mantle, worn over all, which hangs
                    down the back of the figure, is gathered up on the right arm in a manner long as
                    well as very generally adopted by both sexes. The king, who has red hose with
                    black boots and golden spurs, is crowned, a circlet of jewels which binds his
                    hair appearing on his brow from beneath his crown. In his gloved hands, the
                    gloves being gemmed, he holds his sword and what remains of his sceptre. Among
                    notices of King John’s costume, he is recorded to have appeared at a certain
                    Christmas festival in a white damask tunic with a jewelled girdle and gloves,
                    his mantle being of red satin embroidered with sapphires and pearls. Over a
                    white under-tunic fastened with a circular brooch at the throat, Queen Isabel of
                    Angoulême appears in her effigy habited in a long blue tunic covered with single
                    golden crescents; this robe, which is loose and flowing throughout, has its full
                    sleeves gathered in at the wrists, and it is adjusted about the waist by a rich
                    girdle secured by a buckle. The queen wears a wimple and on her coverchef rests
                    her crown; her mantle, which hangs from her shoulders and on her right side is
                    drawn partly over her figure, is yellow covered with red roses and green leaves.
                    Berengaria, the widow of Richard I., who died about 1235, is attired in the same
                    fashion; but her tunic, of ampler proportions, is more gracefully disposed; her
                    large brooch is elaborately enriched; from her gemmed girdle on her left side an
                    aumonière, or purse, is suspended; her mantle, secured by a narrow cord across
                    her breast, is not drawn forward; she wears no wimple, and her coverchef is so
                    adjusted about her crowned head as to permit her wavy hair to be visible. The
                    effigy of this royal widow displays no tokens of any such style or accessories
                    of costume as might have reference to her condition of widowhood.</p>
                <p>The crowned effigy of Henry III. (1272), a noble work, is remarkable for the
                    classic grace and dignity of the adjustment of the ample mantle about the king’s
                    person, over his long tunic and dalmatic; this mantle is fastened by a large
                    morse on the right shoulder. The king’s boots, which are elaborately embroidered
                    with small gold lions enclosed in lozenge-work, are without spurs. During the
                    long reign of this weak prince but few decided changes appear to have taken
                    place to affect what gradually had settled down into becoming the national
                    costume in England. New varieties, however, of rich and costly fabrics continued
                    to be introduced, and they were eagerly adopted as materials for their dress by
                    both sexes of the wealthier classes. Eleanor of Provence is represented clad in
                    an embroidered mantle having an ermine collar, fastened with a small brooch over
                    a close-fitting and wide-skirted tunic of gold brocade, having its sleeves so
                    cut as nearly to cover the hands. At this time furs of various kinds were
                    greatly in request. The fashion, too, which had been introduced in the time of
                    Rufus and was long prevalent, of cutting the borders of dresses into fantastic
                    patterns became more general, and often was carried to excess. Sleeveless
                    tunics, which would show the sleeves as well as the lower parts of the longer
                    under-tunics, began to assume a recognized position in the female attire of the
                    time; and, no longer braided in long tails, ladies’ hair was arranged within
                    network of gold or silver filagree or of silk, the wimple and coverchef, now
                    constantly of very rieh materials, being retained in use, and often so adjusted
                    as to display the countenance in a triangular form after the manner of the mail
                    coif of the knights. Of this fashion the effigy of Aveline, first countess of
                    Lancaster, in Westminster Abbey, affjrds a truly characteristic illustration
                    (fig. 25). At this same period the diapered patterns and rich tissues of Ypres
                    attained to a great celebrity, and heraldic devices began to appear as
                    decorative accessories of dress. No effigy of the warlike Edward I. exists, to
                    show him either in Iris mail, or in such attire as it pleased him to assume when
                    not fully armed; but, doubtless, the fine effigy of Fair Rosamond’s son, Earl
                    William <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n498/mode/1up"

                    accepted as a sufficiently accurate illustration of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >military uniform</hi> of the first Edward after the Conquest, who also may be
                    assumed to have been attired, when his mail had been laid aside, much after the
                    fashion of his father. It is well known that in his day princes and nobles
                    arrayed themselves in flowing robes, worn over comparatively closely fitting
                    tunics or doublets, these garments being made of silk damasks and satins of
                    brilliant colours, with adornments of goldsmiths’ work and furs, in the use of
                    which they were freely followed by the knights and the wealthy classes as well
                    as by the ladies of their era. N ot content with the triangular adjustment of
                    the wimple, towards the close of this century the ladies adopted the strange and
                    unsightly gorget to cover their throats, thus still more closely adapting the
                    aspect of their own head-gear and its accessories to the mail coifs and the
                    helms of their martial lords. The beautiful effigy of Eleanor of Castile, which
                    rests upon a massive plate of bronze gilt and diapered with the armorial castles
                    and lions of Castile and Leon, is remarkable as well for the dignified
                    simplicity of the costume as for the sweet expression of the countenance.
                    Secured by a narrow band which she holds in her left hand, the queen’s long and
                    ample mantle for the most part envelops her person, disclosing only the upper
                    part of her wide-sleeved tunic and the close-fitting sleeves of the dress worn
                    beneath it; she wears neither wimple nor coverchef, but allows her luxuriant
                    hair to fall in rich waves from beneath her diadem upon her shoulders.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Century XIV.</hi> —The royal attire represented in the two
                    halves of this century in the effigies of Edward II. and Edward III. is a tunic
                    (the under-tunic not being visible) descending to the feet and having tight
                    sleeves; a dalmatic, open in front to midway between the knees and the waist, of
                    the same length; and a long flowing mantle, secured across the breast by a broad
                    band of rich workmanship. The dalmatic of the father, who is crowned and in his
                    ungloved hands holds a sceptre and an orb, has full sleeves reaching only to the
                    elbows, but prolonged in broad lappets of moderate length, while that of the son
                    has its sleeves tight and but little shorter than those of his tunic. In both
                    cases the mantle, covering the shoulders but not drawn across the chest or
                    covering any part of the front of the person, falls at the back of the wearer.
                    The boots of Edward III., richly embroidered, are acutely pointed at the toes,
                    but not of extravagant length; the aged monarch is bareheaded, with long flowing
                    hair and beard; his two sceptres have been broken away. One of the crowned
                    statuettes upon the monument of her younger son, John of Eltham, duke of
                    Cornwall, apparently represents Isabelle of France, queen of Edward IL, in a
                    tunic and mantle, having her throat and head enveloped in a combination of a
                    wimple with a gorget, after a fashion equally strange and unbecoming, but which,
                    nevertheless, in her time w as prevalent. This queen, who delighted in splendid
                    extravagance, is recorded to have habitually worn, richly embroidered and
                    adorned with jewels, dresses of cloth of gold or silver, with others of velvet
                    of various colours and of shot taffeta, and with others also of green cloth of
                    Douay and of rose satin. The inventories of wardrobes and jewellery that still
                    exist show, in a significant manner peculiar to themselves, the extent, variety,
                    and unbounded extravagance of the costumes of both sexes, with their costly
                    accessories and ornaments. In strong contrast to the tales thus told, the
                    costume of the effigy of Queen Philippa is simply a gown or tunic, quite tight
                    to the figure and laced down the front; the sleeves tight, traversed from the
                    shoulder onwards by a close-set row of small buttons, and prolonged from the
                    wrists so as partly to cover the hands; and the skirt being very full and
                    falling in rich folds over the feet. A narrow girdle encircles the royal person,
                    adjusted, not as in earlier times somewhat tightly around the waist, but loosely
                    and about the hips, precisely as the military belt had begun to be worn by the
                    other sex. Over this tunic, the only other garment visible, a mantle, falls from
                    the shoulders down the back. The queen’s hair, confined within a reticulated
                    covering of goldsmith's w ork beneath her diadem, is bound by a circlet and made
                    to project prominently on each side of the face. At the close of the century,
                    the effigies of Richard II. and Anne of Bohemia show the same costume to be
                    repeated in the case of both royal personages, the whole being covered with the
                    royal heraldic badges; and the queen’s hair falls unconfined and naturally over
                    her shoulders. Other effigies of ladies of different ranks, notably a fine one
                    of Lady Stapleton at Ingham in Norfolk, give similar examples of the costume
                    worn by the two queens. Established in use early in the century, the display of
                    heraldic insignia blazoned upon articles of dress rose into the highest favour
                    and popularity during the brilliant reign of Edward III., and they also were
                    lavishly adopted in the luxurious times of his grandson. Indeed, with the
                    progress of this century, mediaeval costume both attained to its highest
                    splendour, and also exhibited much of its extreme extravagance. It became the
                    fashion, for example, for both sexes to wear hanging from their sleeves long
                    lappets, sometimes prolongations of the actual sleeves, and at other times mere
                    strips, and their hoods were prolonged in points to correspond with them.
                    Dresses, some very long, others very short, having their edges cut and jagged in
                    a most bizarre manner, often were worn partycoloured, the colours in many cases
                    having been chosen expressly with a view to produce the most vivid contrast;
                    boots and shoes had their pointed toes made twice or even thrice the length of
                    the wearer’s foot; and head-gear, exhibiting no little diversity of fantastic
                    forms, was universally prevalent. The fashions of England corresponded with
                    those of France, though apparently they were not carried here quite to the same
                    excess that they were on the Continent. The singular aim of each sex, not only
                    to emulate the other in the sumptuous style and profuse adornment of their
                    dress, but also to imitate the form and fashion of each other’s attire, obtained
                    in both countries. The consistent adjustment of the knightly surcoats and jupons
                    over armour, enhancing its effect while partly covering it, suggested to the
                    ladies to adopt kirtles or cotes-hardi, that from being merely sleeveless became
                    sideless also. This form of garment, so well adapted for the display of what was
                    worn under it, assumed several varieties of treatment. Sometimes it was little
                    more than the front and back of a jacket, as in fig. 26; and at other times it
                    became a complete dress, with the exception of sides and sleeves, in which case
                    it was either made to fit closely about the person both before and behind, and
                    then was continued to form a loose and flowing skirt of ample proportions and
                    great length, or with a similar skirt the upper part of the dress also hung
                    loosely about the figure, as in fig. 27. In the next century this same dress at
                    times was worn cut off at the knees, so as to leave the lower part of the
                    under-tunic visible as well as its sides and sleeves. This dress constantly was
                    richly guarded and sometimes lined with costly furs, and it generally was also
                    adorned down the front with a continuous series of massive studs or other
                    goldsmiths’ work. It appears also to have been a never-failing usage in
                    connection with this fashion of a sideless kirtle to display the girdle of the
                    undertunic, which rested loosely on the hips, as it passed under the sideless
                    garment both before and behind. Found to have been in use, in the form at first
                    of a long and flowing sleeveless robe or gown, early in the 14th century, this
                    sideless kirtle or cote-hardi continued to enjoy unabated favour for not much
                    less than two centuries. It appears, certainly not later than 1320, in effigies
                    at Bedale, Selby, and Staindrop—the Selby lady having the flowing skirt of her
                    sideless dress blazoned with armorial insignia; in her effigy at Oxford, Lady
                    Montacute is represented in this dress, 1354; and it is repeated in the effigies
                    of Lady Beauchamp, at Worcester, 1384; of Queen Joanna of Navarre, at
                    Canterbury, 1407; of Lady Harcourt, at Stanton Harcourt, 1471; and of the
                    Duchess of Suffolk, at Ewelme, 1474: the two ladies last named, whose husbands
                    were K.G., wear the garter of the order, the former as an armlet and the latter
                    as a bracelet. Still later, 1500, in her beautiful effigy in Westminster Abbey,
                    Elizabeth Arundel, wife of Sir Giles Daubeney, K.G., treasurer to Henry VII., is
                    represented in this same sideless over-tunic which reaches only about to the
                    knees, so displaying the lower part of the long and flowing under-tunic as well
                    as its sides and sleeves. Μ. Viollet-le-Duc has shown the sideless kirtle to
                    have been no less fashionable and no less capable to maintain its position in
                    France, than we possess abundant evidence to prove it to have been in England.
                    The same fashion also prevailed at the same period in other parts of Europe. At
                    Worcester a closely wimpled effigy illustrates in a remarkable manner the usage,
                    at the commencement of the century, to attach small enamelled shields of arms in
                    profusion upon the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0499-0468"/> dresses of ladies of rank, a mode of decoration
                    shown again in a brass at Trotton, 1310. Throughout this century the wimple and
                    coverchef continued to be worn, or the hair was confined within bands of
                    fretwork, or had some light and delicate covering which did not extend to the
                    face and throat. In the second half of the century the hair appears to have been
                    worn partly within the favourite fretwork, and in part falling on the shoulders;
                    the coverchef also then assumed the forms of a variety of caps, and some of the
                    more extravagant head-dresses of the following century began to make their
                    appearance. For protection from the cold and wet the hoodsof mantles always were
                    available, and hats wide in the brim were also worn. The hip-belt was universal.
                    Pocket-holes, into which the hands of the wearers often are represented to have
                    been inserted, are shown to have been made in the outer-tunics and robes.
                    Throughout the era of splendid armour, meu of distinction so constantly are
                    represented in their armour that the typical and specially characteristic male
                    costume of the Middle Ages is commonly considered to have been identified with
                    what in reality ought to be distinguished as the military equipment of the
                    period. Rarely, however, as we see the more accessible and popular of their
                    “counterfeit presentments” in peaceful guise, the warriors of those days when
                    circumstances permitted gladly laid aside basinet and hauberk and panoply of
                    plate, in order to assume some less weighty and uneasy garb. Under the armour
                    close-fitting doublets and hose were worn, made either of leather or of some
                    quilted fabric. When without their armour, the dress of nobles and knights in
                    many respects was assimilated to the garments assumed by them over their armour.
                    The general costume of men of all classes at the same period was closely in
                    accord with the style prevalent with their contemporaries of exalted rank, the
                    essential distinctions of different classes being comparative costliness and
                    splendour of adornment. It will be observed that garments fitting closely to the
                    person were in constant use, as is well exemplified in fig. 28, and also such
                    others as were Oriental in their length and flowing looseness. Early in the 14
                    th century two· or three surcoats were worn over the armour; but later the short
                    jupon, generally jagged at the edges and sleeveless, but sometimes plain and
                    having sleeves reaching only to the elbows, superseded them, when a similar
                    jupon made of some rich material and often having a hood, was adopted to be worn
                    with a hip-belt, without the armour. The hip-belt, as was the case with the
                    other sex who borrowed it from the men, was universal.</p>
                <p>The hose, shoes, boots or buskins, always sharply pointed, became very long as
                    the century advanced. Rows of buttons, also, some of them very small and closely
                    set, were in great favour. Heraldic devices, assumed as military insignia,
                    became the favourite ornaments of the dress of peace. The military camail,
                    again, the representative of the mail-coif of earlier times, found a parallel in
                    the hood when resting on the shoulders, and in the cape which so frequently was
                    associated with the peaceful attire of this century. See fig. 28, which also
                    gives a characteristic illustration of the prolonged sleeve-lappets that still
                    held their ground with resolute tenacity. Six of the original beautiful bronze
                    statuettes, representing two of the daughters and four of the sons of Edward
                    HI., which still remain <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> on the south side of that
                    monarch’s monument in Westminster Abbey, form a group so happily illustrative of
                    both male and female costume in the second half of the 14th century before it
                    had degenerated into the extravagancies of the reign of Richard 11., that it has
                    appeared desirable here to introduce the accompanying sketches of the entire
                    group (figs. 29-34). One of these statuettes (fig. 29) is especially
                    interesting, since it is a contemporary portrait of the Black Prince when he was
                    not armed, which consequently may be agreeably associated with his noble armed
                    effigy upon his own monument at Canterbury. The doublet and hose, doubtless worn
                    by the Black Prince under his voluminous mantle with its deeply jagged lower
                    border, is effectively shown in the statuettes of two of his brothers, Lionel,
                    duke of Clarence (fig. 30), who also wears his mantle; and a younger brother
                    (fig. 31), not now to be identified in consequence of his shield of arms having
                    long been lost. The effigy of the fourth brother (fig, 32), enveloped like the
                    Black Prince in his mantle, has also lost the armorial shield which would have
                    declared his name and title. With the costume of these royal brothers may be
                    compared the habit of a civilian, who lived at the same time with them, as it is
                    shown in his monumental brass at Shottesbroke (fig. 35). The corresponding
                    French costume of a few years earlier, which continued in fashion till the close
                    of the century, is well exemplified in figs. 28 and 36. The effigies of the two
                    royal sisters (figs. 33, 34) speak for themselves as expressive and
                    authoritative typical illustrations of the female dress of their era in its
                    simplest and most characteristic forms, as the entire group in which they appear
                    attests the dignified simplicity which the artists of the Middle Ages, with such
                    excellent taste, have shown that they held to be appropriate for the costume, in
                    itself always accurate <pb break="no"

                    monumental sculpture. Without introducing much of actual novelty, except in the
                    case of some of the head-dresses which from this time continued in use under the
                    fourth, fifth, and sixth Henries, the concluding quarter of the 14th century was
                    distinguished—as we learn from contemporary illuminations—by the pervading love
                    of lavish extravagance in dress in all classes, and by the excess to which the
                    more fanciful devices and fashions of earlier times were carried. Thus, the
                    jagged borders of tunics and mantles became more than ever fantastic; the tunics
                    and mantles themselves attained to a larger size, and the hanging sleeves
                    commonly attached to them drooped to the very ground. Hoods, from being merely
                    pointed, were prolonged in pipe-like extensions ( “liripipes ”), and the points
                    of boots and shoes were made sharper, and the boots and shoes were made longer
                    than ever. The singularly quaint and bizarre usage of making dresses party -
                    coloured, the colours being selected in the majority of instances with a view to
                    decided contrast, derived doubtless from heraldic impalements and quarterings
                    with fields of different tinctures, and carried out in the livery colours
                    assumed by the retainers and dependants of great houses,—a fashion which had
                    established itself during the palmy heraldic days of Edward III., —became
                    general in the reign of Richard 11., and then it was carried out in every
                    variety of’the details, accessories, and ornaments of costume.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Century X V. —</hi> Remarkable for a sustained succession of
                    important changes in armour, and also from the fact that after about 1405, and
                    until about 1475, the panoply of steel was worn uncovered byanysurcoat or jupon,
                    this turbulent century also witnessed a variety of changes in costume—changes
                    that maintained a general uniformity throughout the greater part of Europe—which
                    in their turn led in the succeeding century to the equally general establishment
                    of the Tudor fashions. Heraldic devices continued to constitute favourite
                    accessories and ornaments of dress, and in no slight degree determined both its
                    character and its aspect. To the crests of the knightly helms, and to the
                    contoises or scarves and the mantlings displayed from them by the knights, may
                    be assigned, as being the sources whence they were suggested, the more
                    extravagant and quaint varieties of the female head-gear which prevailed at this
                    period. And, in like manner, the “livery colours” of the nobles and other
                    personages of distinction, in trod need during the preceding ςentury, together
                    with their armorial badges, all of them worn by their partisans, adherents, and
                    dependants, imparted a heraldic character to the costume of the middle and even
                    of the humbler classes. The only royal monumental effigies of this century are
                    those of Henry IV. and of his second wife, Joanna of Navarre, at Canterbury. The
                    king’s dalmatic, of ample proportions and ungirt by any girdle, falls to his
                    feet, completely covering his tunic, except at the wrists of its tight sleeves,
                    which have an under row of small buttons set in contact; over these sleeves are
                    the large and open sleeves of the dalmatic itself, which is remarkable from
                    having at each side a very large opening to give access to the pockets of the
                    tunic. About the shoulders and covering the chest is a cape or tippet; and, over
                    all, there is a mantle, its hood adjusted about the neck of the wearer, which is
                    secured by a broad and rich band, with morses, cords, and tassels. Upon his head
                    the first Lancastrian king wears a crown of elaborate splendour. The effigy of
                    Queen Joanna, from which, as also is the case with the companion effigy of her
                    royal husband, the hands and the greater part of the arms have been broken away,
                    represents her attired in a close-fitting tunic with a narrow very rich
                    hip-girdle, under a long sleeveless and sideles3 cote-hardi, cut low and fitting
                    tightly in the body, but having a loose, long and flowing skirt, and adorned
                    with a row of rich circular studs down the front. The mantle, which falls over
                    the back of the figure and is not gathered up at the arms, is secured by a
                    cordon attached to two lozenge-shaped studs. As a necklace the queen wears the
                    Lancastrian collar of SS.; and her hair, which is plaited in bands within golden
                    network, is surmounted by a truly beautiful crown. Thus the costume of this
                    royal lady shows no change from the ruling fashion of the previous century. At
                    this same time female dresses were worn made full, and either gathered into a
                    kind of close collar about the throat, or having a broad collar falling over the
                    shoulders, their sleeves very large and full and sometimes quite open, while at
                    other times they also were gathered in (but not closely) at the wrists; these
                    dresses, often having a row of small buttons from the throat downwards, were so
                    adjusted by a belt as to have very short waists. At this period also, and till
                    the middle of the century, the tunic commonly worn by men, with the exception of
                    being shorter, in form was almost identical with the full-sleeved kirtle also in
                    common use by the other sex. Among characteristic examples of the ordinary
                    costumes of the first half of the 15th century are effigies, some sculptured and
                    some engraved, at Chipping Campden, Willoughby, Northleach, Kingston-on-Thames,
                    Great Tew, Highaιr Ferrers, and Bedington. In the third quarter of the century
                    fc11β male dress in general use underwent but little change, the very long
                    tunics of earlier times still remaining in favour jut the female kirtles are
                    seldom seen with very full sleeves, tl)β sleeves of the under-tunic being
                    continued in the form of mittens so as partly to cover the hands, the outer
                    sleeves ending in cuffs that are turned back. While the costume of the
                    commonality thus was at any rate comparatively simple and sober, throughout the
                    turbulent period that succeeded the death of Henry V. till the establishment of
                    the Tudors, it would appear as if the fierce excitement and the terrible
                    vicissitudes of a prolonged civil war had impelled the nobility and others of
                    the upper classes in England—encouraged in such a course, as it would seem, and
                    still further stimulated to pursue it by the contemporaneous fashions of
                    France—to have sought a not altogether inconsistent kind of relief in both the
                    revival and the invention of almost every conceivable extravagance and absurdity
                    in dress and personal ornament. Long and loose robes having immense drooping
                    sleeves had as their contemporaries close-fitting tunics reaching down not quite
                    to the knees, with others of looser make which descended midway between the knee
                    and the ankle, and also with jerkins cut short only a few inches below the hips,
                    made very full, and gathered in with a belt about the waist. Of these tunics and
                    jerkins the sleeves assumed an endless variety of form and decoration, being
                    sometimes made to fit tightly, but more generally being large and open, and at
                    their extremities either jagged or bordered with fur. These large sleeves
                    enabled the wearers to display the sleeves of their under garments, and in so
                    doing to emulate the ladies with their sideless cote-hardis and kirtles. Mantles
                    of the richest materials and splendidly adorned, which were made to reach about
                    to the knees, were worn as parts of the regular dress. The half-boots or shoes
                    distinguished as <hi rend="italic">pouïaines</hi> continued to be long and very
                    sharply pointed; and men of rank and fashion actually walked about in clogs,
                    pointed like their poulaines, and exceeding them in length by several inches.
                    The excesses in attire characteristic of this period culminated (in every
                    acceptation of that word) in the female head-dresses, that appear literally to
                    have exhausted the inventive faculties both of the ladies themselves and of
                    those persons who ministered to their tastes and wishes. From their more
                    decidedly characteristic features, some of the more popular of these strange
                    varieties of head-gear have been distinguished as the “horned,” the “mitre, '
                    the “steeple” —in France known as the “hennin,—” and the “butterfly ’ (figs.
                    37-40). Examples of all these head-dresses in their various modifications of
                    contour, size, accessories, adornment, and adjustment.</p>

                    in the general character of the costume of each era, the same fashions of
                    head-gear are found to have prevailed about the same period in other European
                    countries. The most remarkable example of the “horned” head-dress that has been
                    observed cither in France or England, is represented in the effigy of Beatrice
                    of Portugal, who married one of the earls of Arundel in the time of Henry V.,
                    which remains in good preservation in Arundel church in Sussex; fig. 37, from
                    the brass to Lady Hals-ham in the same county, shows a simpler and more moderate
                    form of the same head-dress. Fig. 38 is drawn from a portrait of Elizabeth of
                    York when young, in stained glass at Little Malvern. The “hennin,” fig. 39, is a
                    French example, reproduced from the always effective pages of Viollet-le-Duc.
                    The “butterfly,” shown in fig. 40, is 'another example in which the type of a
                    particular headgear is exhibited with no less of moderation than of accuracy. In
                    every case, to these head-dresses veils, generally of ample proportions and
                    often of great length or depth, -and always of some light and delicate material,
                    were attached, and from the actual structure worn in connection with the hair
                    upon the head they either were expanded by wires or were permitted to fall
                    drooping freely.</p>
                <p>Extravagancies in head-gear, however, were not restricted to the fashions of one
                    sex only; on the contrary, at this same period, among other strange
                    eccentricities and fancies, a kind of cap, in form somewhat resembling a turban,
                    was introduced and generally worn by men, which on one side had attached to it a
                    cluster of very large bows or puffs (the prototype of the “cockade” of later
                    times), while on the other side a broad band or scarf of the same material as
                    the cluster of bows hung down to the ground, or even trailed along upon it,
                    unless it should be the pleasure of the wearer to tuck it up in his girdle, or
                    to wind it round either his head or his throat and shoulders. This strange male
                    head-gear, of which a French example is given in fig. 41, showing the upper part
                    of the scarf when hanging down, often was treated as a hood for occasional use
                    only, when it rested on one of the shoulders of the wearer, its cluster of bows
                    drooping over his back, and the long band or lappet pendant in front of his
                    person, his head, meanwhile, if not bare, being covered with a cap, round or
                    square or peaked, or by a brimless hat adorned with an upright feather and a
                    jewel. In the 13 th and 14th centuries the knightly surcoats and jupons, worn
                    over armour, had their counterparts in the robes and tunics of peaceful attire;
                    and so, in like manner, the shortened tunics and still shorter jerkins, that
                    were in common use when the 15th century was bringing the great civil struggle
                    to its termination in the accession of the Tudors, may be considered to have
                    been suggested by the short “tabard” with its short and full sleeves and its
                    heraldic blazonry, at that time worn by men-at-arms over their plate-armour. At
                    the same time and till the end of the century, the long tunics still in use,
                    which some years earlier had been slit up in front and had their full sleeves
                    somewhat gathered in at the wrists, were made still longer, and had collars
                    either closefitting or open and falling back; they also were made open in front
                    throughout their entire length, and their loose sleeves were of a uniform size
                    from the shoulder to the wrist. At this same time also rosaries, and gypcières
                    or purses, were worn attached to their girdles by both sexes. About the year
                    1480 the long and acutely pointed poulaines were superseded by coverings for the
                    feet of both sexes which exhibited the opposite extreme of being short, very
                    broad, and rounded or sometimes almost square at the toes. In the concluding
                    quarter of this century, the super-tunic or gown of the ladies, made to fit
                    closely and having a long and flowing skirt, the sleeves also close-fitting and
                    with cuffs either turned back or drawn over the hands, was open above the short
                    waist, the collar falling back over the shoulders and showing the under-tunic
                    either carried up to fit closely at the throat, or sometimes cut square and low.
                    Rich and broad necklaces were worn, and belts of goldsmiths’ work with long
                    pendants. The ‘ ‘ homed” head-dress became either sharper in its points, or
                    considerably less pointed and more graceful. The “butterfly ’’ headdress
                    increased in favour, and was worn with the hair drawn back into an enriched caul
                    or cap. About 1490 an angular or “diamond” head-dress superseded the ‘ ‘
                    butterfly; ’’ i t had a ridge, after the manner of a gabled roof of a house,
                    over the head, and forming an angle above the centre of the forehead, from which
                    it descended with a slope on each side of the face; then, another angle having
                    been formed slightly below each eye, this head-gear, which inclosed the back of
                    the head in a species of cap, was continued as a broad lappet falling over each
                    shoulder in front of the person of the wearer; occasionally, also, two other
                    similar lappets depended behind (see fig. 42).</p>

                    doubt in a signal degree characteristic of the period in which it was executed,
                    of the various figures introduced by mediaeval artists into their numerous
                    pictures executed in glass, Winston has made the following concise remarks
                    :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Early English Gothic,</hi> 1175 to 1300.—“Robes, whether lay or
                    ecclesiastical, are generally short, in male figures hardly reaching to the
                    ankles, and in females scarcely more than touching the ground. The female dress
                    usually consists of a close garment with tight sleeves and a loose robe and
                    shoes; the head is sometimes bare, but more commonly draped. The male dress,
                    usually appropriated to dignified persons, also consists of a close garment
                    confined at the waist, and furnished sometimes with tight and sometimes with
                    loose sleeves, a robe or mantle, and long hose, to which is often added a cap
                    greatly resembling the Phrygian bonnet. The costume of ordinary persons is
                    generally a short tunic, confined at the waist and reaching nearly to the knees,
                    and sometimes a short cloak; when this is used, the legs of the figure are
                    generally represented encased in hose, or in a loose sort of stocking setting in
                    folds about the leg, and with or without shoes.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Decorated English Gothic,</hi> 1300 to 1380.—“The αrapenes of
                    this period are much more flowing and ample than those of the last; and in
                    ecclesiastical and female figures the robe is generally long and envelops the
                    feet. The secular emale costume usually consists of a garment fitting tightly to
                    the arms and body, and having a wide long skirt trailing along the ground; upon
                    it sometimes are depicted the armorial bearings of the wearer. A cloak or mantle
                    is often loosely thrown over it. The wimple is a frequent adjunct to the
                    head-dress, and the hair is usually plaited down on each side of the face and
                    inclosed in a net or cowl. The ordinary costume of dignified laymen consists of
                    a long robe and loose cloak,—the hair and beard being arranged in loose and wavy
                    locks. The usual secular dress is a short jerkin or tunic reaching about
                    half-way down the thighs, and tight hose and shoes, upon which model the armour
                    of this period was formed.”</p>

                    “Greater repose was given to the figures in this than in either of the former
                    styles, and the draperies are generally disposed in very broad and grand folds.
                    The female dress in general consists either of a close-bodied dress with long
                    skirts and tight sleeves, or of a looser dress with sleeves wide at the
                    shoulders and tight at the wrists. A cloak is often added, upon which armorial
                    bearings, when used, are emblazoned more frequently than on the other garment.
                    The variety of the head-dresses is great, especially towards and during the
                    reign of Edward IV. The secular male costume, until almost the end of Edward
                    IV.’s reign, appears usually to have consisted of a furred gown of tunic-like
                    form, reaching rather below the knees, slit nearly half-way up the middle, and
                    confined round the waist with a girdle; it had either wide sleeves narrowing
                    toward the wrist, or small at the shoulder and wide at the wrist like those of a
                    surplice. The legs were inclosed in pointed-toed hose. I he hair, until the
                    latter part of the reign of Edward IV., appears to have been cropped closely all
                    round, and after this time to have been cut straight across the forehead, but
                    allowed to grow long behind and at the sides of the face, and to have been
                    smoothed down like a club. In the reign of Henry VII. long furred gowns reaching
                    to the feet and obtusely-toed shoes were used; they continued in fashion during
                    the next reign also.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Century XVI.—“We</hi> find,” says Μ. Paul Lacroix, writing
                    specially with reference to the costume prevalent in France, “that a distinct
                    separation between ancient and modern dress took place as early as the 16th
                    century. In fact, our present fashions may be said to have taken their origin
                    from about that time. It was during this century that men adopted clothes
                    closely fitting to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n502/mode/1up"

                    with more or less wide brims, and closed boots and shoes. The women also wore
                    their dresses closely fitting to the figure, with tight sleeves, low crowned
                    hats, and richly trimmed petticoats. These garments, which differ altogether
                    from those of antiquity, constitute, as it were, the common type from which have
                    arisen the endless varieties of modem male and female dress; and there is no
                    doubt that fashion thus will continually be moving backwards and forwards from
                    period to period, sometimes returning to its original model, and sometimes
                    departing from it.” Before arriving, however, at the useful and generally
                    consistent and becoming dress of the present day, the fashions of both male and
                    female attire had to pass on from the 16th century through a series of changes
                    in every τespect no less strange and extravagant, and yet always more or less
                    directly tending in the same direction, than those which the earlier centuries
                    had witnessed and then had carried away with themselves. And even now more than
                    a little remains to be accomplished, before the ordinary costume in general use
                    can be considered to have realized what ought to be its true aim—the most
                    perfect attainable applicability, that is, to the condition and the requirements
                    of the wearer, due but not excessive attention at the same time being bestowed
                    upon appropriate effectiveness of appearance.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of this century in England, there are the royal effigies of
                    Henry VII. and his queen, Elizabeth of York. The king himself is represented as
                    having his person entirely enveloped in a loose fur-lined robe or gown of ample
                    size, reaching from its close fur collar about his neck to his feet, and so
                    adjusted as to disclose but little of the garments worn beneath it. On his head
                    he has the square cap that came into use and was generally worn during his
                    reign. The queen wears a richly adorned angular head-dress (fig. 42), from
                    beneath which her hair falls unconfined over her shoulders; and the adjustment
                    of her royal mantle is such as to display the upper part of her tunic, which is
                    cut square and does not quite reach to her throat. The countess of Richmond, the
                    mother of Henry VII., in her effigy appears wrapped from head to foot in a loose
                    mantle, her tunic having plain and tight sleeves; and on her head she has a
                    plain angular headdress with a plaited wimple, over which the lappets fall. This
                    costume may be regarded to have been designed, to denote the widowhood of this
                    four times married lady. Thus it appears that in their costume the effigies of
                    these royal personages exhibit none of the distinctive insignia of royalty, and
                    consequently they may he accepted as typical of the costume of their era.
                    Neither of Henry VIII. nor of any one of his queens is there any monumental
                    effigy; but this deficiency is more than compensated by the portraits painted by
                    Holbein, made familiar to all by engravings; while other artists have left no
                    less characteristic pictures representing personages of different ranks and
                    classes who at the same period lived in France and England. Armour, which in the
                    course of this century gradually became less esteemed for purposes of defence,
                    and in a corresponding degree came to be more and more regarded as but little
                    more than a splendid component or accessory of dress, in its form and aspect was
                    closely assimilated to certain garments made of textile materials and in fashion
                    among the armour-wearing classes. Much of curious and suggestive mutual
                    illustration, accordingly, is to be obtained by a comparison between the aspect
                    of a man of rank of this century in his armour, and the same person when in his
                    customary attire. In the time of the first of the Tudor princes men wore two
                    distinct varieties of dress. The one was a long and loose gown, having wide open
                    sleeves, girt about the waist with a belt or scarf, above which it was open, its
                    broad collar falling back over the shoulders; thus an under-tunic or vest was
                    displayed, that in its turn allowed the shirt to be visible both at the throat
                    and the wrists; the hose were tight, and the shoes very broad at the toes. The
                    other form of dress consisted of a short tunic or vest, tight and close-fitting
                    as the hose, worn under an open doublet with long sleeves made throughout very
                    large and loose; hats, low in the crown and broad in the brim and having plumes
                    of feathers, were either worn on the head over a small and closely-fitting cap
                    or coiſl or they were carried hanging from over one of the shoulders down the
                    back. The angular cap represented in the royal effigy also was constantly worn,
                    and the cap (fig. 41) with the cluster of bows and the long pendant sash
                    continued in use. Under Henry VI11., in men’s attire, from midway between the
                    knee and the hip, or from the knee itself, downwards to the wide and easy shoes,
                    all was tight, while about the upper part of the lower J <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> r∏bs and the body all was loose, capacious, and broad, the entire costume
                    at the same time being distinguished by decided stiffness and formality. At the
                    line of junction between the tight and the loose portions oi the dress, the
                    trunk hose, at the time in question universally worn, were gathered in closely
                    either at the middle of the thigh or at the knee, and then they were widely
                    puffed out as they rose to meet the jerkin or jacket, which was open in front
                    and reached only to the hips. These jerkins sometimes were closed at the throat,
                    when a small falling white collar or band was worn; or the jerkin was spread
                    open to display a sleeveless vest, and an embroidered shirt having large sleeves
                    and small ruffles at the wrists. The doublets, or coats, worn over the other
                    garments were very short and very full, an especial object being to give to the
                    figure, and particularly about the shoulders, the appearance of as much breadth
                    and squareness as possible. A cloak, as short as the doublet, was suspended from
                    the shoulders, rather for display than for use; the headcovering was a round
                    cap, low and flat, adorned with a jewel and a single small waving feather; and,
                    attached to the belt, with a gypcière or purse, a dagger was carried
                    horizontally in front of the wearer. The sword, when worn, was a rapier. It was
                    at this period a peculiar and universally prevalent fashion, varying in degrees
                    of eccentricity and extravagance, to slash the garments, so as either simply to
                    show glimpses of some under-dress, or to have some different material of another
                    colour drawn out in puffs through the slashes. This slashing and puffing was
                    extended even to the broad shoes, the tight hose alone being exempted. Besides
                    being frequently slashed and striped, the trunk hose were habitually made with a
                    succession of alternate gatherings-in and puffings-out. All this display, made
                    regardless of true taste and solely in order to accomplish as much of display as
                    possible, naturally was attended with a prevalent indulgence in the use of rich
                    and costly fabrics and splendid decorations. Of King Henry himself it is
                    recorded, at his famous meeting with Francis I. in 1540, that he was apparelled
                    in “a garment of cloth-of-silver damask, ribbed with cloth-of-gold, as thick as
                    might be; the garment was large and plaited very thick, of such shape and make
                    as was marvellous to behold.” The French king was attired in a splendour quite
                    equal to that of his royal English guest; and the nobles and courtiers of both
                    countries took care to emulate their sovereigns in their attire, and in wearing
                    several gorgeous costumes, all of them in the same style of fashion, every day.
                    The costume of Henry II. of France, represented in the woodcut, fig. 43, from
                    the original portrait by Clonet, is a characteristic example of the fashion
                    prevalent in the middle of the 16th century, and it also shows how close was the
                    resemblance between the fashions of male dress at that time in France and
                    England. The costume of the middle and the humbler classes at this era, as
                    naturally would be expected, bore a decided general resemblance to the more
                    elaborate and costly attire of the dignified and wealthy of their
                    contemporaries. They wore the same short close jerkin, the short doublet often
                    with lappet sleeves, the short cloak, the flat round cap plainly made from
                    simple materials, and the tight leggings and broad shoes with the puffed upper
                    hose. Or, instead of the short cloak, they wore a long gown, furred, and with
                    hanging sleeves, sometimes pierced midway for the arms to pass through; a coif
                    tied under the chin also was commonly worn under the flat cap. The doublets of
                    the men of the Elizabethan portion of this century, which were made
                    long-breasted and padded so as to fit the body tightly, were carried down in
                    front to a prolonged peak, and so they closely resembled both the stomachers of
                    the ladies and the breastplates of the military. The fashion of these grotesque
                    doublets, apparently originally Venetian, travelled to England by way of France.
                    The hose, if of the English “trunk type, were puffed out immediately from the
                    middle of the thigh, where they met the tight leggings or stockings that were
                    carried up beneath them, as in fig. 44; but the French and Venetian hose, also
                    in. fashion in England, swelled out gradually from the knee, and the stockings
                    sometimes were drawn over them. These dresses constantly were puffed and
                    slashed, padded and banded throughout, one <hi rend="italic">shſtS</hi> slash
                    being carried down the entire length of each sleeve of the doublet. The
                    contemporary portrait of the French king, Hem y III., about 1575, from which the
                    woodcut (fig. 45) has been drawn, shows very distinctly the tapering French hose
                    and the long pea &lt; <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> doublet, with the treatment
                    of those garments characteristic oi t ιa <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0503-0472"/> period. Very large circular ruffs, in their form
                    and adjustment differing little, if at all, from those worn by the other sex,
                    formed essential features of the male attire in the reign of Elizabeth, when
                    very short cloaks also continued to be worn. At the same period, long gowns
                    guarded with fur, having open collars falling back, and their sleeves
                    comparatively tight and having puffs at the shoulders, were in common use, as
                    were caps and hats greatly varying in form, colour, material, and adornment. It
                    must be added, that amidst all this extravagance and eccentricity of attire,
                    there also existed a taste for simplifying the fashions of the time so as to
                    render them at least comparatively graceful and becoming. In connection also
                    with the costume of the 16th century, it will be kept in remembrance, as one of
                    the most decided innovations ever introduced into male dress, that two distinct
                    coverings were given to the lower limbs when the hose were worn in part tight
                    and plain, and partly puffed out, slashed, and embroidered. The term “hose” then
                    wει applied, by way of distinction, to the upper portion, while to the lower the
                    name of “stocking” was assigned. Towards the close of the century the hose of
                    that period also became “breeches; ' ’ and so, in process of time, the old and
                    long-used word “hose” came to be retained only as an equivalent for “stockings.”
                    Early in the 16 th century noble ladies and gentlewomen introduced various
                    modifications of the universal angular head-dress. Their dresses, fitting
                    closely about the figure, and with long skirts open in front to display the
                    under-dress, were made low and cut square about the neck; their sleeves, tight
                    at the shoulder, suddenly became very large and open, disclosing the puffed
                    sleeves of the under-dress; sometimes, however, these dresses were worn high,
                    with short waists, and a small falling collar. Necklaces and numerous other
                    ornaments of jewellery were in general use; chains also, with objects of various
                    kinds for use or ornament attached to them, hung down from the universal
                    girdles, or the girdles themselves had one long Îiendant end that was
                    elaborately enriched. By country ladies and &gt;y the wives and daughters of
                    citizens a similar style of dress, somewhat simplified, was generally adopted.
                    Somewhat later, the sleeves of dresses had puffs at the shoulders, and when the
                    dresses were made open above the girdle, a “partiet,” or kind of habitshirt, was
                    worn beneath them and carried up to the throat; the head-dress at the same time,
                    while generally retaining an angular contour, was small and made to fit almost
                    closely to the head. At this same time, the general resemblance which all along
                    may be traced between the dresses of the two sexes became universally decided.
                    After the accession of Queen Elizabeth in 1558, the well-known costume,
                    associated with herself from about the middle till the close of her reign,
                    gradually became established. Of the long, peaked, and tight stomachers of the
                    ladies, and of the padded and quilted doublets of the men, it might be said with
                    equal truth that each garment was a parody of the other. Ruffs, often of
                    exaggerated amplitude and of a painfully severe stiffness, were worn by both
                    sexes; sometimes open in front and rising like an expanded fan around the throat
                    and head, more generally they completely encircled the throat, and rested,
                    nearly at right angles to it, on the shoulders. In their puffings and. slashings
                    the sleeves of the dresses of both sexes were alike; nor was almost a
                    corresponding resemblance wanting between the trunk hose and the
                    “petticoatbreeches” of one sex, and the skirts of the kirtles and gowns and the
                    veritable petticoats that were made to expand by enormous wheel-like
                    “farthingales,” as in fig. 46, from the hips of the other sex. Ornaments of
                    every kind abounded. The richest and most showy fabrics in endless variety were
                    in great request, and were worn with abundance of lace, feathers, and
                    embroidery. The monumental effigy of Elizabeth herself, the last memorial of its
                    class commemorative of an English sovereign, represents the queen as attired at
                    all points in the characteristic fashion, by herself set to her time, and
                    identified with her name; and the sister effigy of Queen Mary Stuart, like that
                    of Elizabeth, the work of James I*, and in Westminster Abbey, gives another, but
                    a somewhat simpler and a much mðre graceful, example of the same costume—the
                    queen of Scots wearing the cap that bears her name. As at other periods, the
                    general female costume in the Elizabethan era was a modification of the dress of
                    the court, the circumstances and position of different classes and individuals
                    determining the degree of resemblance.</p>
                <p>In taking a retrospective glance at the numerous changes in costume which had
                    taken place from ancient times to the 16th century, Μ. Lacroix remarks that
                    “among European nations during the Middle Ages we find there to have been but
                    one common standard of fashion, which varied from time to time according to the
                    particular customs of each country, and in accordance also with the
                    peculiarities of each race. In Italy, for example, dress always maintained a
                    certain character of grandeur, ever recalling the fact that the influence of
                    antiquity had not been altogether lost. In Germany and Switzerland garments
                    generally had a heavy and massive appearance, and in Holland still more so.
                    England uniformly studied a kind of instinctive elegance and propriety. It is a
                    curious fact that Spain invariably partook of the heaviness peculiar to Germany,
                    either because the Gothic element still prevailed there, or that the Walloon
                    fashions had an especial attraction to her, owing to associations and general
                    usage. France· was then, as she is now, fickle and capricious, fantastical and
                    wavering, not indeed from indifference, but because she always was ready to
                    borrow from every quarter anything that pleased her. She, however, never failed
                    to place her own stamp upon whatever she adopted, so making any fashion
                    essentially French, even though she had only just borrowed it from Spain,
                    England, Germany, or Italy. In all these countries we have seen, and still see,
                    entire provinces adhering to some ancient custom, causing them to differ
                    altogether in character from the rest of the nation. This is simply owing to the
                    fact of the fashions having become obsolete in the neighbouring places; for
                    every local costume faithfully and rigorously preserved in any community at a
                    distance from the centre of political action or government, must originally have
                    been brought there by the nobles of the country. Thus, the head-dress of Anne of
                    Brittany (1498-1514) is still that of the peasant-women of Penhoet and
                    Labrevack; and the tall conical ’ lιennin' (fig. 39) of Isabel of Bavaria (1400)
                    is still the head-dress of Normandy. <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> With the
                    view “briefly to indicate the last connecting link between modern fashions and
                    those of former periods,” the same writer proceeds to point out how, “under
                    Francis I. (1515— 1547), the costumes adopted from Italy became almost
                    stationary. Under Henry II. (1547-1559), and especially after the death of that
                    prince, the taste for frivolities made immense progress, and the style of dress
                    in ordinary use seemed day by day to lose the few traces of dignity which it
                    previously had possessed. The fashion of ruffs had been introduced into France
                    by Catherine de’ Medici (1560); and at the beginning of the 17th century that of
                    small collars. Dresses, tight at the waist, began to be made very full round the
                    hips by means of large padded rolls; and these were still more enlarged by a
                    monstrous arrangement of padded whalebone and steel, which subsequently became
                    the ridiculous ‘paniers* that were worn almost down to the present century.
                    Under the last of the Valois (1500) men’s dress was short, the jacket or jerkin
                    was pointed and trimmed round with small peaks; the velvet cap was trimmed with
                    aigrettes; the beard was pointed; a pearl hung from the left ear; and a small
                    cloak or mantle, which reached only to the waist, was carried on the shoulder.
                    The use of gloves made of scented leather became universal. Ladies wore-their
                    dresses long, very full, and of costly materials, little or no change in these
                    respects having taken place during the reign of Henry IV. (1589-1610). At this
                    period the men’s high hose were made longer and fuller, especially in Spain and
                    the Low Countries, and the fashion of large soft boots, made of doeskin or of
                    black morocco, became universal. For a long time, even in the towns, the costume
                    of the bourgeois was almost unchanged. Never having adopted either the
                    tight-fitting hose or the balloon breeches, they wore an easy jerkin, a large
                    cloak, and a felt hat, which the English made conical and with a broad brim.
                    Towards the beginning of the 17th century, the high hose, which were worn by the
                    northern nations profusely trimmed, were transformed into the ‘culottes,’ which
                    were full and open at the knees. A division thus was suddenly made between the
                    lower and the upper parts of the hose, as if the garment which covered the lower
                    limbs had been cut in two, and then garters were necessarily adopted. Almost
                    throughout Europe, the felt hat became a cap taking the exact form of the head,
                    and having a wide and flat brim turned up on one side. To boots and shoes high
                    heels were added, in place of those which before had been flat and had been
                    accompanied with single soles. Two centuries later a terrible social agitation
                    took place in Europe, after which male attire became plain, ungraceful,.</p>

                    perpetually changing, became graceful and elegant, though often approaching the
                    extravagant and absurd.”</p>

                    >V^1I.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> During the reign of the first Stuart
                    sovereign of Great Britain the fashions of dress, which under his Tudor
                    predecessor had culminated without undergoing any changes sufficiently marked to
                    give to them a fresh character, attained to even an exaggerated extravagance.
                    Notwithstanding the absence of any effigy of him, we are familiar with the
                    personal appearance and costume of James I. and VI., and in his costume we
                    possess a true type of the dress prevalent during his reign. The long-waisted,
                    peaked, and close-fitting slashed doublets of the days of Elizabeth, still
                    longer in the waist, more acutely peaked, and as far as was possible more
                    closely fitting than ever, habitually were kept in shape by means of stays worn
                    under them. The trunk-hose mercilessly slashed, became larger than before,
                    padded garments being specially congenial to the disposition and temperament of
                    the king; and, having attained to a balloon shape, they tapered down to the
                    knees of the wearer, where they were secured by sashes tied in bows at the side.
                    Cloaks and ruffs remained unchanged. Hats came into fashion that were tall in
                    the crown, slightly conical in shape, with a narrow brim turned up on one side,
                    and adorned with a jewel and a single feather, or with a rich band and a plume.
                    Large rosettes were worn on the shoes, which retained their bιoad shape, and
                    often had high red heels. Rapiers, worn without any belt crossing the person,
                    were narrow and very long in the blade. In like manner, the female dresses
                    underwent but little change, except in having their λvorst features and
                    especially <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> heir farthingales, with the lavish
                    profusion of their tasteless adornment, intensified. It was at this time,
                    however, that the custom of painting the face began to prevail; and while ruffs
                    or bands of immoderate size stretched forth from the ladies’ necks, they wore
                    the front of their dresses cut away immediately beneath them in a manner that
                    exposed the bosom in defiance of all modesty. Less fashionable ladies, between
                    1615 and 1625, discarded the tight and pointed stomacher and farthingale, and
                    wore over an easy jerkin and ample petticoat, a loose gown open in front, made
                    high to meet the ruff, and with long hanging sleeves through which the tight
                    sleeves of the jerkin were displayed; or they followed the fashion of their
                    time, modified and without its more salient absurdities. The same may be said of
                    the men who were content in some degree to follow the fashion, while altogether
                    repudiating being leaders of it. With the costume of the reign of Charles I., on
                    the whole more sober, and in more than a few respects really elegant, Vandyck
                    has made the world happily familiar. At first the ruffs were retained, their
                    size only having been diminished; but all traces both of the angular head-dress
                    and of the Mary Stuart cap, and with them of the farthingale, disappeared; and
                    after a while the ruffs followed then. The ladies wore the very full sleeves of
                    their dresses tied in at the elbows as well as gathered in at the wrists; their
                    bodies, tightly fitting, sometimes were long and pointed, and at other times not
                    longer than the natural waist; the long petticoat of some rich material was
                    displayed beneath a loose and open robe or gown, that was gathered up and had
                    short loose sleeves with deep white cuffs, and a deep falling collar or “band"
                    was fastened closely at their throat; or they wore large kerchiefs over their
                    bodies, and gowns having flowing skirts and comparatively tight sleeves.
                    Coverchefs or hoods also were worn, from which descended long veils, often of
                    such ample proportions as to resemble mantles. Patches at this time began to
                    make their appearance; and notwithstanding their intrinsic absurdity and their
                    strange faculty for disfigurement, they continued in fashion throughout the
                    century. Men’s doublets or coats, the true prototypes of the frock-coats of the
                    present day, having full sleeves made tight at the wrists, w ere rather longer
                    and worn buttoned from the waist (where they showed the shirt) upwards to the
                    falling white band; plain white cuffs, sometimes supeιseded by others of lace,
                    were also worn. The trunk-hose became loose breeches of uniform width aud open
                    at the knees, where they were fringed or had a border of lace, and were fastened
                    with sash-like garters; the stockings were tight; the shoes had large roses; and
                    the felt hat was large and wide in the brim. By the men of fashion this costume,
                    in itself really worthy of decided commendation, was easily made to assume a
                    fantastic aspect, by the adoption of rich and variously coloured fabrics and the
                    addition of lace, bunches of ribbon, feathers, embroidery, and gold lace, and
                    numerous “points” or laces to fasten the breeches to the stockings, with boots
                    long in the foot, and having tops of enormous width that were turned down and
                    lined with lace. These gentlemen, who delighted in having long hair, also wore
                    or more frequently carried on their left arm a short cloak; and they were
                    provided with basket-hilted rapiers having blades of great length. Besides
                    rejecting all bright colours, and every kind of ornamental accessory, a very
                    different class of their contemporaries reduced this same costume to its
                    simplest possible conditions, thus contrasting one extreme with another most
                    opposed to it. These men, who to their closely-cropped hair owed their famous
                    designation as “Roundheads,” with their sombre and plain garments wore their
                    felt hats of excessive height, with a great breadth of brim, and perfectly
                    plain. The buff-coats, adopted at this period as parts of the military uniform,
                    conformed in their general character to the doublets worn as ordinary dress.
                    While retaining the characteristic features of the fashions of their times, the
                    dresses of the female members of the “Roundhead’’ section of the English
                    community were made with the plainest simplicity—a simplicity, however, which
                    the taste and ingenuity of the wearers rarely failed to render graceful and
                    becoming. On his restoration, Charles II. brought with him to England the
                    fashions of dress with which he had been familiar in France; and they suited
                    -well both his own character and that irresistible and widespread reaction from
                    the stern and yet manly gloom of the Protectorate that burst out into a frenzy
                    of national recklessness. Shortly after the king’s return, indeed, and for some
                    little time afterthe re-establishment of the monarchy, in the families of graver
                    citizens a quiet style of dress, not unlike what had been prevalent for several
                    years, continued in use by both sexes. Men wore plain doublets of moderate
                    length, full breeches slightly ornamented at the knees, large bands, shoes tied
                    over the instep in bows of moderate size, and loose cloaks having long open
                    sleeves; pointed beards and moustaches continued to be worn also, and under
                    their felt hats the men retained the coifs of past times, or they covered tìieir
                    heads with coifs or caps only. Plain and in the body closely fitting, the ample
                    skirts of the ladies’ dresses, open in front to display an equally unpretending
                    under-dress, occasionally were partly covered by a no less plain apron; their
                    bands or collars, fastened in front with formal bows, were very largo and
                    generally quite plain; and their close hoods they wore tied under the chin,
                    beneath flowing veils or mantles. The very different style of costume which
                    Charles himself had learned to wear at the court of Louis XII. of France, and
                    which he speedily taught his own subjects to assume, consisted of a
                    comparatively long and loose doublet richly laced and embroidered, having large
                    and puffed out sleeves turned back a little below the elbow, leaving the lower
                    arm to be covered by the full sleeves of the shirt with their lace ruffles at
                    the wrists. Under this doublet was a vest, sleeveless but otherwise resembling
                    it, which was left open at the waist; in their turn, from beneath the vest the
                    breeches displayed their expanded width, with their ornamental bunches of ribbon
                    above the knees and lace ruffles below them. A falling band of the richest lace
                    enveloped the throat, and was loosely tied witlfan equally rich scarf of which
                    the ends hung down over the vest; an enormous periwig superseded the natural
                    hair, its curls falling in abundance over the shoulders, the beard being close
                    shaven and only a slight moustache permitted to remain. The hat, broad-brimmed
                    and having its brim on one side slightly turned up, was adorned with a rich band
                    and a profusion of drooping feathers; the stockings were tight to the leg, and
                    the shoes, made very high over the instep, ιvere tied with immense bows that
                    extended horizontally on either side of the foot; and a short cloak, no less
                    splendid in both material and enrichment than the other portions of this
                    gorgeous attire, either was suspended from the left shoulder or carried on the
                    left arm. The sword, a rapier long and narrow in the blade, was suspended from a
                    very broad and elaborately enriched belt crossing the person over the right
                    shoulder. It will be understood that in the production of this costume the
                    richest and most showy fabrics were employed; also that the men delighted in
                    exhibiting in their dress every variety as well of colour and tint as of
                    material, white, black, scarlet, and different shades of brown being in especial
                    favour, with trimmings of gold and silver lace, buttons and twist, and ribbons
                    of all breadths and every hue. The accompanying woodcut, drawn from an original
                    contemporary authority (fig. 47), gives a correct general idea of the costume of
                    the period of Charles II. In the autumn of 1666, as we learn from the
                    ever-observant Pepys, the king in council declared his purpose to set a more
                    sober and less costly fashion for dress, which he declared that he would not
                    alter. Accordingly, under his doublet Charles appeared in a “vest,” “being a
                    long cassock,” as Pepys explains, “close to the body, of black cloth and pinked
                    with white silk under it; andacoat, or doublet, over it; and the legs ruffled
                    with white ribbon, like a pigeon’s leg; and upon the whole,” adds the diarist,
                    “I wish the king may keep it, for it is a. very fine and handsome garment.” The
                    king kept it so far as afterwards it pleased him, and no further. This vest, or
                    waistcoat, has <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n505/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0505-0474"/> undergone many changes, indeed, but it never has
                    fallen into disuse since that 15th day of October 1666. In 1680 both vest and
                    doublet became considerably longer, the latter reaching quite to the knees, and
                    the former being but little shorter. The doublet was worn open, a sash about the
                    waist then confining the vest. The brims of the hats at the same time became
                    narrower, and bows of ribbon often were worn in place of feathers. The baudrick,
                    or diagonal sword-belt, worn over the doublet was very broad, and allowed the
                    hilt of the rapier to hang considerably below the left hip. About this time
                    also, when jack-boots resembling those that had formed a part of the military
                    appointments of the troopers in the civil Avar came into fashion, the sleeves of
                    doublets were lengthened, and made with very broad cuffs which doubled back from
                    the wrists. In the short reign of James II. (1685-1688), when the moustache
                    disappeared, doublets and vests still further increased in length, and the cuffs
                    of the doublet-sleeves became extravagantly large; more prominence was given to
                    the lace cravats, which were worn loosely about the throat and with their ends
                    hanging down over the upper part of the vest; the breeches and stockings
                    remained without any change of form or adjustment; halfboots were worn, and
                    buckles began at times to supersede roses and bows upon shoes; and at this time
                    the sword was occasionally carried thrust through the lower part of the doublet,
                    and almost in a horizontal position. The costume of the ladies of the Charles
                    II. era, represented with such grace and effectiveness in Lely’s pictures,
                    Planché thus describes: “A studied negligence, an elegant deshabille, is the
                    prevailing character of the costume in which they are nearly all represented;
                    their glossy ringlets escaping from a bandeau of pearls, unveiled by even the
                    transparent lawn of the band or of the partiet; and the fair round arm reclines
                    upon the voluptuous satin petticoat, while the gown of the same rich materials
                    piles up its voluminous train in the background.” During the early part of the
                    reign, however, much of the Puritan formality of then recent times lingered in
                    female dress, as it did also in the attire of the male portion of the
                    commonalty. Tightly laced bodices at no time lost favour with females of all
                    ranks and classes. Hoods were worn, but generally only for protection from the
                    weather, the prevailing usage being for females to wear their own hair in
                    natural ringlets flowing over their shoulders, and with small curls over their
                    foreheads; false hair, indeed, was sometimes, but only sometimes, worn, and worn
                    in an extravagant fashion. The custom of painting and placing patches on the
                    face became more common as the second half of the century advanced; and the
                    immodest practice of exposing the bosom then attained to the extreme of
                    indelicacy. As might have been expected at that era, the seldom dormant aim of
                    the one sex to imitate the costume of the other was in full activity; thus,
                    Pepys says,—“Walking in the gallery at Whitehall (June 1, 1664), I find the
                    ladies of honour dressed in their riding garbs, with coats and doublets with
                    deep skirts, just for all the world like mine, and their doublets buttoned up
                    the breast, with periwigs and with hats; so that only for a long petticoat
                    dragging under their men’s coats, nobody would take them for women in any point
                    whatever; which was an odd sight, and a sight that did not please me.” Somewhat
                    later, a similar “odd siglit” excited a corresponding feeling, the disapproval
                    being blended with perplexed surprise, in the mind of Sir Roger de Coverley <hi
                    rend="italic">(Spectator,</hi> June 2, 1711). Whether worn by men or women, the
                    ordinary dresses of the commonalty in th.eir general character resembled those
                    of the noble and wealthy, but were much simpler in both style and materials.</p>
                <p>Accompanied by no other decided or marked innovation than the introduction of
                    tight knee-breeches, which during the following century were worn by all
                    classes, and still form no unimportant part of English costume, the reign of
                    William III. witnessed such modifications in the costume of the two preceding
                    centuries as tended to make it more formal and appropriate, while at the same
                    time leading the way to the tasteless frivolities and excesses of the next
                    succeeding century. The doublets or coats of the gentlemen, their favourite
                    colour some tint of claret when not scarlet or black, were longer, made to fit
                    stiffly to the body, and laced and embroidered along the edges and seams and
                    around the pocket-holes or the large flaps of the pockets in their skirts; and
                    their comparatively tight sleeves had enormous cuffs that were laced and adorned
                    with buttons; large shoulder-knots of ribbon were also worn. The vests,
                    retaining their length, were left unbuttoned below the waist. Sashes
                    occasionally were worn, and sometimes over the doublet. The breeches were made
                    to fit tolerably closely to the limbs, and were, quite tight at the knees, where
                    the tightly-fitting stockings, if not gartered, were drawn over them in a roll.
                    The shoes, very high in the heel and fastened with buckles, had flaps which
                    covered the instep and rose in front of the legs for 3 or 4 inches. The full
                    shirt-sleeves with their lace ruffles were shown at the wrists; the loose
                    neckcloth, had long pendant ends terminating in lace, if it was not entirely
                    made of that material. The periwig, if possible more voluminous than ever, was
                    abundantly powdered. The hat, sometimes triangular in form and with a narrow
                    turned-up brim, was low in the crown, edged with gold-lace, and covered with
                    feathers; or, being wide-brimmed, its brim was slightly turned up at the sides,
                    when it was adorned only with a laced band and a small tuft of ribbons or
                    feathers. The cloak, when in use, was rather longer than the doublet. In winter,
                    the men kept their hands warm in small muffs that were suspended from ribbons
                    about their necks; and for summer wear they had gloves edged with lace. When not
                    attached to a broad and elaborately enriched belt crossing the right shoulder
                    over the doublet, the rapier was carried thrust through the left pocket-hole of
                    the doublet itself, the weapon being to form an acute angle at the back of the
                    wearer. A costume such as this, as a matter of course, would be subjected to
                    various modifications, and would constantly be simplified in many particulars
                    without any essential departure from the actual type. The accompanying figure
                    (fig. 48), drawn from a contemporary French engraving which represents an
                    assemblage of the most illustrious personages in France in the year 1696, when
                    compared with the numerous effigies and other portraits of the same era in this
                    country, shows the typical dress to have been identical in its essentials, and
                    characteristic on both sides of the Channel at the close of the 17th century.
                    Further comparison, extending its range over the greater number of the countries
                    of Europe, would serve to demonstrate the comprehensive prevalence of this same
                    typical dress, and at the same time to assign its various subordinate local
                    modifications to the varying influences of climate and of national character. In
                    the female dress of this period, as it is exemplified in portraits of ladies of
                    rank and fashion, stiffness and a formality of aspect were strangely blended
                    with eccentricity and frivolous display. Bodices, very long in the waist and
                    rather obtusely pointed both behind and before, were very tightly laced over
                    rigid corsets; rich petticoats or under-dresses, partly covered with equally
                    rich small aprons, were displayed from under full and flowing dresses that were
                    gathered up in masses at the back of the wearer, or were drawn back and made to
                    trail along on the ground behind her. At first very short and wide and edged
                    with lace, from within which the delicate sleeves of the undergarment issued
                    forth, the sleeves of the gowns after a while became tight and were prolonged to
                    the wrists where they terminated in deep and wide upturned cuffs whence drooped
                    a profusion of lace lappets or ruffles. Furbelows were introduced and worn in
                    profusion upon dresses of every kind, including scarves and cloaks; and the
                    fashion for adopting doublets and vests, with neckcloths, resembling those worn
                    by men was prevalent in riding and walking costume. Heavy head-dresses also
                    succeeded to the flowing ringlets and to the natural gracefulness of the
                    coiffure of the era of Charles II. The hair, combed up and with an inclination
                    backwards from the forehead, was surmounted by strata of ribbon and lace,
                    sometimes intermingled with feathers, and a kerchief or scarf of some very light
                    material thrown over all was permitted to hang down to the waist over en below
                    it. Structures so produced assumed various forms, some of them being made to
                    project while others either rose vertically or expanded in a horizontal
                    direction, height, however, being the special aim; but in every case the result
                    was the reverse of graceful or becoming. Hats, low in the crown and with wide
                    brims, were worn over hoods when cold or when protection from wet required their
                    adoption.</p>

                    The 17th century having been treated as a period of transition in the matter of
                    costume between the Middle Ages and modern times, the era of modern costume may
                    be defined to commence with the l8th century—that is, fourteen years before the
                    accession of the sovereigns of the House of Hanover to the crown of Great
                    Britain. Until in the course of this century it fell into general disuse for
                    regular military service, defensive armour must be considered to have maintained
                    a claim to have been regarded, under certain conditions and to a certain extent,
                    as identified with the dress of an important and influential section of the
                    community; that claim, how <pb break="no"

                    tenacity, altogether ceased to exist shortly after the commencement of the era
                    of modern costume. For a considerable time, indeed almost till the middle of the
                    century, costume must be considered to have been modified rather than subjected
                    to decided innovation. Men’s dress remained the same in its general character,
                    but became improved from being simplified and from having its decoration toned
                    down. Planché says :—“Square-cut coats and long-flapped waistcoats with pockets
                    in them, the latter meeting the stockings, still drawn up over the knee so high
                    as entirely to conceal the breeches (then made to fit with comparative tightness
                    to the limbs), but gartered below it; large hanging cuffs and lace ruffles; the
                    skirts of the coat stiffened out with wire or buckram, from between which peeped
                    the hilt of the sword, deprived of the broad and splendid belt in which it swung
                    in preceding reigns; blue or scarlet silk stockings with gold or silver clocks;
                    lace neckcloths; square-toed short-quartered shoes, with high red heels and
                    small buckles; very long and formally curled perukes, black riding wigs,
                    bag-wigs, and nightcap wigs; small three-cornered hats laced with gold or silver
                    galloon, and sometimes trimmed with feathers,—composed the habit of the noblemen
                    and gentlemen during the reigns of Queen Anne and George I.” To this habit, the
                    dress of the commonalty, according to custom, conformed in all characteristic
                    essentials. Meanwhile, when they did not wear such head-dresses as were very
                    low, the ladies continued to elevate their strange and uncouth head-gear. About
                    1710, as if resolved that their figures should rival their heads in
                    extravagance, they introduced the hooped petticoat, at first worn in such a
                    manner as to give to the person of the wearer below her very tightly laced waist
                    a contour resembling the letter V inverted— <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ∖∙ The
                    hooped dresses, thus introduced, about 1740 attained to an enormous expansion;
                    and, being worn at their full circumference immediately below the waist, they in
                    many ways emulated the most outrageous of the farthingales of the Elizabethan
                    age. Some few years also before the middle of this century the “saque” made its
                    appearance: it was a loose gown, open in front, which was worn hanging from the
                    shoulders quite free of the person of the wearer, and was gathered up over the
                    hoop when not permitted to trail along on the ground; in this unsightly garment
                    any approach to “fit” was necessarily out of the question. At the same period,
                    the men began to lay aside more of their lace and of the other ornamental
                    accessories of their garments; their coats became longer, and their waistcoats
                    somewhat shorter; the cuffs of their collarless coats increased in size until
                    they reached their elbows; their stockings, when still drawn over their breeches
                    above the knee, were so adjusted as to permit their breeches to be seen, but the
                    breeches began to be made to fasten over the stockings, with buttons and buckles
                    below the knee; their wigs ceased to curl over their shoulders, and pigtails
                    came into fashion. The costume of this era has been immortalized by Hogarth.
                    During the forty years of this century that George III. was king, the fashions
                    of dress passed through a remarkable variety of changes, each change
                    contributing its own full share to the aggregate of extravagance and absurdity
                    that was surpassed at no earlier period. About 1760 a passion for adorning the
                    dress of both sexes began to revive; and it soon exercised its influence,
                    reckless of all true taste, with unsparing energy—the head-dresses of the
                    ladies, wſhich about 1780 attained to the culminating degree of extravagant
                    unsightliness, being its specially favoured field for operations. Fig. 49,
                    faithfully reproduced from a contemporary engraving, shows under one of its
                    least extravagant and tasteless forms a fashionable head-dress of the period in
                    question. As a matter of course, in the construction of every variety of
                    head-gear such as this, which in every instance necessarily obliterated all
                    traces of the true form of the head and destroyed all proportion in the entire
                    figure, false hair was used in abundance with a profusion of objects of a
                    so-called decorative order. Until about 1785 the type of men’s dress remained
                    established without any essential change: the coat was made to fall back more
                    than had been the usage a few years earlier, the object being to display more
                    effectively the long-flapped waistcoat with the pockets in its laced flaps; the
                    stockings always were gathered up below the knee under the breeches, wſhich were
                    fastened by buckles; the heels of shoes were lowered, and the buckles worn in
                    them were comparatively small; cocked-hats were worn,’with laced ruffles and
                    cravats, and bag-wigs, which generally were powdered; and a broad black ribbon,
                    called a “solitaire,” was placed about the throat and fastened behind. This
                    costume about 1785 gave way to the dress that in France was developed with the
                    advance of the Révolution. Men’s coats became very long, and sloped off from the
                    waist, where they were buttoned, both upwards and downwards; their sleeves were
                    moderately tight with small close-fitting cuffs, and their collars either were
                    high and doubled back stiffly, or made to spread upon the shoulders; the flaps
                    of their pockets were placed at the back and close together; and all puffing and
                    lace and embroidery were laid aside. The flaps of waistcoats, if retained at
                    all, were short, and the garment itself was made open at the throat, the frill
                    of the shirt appearing from under it. The breeches, fitting very tightly, either
                    were cut short at the knee, or carried a few inches below it and there buttoned
                    and tied with strings, knee-buckles except for court-dresses having gone out of
                    fashion; the tight breeches also at this same time frequently were prolonged as
                    pantaloons to the middle of the calf of the leg, where they were met by half
                    top-boots. A rather large cravat was tied loosely in bows about the throat; the
                    hair, worn long generally, was powdered and tied in a queue; and the hats, round
                    in form, were either of moderate height in the crown, or tall and conical, and
                    their nearly flat round brim was either narrow or moderately broad. The ladies
                    delighted in tight bodices, furbelowed dresses, gorgeous petticoats, worn over
                    hoops varying in size, and saques, which in reality were the mantles of early
                    times revived, without a revival of their grace and elegance. About 1770, the
                    sleeves of the ladies’ dresses were tight on the upper arm, where they suddenly
                    became very large, and, drooping at the elbow, they terminated in rich fringes
                    of lace ruffles; a few years later the sleeves expanded from the shoulder, till
                    they became a succession of constantly enlarging ruffles and lappets; and again,
                    before 1780, they became tight throughout, with small cuffs and no lace at the
                    elbows, when they were worn with long gloves. Influenced, doubtless, by the
                    great portraitpainters of that time, about 1785 the female head-dresses
                    gradually subsided, and their worst features for the most part disappeared. Hats
                    having an immense expanse of brim grew into favour, and the natural hair was
                    permitted to fall over the shoulders in ringlets. Small hoops were worn in 1788,
                    with a dress open in front and trailing on the ground behind, their sleeves
                    tight and frilled at the elbows. This dress often was worn with a tight and very
                    low bodice, a white kerchief being gathered closely about the throat, and while
                    entirely enveloping the bust, being <pb break="no"

                    resemble the breast of a pigeon. Round straw hats, with drooping edgefrills,
                    bows of ribbon, feathers, and high crowns, completed this costume. Then in about
                    five years came the era of short waists, that might be distinguished as the
                    waistless era when ladies’ dresses, no longer distended by hoops, fell in
                    straight loose folds to their feet. About 1795 open dresses were discarded; the
                    saques ceased to be; waists became longer, and when the present century dawned
                    they regained their natural position and form. At this time bonnets were worn
                    that incased the wearer’s head, or were flat and projecting. They also were
                    adorned with a taste that was comparatively simple and becoming; and, at the
                    same time, the hair, free from powder, was dressed in curls about the face and
                    neck. While thus in ordinary life costume at the close of the 18th century
                    became approximately what might be desired, court-dress still exhibited the
                    extravagancies that under other conditions had happily become obsolete, the hoop
                    with all its really offensive mass of so-called decorative allies retaining
                    their ground in defiance of all opposition, until the chief offender and its
                    worst associates were banished by royal command when George IV. had become
                    king.</p>

                <p>The peers of the United Kingdom, on occasions of state and ceremony, over their
                    habitual dress wear robes of scarlet cloth, made long and of ample dimensions,
                    which are adjusted on the right shoulder and are guarded with bands or rows of
                    ermine, the robes of the different orders and ranks of the peerage being
                    distinguished as follows :— Barons, who now form the lowest order of British
                    peers, on their scarlet robes have two bands of ermine; viscounts, whose order
                    intervenes between the barons and the earls, have two and a half bands of
                    ermine; the robes of earls have three bands; those of marquises have three and a
                    half rows; and upon the robes of dukes, whose order is the highest, the ermine
                    is in four rows.</p>

                <p>So long as the highest offices in the law were held, in accordance with mediaeval
                    usage, by dignified ecclesiastics, those eminent personages were represented in
                    their monu.- mental effigies, not as wearing judicial or other legal dress and
                    robes, but as habited in the official vestments of their rank as churchmen; and
                    that this practice continued in force down to the time of the Reformation is
                    shown in the brass in Ely Cathedral to Thomas Goodrich, bishop of that see, who
                    also was lord high chancellor of England. Monumental effigies of judges,
                    however, and of other personages of note in the law, occasionally occur from the
                    middle of the 14th century downwards, which give information as to the form and
                    adjustment of legal robes that doubtless is authentic, and therefore valuable;
                    but these authorities do not extend to any indications of colour. The actual
                    dress of these legal personages evidently differed but little, if it differed at
                    all, from the ordinary costume of their day; but over their dress they wore a
                    tippet, and a robe which with rare exceptions was fastened on the right
                    shoulder, and their heads were covered with a close-fitting coif, in addition to
                    which in the 15th and 16th centuries they carried the hood with the long pendant
                    scarf, so characteristic of those times, cast over one of their shoulders. It is
                    probable, also, that the long and loose gown with wide sleeves in general use
                    assumed at a comυaratively early period the aspect of an official robe by being
                    made of the same material and colour as the unquestionably official mantle. In
                    the second half of the l5th century and in the century following, the gowns worn
                    by the judges when on the bench, and on all occasions of state and ceremony,
                    certainly constituted parts of their official attire. Scarlet appears to have
                    been the prevalent colour of judicial robes, with linings and trimmings of
                    miniver—the white skin of the ermine—until the l7th century, when on certain
                    occasions the judges wore robes of black or violet; but robes and gowns of a
                    yellowish hue, and distinguished as “mustard-coloured,” were also worn; and
                    there is a record of an issue of “liveries” of both cloth and silk with fur from
                    the great wardrobe, in the time of Edw ard III., to the justices, the colour of
                    each fabric being green. Again, in similar allowances under Richard II. and
                    Henry VI., “green” is a colour specially mentioned with “violet in grain,” and
                    fur of “miniver.” In his fine sculptured effigy at Harwood in Yorkshire, Chief
                    Justice Sir William Gascoigne (died in 1419) is represented having suspended
                    from his girdle an anlace or short sword, with a gypcière; and the same
                    appendages also appear in several brasses to judges. In four illuminations,
                    which have been reproduced in fac-simile and published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arcliaeologia</hi> (xxxix. 358), in which are represented sittings of the
                    king’s four superior courts in the time of Henry VI.—Chancery, King’s Bench,
                    Common Pleas, and Exchequer—the robes and costume of the lord chancellor,
                    judges, serjeants, barristers, and officers of the courts are shown with minute
                    attention to both colour and details. The chancellor and one judge who sits
                    beside him, and all the judges of the three other courts, are alike in being
                    attired in ample robes of scarlet, lined and trimmed with white fur; but the
                    chancellor alone wears a scarlet robe which is not fastened on the shoulder and
                    has openings pierced on each side to admit his arms passing through, so showing
                    the sleeves of his under garment to be white; he is further distinguished by
                    having about his shoulders and over his robe a tippet of scarlet, lined and
                    bordered with white fur; the white lining of his hood, also, stands up about his
                    neck like a collar, and on his head he has a close-fitting dark brown cap. Under
                    his scarlet robe, the judge sitting on the right of the chancellor, who holds in
                    his hands a sealed document, is habited in a gown of the same colour;
                    bare-headed and tonsured, he also has the white lining of his hood adjusted
                    about his neck after the manner of a collar. To the right and left, two on each
                    side, their seats on the same level with the two central scarlet-robed figures,
                    four other personages, who may have been masters in Chancery, are seated,
                    habited in flowing “mustard-colour” robes not adjusted on the shoulder, and
                    having falling over their shoulders large hoods of the same colour lined with
                    white; they all are bare-headed, and three of their number certainly are
                    tonsured. Five judges sit in the Court of King’s Bench, robed alike in scarlet
                    gowns, with tippets, and mantles worn over their tippets, and fastened on the
                    right shoulder. All these robes are lined and bordered with white, and the
                    mantles have scarlet hoods worn as collars closely encircling the throat. These
                    five judges wear white coifs, as do the seven judges, all of them robed exactly
                    like their brethren of the King’s Bench, who preside in the Court of Common
                    Pleas. Over the Court of Exchequer a baron presides, who is robed in the rame
                    manner as the judges of the two courts last named; but he differs from them in
                    wearing (doubtless over his coif, which is not shown) a large scarlet hood-like
                    cap, of the fashion prevalent at his day. He sits with two other judges on each
                    side of him, who wear “mustard-colour” robes of the same character; two of them
                    also wear the large caps; while the two others, wearing coifs, hold similar caps
                    in their hands; all these caps are “mustard-colour.” <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0508-0477"/> At the table in each court stand serjeants,
                    counsel, notaries, clerks, and officers of various ranks, all of them in their
                    proper official costume. All of them bare-headed, some of these persons wear
                    full-sleeved gowns reaching to their feet, of blue, green, or mustard-colour;
                    and their gowns, which have small black collars, are adjusted at the waist with
                    narrow black girdles. Others, wearing similar girdles, are habited in gowns of
                    the same fashion that are party-coloured, the division and junction of the two
                    colours being vertical or per pale, and the colours being blue and green, blue
                    or green and mustard-colour, green and murrey, and two tints of green. These
                    gowns also are “rayed,” or striped, either diagonally or vertically, with
                    yellow, white, or blue. The notaries carry at their girdles their inkhorn and
                    penner. The serjeants alone, who appear in each one of the four pictures, are
                    habited in long and flowing gowns, worn without any belt, all of them
                    party-coloured blue and green and rayed, with tippets and hoods of the same
                    colours; these learned gentlemen, also, have on their heads coifs similar to
                    those worn by the judges (fig. 50). The use of party -coloured garments,
                    undoubtedly of heraldic origin, by persons of various classes and ranks, has
                    already been noticed. In the absence of any express record of the source whence
                    certain officers of the law derived their partycoloured gowns, it has been
                    considered probable that these were livery gowns, presented to serjeants and
                    barristers by their clients of high rank, with their retaining fees. However
                    this may be, it appears certain that their partycoloured robes were worn by
                    serjeants long before the l5th century; and, when giving his view as to their
                    significance, in the following passage from a charge delivered to certain
                    serjeants then newly created, in the thirty-sixth year of Queen Elizabeth, the
                    lord chief justice suggested these party-coloured robes having been worn by the
                    judges :— “By the party-coloured garments,” said that learned personage, “being
                    both of deep colours, and such as the judges themselves in ancient times used
                    (for so we receive it by tradition), is signified soundness and depth of
                    judgment, an ability to discerne of causes, what colour soever be cast over
                    them, and under or with what vail or shadow soever they be disguised.” In the
                    15th century Sir John Fortescue said of a judge,—“Being a serjeant-at-law, he is
                    clothed in a long priest-like robe, with a furred cape about his shoulders, and
                    thereupon a hood with two labels (such as doctors of the law wear in certain
                    universities with their coif); but, being made a justice, instead of his hood he
                    must wear a cloak closed upon his right shoulder, all the other ornaments of a
                    serjeant still remaining, saving that his vesture shall <hi rend="italic">not be
                    party-coloured</hi> as a serjeant’s may, and his cape furred with miniver,
                    whereas the serjeant’s cape is ever furred with white lambskin.” Whatever at
                    various periods may have been the usage with judges, the wearing of
                    party-coloured robes by serjeants appears to have been discontinued about the
                    commencement of the present century. In our own times, except on some special
                    occasions when their robes are either purple or scarlet, serjeants wear a black
                    silk gown, like that of queen’s counsel. The robes of the junior members of the
                    bar, made of black stuff instead of silk, are further distinguished by certain
                    peculfarities of form. Reminiscences of the coifs of earlier days, and of the
                    caps with the pendants, still linger in the wigs worn by the entire learned
                    brotherhood of the law, and in certain peculiar appendages attached to their
                    robes. The large bands also, worn at the present day, may be considered to have
                    had their prototypes in the labels already mentioned, which appear, dependent on
                    his breast from his hood, in the brass to Thomas Rolf, barrister, 1440, at
                    Gosfield, Essex. Fine and characteristic examples of judicial costume are
                    preserved in various monumental effigies, some sculptured and others engraved,
                    which include in their number the memorials of Judge Thomas Owen, 1598, and Lord
                    Chief Justice Sir Thomas Richardson, 1634, both in Westminister Abbey; the
                    effigy of Judge Richard Harper, <hi rend="italic">temp.</hi> Mary, at
                    Swarthstone, Derbyshire; and the brasses, ranging in date from 1400 to 1553, at
                    Deerhurst, Watford, Gunby, Graveney, Latton, Dagenham, Cowthorpe, Norbury,
                    Milton, and Narburgh. It may here be added that, in various representations of
                    notaries of the 15th and 16th centuries, they appear in the ordinary civilian
                    attire of their period with a pen-case ard inkhorn suspended from the girdle of
                    their tunic; there is a good example in a brass in the church of St Mary’s
                    Tower, Ipswich; while several of these personages are introduced into the
                    illuminations representing the courts of law described above.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Naval and Military.</hi></p>
                <p>Any attempt to notice in detail the naval and military uniforms in use at
                    successive periods even in England would far exceed our present limits. At the
                    same time, it appears desirable here to observe that the very decided
                    distinction between “uniform.” and especially military uniform, and contemporary
                    civil costume now obtaining is of comparatively recent date. Throughout the
                    armour era such distinction can scarcely be said to have existed, nor were the
                    services afloat and on land distinguished by special and recognized
                    peculiarities of dress. In the navy, the distinctive characteristics of uniform
                    have become the cocked hat, epaulets of bullion, the crown-and-anchor button,
                    and a by no means lavish application of gold-lace— the cloth, a dark blue with
                    facings and lining of white, except during the reign of William IV,, when the
                    white was superseded by scarlet. Gradations of naval rank are indicated by the
                    presence of a crown, a star or stars, and an anchor on the shoulder-strap of the
                    epaulets, and by the size and comparative richness of the bullion; also by the
                    number and the breadth of distinct strips of gold-lace that encircle the cuffs
                    of coats and jackets; all executive officers being further distinguished by a
                    coil of the gold-lace attached to the uppermost of the cuff-circles. From the
                    time that the stout “buff-coat” of the era of the Commonwealth succeeded to what
                    still lingered of the plate panoply and the mail of earlier times, the uniform
                    of the British army, for a while in many essential features conforming to the
                    prevailing characteristics of the general costume of the day, has undergone a
                    succession of changes for the most part more remarkable for variety and often
                    for caprice, than expressive either of true taste in the consistent adornment of
                    a soldier’s person, or of considerate adjustment to the exigencies of military
                    service, the exceptions being the judicious innovations happily introduced early
                    in the present century by the duke of Wellington. Scarlet obtains as the
                    distinctive national British military colour, certain arms of the service being
                    attired in blue or dark green; while the recent volunteer movement has brought
                    with it a variety of uniforms expressly adapted for use by the reserved forces.

                <p>Without a rival in the picturesque individuality of its character, the national
                    costume of the Highlands of Scotland is remarkable as well for the manner in
                    which it has been made to distinguish the various clans or septs of the same
                    race, as for a certain general uniformity that significantly intimates the
                    brotherhood of the clans as alike sharing a single common nationality. It
                    probably is due to its own distinctive peculiarities that the Scottish Highland
                    dress should have been inherited and transmitted from generation to generation
                    almost without any change, and that at the present day it should be held in as
                    high a degree of estimation as it ever enjoyed in past times. In early ages,
                    having been influenced in a certain degree by the general fashions of dress
                    prevalent at successive periods, a comparatively slight use of defensive armour
                    having also for a while been adopted as a military accessory, shortly after the
                    commencement of the 17th century this costume may be considered to have assumed
                    the character which since that time it has maintained, with scarcely any
                    modification except in the style of the short tunic. Before the accession of
                    James VI. of Scotland to the throne of Great Britain, the tunic and the
                    “phillibeg,” or kilt, formed a single garment, whereas apparently during the
                    reign of the son of Queen Mary Stuart the kilt became a separate garment, to be
                    adjusted about the waist, and reaching not quite to the knees after the manner
                    of a short petticoat, a vest and tunic being separate garments also. Stockings,
                    gartered below the knees, which thus would be left bare, with shoes, completed
                    the equipment of the lower limbs. A cap or bonnet, without any peak, decorated
                    with a spray of heather, was worn as a head covering, the bonnets of the chiefs
                    being distinguished by the addition of eagles’ feathers. In front of the person,
                    and depending from a belt encircling the waist, was worn the “spleuchan,” or
                    pocket-purse, covered with fur; and a “plaid,” or scarf, of ample dimensions,
                    generally adjusted across the person of the wearer, and having the ends hanging
                    down from a brooch fastened on the left shoulder, as in fig. 52, completed the
                    costume; occasionally, however, the plaid was gathered up so as to admit more
                    free movement in the manner represented in fig. 51.</p>
                <p>The weapons were a broadsword, or “claymore,” having a straight blade and a
                    basket-hilt, attached to a broad baudrick which passed over the right shoulder,
                    and a dirk worn on the right side, the sheath of the dirk being also provided
                    with a hunting-knife. Before the general use of firearms by the Highlanders,
                    they carried for defence a circular target on the left arm. The two accompanying
                    figures, which show the different modes of adjusting the plaid, are also
                    examples, the one of the tartan in which green is the prevailing colour, with
                    narrow checks of red (fig. 51), a chief of the clan MacDonell, and the other
                    (fig. 52), a piper of the clan Gregarach, of a tartan which is red with narrow
                    black checks. The colours, and the “set” or patterns of the checks, of the
                    tartans of the different clans, the Royal Stuart being the richest of all, have
                    been determined for a considerable time, the actual era of their original
                    introduction not having been definitively determined. The costume of each clan
                    is fully and faithfully represented in Μ Tan’s volumes, referred to below.</p>

                <p>To compensate in some degree for unavoidable conciseness, as much space as
                    possible is here assigned to references to publications which comprehend within
                    their range the consideration and illustration of minute details, and which also
                    treat of costume under widely varying conditions and regarded from very
                    diiferent points of view. No attempt is made to give a list that is even
                    approximately complete, but attention is directed to a selected series of works
                    of a typical and authoritative character, in which is concentrated direct,
                    specific, and suggestive information. In its historical aspect, the study of
                    costume implies a systematic comparison of the costumes of different races and
                    countries. Reference must also be made to those monumental works of art that
                    have come down to our own times comparatively unmutilated, which are also of
                    equal value as illustrations of armour. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Arms and
