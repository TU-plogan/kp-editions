                <p><label type="entry">CORNWALL</label>, the most westerly county in England, is
                    also that which extends farthest to the south. The extreme western point of the
                    mainland is the Land’s End, 5° 4T 3T ’ W. long.; the extreme southern point is
                    the Lizard Head, in 49° 57' 30* N. lat. It is bounded on all sides by the sea,
                    except on the east, where it joins Devonshire. The River Tamar forms the general
                    boundary between the two counties from its source in the parish of Morwenstow.
                    At the source of the river the boundary turns westward to the sea, cutting off
                    from Cornwall the point of Hartlaud. Cornwall is in effect a long promontory,
                    which gradually narrows toward the Land’s End, and has one deeply projecting
                    spur ending in the Lizard. The breadth of the county is nowhere very great; and
                    the two seas, the English and the British channels, are visible at once from
                    several parts of the high land of the interior. The greatest length of the
                    county, from the Tamar to the Land’s End, is 80 miles. It covers an area,
                    including the Scilly Islands, of 869,878 acres, or 1359 square miles; contains 9
                    hundreds (16 divisions), 216 parishes, 28 market towns; and in 1871 had 362,343
                    inhabitants (169,706 males, 192,637 females). The population in 1861 numbered
                    369,390 persons, and in 1851 it was 355,559, showing an increase between 1851
                    and 1871 of 2 per cent. Cornwall is included in the western circuit. Originally
                    forming part of the diocese of Exeter, it was in 1876 disjoined therefrom and
                    erected into a separate bishopric—that of Truro. The assizes for the county are
                    held at Bodmin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.—</hi> The rivers all flow towards the south, with the
                    exception of the Camel and the Alan, which, uniting, fall into the sea at
                    Padstow. Every northern coombe, however, has its streamlet. The rivers of the
                    south coast are—the Tamar, by far the most important; the Lynher, which falls
                    into it; the Looe and the Fowey rivers, falling into creeks at those places; and
                    the Fal, on which stands Falmouth. Except the Tamar none of these streams are of
                    great size or length of course.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology —</hi> The Carbonaceous formations of North Devon
                    extend into the north-western angle of Cornwall, but by far the greater part of
                    the county belongs to the Devonian or grauwacke series of rocks, consisting of
                    slates and shales, which occupy much of South Devon, and occur again in North
                    Devon and Somersetshire. From the Devonians four large patches of granite
                    project at intervals. The Land’s End district forms the most westerly of these
                    granite patches, each one of which is of considerably less area than the
                    granitic region of Dartmoor, east and north of which true granite does not occur
                    in England except in Cumberland and Westmoreland. The highest point of the
                    Dartmoor granite rises to 2050 feet, Tlιe highest point in Cornwall is Brown
                    Willy, 1368 feet. This is in the most easterly patch of granite, and the height
                    of each patch diminishes westward until the granite of the Scilly Isles, which
                    lie beyond the Land’s End, and belong to the same system, reaches, at its
                    highest, to no more than 140 feet. A large mass of serpentine occupies the
                    district about the Lizard Head; and the Devonian rocks are traversed by numerous
                    veins and outbreaks of trap and of “elvans,”— the name locally given to
                    porphyries, granitic and felspathic. The most curious pile of weathered granite
                    is the Cheesewring, near Liskeard. Roche Rocks are formed by protruding trap.
                    The mineral veins, for which Cornwall has so long been famous, occur in both the
                    Devonian rocks and the granitic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scenery.—</hi> The distinctive scenery of Cornwall is to be
                    observed on her coast line, which is much indented, and consists mostly of bold,
                    rugged, and fantastically shaped rocks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soil. —</hi> The position of the county between two seas, and
                    the character of its geological formations, affect the cultivation of the soil,
                    and the character of its climate. The soil of a great part of Cornwall is
                    indifferent, and the interior, where the ground rises to its greatest height, is
                    so completely exposed to the sea-winds that sweep across it from east and west,
                    that it remains almost without cultivation. The granite district west of
                    Launceston is broken and picturesque, with rough <hi rend="italic">tors</hi> or
                    hills and boulders. This is for the most part a region of furze and heather; but
                    after passing Bodmin, the true Cornish moorland asserts itself,—bare, desolate,
                    and impracticable, broken and dug into hillocks, sometimes due to primaeval
                    stream-works, sometimes to more modern search for metals. The seventy miles from
                    Launceston to Mount’s Bay have been not untruly called “the dreariest strip of
                    earth traversed by any English high road.” There is hardly more cultivation on
                    the higher ground west of Mount’s Bay, or in the “Meneage,” or “rocky country,”
                    the old Cornish name of the promontory which ends in the Lizard. Long coombes
                    and valleys, however, descend from this upper moorland towards the coast on both
                    sides. In them the soil is frequently rich and deep; there are good arable and
                    pasture farms, and the natural oak wood which these coombes or gullies contain
                    has been well Cared for and increased by modern plantations. Hitherto, however,
                    the wealth of Cornwall has lain not so much in the soil, but underground, and in
                    the seas which beat against her coast. Hence the favourite Cornish toast,—“fish,
                    tin, and copper.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">climate</hi> of Cornwall is peculiar. Snow seldom lies for
                    more than a few days, and the winters are less severe than in any other part of
                    England. The sea-winds, except in a few sheltered places, prevent timber-trees
                    from attaining to any great size, but the air is mild, and the lower vegetation,
                    especially in the Penzance district, is almost southern in its luxuriance. This
                    is partly due tc the influence of the Gulf Stream, which passes but a short
                    distance west of the Scilly Islands. Geraniums, fuchsias, myrtles, hydrangeas,
                    and camellias grow to a considerable size, and flourish through the winter at
                    Penzance and round Falmouth; and in the Scilly Isles a great variety of exotics
                    may be seen flourishing in the open air. Stone fruit, and <pb break="no"

                    full flavour as in the neighbouring county, owing to the want of dry heat. The

                        rend="italic">Pinus insignis,</hi> and other firs succeed well in the
                    western part of the county. All native plants display a perfection of beauty
                    hardly to be seen elsewhere, and the furze, including the double blossomed

                    to Cornwall, cover the moorland and the cliff summits with a blaze of the
                    richest colour. On the whole the climate is healthy, though the constant west
                    and south-west winds, bringing with them great bodies of cloud from the
                    Atlantic, render it damp and showery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi> has not received so much attention here as the
                    more remunerative although more speculative pursuit of mining. Barley, wheat,
                    and oats are the principal corn crops, and the acreage under each of these is
                    much the same in amount; while of green crops one-half the acreage is occupied
                    by turnips, a fifth by mangolds, and only a tenth by potatoes. Early potatoes,
                    brocoli, and asparagus are grown extensively around. Penzance, where the climate
                    is very equable, and these products are sent off in large quantities to the
                    London market. The stock of animals is considerable, and has recently been
                    increased to some extent. The cattle, which on some farms are used for
                    ploughing, belong mostly to the Devon breed. The following tables, taken from
                    the agricultural returns, show the acreage of crops and numbers of live stock in
                    the years 1873 and 1876 respectively:—</p>

                <p>With reference to the division of the land, according to the “Owners of Land”
                    Return, 1873, the county was in that year divided among 13,866 separate
                    proprietors, holding laud estimated at a total value of £1,235,167. There were
                    8717 owners of less than 1 acre, and the largest separate property amounted to
                    25,910 acres. Of the whole proprietors 62 per cent, held less than 1 acre of
                    land, which is a little under the proportion of small proprietors in the
                    neighbouring county of Devon, and still more under that of all England. The
                    average size of the properties was 54 acres, while that of all England was 34,
                    and the average value per acre was £l, l2s. 6⅛d. as against £3 the average of
                    the whole country. The proprietors who in 1873 held more than 10,000 acres in
                    the county were the following:— Viscount Falmouth, 25,910; Lord Robartes
                    (Lanhydrock), 22,234; Hon. G. Μ. Fortescue (Boconnoc), 17,208; G. L. Bassett
                    (Tehidy Park), 16,969; Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, 13,288; Duchy of Cornwall,
                    12,516; C. H. T. Hawkins (Probus), 12,119; and Lord John Thynne, 10,244.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Economic Geology and Mines.—</hi> The granite, the slate, and
                    the serpentine of Cornwall are of the first importance. The mines are among the
                    chief features of the county. Granite is largely quarried in various districts,
                    especially at Luxulian, on the Liskeard moors, and at Penryn, and has served for
                    the material of London and Waterloo bridges, the docks of Chatham, and many
                    great public works. The granite of Cornwall is for the most part coarse-grained;
                    but in this respect it differs considerably in different places, and the
                    coarse-grained rock is often traversed by veins of finer texture. From the
                    Delabole quarries, in the Devonian series, near Tintagel, the best slate in the
                    kingdom is extracted, and is largely exported; 120 tons are raised on an average
                    daily. These slates were in great repute in the 16th century and earlier.
                    Serpentine is quarried in the Lizard district, where alone it is found, and,
                    besides its use as a decorative stone, it is exported in small quantities to
                    Bristol for the manufacture of carbonate of magnesia. China-clay is prepared
                    artificially from decomposed granite, chiefly in the neighbourhood of St
                    Austell, and is exported to an annual amount of about 80,000 tons. The chief
                    mineral productions of Cornwall, considered as objects of trade, are tin and
                    copper, the former being found nowhere in the United Kingdom except in Cornwall
                    and Devon. Both these metals occur most plentifully in the Devonian series, but
                    for the most part in the neighbourhood of granite, or of its modification,
                    elvan. Tlιe veins of ore are arranged in groups as follows :—1. That of St
                    Austell, chiefly stanniferous; 2. St Agnes, chiefly stanniferous; 3. Gwennap,
                    Redruth, and Camborne, chiefly cupriferous; 4.'Breage, Marazion, and Gwinear, of
                    mixed character; 5. St Just and St Ives, mainly stanniferous. Besides tin and
                    copper, antimony ores are found where the Devonian rocks are much traversed by
                    traps, as at Endellyon, Port Isaac, and St Germans. Manganese is also found
                    under similar conditions. Some lead occurs, and some small mines are worked, but
                    with no great results; and iron, in lodes, as brown haematite, has been w orked
                    extensively near Lostwithiel and elsewhere. Metals occur in the lines of fault
                    and fissure, which extend through the different geological formations of Devon
                    and Cornwall. In Devon and in East Cornwall these lines run nearly N. and S.,
                    and are crossed by others running E. and W. In West Cornwall the lines are more
                    bent, and the main fissures take a direction nearly parallel with the general
                    range of land. Metallic fissures are locally termed lodes. Ores are not
                    disseminated through all parts of the fissures in which they are found, but are
                    gathered in patches known as “bunches of ore,” the intervening portions
                    containing strings and specks of metal, but in quantities too small to be
                    profitably worked. It should be observed that in all lodes or fissures, whatever
                    may be the nature of their produce, the parts most highly inclined are always
                    the most productive. Tin occurs not only in lodes but in streams of stones and
                    minute grains, carried from the head of the lode, where it neared the surface,
                    apparently by some great force of water, which must have rushed from N. to S.,
                    since thø great streams of tin are in all instances carried toward the S. coast.
                    Stream tin is found immediately on the hard rocky surface of the country, and is
                    covered by numerous tertiary deposits, which indicate that much of the coast
                    line has been depressed and again raised, since the first deposit of the tin
                    stones. Oxide of tin also generally occurs in the “gossan,” or ochreous
                    substance which forms the upper part of a good copper lode. The native ore from
                    the mine or the stream-work is known as black tin. White tin is the metal after
                    smelting. In the stream works tin pebbles are sometimes found of 10 or 12 lb
                    weight, and great masses of rock richly impregnated with metal have occurred
                    weighing more than 200 lb. But the small or grain tin, as it is called, is of
                    better quality.</p>
                <p>Tin occurs in both granite and slate; copper for the most part in granite. The
                    most important Cornish copper ore is the sulphuret, commonly known as grey ore
                    by the miners; but copper pyrites, or the bisulphuret of copper, occurs far more
                    frequently in both Cornwall and Devon. The tin of Cornwall has been known and
                    worked from a period long before the dawn of certain history. Copper, which lies
                    deeper in the earth, and consequently cannot be “streamed” for, was almost
                    unnoticed in the county until the end of the 15th century, and little attention
                    was paid to it until the last years of the 17th. No mine seems to have been
                    worked exclusively for copper before the year <pb break="no"

                    had been bought by Bristol merchants, to their great gain, at the rate of from
                        <hi rend="italic">£2,</hi> 10s. to £4 per ton. In 1718 a Mr Coster gave a
                    great impulse to the trade by draining some of the deeper mines, and instructing
                    the men in an improved method of dressing the ore. From that period the present
                    trade in Cornish copper may be said to date its rise, the annual produce, with
                    occasional exceptions, having until recent times progressively increased. In
                    1851 the mines of Devon and Cornwall together were estimated to furnish
                    one-third of the copper raised throughout other parts of Europe and the British
                    Isles (De la Beche). It has been calculated that the clear profits from fourteen
                    of the most productive mines in Cornwall (both tin and copper), daring the
                    present century, have reached to £2,756,640, the value of the entire produce
                    having been £13,158,203. From this gross sum the expenses of labour, materials,
                    working costs, and “dues” or royalties have to be deducted. The number of years
                    during which these fourteen mines have been worked varies from 5 to 66.</p>
                <p>The underground wealth of Cornwall is, however, not only diminishing in quantity
                    and quality, but the process of raising it is becoming too expensive to be
                    continued. No copper lodes of great importance have been discovered of late
                    years, while the surface or stream tin is nearly exhausted. Almost all the
                    Cornish tin is now raised from deep mines at heavy expense, and has to compete
                    with the vast supplies which arrive from foreign countries. The Cornish miners
                    are an intelligent and independent body of men. They are in request in whatever
                    part of the world mining operations are conducted; and it may fairly be asserted
                    that the solution of every intricate problem in mining geology is generally
                    assigned to a Cornish agent, and every task requiring skill, resource, and
                    courage intrusted to a Cornish miner. About 28,000 persons used to be employed
                    in the mines, but emigration to more remunerative fields abroad has recently
                    reduced that number most materially. For many centuries a tax on the tin, after
                    smelting, was paid to the earls and dukes of Cornwall. The smelted blocks were
                    carried to certain towns to be coined,—that is, stamped with the duchy seal
                    before they could be sold. By an Act of 1838 the dues payable on the coinage of
                    tin were abolished, and a compensation was awarded to the duchy instead of
                    them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stannary Courts.—</hi> By ancient charters, the tinners of
                    Cornwall were exempt from all other jurisdiction than that of the stannary
                    courts, except in cases affecting land, life, and limb. The earliest charter is
                    that of Edmund ear] of Cornwall, but the freedom then assured was rather
                    confirmed than given for the first time; and it is probable that the customs of
                    the stannary courts are of high antiquity. Twenty-four stannators were returned
                    for the whole of Cornwall. Tlιeir meeting was termed a parliament, and when they
                    assembled they chose a speaker. . In earlier times, the combined tinners of
                    Devon and Cornwall assembled on Hingston Down, a tract of highland on the
                    Cornish side of the Tamar. After the charter of Earl Edmund, the Cornish
                    stannators met (apparently) at Truro; those of Devonshire at Crockern Tor on
                    Dartmoor. An officer was appointed by the duke of Cornwall or the Crown, who was
                    Lord Warden of the Stannaries, and the parliaments were assembled by him from
                    time to time, in order to revise old or to enact new laws. The last Cornish
                    stannary parliament was held at Truro in 1752. For a long series of years little
                    or no business was transacted in the stannary courts; but the necessity for a
                    court of peculiar jurisdiction, embracing mines and mining transactions of every
                    description within the county of Cornwall having become more and more apparent,
                    a committee was appointed to report on the subject, and an Act of Parliament was
                    afterwards (1836) passed, suppressing the law courts of the stewards of the
                    different stannaries, and giving to the vice-warden their jurisdiction, besides
                    confirming and enlarging the ancient equity jurisdiction of that office. Several
                    statutes have since been passed defining and amending the stannary laws. From
                    the judgments of the vice-warden an appeal lies to the Lord Warden, and from him
                    to the Supreme Court of Judicature. The court, thus renewed, has greatly
                    benefited the mining interests of Cornwall.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fisheries.—</hi> The fisheries of Cornwall and Devon are the
                    most important on the south-west coasts. The pilchard is in great measure
                    confined to Cornwall, living habitually in deep water not far west of the Scilly
                    Isles, and visiting the coast in great shoals,—one of which is described as
                    having extended from Mevagissey to the Land’s End, a distance, including the
                    windings of the coast, of nearly 100 miles. In summer and autumn pilchards are
                    caught by drift nets; later in the year they are taken off the northern coast by
                    seine nets. Forty thousand hogsheads, or 120 million fish, have been taken in
                    the course of a single season, requiring 20,000 tons of salt to cure .them. The
                    northern shoals are by far the largest. Twelve millions have been taken in a
                    single day; and the sight of this great army of fish passing the Land’s End, and
                    pursued by hordes of dog-fish, hake, and cod, besides vast flocks of sea-birds,
                    is one of the most striking that can be imagined. The fishery gives employment
                    to about 10,000 persons, and a capital of nearly £300,000 is engaged in it. The
                    headquarters of the fishery are Mount’s Bay and St Ives, but boats are employed
                    all along the coast. When brought to shore the pilchards are carried to the
                    cellars to be cured. They are then packed in hogsheads, each containing about
                    2400 fish. These casks are largely exported to Naples and other Italian
                    ports—whence the fisherman’s toast, “Long life to the Pope, and death to
                    thousands.” Besides pilchards, mackerel are taken in great numbers on the
                    southern coast. Conger eels of great size, weighing from 60 to 120 ft&gt;, are
                    found near the shores, and among other fish taken should be mentioned mullet and
                    John Dory. Recently a brisk trade in “sardines” has been established—young
                    pilchards taking the place of the real Mediterranean fish.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Although there can be no doubt that Cornwall and
                    Devonshire are referred to under the general name of Cassiterides, or the “Tin
                    Islands,” it cannot be said that we have any authentic historical knowledge of
                    either county until after the Roman conquest of Britain. It remains uncertain
                    whether Phoenician or Carthaginian traders actually visited Cornw all, or
                    whether they obtained their supplies of tin through Gaul. But we know that the
                    tin of the district was largely exported from a very early period, and that the
                    mines were still w’orked under the Romans. Cornwall formed part of the British
                    kingdom of Damnonia, which long resisted the advance of the Saxons westward, and
                    remained almost unbroken in power until the reign of Ine of Wessex (688-726).
                    From that time the borders of the British Kingdom gradually narrowed, until,
                    about the year 926, Athelstane drove the Britons from Exeter, and fixed the
                    Tamar as the limit between them and the Saxons of Devon. At this period, and
                    perhaps for some time after, the Britons of West Wales (the name given by the
                    Saxons to the old D am non i an kingdom) retained their line of chiefs, though
                    under some kind of subjection to the kings of Wessex. The British bishop, Conan,
                    submitted to archbishop Wulfhehn of Canterbury after Áthelstane’s conquest, and
                    was reappointed by him in 936. The Cornish see was afterw ards merged in that of
                    Crediton, and in 1050 the place of the united sees w as transferred to Exeter,
                    where it remained till 1876. But Cornwall, although the mass of the people
                    remained Celtic, speedily received Saxon masters, and in the Domesday Survey the
                    recorded names <pb break="no"

                    Confessor are all Saxon. The conqueror bestowed nearly the whole county on his
                    half brother, Robert of Mortain, and thus arose what Mr Freeman styles “that
                    great earldom and duchy of Cornwall which was deemed too powerful to be trusted
                    in the hands of any but men closely akin to the royal house, and the remains of
                    which have for ages formed the apanage of the heir-apparent to the crown.” Of
                    the earls, the most important were the brother of Henry III., Richard, king of
                    the Romans, and his son Edmund. In 1336 the earldom was raised to a duchy by
                    Edward III. in favour of his son, the Black-Prince, and of his heirs, eldest
                    sons of the kings of England. Since that time the Prince of Wales has always
                    been duke of Cornwall. When there is no Prince of Wales the revenues of the
                    duchy are appropriated by the Crown. When the duchy was first created by Edward
                    III., the lands belonging to and dependent on it included, not only the great
                    open moors of Cornwall, and Dartmoor f &gt;rest in Devonshire, but 9 parks, 53
                    manors, 10 castles, 13 boroughs and towns, and 9 hundreds. Considerable changes
                    and reductions have, however, been since made, and the income of the duchy is at
                    present derived from lands in Somerset and Devon as well as in Cornwall itself.
                    The history of the duchy is virtually that of Cornwall. There has been little to
                    connect it with the general history of the country except during the Civil War,
                    when Cornwall was for the most part royalist, and some sharp fighting took place
                    within its bounds. Besides much skirmishing, there were two important battles,
                    that of Braddock Down (Jan. 19, 1642-3), and that of Stratton, (May 15, 1643),
                    both gained for the king.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities.—</hi> No part of England is so rich as Cornwall in
                    antiquities of the primaeval period. These chiefly abound in the district
                    between Penzance and the Land’s End, but they occur in all the wilder parts of
                    the county. They may be classed as follows. (1.) <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cromlechs.</hi> These in the west of Cornwall are called “quoits,” with a
                    reference to their broad and flat covering stones. The largest and most
                    important are those known as Lanyon, Caerwynen, Mulfra, Chùn, and Zennor quoits,
                    all in the Land’s End district. Of these Chûn is the only one which has not been
                    thrown down. Zennor is said to be the largest in the British Isles, while
                    Lanyon, when perfect, was of sufficient height for a man on horseback to ride
                    under. Of those in the eastern part of Cornwall, Trethevy near Liskeard and
                    Pawton in the parish of St Breock are the finest, and have remained intact. (2.)
                    Rude uninscribed <hi rend="italic">monoliths</hi> are common to all parts of
                    Cornwall. Those at Boleit, in the parish of Buryan, are the most important. (3.)
                        <hi rend="italic">Circles,</hi> none of which are of great dimensions. The
                    principal are the Hurlers, near Liskeard; the Boskednan, Boscawen-ûn, and
                    Tregeseal circles; and that called the Dawns-ûn, or Merry Maidens. All of these,
                    except the Hurlers, are in the Land’s End district. The other circles that may
                    be mentioned are the “Trippet Stones,” in the parish of Blisland, and one at
                    Duloe. (4.) Long <hi rend="italic">alignments</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >avenues</hi> of stones, resembling those on Dartmoor, but not so perfect,
                    are to be found on the moors near Rough tor and Brown Willy. A very remarkable
                    monument of this kind exists in the neighbourhood of St Columb, called the “Nine
                    Maidens.” It consists of nine rude pillars placed in a line, while near them is
                    a single stone known as the “Old Man.” (5.) <hi rend="italic">Hut
                        dwellings.</hi> Of these there are at least two kinds, those in the eastern
                    part of the county resembling the beehive structures and enclosures of Dartmoor,
                    and those in the west, comprising “hut-clusters,” having a central court, and a
                    surrounding wall often of considerable height and thickness. The beehive masonry
                    is also found in connection with these latter, as are also (6.) <hi
                        rend="italic">Caves,</hi> or subterraneous structures, resembling those of
                    Scotland and Ireland. (7.) <hi rend="italic">Cliff castles</hi> are a
                    characteristic feature of the Cornish coast, the chief being the “Little Dinas”
                    near Falmouth, Trevelgue near St Columb, and Ι reryn, Mên, Kenedjack, Bosigran,
                    and others in the west. These are all fortified against the land side. (8.) <hi
                        rend="italic">Hill castles,</hi> or camps, are very numerous.
                    Castel-an-Dinas, near St Columb, is the best example of the earthwork camp, and
                    Chíln Castle near Penzance, of the stone.</p>
                <p>Of early and mediaeval antiquities the most noticeable are crosses, scattered all
                    over the county, and of various dates, from the 6th to the 16th century, many
                    resembling the early crosses of Wales; inscribed sepulchral stones of the 7th
                    and 8th centuries, of which the “mên scryffa” in Madron is a good example; and
                    oratories of the early Irish type. St Pirans is the most important of these.</p>
                <p>The Cornish churches, for the most part, belong to the Perpendicular style of
                    architecture, and are generally low in the body, but with high and plain granite
                    towers. The rich tower of Probus, however, is an exception, as well as the
                    church of St Mary Magdalene at Launceston, the exterior of which is’covered with
                    sculpture. Within, the chief feature is the absence of a chancel arch. The
                    castles of Launceston, Trematon, and Restormel seem to be of the time of Henry
                    III., but the mounds which occur in the first two are no doubt much
                    earlier,—possibly marking British strongholds. Tintagel has bat a few shapeless
                    walls. Of later castles there is Pendennis (built temp. Henry VIII.); St
                    Michael’s Mount, although castellated at an early period, has nothing more
                    ancient than the 15 th century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Language.—</hi> The old Cornish language survives in a few
                    words still in use in the fishing and mining communities, as well as in the
                    names of persons and places, but the last persons who spoke it died toward the
                    end of the 18th century, It belonged to the Cymric division of Celtic, in which
                    Welsh and Armorican are also included. The most important relics of the language
                    known to exist are three dramas or miracle plays, edited and translated by Edwin
                    Norris, Oxford, 1859. A sketch of Cornish grammar is added, and a Cornish
                    vocabulary from a MS. of the 13th century (Cotton MSS. Vespasian A. 14, p. 7α).

                    Queen Mary’s time, but much altered; the grounds and gardens are, however, more
                    important than the house; Cotele, on the Tamar (dowager countess of Mount
                    Edgecumbe),—a most striking place, the house Tudor, temp. Henry VIII. and
