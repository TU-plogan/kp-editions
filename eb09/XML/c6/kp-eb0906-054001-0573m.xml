                    German, <hi rend="italic">Krakau),</hi> a city of the crownland of Galicia,
                    Austria, the capital anciently of Poland, and more recently of a small Polish
                    republic which bordered on the Prussian, Austrian, and Russian dominions where
                    they meet. The city stands in a fertile plain on the left bank of the Vistula,
                    where the stream of the Rudowa joins it, nearly 200 miles north-east of Vienna
                    in latitude (of observatory) 50° 3' 50" N., longitude 19’ 57' 30" E., and at an
                    elevation of 650 feet above the sea. The main railway line of Galicia, called
                    the Carl Ludwig’s Bahn, uniting the system of Germany along the outskirts of the
                    Carpathian range with the lines about the Lower Danube, crosses the Vistula at
                    Cracow. A line of detached forts has been built round the city, and a castle on
                    a height commands the town. Promenades occupying tho place of the old walls,
                    planted with trees, divide the old town from the seven extensive suburbs of
                    Stradom, Ribaki, Kleparz, Piasek, Wesola, Smolensk, and Wielopole; and an arm of
                    the Vistula cuts off the Jewish quarter of Kasimierz. In the old town the
                    extensive castle of the Polish kings on the <pb break="no"

                    been for the most part rebuilt to serve as barracks and for a hospital. The
                    Stanislas Cathedral (Lady Church), built in 1359, contains many interesting
                    antiquities relating to the kingdom of Poland; the monarchs were crowned in this
                    edifice, which also holds the mausoleum of the Sigismunds, the silver coffin of
                    the holy Stanislas, and the remains of John Sobieski, of Poniatowski, and of
                    Kosciusko; it is adorned by sculptures by Thorwaldsen, and a wooden carved altar
                    (1472-1484) by Veit Stoss, who was a native of</p>
                <p>Cracow. There are forty churches in the city, with twenty-three convents of monks
                    and nuns. In the Ringplatz stand the old Gothic cloth booths and the ancient
                    Rathhaus with a fine tower. A relic of the old wall remains in the Floriane gate
                    on the esplanade. The university of Cracow, founded by Casimir the Great, and
                    carried out by Jagellon in 1401, has sixty-nine professors and about 450
                    students, and possesses a library of 140,000 volumes and numerous MSS. Attached
                    to it are an observatory, botanic gardens, natural, historical, and medical
                    museums, a laboratory, and medical schools. Cloth, leather, and agricultural
                    implements are manufactured to some extent in Cracow, and a busy traffic in
                    grain, wood, salt, wine, linen, and pigs is carried on by the Vistula. In the
                    neighbourhood thero are coal and zinc mines. Besides a bridge over the old
                    Vistula, the Franz Joseph Bridge on five stone piers and the railway bridge
                    cross the river to the villages of Podgorze and Stawisko on the opposite bank.
                    Three miles northwest of Cracow a huge mound 125 feet in height was raised in
                    1824 to the memory of Kosciusko, and this has now been utilized as the site of a
                    fort. The village of Krzezowice in this direction is a favourite resort of
                    Cracow people, and has a fine castle, a Gothic church, sulphur baths, and iron
                    and zinc mines. Eight miles south-east of Cracow, united to it by a branch
                    railway, are the village and famous salt-mines of Wieliczka; about 1000 miners
                    are constantly employed here, and the annual yield of salt amounts to more than
                    a million cwts. Population (1869), 49,835, including about 10,000 Jews.</p>
                <p>Cracow takes its name from the Polish Prince Krak or Krakus, and dates from about
                    the year 700. Perhaps no city has suffered greater vicissitudes. It was taken in
                    1039 by the Bohemians, in 1241 by the Mongols, by the Swedes in 1655 and in
                    1702, and by the Russians in 1768. It remained the capital of Poland from 1320
                    till 1609, when the seat of government was transferred to Warsaw, but the kings
                    of Poland were crowned in it till 1764. On the third partition of Poland in 1795
                    Austria took possession of this portion; but in his campaign of 1809 Napoleon
                    wrested it from that power, and incorporated it with the duchy of Warsaw, which
                    was placed under the rule of Saxony. In the campaign of 1812 the Emperor
                    Alexander made himself master of this and the other territory which formed the
                    duchy of Warsaw. At the general settlement of the affairs of Europe by the great
                    powers in 1815, it was agreed that Cracow and the adjoining territory should be
                    formed into a free state; and, by the General Treaty of Congress signed at
                    Vienna in 1815, “the town of Cracow, with its territory, is declared to be for
                    ever a free, independent, and strictly neutral city, under the protection of
                    Russia, Austria, and Prussia.’’ In February 1846, however, an insurrection broke
                    out in Cracow, apparently a ramification of a widely-spread conspiracy
                    throughout Poland. The senate and the other authorities of Cracow were unable to
                    subdue the rebels or to maintain order, and, at their request, the city was
                    occupied by a corps of Austrian troops for the protection of the inhabitants.
                    The three powers, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, made this a pretext for
                    extinguishing this independent state; and having established a conference at
                    Vienna (November 1846) the three courts after due deliberation, contrary to the
                    assurance previously given, and in opposition to the expressed views of the
                    British and French Governments, came to the conclusion to extinguish the state
                    of Cracow and to incorporate it with the dominions of Austria.</p>
