                    development of the national character, requiring, as it does, such a combination
                    of intellectual and physical qualities—broad and open shoulders, stout arms and
                    quick legs, with patience, calculation, and promptness of execution.</p>
                <p>- In the infancy of the game, stumps did not exist. A circular hole in the turf
                    supplied their place, and it is surmised that the batsman was put out either by
                    being caught, or, when running, by the outside returning the ball into the
                    cavity ere the striker placed the base of his bat therein. This led to unseemly
                    tussles between the batsman and fielders, often to the detriment of the latter’s
                    hands. It is surmised from the old records of the Hambledon Club that the first
                    description of wicket comprised one stump only, 18 inches high, which was
                    displaced with the ball, in lieu of “holing” the same, in order to put the
                    runner out, but absolute proof on this point is wanting. The date of a second
                    stump being added is buried in obscurity. It is only known that they were placed
                    2 feet apart, with a connecting cross-bar on the top, the height being 1 foot;
                    and a large hole for putting the ball into was excavated between the stumps. The
                    dimensions of 22 inches by 6 inches were adopted in 1702, and thus, as far as is
                    known, matters remained till, in 1775, at a Hambledon Club match, the ball was
                    observed to pass thrice between the two stumps without dislodging the cross-bar.
                    To obviate this a third stump was added in the middle, and the modern bails were
                    substituted for the cross-bar. The next alteration was to 24 inches by 7 inches
                    in 1798, and in 1817 another inch was added to the height; at which dimensions,
                    viz., 27 inches by 8 inches, the wicket remains in 1877. It is possible that
                    there were other intermediate alterations from time to time; but as each year’s
                    laws have not been preserved, this is uncertain. From the earliest days,
                    however, the wickets have always been placed one chain or 22 yards apart.</p>
                <p>Cricket bats were at first made with a sweeping curve at the base, which made
                    them available for hitting only. They were broader and far more cumbersome than
                    the lithe spring-handled implements of the present day,—the shape now in use
                    appearing to have become prevalent about 1825, when round arm bowling came
                    permanently into vogue. A sketch of the various shapes in use from early times
                    downwards will be found in the frontispiece of Mr Frederick Gale’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Echoes from the old Cricket Fields.</hi> No evidence exists as to
                    the size and weight of the first balls used. At the end of the 18th century they
                    were much of the same dimensions as now, but both materials and workmanship have
                    vastly improved even since the first “treble sewn” was manufactured.</p>
                <p>Cricket is divided into single and double wicket, and it is a moot point which of
                    the two was the parent game. Judging, however, from the earliest evidence
                    extant, it seems probable that single wicket was the first instituted, as it is
                    less complicated and requires fewer players. In their pavilion at the Kennington
                    Oval the Surrey County Cricket Club possesses the earliest known picture of the
                    game in anything like its present form. The date is 1743, and the stumps are
                    aptly described by Mr Frederick Gale as “a skeleton hurdle of about 2 feet wide
                    and 1 foot high.” The bat is of the old-fashioned curved shape, and the score
                    was kept by notching each individual run on a stick. With the exception that all
                    play was evidently forward of the wicket (the same is the case now in single
                    wicket matches with less than five a side), the leading features of the game are
                    identical with those of the present day. Single wicket, however, was never much
                    practised after a knowledge of the game became thoroughly diffused, except by
                    great players for a large stake or a championship. It is with the double wicket
                    game that we <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n612/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0612-0579"/> are more immediately concerned, that being the
                    now universally accepted form.</p>
                <p>The most radical change that has ever taken place in the development of the game
                    is the introduction of round or straight arm bowling in lieu of the underhand.
                    That the n¾w style was first discovered (about 1785) by Tom Walker, a
                    professional of the old Hambledon Club, is now generally admitted; but the
                    dogged conservatism of the day pronounced it to be unfair, and successfully
                    repressed the innovation. About 1805 the style was revived by Mr John Willes, a
                    great Kentish amateur. It was not, however, until 1825, when Mr G. T. Knight of
                    Alton strenuously took up the cudgels on behalf of the so-called “throwing
                    bowling,” that it became a permanent institution, and then only after many
                    bickerings and much controversy. The new style created a great revolution in
                    cricket, as it afforded the bowlers much greater command over their delivery
                    both in strength and in direction. From time to time various other new points
                    have arisen requiring special legislation, and changes have taken place in the
                    mode of conducting the game.</p>
                <p>Much labour and careful attention are required in laying out a good cricket
                    ground and maintaining the same in proper order. As a general rule the shorter
                    and more level the turf can be got the better. Double wicket requires two sides
                    of eleven players each, the choice of first innings being decided by lot. Two
                    strikers go in, one at each wicket, and the object of the fielders is to
                    dislodge them according to the rules of the game. The other strikers go in by
                    rotation as arranged by their captain. When a ball is hit the striker may, if
                    possible, score a run by reaching the opposite popping crease ere the wicket is
                    put down, each time he successfully traverses the distance between the two
                    popping creases counting as one run. When sufficient time is available each side
                    has two innings, and that scoring the largest number of runs is the winner.
                    Otherwise both sides may agree to decide the issue on the result of one innings
                    apiece, and it is sometimes arranged to allow six balls in each over, instead of
                    four. At the end of each over, the whole of the outside change their positions;
                    another bowler delivers an over from the opposite wicket, and so on alternately.
                    A general idea of the position of the players may be formed from the
                    accompanying diagram, but variations take place according to the description of
                    bowling in use.</p>
                <p>A captain is chosen on each side, who has the entire management of his eleven. In
                    conjunction with the opposing captain he makes the necessary arrangements for
                    the match. He should be a thorough judge of all points of the game, and able to
                    place the field to the best advantage according to the description of the
                    bowling and peculiarities of the striker. Constant practice is necessary to
                    become a good bowler, and obtain such a thorough command of the ball as to vary
                    the pace and pitch as well as to impart twist. The two chief varieties of balls
                    are “lengths” and “not lengths,” according as their pitch deceives the striker’s
                    eye as much as possible or not. A batsman’s first rule is to play with a
                    straight bat, as he thereby gains most protection for his stumps; and he should
                    make the most of his stature. Batting is divided into “forward” and “back play,”
                    according as the batsman stretches forward to meet the ball, or keeps the body
                    perpendicular or slightly inclined backwards, The fielders should ever be on the
                    alert, their business being to stop or catch the ball, and return it to one of
                    the wickets with all possible haste. For further details of each player’s duties
                    and full instructions how to play the game correctly, we must refer our readers
                    to the Rev. James Pycroft’s excellent work, <hi rend="italic">The Cricket
                    Field.</hi> Single wicket is sufficiently explained by the laws, She only
                    material difference being that the batsman has to reach the bowling stump and
                    return to the popping crease— a distance of 44 yards in place of 22 yards—for
                    every run he scores. The laws of the game as now constituted by the Marylebone
                    Cricket Club are as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. The ball must weigh not less than 5⅜ nor more than 5j ounces. It must measure
                    not less than 9 nor more than 9∣ inches in circumference. At the beginning of
                    each innings, either party may call for a new ball.</p>
                <p>2. The bat must not exceed 4∣ inches in the widest part; it must not be more than
                    38 inches in length.</p>
                <p>3. The stumps must be 3 in number, 27 inches out of the ground; the bails 8
                    inches in length; the stumps of equal and of sufficient thickness to prevent the
                    ball from passing through.</p>
                <p>4. The bowling crease must be in a line with the stumps, and 6 feet 8 inches in
                    length, the stumps in the centre,—with a return crease at each end towards the
                    bowler at right angles.</p>
                <p>5. The popping crease must be 4 feet from the wicket, and parallel to it,
                    unlimited in length, but not shorter than the bowling crease.</p>
                <p>6. The wickets must be pitched opposite to each other by the umpires, at the
                    distance of 22 yards.</p>
                <p>7. It shall not be lawful for either party during the match, without the consent
                    of the other, to alter the ground by rolling, watering, covering, mowing, or
                    beating, except at the commencement of each innings, when the ground shall be
                    swept and rolled unless the next side going in object to it. This rule is not
                    meant to prevent the striker from beating the ground with his bat near to the
                    spot where he stands during the innings, nor to prevent the bowler from filling
                    up holes with saw-dust, &amp;c., when the ground shall be wet.</p>
                <p>8. After rain the wickets may be changed with the consent of both parties.</p>
                <p>9. The bowler shall deliver the ball with one foot on the ground behind the
                    bowling-crease, and within the return crease, and shall bowl one over before he
                    change wickets, which he shall be permitted to do twice in the same innings, and
                    no bowler shall bowl more than two overs in succession.</p>
                <p>10. The ball must be bowled. If thrown or jerked the umpire shall call “no
                    ball.”</p>
                <p>11. The bowler may require the striker at the wicket from which he is bowling to
                    stand on that side of it which he may direct.</p>
                <p>12. If the bowler shall toss the ball over the striker’s head, or bowl it so wide
                    that, in the opinion of the umpire, it shall not be fairly within the reach of
                    the batsman, he shall adjudge one run to the party receiving the innings, either
                    with or without an appeal, which shall be put down to the score of wide balls;
                    such ball shall not be reckoned as one of the four balls: but if the batsman
                    shall <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n613/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0613-0580"/> by any means bring himself within reach of the
                    ball, the run shall not be adjudged.</p>
                <p>13. If the bowler shall deliver a “no ball,” or a “wide ball,” the striker shall
                    be allowed as many runs as he can get, and he shall not be put out except by
                    running out. In the event of no run being obtained by any other means, then one
                    run shall be added to score of “no balls” or “wide balls” as the case may be.
                    All runs obtained for “wide balls” to be scored to “wide balls.” The names of
                    the bowlers who bowl “wide balls,” or “no balls,” in future to be placed on the
                    score, to show the parties by whom either score is made. If the ball shall first
                    touch any part of the striker’s drees or person (except his hands), the umpire
                    shall call “leg bye.”</p>
                <p>14. At the beginning of each innings the umpire shall call “play;” from that time
                    to the eud of each innings no trial ball shall be allowed to any bowler.</p>
                <p>15. The striker is out if either of the bails be bowled off, or if a stump be
                    bowled out of the ground;</p>
                <p>16. Or if the ball from the stroke of the bat or hand, but not the wrist, be held
                    before it touch the ground, although it be hugged to the body of the
                    catcher;</p>
                <p>17. Or if in striking, or at any other time while the ball shall be in play, both
                    his feet shall be over the popping crease, and his wicket put down, except his
                    bat be grounded within it;</p>
                <p>18. Or if in striking at the ball he hit down his wicket;</p>
                <p>19. Or if, under pretence of running or otherwise, either of the strikers prevent
                    a ball from being caught, the striker of the ball is out;</p>
                <p>20. Or if the ball be struck and he wilfully strike it again;</p>
                <p>21. Or if in running the wicket be struck down by a throw, or by the hand or arm
                    (with the ball in hand), before his bat (in hand) or some part of his person be
                    grounded over the popping crease; but if both bails be off, a stump must be
                    struck out of the ground;</p>
                <p>22. Or if any part of the striker’s dress knock down the wicket;</p>
                <p>23. Or if the striker touch or take up the ball while in play, unless at the
                    request of the opposite party;</p>
                <p>24. Or if with any part of his person he stop the ball, which in the opinion of
                    the umpire at the bowler’s wicket, shall have been pitched in a straight line
                    from it to the striker’s wicket and would have hit it.</p>
                <p>25. If the players have crossed each other, he that runs for the wicket which is
                    put down is out.</p>
                <p>26. A ball being caught, no run shall be reckoned.</p>
                <p>27. The striker being run out, the run which he and his partner were attempting
                    shall not be reckoned.</p>
                <p>28. If a lost ball be called, the striker shall be allowed six runs, but if more
                    than six shall have been run before lost ball shall have been called, then the
                    striker shall have all that have been run.</p>
                <p>29. After the ball shall have been finally settled in the wicket-keeper’s or
                    bowler’s hand, it shall be considered dead; but when the bowler is about to
                    deliver a ball, if the striker at his wicket go outside the popping crease
                    before such actual delivery, the said bowler may put him out, unless (with
                    reference to the 21st law) his bat in hand, or some part of his person, be
                    within the popping crease.</p>
                <p>30. The striker shall not retire from his wicket and return to it to complete his
                    innings after another has been in, without the consent of the opposite
                    party.</p>
                <p>31. No substitute shall in any case be allowed to stand out or run between the
                    wickets for another person without the consent of the opposite party; and in
                    case any person shall be allowed to run for another, the striker shall be out if
                    either he or his substitute be off the ground in manner mentioned in laws 17 and
                    21, while the ball is in play.</p>
                <p>32. In all cases where a substitute shall be allowed, the consent of the opposite
                    party shall also be obtained as to the person to act as substitute, and the
                    place in the field which he shall take.</p>
                <p>33. If any fieldsman stop the ball with his hat, the ball shall be considered
                    dead, and the opposite party shall add five to their score. If any be run they
                    shall have five in all.</p>
                <p>34. The ball having been hit, the striker may guard his wicket •with his bat, or
                    with any part of his body except his hands, that the 23rd law may not be
                    disobeyed.</p>
                <p>35. The wicket-keeper shall not take the ball for stumping until it have passed
                    the wicket; he shall not move until the ball be out of the bowler’s hand; he
                    shall not by any noise incommode the striker; and if any part of his person be
                    over or before the wicket, although the ball hit it, the striker shall not be
                    out.</p>
                <p>36. The umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play; and all disputes
                    shall be determined by them, each at his own wicket; but in case of a catch
                    which the umpire at the wicket bowled from cannot see sufficiently to decide
                    upon, he may apply to the other umpire, whose opinion shall be conclusive.</p>
                <p>37. The umpires in all matches shall pitch fair wickets; and the parties shall
                    toss up for choice of innings. The umpires shall change wickets after each party
                    has had one innings.</p>
                <p>38. They shall allow two minutes for each striker to come in and ten minutes
                    between each innings. When the umpire shall call “play” the party refusing to
                    play shall lose the match.</p>
                <p>39. They are not to order a striker out unless applied to by the adversaries.</p>
                <p>40. But if one of the bowler’s feet be not on the ground behind the bowling
                    crease and within the return crease when he shall deliver the ball, the umpire
                    at his wicket, unasked, must call “no ball.”</p>
                <p>41. If either of the strikers run a short run the umpire shall call “one
                    short.”</p>
                <p>42. No umpire shall be allowed to bet</p>
                <p>43. No umpire is to be changed during the match, unless with the consent of both
                    parties, except in case of violation of 42d law; then either party may dismiss
                    the transgressor.</p>
                <p>44. After the delivery of four balls the umpire must call “over,” but not until
                    the ball shall be finally settled in the wicket-keeper’s or bowler’s hand; the
                    ball shall then be considered dead; nevertheless, if any idea be entertained
                    that either of the strikers is out, a question may be put previously to, but not
                    after, the delivery of the next ball.</p>
                <p>45. The umpire must take especial care to call <hi rend="italic">“no</hi> ball”
                    instantly upon delivery, “wide ball” as soon as it shall pass the striker.</p>
                <p>46. The players who go in second shall follow their innings if they have obtained
                    eighty runs less than their antagonists, except in all matches limited to one
                    day’s play, when the number shall be limited to sixty instead of eighty.</p>
                <p>47. When one of the strikers shall have been put out, the use of the bat shall
                    not be allowed to any person until the next striker shall come in.</p>
                <p>Note.—The committee of the Marylι∙bone Club think it desirable that previously to
                    the commencement of a match, one of each side should be declared the manager of
                    it; and that the new laws with respect to substitutes may be carried out in a
                    spirit of fairness and mutual concession, it is their wish that such substitutes
                    be allowed in all reasonable cases, and that the umpire should inquire if it is
                    done with consent of the manager of the opposite side.</p>
                <p>Complaints having been made that it is the practice of some players when at the
                    wicket to make holes in the ground.for a footing, the committee are of opinion
                    that umpires should be empowered to prevent it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Single Wicket.</hi></p>
                <p>1. When there shall be less than five players on a side, bounds shall be placed
                    twenty-two yards each in a line from the off and leg stump.</p>
                <p>2. The ball must be hit before the bounds to entitle the striker to a run, which
                    run cannot be obtained unless he touch the bowling stump or crease in a line
                    with it with his bat, or some part of his person, or go beyond them, returning
                    to the popping crease as a double wicket, according to the 21st law.</p>
                <p>3. When the striker shall hit the ball one of his feet must be on the ground and
                    behind the popping crease, otherwise the umpire shall call “no hit.”</p>
                <p>4. When there shall be less than five players on a side neither byes nor
                    overthrows shall be allowed, nor shall the striker bo caught out behind the
                    wicket, nor stumped out.</p>
                <p>5. The fieldsman must return the ball so that it shall cross tho play between the
                    wicket and the bowling stump, or between the bowling stump and the bounds; the
                    striker may run till the ball be so returned.</p>
                <p>6. After the striker shall have made one run, if he start again he must touch the
                    bowling stump, and turn before the ball cross the play to entitle him to
                    another.</p>
                <p>7. The striker shall be entitled to three runs for lost ball, and the same number
                    for ball stopped with hat, with reference to the 28th and 33d laws of double
                    wicket.</p>
                <p>8. When there shall be more than four players on a side there shall be no bounds.
                    All hits, byes, and overthrows shall then be allowed.</p>
                <p>9. The bowler is subject to the same laws as at double wicket.</p>
                <p>10. No more than one minute shall be allowed between each ball.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bets.</hi></p>
                <p>1. No bet upon any match is payable unless played out or given up.</p>
                <p>2. If the runs of one player be betted against those of another, the bet depends
                    on the first innings unless otherwise specified.</p>
                <p>3. If the bet be made on both innings, and one party beat the other in one
                    innings, the runs of the first innings shall determine it.</p>
                <p>4. If the other party go in a second time, then the bet must be determined by the
                    number on the score.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">County Cricket.</hi></p>
                <p>The following laws of county qualification were established at a meeting held in
                    the Surrey County Pavilion, Kennington Oval, on June 9, 1873 :—</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n614/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0614-0581"/>
                <p>1. That no cricketer, whether amateur or professional, shall play for more than
                    one county during the same season.</p>
                <p>2. Every cricketer born in one county and residing in another shall be free to
                    choose at the commencement of each season for which of those counties he will
                    play, and shall, during that season, play for that county only.</p>
                <p>3. A cricketer shall be qualified to play for any county in which he is residing
                    and has resided for the previous two years; or a cricketer may elect to play for
                    the county in which his family home is, so long as it remains open to him as an
                    occasional residence.</p>
                <p>4. That, should any question arise as to the residental qualification, the same
                    should be left to the decision of the committee of the Marylebone Club.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi> —The name cricket is cognate to the Saxon <hi
                    rend="italic">cric</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cryc,</hi> a crooked stick. This
                    germ of the modern bat is seen in the earliest representation of the pastime
                    about the middle of the 13th century. In a MS. in the King’s Library, 14 Bv,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Chronique</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Angleterre, depuis</hi><hi

                    III.,</hi> there is found a grotesque delineation of two male figures playing a
                    game with a bat and ball. This is undoubtedly the first known drawing of what
                    was destined to develop into the scientific cricket of modern times. The left
                    hand figure is that of the batsman, who holds his weapon perpendicularly in the
                    right hand with the handle downwards. The right hand figure shows the c ιtcher,
                    whose duty is at once apparent by the extension of his hands. In another portion
                    of the same MS., however, there is a male figure pointing a bat, with the base
                    curved like a leopard's head, towards a female figure in the attitude of
                    catching, but the ball is absent. On p. 126 of King Edward I.’s wardrobe account
                    for the year 1300, there occurs the following entry, viz., “Domino Johanni de
                    Leek capellano Domini Edwardi fil’ Regis, pro den’ per ipsum liberat’ eiαem
                    Domino suo ad ludendum ad <hi rend="italic">creag',</hi> et alios ludos per
                    vices, per manus proprias apud Westm ’, 10 die Marcii, 100s. Et per manus
                    Hugonis camerarii sui apud Ne wen ton mense Marcii, 20s—summa, £6." Here is
                    found the earliest allusion to the game as designated by a term analogous to the
                    modern word “cricket,” as well as indisputable proof that even in these early
                    times the game was followed by the first personages in the realm, who of course
                    spoke French. In a Bodleian Library MS., No 264, dated 18th April 1344, and
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Romance of the Good King Alexander,</hi> fielders for
                    the first time appear in addition to the batsman and bowler. All the players are
                    monks with their cowls up and down alternately, the former having been
                    erroneously taken for female figures by Strutt in his <hi rend="italic">Sports
                    and Pastimes.</hi> On the extreme left of the picture, the bowler, with his cowl
                    up, poises the ball in the right hand with the arm nearly horizontal. The
                    batsman comes next with his cowl down, a little way only to the right, standing
                    sideways to the bowler with a long roughly-hewn and slightly-curved bat, held
                    vertically, handle downwards in the left hand. On the extreme right come four
                    figures—with cowls alternately down and up, and all having their hands raised in
                    an attitude to catch the ball should it be missed by the batsman, or be tipped
                    in their direction. Judging, however, from the positions of bowler and batter,
                    the out players are not placed so as to field a direct but a side hit. But the
                    want of perspective in the composition renders any estimate of their object
                    uncertain. It is evident, however, that the bat was always held in the left hand
                    at this date, since on the opposite page of the same MS. a solitary monk is
                    figured with his cowl down, and so holding a somewhat elongated oval-shaped
                    implement. The close roll of 39 Edw. III. (1365), Men. 23, disparages certain
                    games on account of their interfering with the practice of archery, where the
                    game of cricket is probably included among the pastimes denounced as “ludos
                    inhonestos, et minus utiles aut valentes.” In this instance, cricket was clearly
                    considered fit for the lower orders only. Judging from the drawings, it can only
                    be conjectured that the game consisted of bowling, batting, and fielding, though
                    it is known that there was an inside and an outside, for sometime during the
                    15th century the game was called “Hond-yn or Hondoute,” or “Hand in and Hand
                    out.” Under this title it was interdicted by 17 Edw. IV. c. 3 (1477-78), as one
                    of those illegal games which still continued to be so detrimental to the
                    Cractice of archery. By this statute, any one allowing the game to e played on
                    his premises was liable to three years’ imprisonment and £20 fine, any player to
                    two years’ imprisonment and £10 fine, and the implements to be burnt. The
                    inference that hand in and hand out was analogous to cricket is made from a
                    passage in the ∏on. Daines Barrington’s <hi rend="italic">Observations on the
                    more Ancient Statutes from Magna</hi><hi rend="italic">Charta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">to</hi> 21 <hi rend="italic">James I.</hi> cap. 27.” Writing in
                    1766, he comments thus on the above statute, viz: “This is, perhaps, the (<hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> i°≡ <hi rend="superscript"> t severe</hi> ^ <hi

                    in that game.”</p>
                <p>The word “cricket” first occurs about the year 1550. In Russell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Guildford</hi> (p. 203), it appears there was a piece
                    of waste land in the parish of Holy Trinity in that city, which was enclosed by
                    one John Parish, an innholder, some five years before Queen Elizabeth came to
                    the throne. In 35 Elizabeth (1593), evidence was taken before a jury and a
                    verdict returned, ordering the garden to be laid waste again and disinclosed.
                    Amongst other witnesses John Derrick, gent., and one of H. Μ.’s coroners for
                    Surrey, <hi rend="italic">aetat.</hi> fifty-nine, deposed he had known the
                    ground for fifty years or more, and “when he was a scholler in the free school
                    of Guildford, he and several of his fellowes did runne and play there at <hi
                    rend="italic">cτickctt</hi> and other plaies.” In the original edition of Stow’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Survey of London</hi> (1598), the word does not occur, though
                    he says, “The ball is used by noblemen and gentlemen in tennis courts, and by
                    people of the meaner sort in the open fields and streets.” It might justly be
                    surmised that such a national game as cricket would soon be introduced at public
                    schools. Accordingly, the first trace of it is found at Winchester College in
                    1650, since Lisle Bowles, writing of the good Bishop Ken, who was admitted to
                    Winchester, 13th January 1650-51, says, “On the fifth or sixth day our junior
                    .... is found for the first time attempting to wield a cricket bat.” In 1688 we
                    find a “ram and bat” charged in an Etonian’s school bill. Two other noteworthy
                    references to the game are found during the last quarter of the 17th century.
                    The first is in a somewhat ribald poem (1658), entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Mysteries of Love and Eloquence, or the Arts of Wooing and Complimenting,</hi>
                    by Edward Philips, John Milton’s nephew, who, in a dialogue between a country
                    bumpkin and his mistress going to a fair, makes the latter say, “Would my eyes
                    had been beat out of my bead with a cricket ball.” The second occurs in the
                    diary of the Rev. Henry Teonge, a naval chaplain to H. Μ. ship “Assistance,” and
                    states that during a visit to Antioch on 6th May 1676, several of the ship’s
                    company, accompanied by the consul, rode out of the city early, and amongst
                    other pastimes indulged in “krickett.” During the first half of the 18th century
                    the game became popular, and is repeatedly noticed by writers of the time, such
                    as Swift, D’Urfey, Pope, Soame Jenyns, and Strype in his edition of Stow’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Survey of London.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1748 it was decided that cricket was not an illegal game under the well-known
                    statute 9 Anne cap. 19, the Court of King’s Bench holding “that it was a very
                    manly game, not bad in itself, but only in the ill use made of it by betting
                    more than ten pounds on it; but that was bad and against the law.” In these
                    early times even, the pastime was followed by all classes, and Frederick, prince
                    of Wales, died in 1751 from internal injuries caused by a blow from a cricket
                    ball whilst playing at Cliefden House. Nevertheless, this commingling of
                    aristocrats and plebeians on the cricket sward was viewed with apprehension, and
                    repeatedly discountenanced by writers of the day. Games were played for large
                    stakes. Ground proprietors and tavern keepers farmed and advertised matches, the
                    results whereof were not always above suspicion. The old artillery ground at
                    Finsbury appears to have been the earliest scene of action of this class of
                    matches. But the true birthplace of the game in its developed state was no
                    cockney inclosure, but the broad open downs of the southern counties of England,
                    and more especially in the great hop-growing districts. The large hop fairs,
                    notably that of Weyhill, were the rendezvous for all comers from the southern
                    counties, and it is probable that the great county matches were arranged on
                    these occasions. The first record preserve! of a match is between Kent and All
                    England, which, judging from an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">General
                    Advertiser</hi> of the day, was played on August 4, 1746, at the Artillery

                <p>The old Hambledon Club was the first founded in England, and lasted from 1750 to
                    1791. Its playing fields were Broad Half Penny and Windmill Downs. When at its
                    zenith the club frequently contended with success against All England. Their
                    great players were more or less retained by noblemen and wealthy patrons of the
                    game, and this club remained invincible for some forty years. Though a cricket
                    club existed at Hambledon down to 1825, the original society was broken up in
                    1791, owing to the distance from the metropolis. A dispersion of its famous
                    players through neighbouring counties took place, and was naturally accompanied
                    with a diffusion of the precepts of the game, which gradually extended northward
                    and westward, till, at the end of the 18th century, cricket had become
                    established as the national game of England. The famous Marylebone Cricket Club
                    now justly ranks as the leading club of the world, frames the laws governing the
                    game, and arbitrates on all disputes connected therewith. This society sprang
                    out of the old Artillery Ground Club, which played at Finsbury till about 1750,
                    when they moved to White Conduit Fields, and became the White Conduit Cricket
                    Club. In 1787 they were remodelled under their present title, and moved to Old
                    Lords’ Ground, on the site of Dorset square, thence in 1824 to Middle Lords’
                    Ground at South Bank on the site of the Regent’s Canal, and finally in 1827 to
                    the present Lords’ Ground, which in 1864 became their freehold property. The
                    Surrey County Club, with the Kennington Oval as their headquarters, was formed
                    in 1845. In the same year the famous I Zingari Club, confined exclusively to
                    amateurs—first saw light, and commenced its Bohemian wanderings throughout Great
                    Britain, and often into foreign <pb break="no"

                    the captaincy of Clarke, ‘ ‘ The Nottingham Bowler,” commenced playing matches
                    against odds in various parts of the country. Since then several professional
                    elevens annually play what may be termed exhibition matches, in all parts of
                    Great Britain. Such contests are often detrimental to the professionals engaged
                    in them, but on the other hand they have done much to diffuse a zeal for
                    cricket, and at the present time there is not a county, large city, university,
                    or public school, town or village, in England, which does not possess its
                    cricket club, without mentioning the British colonies, and wherever Englishmen
                    assemble abroad in sufficient numbers.</p>
