                    ecclesiastical history of the British Islands has there been more discussion
                    than on that of the Culdees. Their very name has furnished matter for
                    dissertations, and their doctrines, mode of life, and peculiar institutions have
                    been the fruitful source of controversy. There is still room for doubt as to
                    details, but in all-important points the truth has been sufficiently ascertained
                    by the learned Scottish and Irish antiquaries who have devoted their attention
                    to the question. The discussion may now be held as practically settled in
                    Britain, though Continental scholars of some mark are still disposed to carry it
                    on.</p>

                <p>It is of no consequence whether the wordCuldee is of Latin or Celtic origin. The
                    name is equally significant and of similar meaning in both languages. It is not
                    precisely ascertained at what time that name was first used. It was unknown to
                    Bede and the biographers of St Columba, but seems to have been established early
                    in the 10th century as the title of an order of ecclesiastics possessing
                    numerous establishments in Scotland and Ireland, and a very few also in England
                    and Wales. The Culdees resided in monasteries, but were not tied down by
                    monastic rules so strict as those of the followers of Columba or Columbanus, or
                    of the Benedictine order and its various branches. Their institute bore some
                    resemblance to the rule of the canons-regular of St Augustine, but still more to
                    that of the secular canons so well known in the history of England during the
                    10th and 11th centuries. They were not united in one great community like the
                    Columbites and Cistercians, or the orders of the Mendicant Friars, but resided
                    in their separate monasteries or colleges, each of which was governed by its
                    abbot, and was practically independent of the others. The Scottish monasteries
                    are the best known, and it is in connection with them that the history of the
                    order is most important. Their chief houses in that country were St Andrews,
                    which numbered among its superiors King Constantine, who in earlier years had
                    fought against the English sovereign Athelstan at Brunanburh; Dunkeld, of which
                    Crinan, grandfather of Malcolm Canmore, was one of the lay abbots; Lochleven,
                    famous as giving us the oldest of Scottish library catalogues; and Abernethy and
                    Brechin, remembered chiefly in connection with their round towers.</p>
                <p>It was long fondly imagined by Protestant writers that the religious belief and
                    worship of the Culdees supplied complete evidence of primitive truth having been
                    preserved free from Roman corruptions in one remote comer of Western Europe. It
                    is now certain that this opinion is entirely opposed to historical evidence. In
                    doctrine, ritual, and government there was no difference between the Culdees and
                    the monastic communities in the Latin Church, except that the former, as was to
                    be expected in a remote and uncivilized country distracted by repeated invasions
                    of the Northmen, and by almost uninterrupted civil dissensions, were more
                    superstitious and corrupt than their brethren on the Continent. In
                    ecclesiastical discipline and morals there was the same inferiority. The “pure
                    Culdees” are familiar in poetry and legend, but are unknown to history. At no
                    time distinguished above their fellows for learning or piety, they gradually
                    became still more remiss. The chief endowments of their monasteries were seized
                    by nobles, who called themselves abbots, but were neither ecclesiastics nor
                    discharged any ecclesiastical functions, and who transmitted their titles and
                    estates to their families in hereditary descent. In one respect these nobles
                    were better than the corresponding class who, as priors of St Andrews and abbots
                    of Arbroath and Paisley, or the like, fought on either side in the civil wars of
                    the 16th century;—they gave up a portion of their revenues to ecclesiastics,
                    who, under the name of priors, discharged the spiritual functions of superiors
                    of the monasteries.</p>
                <p>Such a system naturally tended to become more corrupt as time went on. We need
                    not believe all that is told to the prejudice of the Culdees by the chroniclers
                    of a later age; but it is certain that the changes introduced into the Scottish
                    Church by the influence of Queen Margaret and her son King David effected a
                    great and beneficial revolution. The Culdees in general conformed to the
                    stricter discipline enforced by these sovereigns. The lay abbots had to resign
                    their titles if not their estates; the chief houses of the old rule reappeared
                    as Benedictine and Augustinian monasteries; and, in one case at least, that of
                    Brechin, the Culdees became for a time the chapter of the new cathedral The last
                    appearance of the Culdees in Scottish history is in connection with the
                    unsuccessful attempts of the prior and brethren of the order at St Andrews, in
                    the beginning of the 14th century, to maintain their ancient privilege of
                    assisting at the election of a bishop of the primatial see.</p>
                <p>The best and fallest account of the Culdees is to be found in Dean Reeves’s <hi
