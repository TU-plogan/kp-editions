                    the later Cistercian foundation of that name, which lies higher up the Tweed—had
                    been founded before the middle of the 7th century. The first abbot was Eata, one
                    of the twelve English disciples of the Scottish Aidan; and under him Cuthbert,
                    then probably in early youth, became a monk. He accompanied Eata on the latter
                    being appointed superior of the monastery at Ripon, founded by Alchfrid, son of
                    Oswy, king of Northumbria. When the dispute arose between the English and
                    Scottish ecclesiastics as to the proper time of keeping Easter, Eata, rather
                    than conform to the English usage, returned to Melrose along with Cuthbert, who
                    soon afterwards was appointed prior of that monastery. Eata having subsequently
                    adopted the English rule was appointed abbot of Lindisfarne by king Oswy, and
                    Cuthbert, still accompanying him, held the office of prior. Under the influence
                    of that intense desire to lead a life of absolute solitude by which the Scottish
                    monks of the school of St Columba were so frequently impelled, Cuthbert, after a
                    residence of considerable duration at Lindisfarne, resigned his office and
                    retired to the neighbouring island of Farne. From this seclusion Egfrid, king of
                    Northumbria, endeavoured to recall him. Cuthbert at first resisted the king’s
                    entreaties, but was at last induced to comply and to become bishop of
                    Lindisfarne. He was consecrated at York during the Easter festival of 685 by
                    Theodore, archbishop of Canterbury. After exercising his episcopal office for
                    two years he again retired to his solitude of Farne, where he died on the 20th
                    of March 687.</p>
                <p>During his lifetime Cuthbert had been reverenced as a saint, a reverence which
                    his holy life and faithful discharge of all his duties had well deserved. His
                    austere and secluded mode of living added greatly to the estimation in which he
                    was held, and as usual at that period the performance of miracles was freely
                    ascribed to him. Two accounts of his life were written within a short time after
                    his decease, one by an unknown author, the other by the most distinguished
                    ecclesiastic of the age—the Venerable Bede. They give an interesting account of
                    Cuthbert while prior of Melrose. His labours were not confined to his monastery.
                    He went about the country, sometimes on horseback, but more frequently on foot,
                    preaching to the rude people, and instructing them in their religious duties,
                    following in all respects the example of St Aidan and the other early Scottish
                    missionaries. When bishop of Lindisfarne he continued to act in the same manner,
                    as well knowing, to use the words of Bede, that “He who said, Thou shalt love
                    the Lord thy God, also said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”</p>
                <p>The fame of Cuthbert increased as time went on, and excelled that of all the
                    saints of the north. His remains were preserved at Lindisfarne as the most
                    precious treasure of the church; and, when the island towards the end of the 9th
                    century was attacked by the heathen Danes, the monks fled, carrying the relics
                    with them, which were finally deposited at Durham, when that city became the
                    seat of the Northumbrian bishopric. During the Middle Ages his shrine at Durham
                    was almost as famous as that of St Thomas at Canterbury, and attracted the
                    visits of innumerable pilgrims. The English army rallied round the banner of St
                    Cuthbert at the battle of Neville’s Cross, and it is said to have been carried
                    for the last time at the rising known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, in the reign
                    of Henry VIII. When the whole mediaeval system was beginning to crumble, and
                    after its entire overthrow, the popular reverence for his name did not cease in
                    his own northern region. The last Roman Catholic bishop of Durham, and not the
                    least famous of his line, was Cuthbert Tunstall: and in the <pb break="no"

                <p>The original authorities for the life of St Cuthbert are the two biographies
                    already referred to and the notices in Bede’s <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical
                    History.</hi> Bede mentions that what he wrote, whether in the history or in the
                    life, was derived from the records of the monastery of Lindisfarne, or from the
                    testimony of those to whom Cuthbert was personally known. (G. G. )</p>
