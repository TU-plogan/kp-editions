                    the 9th foot, through the influence of Colonel Campbell, his maternal uncle. The
                    youthful officer had an early opportunity of engaging in active service. He
                    fought under Sir Arthur Wellesley at Vimiera, took partin the retreat of Sir
                    John Moore, and was present at the battle of Coruña. He shared in all the
                    fighting of the next Peninsular campaign, and was severely wounded while leading
                    a storming-party at the attack on San Sebastian. He was again wounded at the
                    passage of the Bidassoa, and compelled to return to England, when his
                    conspicuous gallantry was rewarded with the rank of captain and lieutenant,
                    without purchase. Campbell held a command in the American expedition of 1814;
                    and after the peace of the following year he devoted, himself to studying the
                    theoretical branches of his profession. In 1823 he quelled the negro
                    insurrection in Demerara, and two years later obtained his majority by purchase.
                    In 1832 he became lieutenant-colonel of the 98th foot, and with that regiment
                    rendered distinguished service in the Chinese war of 1842. Colonel Campbell was
                    next employed in the Sikh war of 1848—49, under Lord Gough. At Chillianwalla,
                    where he was wounded, and at the decisive victory of Goojerat, his skill and
                    valour largely contributed to the success of the British arms; and his “steady
                    coolness and military precision” were highly praised in official despatches. He
                    was created a K.C.B. in 1849, and specially named in the thanks of
                    Parliament.</p>

                <p>After rendering important services in India, Sir Colin Campbell returned home in
                    1853. Next year the Crimean war broke out, and he accepted the command of the
                    Highland brigade, which formed the left wing of the duke of Cambridge’s
                    division. The success of the British at the Alma was mainly due to his
                    intrepidity; and with his “thin red line” of Highlanders he repulsed the Russian
                    attack on Balaklava. At the close of the war Sir Colin was promoted to be Knight
                    Grand Cross of the Bath, and elected honorary D.C.L∣. of Oxford. His military
                    services, however, had as yet met with tardy recognition; but, when the crisis
                    came, his true worth was appreciated. The outbreak of the Indian Mutiny called
                    for a general of tried experience; and on July 11, 1857, the command was offered
                    to him by Lord Palmerston. On being asked when he would be ready to set out, the
                    veteran replied, “Within twenty-four hours.” He was as good as his word; he left
                    England the next evening, and reached Calcutta on August 13. The position was
                    one of unusual difficulty, but his energy and resource did not fail for a
                    moment. Having formed an army as hastily as possible, he marched with 6000 men
                    and 36 guns to the relief of Lucknow. The odds against him were great, and
                    nothing save consummate dexterity of manoeuvring could have achieved success.
                    When the British guns were silenced by the fire of the rebels, Sir Colin himself
                    headed the final assault, carried the fort, and saved the besieged. He
                    afterwards, by his skilful tactics, thoroughly defeated the enemy, and captured
                    their strongholds,—thus crushing the mutiny and preserving the British rule in
                    India. For these services he was raised to the peerage in 1858, by the title of
                    Lord Clyde; and returning to England in the next year he received the thanks of
                    both Houses of Parliament. He enjoyed a pension of £2000 a year until his death,
                    which occurred on the 14th of August 1863.</p>
                <p>Lord Clyde possessed iu abundant measure all the qualities which go to make a
                    successful general. He combined the daring of the subaltern with the calm
                    prudence of the veteran commander. The soldiers whom he led were devotedly
                    attached to him; and his courteous demeanour and manly independence of character
                    won him unvarying respect. Though adequate recognition of his merits came
                    slowly, he never allowed any feeling of pique to interfere with duty; and he
                    deserves to be regarded as one of the most distinguished generals that Britain
                    has produced. <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi></p>
