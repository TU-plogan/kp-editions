                    one of the representative painters of Germany at the time of the Reformation,
                    was born at Cronach in Upper Franconia, and learnt the art of drawing from his
                    father. It has not been possible to trace his descent or the name of his
                    parents. We are not informed as to the school in which he was taught, and it is
                    a mere guess that he took lessons from the South German masters to whom Mathew
                    Grunewald owed his education. But Grunewald practised at Bamberg and
                    Aschaffenburg, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0577-0544"/> and Bamberg is the capital of the diocese in
                    wſhich Cronach lies. According to Gunderam, the tutor of Cranach’s children,
                    Cranach signalized his talents as a painter before the close of the 15th
                    century. He then drew upon himself the attention of the elector of Saxony, who
                    attached him to his person in 1504. The records of Wittenberg confirm Gunderam’s
                    statement to this extent that Cranach’s name appears for the first time in the
                    public accounts on the 21th of June 1501, when he drew 50 gulden for the salary
                    of half a year, as <hi rend="italic">pictor ducalis.</hi> The only clue to
                    Cranach’s settlement previous to his Wittenberg appointment is afforded by the
                    knowledge that he owned a house at Gotha, and that Barbara Brengbier, his wife,
                    was the daughter of a burgher of that city. Of his skill as an artist we have
                    sufficient evidence in a picture dated 1504 (Fiedler collection at Berlin),
                    preserved till lately in the Sciarra Colonna Palace at Rome. But as to the
                    development of his manner prior to that date we are altogether in ignorance. In
                    contrast with this obscurity is the light thrown upon Cranach after 1501. We
                    find him active in several branches of his profession,—sometimes a mere
                    housepainter, more frequently producing portraits and altarpieces, a designer on
                    wood, an engraver of copper-plates, and draughtsman for the dies of the
                    electoral mint. Early in the days of his official employment he startled his
                    master’s courtiers by the realism with which he painted still life, game, and
                    antlers on the walls of the country palaces at Coburg and Lochau; his pictures
                    of deer and wild boar were considered striking, and the duke fostered his
                    passion for this form of art by taking him out to the hunting field, where he
                    sketched “his grace” running the stag, or Duke John sticking a boar. Before 1508
                    he had painted several altar-pieces for the Schlosskirche at Wittenberg in
                    competition with Dürer, Burgkmair, and others; the duke and his brother John
                    were portrayed in various attitudes, and a number of the best woodcuts and
                    copper-plates were published. Great honour accrued to Cranach when he went in
                    1509 to the Netherlands, and took sittings from the Emperor Maximilian and the
                    boy who afterwards became Charles V. Till 1508 Cranach signed his works with the
                    initials of his name. In that year the elector gave him the winged snake as a
                    motto, and this motto or <hi rend="italic">Kleinod,</hi> as it was called,
                    superseded the initials on all his pictures after that date. Somewhat later the
                    duke conferred on him the monopoly of the sale of medicines at Wittenberg, and a
                    printer’s patent with exclusive privileges as to copyright in Bibles. The
                    presses of Cranach were used by Luther. His chemist’s shop was open for
                    centuries, and only perished by fire in 1871. Relations of friendship united the
                    painter with the Reformers at a very early period; yet it is difficult to fix
                    the time of his first acquaintance with Luther. The oldest notice of Cranach in
                    the Reformer’s correspondence dates from 1520. In a letter written from Worms in
                    1521, Luther calls him his gossip, warmly alluding to his “Gevatterin,” the
                    artist’s wife. His first engraved portrait by Cranach represents an Augustine
                    friar, and is dated 1520. Five years later the monk dropped the cowl, and
                    Cranach was present as “one of the council” at the betrothal festival of Luther
                    and Catherine Bora. The death at short intervals of the Electors Frederick and
                    John (1525 and 1532) brought no change in the prosperous situation of the
                    painter; he remained a favourite with John Frederick I., under whose
                    administration he twice (1537 and 1540) filled the office of burgomaster of
                    Wittenberg. But 1547 witnessed a remarkable change in these relations. John
                    Frederick was taken prisoner at the battle of Mühlberg, and Wittenberg was
                    subjected to stress of siege. As Cranach wrote from his house at the corner of
                    the market-place to the Grand-Master Albert of Brandenburg at Königsberg to tell
                    him of John Frederick’s capture, he showed his attachment by saying, “I cannot
                    conceal from your Grace that we have been robbed of our dear prince, who from
                    his youth upwards has been a true prince to us, but God will help him out of
                    prison, for the Kaiser is bold enough to revive the Papacy, which God will
                    certainly not allow.’’ During the siege Charles bethought him of Cranach, whom
                    he remembered from his childhood, and summoned him to his camp at Pistritz.
                    Cranach came, reminded his majesty of his early sittings as a boy, and begged on
                    his knees for kind treatment to the Kurfürst. Three years afterwards, when all
                    the dignitaries of the empire met at Augsburg to receive commands from the
                    emperor, and when Titian at Charles’s bidding came to take the likeness of
                    Philip of Spain, John Frederick asked Cranach to visit the Swabian capital; and
                    here for a few months he was numbered amongst the household of the captive
                    elector, whom he afterwards accompanied home in 1552. He died at Weimar, in
                    October 1553.</p>
                <p>The oldest extant picture of Cranach, the Rest of the Virgin during the Flight in
                    Egypt, marked with the initials L.C., and the date of 1504 (Mr Fiedler, Berlin),
                    is by far the most graceful creation of his pencil. It is enlivened by a host of
                    angels ministering in the pleasantest way to the wants of the infant Saviour.
                    The scene is laid on the margin of a forest of pines, and discloses the habits
                    of a painter familiar with the mountain scenery of Thuringia. There is more of
                    gloom in landscapes of a later time; and this would point to a defect in the
                    taste of Cranach, whose stag hunts (Moritzburg, Madrid, Labouchere collection)
                    are otherwise not unpleasing. Cranach’s art in its prime was doubtless
                    influenced by causes which but slightly affected the art of the Italians, but
                    weighed with potent consequence on that of the Netherlands and Germany. The
                    business of booksellers who sold woodcuts and engravings at fairs and markets in
                    Germany naturally satisfied a craving which arose out of the paucity of
                    wall-paintings in churches and secular edifices. Drawing for woodcuts and
                    engraving of copper-plates became the occupation of artists of note, and the
                    talents devoted in Italy to productions of the brush were here monopolized for
                    designs on wood, or on copper. We have thus to account for the comparative
                    unproductiveness as painters of Dürer and Holbein, and at the same time to
                    explain the shallowness apparent in many of tho later works of Cranach; but we
                    attribute to the same cause also the tendency in Cranach to neglect effective
                    colour and light and shade for strong contrasts of flat tint. Constant attention
                    to mere contour and to black and white appears to have affected his sight, and
                    caused those curious transitions of pallid light into inky grey which often
                    characterize his studies of flesh; whilst the mere outlining of form in black
                    became a natural substitute for modelling and chiaroscuro. There are, no doubt,
                    some few pictures by Cranach in which the flesh-tints display brightness and
                    enamelled surface, but they are quite exceptional. As a composer Cranach was not
                    greatly gifted. His ideal of the human shape was low; but he showed some
                    freshness in the delineation of incident, though he not unfrequently bordered on
                    coarseness. His copper-plates and woodcuts are certainly the best outcome of his
                    art; and the earlier they are in date the more conspicuous is their power.
                    Striking evidence of this is the St Christopher of 1506, or the plate of Elector
                    Frederick praying before the Madonna (1509). It is curious to watch the changes
                    which mark the development of his instincts as an artist during the struggles of
                    the Reformation. At first we find him painting Madonnas. His first woodcut
                    (1505) represents the Virgin and three saints in prayer before a crucifix. Later
                    on he composes the marriage of St Catherine, a series of martyrdoms, and scenes
                    from the Passion. After 1517 he illustrates<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n578/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0578-0545"/> occasionally the old gospel themes, but he also
                    gives expression, to some of the thoughts of the Reformers. In a picture of 1518
                    at Leipsic, where a dying man offers “his soul to God, his body to earth, and
                    his worldly goods to his relations,” the soul rises to meet the Trinity in
                    heaven, and salvation is clearly shown to depend on faith and not on good works.
                    Again sin and grace become a familiar subject of pictorial delineation. Adam is
                    observed sitting between John the Baptist and a prophet at the foot of a tree.
                    To the left God produces the tables of the law, Ad un and Eve partake of the
                    forbidden fruit, the brazen serpent is reared aloft, and punishment supervenes
                    in the shape of death and the realm of Satan. To the right, the Conception,
                    Crucifixion, and Resurrection symbolize redemption, and this is duly impressed
                    on Adam by John the Baptist, who points to the sacrifice of the crucified
                    Saviour. There are two examples of this composition in the Galleries of Gotha
                    and Prague, both of them dated 1529. One of the latest pieces with which the
                    name of Cranach is connected is that which Cranach’s son completed in 1555, and
                    which is now in the cathedral of Weimar. It represents Christ in two forms, to
                    the left trampling on Death and Satan, to the right crucified, with blood
                    flowing from the lance wound. John the Baptist points to the suffering Christ,
                    whilst the blood stream falls on the head of Cranach, and Luther reads from his
                    book the words, “The blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin.” Cranach sometimes
                    composed gospel subjects with feeling and dignity. The Woman taken in Adultery
                    at Munich is a favourable specimen of his skill, and various repetitions of
                    Christ receiving little children show the kindliness of his disposition. But ho
                    was not exclusively a religious painter. He was equally successful, and often
                    comically naive, in mythological scenes, as where Cupid, who has stolen a
                    honeycomb, complains to Venus that he has been stung by a bee (Weimar, 1530,
                    Berlin, 1534), or where Hercules sits at the spinning-wheel mocked by Omphale
                    and her maids. Humour and pathos are combined at times with strong effect in
                    pictures such as the Jealousy (Augsburg, 1527, Vienna, 1530), where women and
                    children are huddled into telling groups as they watch the strife of men wildly
                    fighting around them. Very realistic must have been a lost canvas of 1545, in
                    which hares were catching and roasting sportsmen. In 1546, possibly under
                    Italian influence, Cranach composed the Fons Juventutis of the Berlin Gallery,
                    executed by his son, a picture in which hags are seen entering a Renaissance
                    fountain, and are received as they issue from it with all the charms of youth by
                    knights and pages.</p>
                <p>Cranach’s chief occupation was that of portrait-painting, and we are indebted to
                    him chiefly for the preservation of the features of all the German Reformers and
                    their princely adherents. But he sometimes condescended to depict such noted
                    followers of the Papacy as Albert (Kur-Mainz) of Brandenburg, Anthony Granvelle,
                    and the duke of Alva. A dozen of likenesses of Frederick III. and his brother
                    John are found to bear the date of 1532. It is characteristic of Cranach’s
                    readiness, and a proof that he possessed ample materialior mechanical
                    reproduction,that he received payment at Wittenberg in 1533 for “sixty pairs of
                    portraits of the elector and his brother” in one day. Amongst existing
                    likenesses wo should notice as the best that of Albert, elector of Mainz, in the
                    Berlin museum, and that of John, elector of Saxony, in the museum of Weimar.</p>
                <p>Cranach had three sons, all artists :—John Lucas, who died at Bologna in 1536;
                    Hans Cranach, whose life is obscure; and Lucas, born in 1515, who died in 1586.
                    General von Cranach, now commanding the fortress of Cologne, is one of the last
                    descendants of the painter of Wittenberg.</p>
