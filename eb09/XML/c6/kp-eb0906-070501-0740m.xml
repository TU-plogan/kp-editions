                    soldiers under his own charge. His education was well attended to, and his
                    courage and capacity in outdoor exercises were notable from his early years. In
                    1740 he sailed as a volunteer in the fleet under the command of Sir John Norris;
                    but he quickly became dissatisfied with the navy, and early in 1742 he began the
                    military career in which he was destined to play so prominent a part.</p>
                <p>The importance for England of the European struggle which began with the death of
                    Charles VI. was that France had declared against the young Hungarian queen. The
                    war on the part of Britain was begun by a force of over 16,000 men being
                    despatched to Flanders under the command of the earl of Stair. The English
                    troops were reinforced by Hessians and Hanoverians in British pay and in 1743
                    George II. and the “martial boy” shared in the glory of Dettingen (27th June).
                    The duke of Cumberland, who led the left of the victorious army, and was wounded
                    in action, displayed an energy and valour on the report of which in England that
                    tide of his popularity began to flow which was in flood at Culloden, and which
                    steadily ebbed thereafter till his death.</p>
                <p>In 1745 the duke was again in Flanders, and on this occasion he was in full
                    command, having under him British, Hanoverian, Austrian, and Dutch troops to the
                    number of 50,000. Advancing to the relief of Tournay, which was besieged by
                    Marshal Saxe, he engaged the greatest general of the age at Fontenoy on the 11th
                    of May. It cannot now be doubted that, had the duke been supported by the allies
                    in his marvellously courageous· attack on the superior positions of the French'
                    army, Fontenoy would not have been recorded as a defeat to the British arms.
                    Three times renewing his attack in spite of repulse, he was at last forced to
                    yield, which he did by effecting a dogged and masterly retreat.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding a severity of discipline which would astonish soldiers of the
                    present day, the young duke had the power to inspire his men with a strong
                    attachment to his person and a very lively <hi rend="italic">esprit de
                    corps.</hi> As a general his courage and resolution were not sufficiently
                    tempered with sagacity and tact; but he displayed an energy and power in
                    military affairs which pointed him out to the British people as the one
                    commander upon whom they could rely to put a decisive stop to the marvellous
                    successes of Prince Charles Edward in the rebellion of 1745-46.</p>
                <p>He was accordingly recalled from Flanders, and immedi-dately proceeded with his
                    preparations for quelling the insurrection. He joined the midland army under Sir
                    John Ligoï Âer, and was at once in pursuit of his swift-footed foe. But the
                    retreat of Charles Edward from Derby disconcerted his plans; and it was not till
                    they had reached Penrith, and the advanced portion of his army had been repulsed
                    by Lord George Murray on Clifton Moor, that he became aware how hopeless an
                    attempt to overtake the retreating Highlanders would then be. Carlisle having
                    been retaken, he retired to London, till the news of the defeat of Hawley at
                    Falkirk roused again the fears of the English people, and centred the hopes of
                    Britain on the royal duke. He was appointed commander of the forces in
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>Having arrived in Edinburgh on the 30th of January 1746, he at once proceeded in
                    search of the young Pretender. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles Edward.)</hi>
                    He diverged, however, to Aberdeen, where he usefully and energetically employed
                    his time in training the well-equipped forces now under his command for the
                    peculiar nature of the warfare in which they were about to engage. What the old
                    and ex. perienced generals of his time had failed to accomplish or even to
                    understand, the young duke of Cumberland, as yet only twenty-four years of age,
                    effected with simplicity and ease. He prepared to dispose his army so as to
                    withstand with firmness that onslaught on which all Highland successes depended;
                    and he inspired his men with courage by directing each, on the fierce assault
                    being made, to transfix with his bayonet not his immediate opponent but the
                    kilted warrior on his right.</p>
                <p>On 8th April 1746 he set out from Aberdeen on that expedition so fruitful in
                    disaster to his enemies, and so fatal to the last hopes of Jacobitism. To his
                    astonishment he was not opposed on the Spey. To his great advantage the attempt
                    of Lord George Murray to surprise his troops as they lay encamped near Nairn
                    proved worse than futile to the exhausted and starving foe, whom on the morrow
                    he engaged and defeated at Culloden-This battle, fought on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n741/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0741-0706"/> the 15th of April, resulted in the total
                    overthrow of the Highland army. It is vain to deny that the men wounded in
                    battle were deliberately despatched by orders of the duke, and that his hard and
                    unsparing nature, coupled with his firm and unfeeling resolve to treat the
                    vanquished merely as rebels, induced him to deny to those whom he had conquered
                    the privileges of war or their rights as fellow-countrymen. His excesses have
                    been over-estimated, but it cannot be gainsaid that they were unconstitutional
                    and most cruel. The relief occasioned to Britain by the duke’s victorious
                    efforts was acknowledged by his being voted an income of £40,000 per annum in
                    addition to his revenue as a prince of the royal house.</p>
                <p>Henceforth, however, the career of Cumberland was to be one of signal defeat. In
                    1747 he was again on the Continent opposing the still victorious Marshal Saxe;
                    and at Lauffeld, near Maestricht, the Dutch, Austrian, and English allies under
                    the joint command of the duke and his brother-in-law Prince William of Nassau
                    received a notable defeat. Ten years afterwards Cumberland soured his popularity
                    both as a soldier and a statesman by the affair of Closterseven. When Frederick
                    the Great was suffering the terrible defeats of Prague and Kolin, at the hands
                    of the Austrians, the duke of Cumberland was attempting to defend Hanover at the
                    head of a motley army, raised chiefly in Brunswick, Prussia, and the Electorate.
                    But it was quite in vain; and at Hastenbeck, near Hameln, on the 26th of July
                    1757, he was defeated by the superior forces of D’Estrees. In September of the
                    same year his defeat had almost become disgrace. Driven from point to point, and
                    at last hemmed in by the French under Richelieu, he capitulated at Closterseven
                    on the 8th of the month, abjectly agreeing to disband his army and to evacuate
                    Hanover, which he had undertaken to defend. His disgrace was completed on his
                    return to England by the king’s refusal to be bound by the terms of the duke’s
                    agreement. In chagrin and disappointment he retired into private life, after
                    having formally resigned the public offices he held.</p>
                <p>It was not till shortly before his death that he again appeared on the stage of
                    public affairs. In 1765, when the debates on the regency bill were agitating the
                    people of England, George III., dissatisfied with Grenville and his ministry,
                    applied to his royal uncle the duke of Cumberland, who was now in failing
                    health, to open negotiations with Pitt for a return to power. On Pitt’s
                    declinature, and symptoms of violence becoming evident among the populace,
                    Cumberland again attempted to extricate the king from his unfortunate position
                    by a second negotiation with the great and popular statesman. This too was,
                    however, unsuccessful. On 31st October 1765 the duke died. His statue stands in
                    Cavendish Square.</p>
