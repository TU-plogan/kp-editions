                <p>THERE is probably no class among the Invertebratawhich offers so many striking
                    family and individual peculiarities as are to be met with among the Crustacea.
                    Having a special type of structure, and possessed of numerous characteristics in
                    common, they nevertheless put on such diverse appearances both in the young and
                    adult stages of their existence as frequently to have baffled the most able
                    investigators, whilst many of the vagrant members of the class still challenge
                    further research.</p>
                <p>The masterly and exhaustive labours of Charles Darwin on the Cirripedia have
                    rescued that aberrant group from obscurity, and many of the parasitic forms have
                    been relegated to the various orders of which they are in reality only
                    degenerated members, their organs having suffered <pb break="no"

                    having undergone modification, in consequence of the peculiar existences which
                    they lead. But our advance towards a more correct knowledge of the class, as a
                    whole, has been mainly derived from the accumulated store of embryological and
                    developmental studies which—commenced in 1823 by Vaughan Thompson—have in these
                    later years been so successfully prosecuted by Audouin and Milne-Edwards,
                    Darwin, Spence Bate, Van Beneden, Claus, Anton Dohrn, A. S. Packard, O. F.
                    Müller, Fritz Müller, and very many other naturalists. Much, however, still
                    remains to be accomplished.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Crustacea</hi> belong to the sub-kingdom <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Annulosa,</hi> and to the division <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Arthropoda,</hi> in which are also included the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Insecta,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Myriapoda,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Arachnida</hi>; they are known also as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Articulata,</hi> from the body being composed of a series of distinct rings or
                    segments, each segment usually possessing a pair of jointed appendages or limbs
                    articulated to it. They may be defined to be those Articulata which, whenever
                    respiratory organs ⅛re specially developed, possess branchiae and not tracheae.
                    By this definition they are at once separated from all insects and myriapods,
                    which invariably possess tracheae. But it remains a difficulty, if it be not
                    altogether impossible in the present state of science, to frame any definition
                    which shall similarly include all <hi rend="smallcaps">Crustacea</hi> and
                    exclude all <hi rend="smallcaps">Arachnida.</hi> In both classes, in fact, there
                    are forms which possess no special respiratory organs; and if in these cases we
                    resort to other characters, none which are of universal application have as yet
                    been discovered.</p>
                <p>It may be said, however, that as a rule these exceptional Crustacea possess more
                    than four pairs of locomotive appendages, have two pairs of antennary organs,
                    and possess a simple alimentary canal; while the Arachnida generally have not
                    more than four pairs of locomotive appendages, possess at most one pair of
                    antennary organs, and have their alimentary canal produced into caeca

                    animal. This hardened envelope serves also as an external skeleton, giving
                    rigidity and support to the internal organs; and to its inflections,
                    projections, and rugosities the muscles and membranes of the body and appendages
                    are attached.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Body-Segments.</hi> —The crustacean exo-skeleton consists of
                    a series of rings, usually a repetition of each other, and differing only in
                    modification according to the necessity of the various portions of the animal.
                    Each of these divisions is called a <hi rend="italic">somite</hi> (Huxley).</p>
                <p>The normal number of <hi rend="italic">somites,</hi> or segments, is
                    twenty-one;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> In all the
                    higher Crustacea the body is normally composed of twenty-one segments, but, of
                    these, the last never bears true appendages, and is developed subsequently to
                    the others from the dorsal surface of the body. Hence we are justified in
                    regarding it, not as a somite or primitive typical segment of the body, but as a
                    peculiar median appendage, to which the special name of “telson” (Spence Bate)
                    may be applied. Thus the number of somites becomes reduced to twenty, each
                    bearing its pair of appendages (Huxley, <hi rend="italic">Medical Times and
                    Gazette,</hi> 1857, p. 507). Professor Bell considers the extremely minute and
                    movable points attached to the extremity of this segment in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pcdae;non</hi><hi rend="italic">serratus</hi> to be a pair of rudimentary
                    appendages <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Brit. Stalk-eyed Crustacea,</hi> p. xx.,
                    1853).</p></note> but instances occur among the extinct Trilobita and the recent
                    Phyllopoda and Branchiopoda, in which a larger number of segments than
                    twenty-one· are to be met with. On the other hand, many recent and fossil forms
                    offer examples of Crustacea in which one or more segments are never developed;
                    but this apparent absence is generally due to their coalescence, and we shall
                    not unfr§quently find indications of this if we bear in mind the theory of Oken,
                    that each pair of appendages indicates a separate segment. A knowledge, too, of
                    the earlier (larval) stages of some of these forms<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> As, for instance, the larval stages of <hi

                    revealed the presence of the normal number of free segments in the young
                    individual, which in later life are permanently soldered together.</p>
                <p>Although the segments of tho Crustacea are greatly modified in the different
                    orders, yet they can nevertheless be shown to be all composed of two lateral
                    moieties resembling each other; we can also distinguish two arcs, the one
                    superior, the other inferior, as shown in tho annexed figure (fig. 2).</p>
                <p>The superior central pair united constitute the <hi rend="italic">tergum</hi> (í,
                    <hi rend="italic">t),</hi> and the lateral are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >epimera (ep, ep).</hi></p>
                <p>The inferior arc is composed of the same number of pieces. The two median pieces
                    unite to form the <hi rend="italic">sternum (s, s),</hi> and the
                    latero-inferiorpair are called the <hi rend="italic">episternum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(es, es).</hi> They are always united at the sternum; but there
                    generally exists, between the inferior arc and the epimera situated above, a
                    wide space destined for the articulation of the corresponding appendage
                    (Milne-Edwards).</p>
                <p>Mr C. Spence Bate, in his “Report on the British Edriophthalmia” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Brit. Assoc. Repts.,</hi> 1855), differs from Milne-Edwards and
                    other previous writers who had considered the series of scale-like plates at the
                    sides of the body-segments of the Amphipoda as representing the “epimeral
                    pieces” of each somite; on the contrary, he considers them to be the dilated
                    coxal joint (or <hi rend="italic">protopodite)</hi> of each limb. This view he
                    adheres to in his chief work<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    p. 3) on the sessile-eyed Crustacea, and reiterates in his Report<note

                    1875, published 1876.</p></note> (1875, p. 47), where he writes the <hi

                    a somite <hi rend="italic">cannot exist;</hi> they are really portions of the
                    integument of the appendages. That they are present in the Amphipoda attached to
                    the coxal joint of seven pairs of the limbs is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n667/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0667-0634"/> readily seen; but in the Decapoda, Stomaρoda, and
                    Isopoda it cannot by any means be so easily demonstrated. “We know of no example
                    of a ring in which we are able to distinguish all the pieces that we desire to
                    enumerate. In some there is an absence of certain pieces from the places they
                    should occupy; sometimes they are very intimately soldered together, so that we
                    cannot detect even a trace of separation; but in studying each of them
                    separately, where it is most distinct, we shall be able to form a clear idea,
                    and recognize its character in spite of its union with its neighbouring pieces.
                    Moreover, although this analysis of the ring may not be always practicable, it
                    is none the less true that it facilitates much the study of the exterior
                    skeleton of articulated animals, and that it will permit us often to establish
                    analogies where the greatest difference would at first sight appear to exist”
                    (Milne-Edwards).</p>
                <p>Professor Huxley in his lectures<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Medical Times and Gazette,</hi>
                    1857.</p></note> has somewhat simplified Milne-Edwards’s view of the crustacean
                    segment. Taking for his type one of the body rings, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >somites,</hi> of the common lobster (fig. 3), he points out that it consists of
                    a convex upper part, called the <hi rend="italic">tergum</hi> (∕), and a flatter
                    inferior side, the <hi rend="italic">sternum</hi> (s), the angle of junction on
                    each side of the tergum and sternum being produced downwards, forming what is
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">pleuron</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">epimer</hi> α)
                    (y&gt;Z.) For ordinary studies this view of a somite will be found sufficiently
                    clear and simple.</p>
                <p>From the inner surface of these tegumentary rings in the Crustacea various plates
                    are given off which project into the internal cavity, constituting in some
                    instances cells and canals.</p>
                <p>According to Milne-Edwards, these processes are always developed at the points of
                    union of two rings or of two neighbouring pieces of the same segment; and this
                    disposition has obtained for them the name of <hi rend="italic">apodema</hi>
                    (fig. 4). They are the result of a fold of the integumentary membrane which
                    penetrates more or less deeply between the organs, and which is strengthened
                    with calcareous matter like the rest of the external structure, and always
                    formed of two thin plates soldered together. They serve the office fulfilled by
                    the bones in the Vertebrata, <hi rend="italic">viz.,</hi> that of affording
                    solid surfaces to which the muscles are attached.</p>

                    consent and usage the body of a crustacean is divided into three regions,

                    agree in considering the last seven<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>That is—reckoning the <hi rend="italic">telson</hi> as the
                    twenty-first segment.</p></note> segments to be abdominal. The only difference
                    of opinion is as to the division of the first fourteen,—how many are cephalic
                    and how many thoracic.</p>
                <p>Dr Dana is of opinion that Crustacea have no distinct head, but only a <hi
                    rend="italic">cephalothorax</hi> composed of the fourteen anterior segments, yet
                    he admits that in the Edriophthalmia the seven most anterior pairs of appendages
                    are devoted to the mouth and organs of sensation, and in the extinct <hi
                    rend="italic">Pterygotus</hi> and in the Trilobita a distinct head certainly
                    exists.</p>
                <p>Professor Huxley considers that the division in the Podophthalmia is indicated by
                    the cervical fold and by the sudder change in the character of the appendages
                    between the sixth and seventh somites, and an equally marked similarity between
                    the latter and those of the eighth and ninth pair. So that according to this
                    view we should have six <hi rend="italic">cephalic,</hi> eight <hi rend="italic"
                    >thoracic,</hi> and six <hi rend="italic">abdominal</hi> somites (for Professor
                    Huxley regards the <hi rend="italic">telson</hi> as not being a true somite but
                    a median appendage, like the post-oral plate in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pterygotus).</hi> But, as Dana well observes, the mouth organs may become legs,
                    or the legs may become mouth organs by slight variations, therefore this line of
                    division can hardly be maintained on the character of the appendages alone,
                    seeing it does not hold good for other groups equally entitled to consideration,
                    as is the Podophthalmia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In the Edriophthalmia the normal arrangement mostly is maintained, the
                    fourth to the seventh pairs being epistomial appendages, and the eighth to the
                    fourteenth ambulatorv organs.</p></note></p>

                    twenty-one body srgments to prevail among the Crustacea, so also in the
                    appendages the type number of joints is seven, any departure from which is
                    disguised by fusion of one or more joints together, the obsolete condition of
                    others, or the depauperization of the limb into numerous <hi rend="italic"

                    >endopodite,</hi> which may serve as a mouth organ, a branchial appendix, a

                    differ from each other in a greater or less degree in proportion to the higher
                    or lower grade which we examine. Thus among the Decapoda (crabs and lobsters)
                    the cephalic, thoracic, and abdominal somites all possess appendages with well
                    marked characters, each series being highly differentiated for the functions to
                    be performed by it. Among the Entomostraca, the appendages of the anterior
                    cephalic somites alone are highly specialized, the others being either mere
                    vegetative repetitions of one another, or else altogether wanting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First pair.—</hi> The first cephalic somite supports the eyes,
                    <hi rend="italic">the most constant of all the organs,</hi> and probably the
                    only pair of appendages which are never diverted from their normal use, though
                    sometimes atrophied. In the more highly cephalized forms, the Decapoda-Brachyura
                    (crabs), the eyes are placed on the outer s <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> de of
                    the two pairs of antennae, but the anatomical evidence shows that the most
                    anterior pair of nerves, in this as in all other orders of Crustacea, is that
                    which is connected with the ophthalmic organs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Second pair.—</hi> The second somite bears the first pair of
                    antennae (or <hi rend="italic">ardennules),</hi> called the inner pair in the
                    higher forms, and the upper pair among the lower Crustacea. Ordinarily they are
                    slender, tapering, freely-moving, multi-articulate organs. In the lobster both
                    the endopodite and exopodite are equally developed from a common basal-joint or
                    <hi rend="italic">protopodite</hi> (see 2 in fig. 6).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Third pair.—</hi> The third somite supports the second or
                    posterior pair of <hi rend="italic">antennae,</hi> sometimes called the outer
                    pair in the higher, and the inferior pair in the lower forms of Crustacea. In
                    the lobster these are represented by a basal-joint or <hi rend="italic"
                    >protopodite,</hi> and a long filamentary, multi-segmented endopodite, to the
                    outer base of which a small scale is attached representing the exopodite. In all
                    the higher Crustacea the three most anterior somites are always <hi

                    genera, moreover, they are specially set apart as bearing the organs of sense.
                    Generally they are so closely blended together, both in the earlier stages of
                    development and also in the adult forms, as to defy separation, the presence of
                    three somites being only demonstrable by dissection, and by a knowledge of the
                    fact that each pair of appendages, wherever it exists, presupposes a segment or
                    ring to which it belongs. The genus <hi rend="italic">Squilla</hi> affords,
                    perhaps, the best evidence of the separate existence of these cephalic rings. In
                    it the first, or ophthalmic somite, is quite distinct from the second and third
                    antennary, which are also separable from one another, although the latter blends
                    with the next somite, and the succeeding ones can only be distinguished by
                    dissection. Usually the antennae or feelers are constant appendages; but still,
                    the number and disposition of these organs varies extremely. Some of the lowest
                    forms are wholly without antennae, or are furnished with them in <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> merely rudimentary state. Some species have only a single
                    pair, the normal number, however, as we have already pointed out, is two pairs.
                    In position they are inserted on the superior or inferior surface of the head,
                    according to the development of the somites composing the cephalon. Ordinarily
                    they are slender flexible multiarticulate appendages, but even among the higher
                    forms they are subject to extraordinary modifications; thus in the Scyllaridae,
                    the external pair are developed into broad flat organs of natation, and probably
                    also for burrowing. In <hi rend="italic">Arcturus,</hi> an Isopod, they are the
                    nursery for the young; in the Entomostraca they are usually natatory organs; in
                    <hi rend="italic">Pterygotus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Limulus</hi> they are
                    chelate, serving, as in the Copepoda, as clasping organs for the male. In the
                    last free condition of the Cirripedia and Rhizocephala they serve as the organs
                    for attachment,—being converted into cement-ducts in the former, and into
                    root-like organs of nutrition in the latter. The second pair of antennae and
                    sometimes even the first pair become mouth organs in the Merostomata.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fourth to Ninth pairs. Epistomial</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mouth Organs.—</hi> In the Decapoda the six succeeding pairs may be called
                    mouth-organs or epistomial appendages, being all engaged in duties subservient
                    to nutrition. The fourth somite bears the actual jaws or mandibles proper with
                    their palpi, outside which lie two pairs of maxillae, followed by three pairs of
                    maxillipeds or jaw-feet. In each successive somite, these organs become less
                    highly specialized mouthorgans, and betray the fact that they are after all only
                    simple feet modified. Thus in <hi rend="italic">Squilla</hi> (a Stomapod) the
                    eighth somite (first thoracic) bears a pair of robust claws, the terminal joint
                    of which is furnished with long and sharp teeth, these forming the.principal
                    organs of prehension; whilst the ninth somite bears a pair of ordinary feet like
                    the two following pairs (see fig. 71).</p>
                <p>In most of the Edriophthalmia the mouth-organs extend only to the seventh somite,
                    the eighth and ninth being included with the ambulatory members.</p>
                <p>In the Decapoda we can detect the more or less rudimentary endopodite and
                    exopodite in the fifth pair of appendages, and in each succeeding pair to the
                    ninth; the eighth and ninth pairs also bear a third organ called an <hi

                    type="authorial"><p> Prof. Bell writes:—“Normally there are twenty-one pairs of

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Internal Structure.—Nervous System.</hi> —The typical form
                    of the nervous system in the young of all the Articulata is a chain of ganglions
                    placed along the <hi rend="italic">ventral</hi> surface of the body, and
                    traversed in front by the gullet. This typical arrangement, however, undergoes
                    great modifications in the several orders of Crustacea. Taking the
                    Edriophthalmia, for example (fig. 7), we find the nervous system to consist of
                    two parallel chords traversing the length of the body, each having its own
                    ganglionic enlargement in each somite in juxtaposition, but not confluent; so
                    that there is a distinct pair of ganglions for each segment. These are again
                    united by transverse commissures, and each ganglionic knot gives off nervous
                    filaments to the limbs of its particular somite.</p>
                <p>In the lobster (Decapoda-Macrura), the nervous system consists of a
                    longitudinally disposed series of differentsized ganglions connected together by
                    commissural cords (fig. 8).</p>
                <p>Primitively there is a pair of ganglions to each somite, but the three first
                    pairs are fused together in the adult so as to form a large cerebral ganglion
                    placed in front of the mouth, and called the supra-aesophageal ganglion. From
                    this a nervous chord passes back on each side of the gullet to the large
                    postoral ganglion, which is made up of six pairs of primitive ganglions fused
                    together. Then follow five pairs of thoracic and six abdominal ganglions all
                    distinct, but connected one with another by a nervous band formed of the
                    primitive commissural chords which have coalesced along the middle line.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This double ganglionic chain
                    of the lobster was found by Newport to be composed of two orders of fibres,
                    forming distinct and superposed fasciculi or columns, which the author
                    designates <hi rend="italic">columns of sensation and of motion,</hi> analogous
                    to the fasciculi of the anterior and posterior columns of the spinal chord of

                    interganglionic chords, but become extremely apparent in the ganglions
                    themselves, for these enlargements belong exclusively to the inferior or <hi

                    axis all the nerves are given off, but none arise by two distinct roots like the
                    spinal nerves of man.</p>
                <p>In the prawn <hi rend="italic">(Palaemon)</hi> and spiny lobster <hi
                    rend="italic">(Palinurus)</hi> the thoracic ganglia coalesce to form a long,
                    elliptical, perforated nervous mass. In the hermit-crab <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pagurus)</hi> the cephalic ganglion presents a transversely quadrate form,
                    sending off the usual nerves to the eyes, antennae, &amp;c. The lateral
                    oesophageal chords, after supplying the digestive system with the stomato
                    gastric nerves, unite below to form the ganglion which distributes nerves to the
                    maxillary apparatus and pharynx. This is succeeded by a large oblong ganglion
                    situated at the base of the great nippers, and of the second pair of feet, both
                    of which pairs it supplies. The lateral chords, diverging for the passage of the
                    artery, re-unite to form a third thoracic ganglion, smaller than the second,
                    supplying the third pair of thoracic feet, and sending off three pairs of nerves
                    posteriorly. Of these the lateral pair goes to the fourth diminutive pair of
                    feet; the median pair supplies the fifth pair of feet; the two remaining dorsal
                    nerves, which are of minute size, form the continuations of the abdominal
                    chords, and pass along the under or concave side of the soft, membranous, and
                    highly sensitive abdomen to the anus, anterior to which the last small ganglion
                    is situated; this supplies the nerves to the muscles of the caudal plates, here
                    converted into claspers for enabling the animal to adhere to the columella of
                    the spiral shell which it may have selected to protect the portion of its body
                    undefended by the usual dense and insensible crustaceous covering (Owen).</p>
                <p>The general progress of the development of the nervous system in the Crustacea
                    has been, as we have seen, attended with increased size and diminished numbers
                    of its central or ganglionic masses. The divisions of each pair of ganglions
                    first coalesce by transverse approximation; distinct pairs of ganglions
                    approximate longitudinally, conjoining as usual from behind forwards; confluent
                    groups of ganglions are next found in definite parts of the body, as on the
                    thorax of those species which have special developments and uses for particular
                    legs. In the crab, in which the general form of the body attains most
                    compactness, the ventral nervous trunks are concentrated into one large oval
                    ganglion, from which the nerves radiate to all parts of the trunk, the legs, and
                    the short tail.</p>
                <p>A corresponding structure of the nervous system is also well displayed in <hi
                    rend="italic">Maia</hi> (fig. 9.) An analogous concentration, but not an
                    homologous one, obtains iu <hi rend="italic">Limulus.</hi> Here the nervous
                    substance is chiefly massed round the oesophagus, the fore part of the ring
                    expanding into a pair of ganglions, from which the nerves are sent off to the
                    small median ocelli and the large lateral eyes; the nerves to the latter are of
                    great length, wind round the anterior apodemata, and bend back to their
                    termination, breaking up into a fasciculus of minute filaments before
                    penetrating the large compound eye. Two stomato-gastric nerves arise from the
                    upper and fore part of the ring. From the under surface of the fore part of the

                    antennules; five large nerves proceed from each side of the ring to the five

                    The posterior part of the nervous ring is prolonged backwards in the form of a
                    chord having four ganglionic enlargements on its ventral surface, and terminates
                    opposite the penultimate post-abdominal plate in a fifth slight ganglionic
                    enlargement which bifurcates; each division sends off a few nerves as it
                    proceeds to the caudal appendage, on entering which it is resolved into a plexus
                    or kind of <hi rend="italic">cauda</hi><hi rend="italic">equina.</hi> Besides
                    the principal nerves above mentioned many smaller nerves are given off to other
                    parts of the body. The sides of the great oesophageal ring are united by two
                    transverse commissural bands; but the most remarkable feature of the nervous
                    axis of this crustacean is its envelopment by an arterial trunk. A pair of aorta
                    from the fore part of the heart arch over each side of the stomach, and seem to
                    terminate by intimately blending with the sides of the oesophageal nervous ring.
                    They, in fact, expand upon, and seem to form its neurilemma; a fine injection
                    thrown into them coats the whole central mass of the nervous system with its red
                    colour (Owen, <hi rend="italic">Lectures—Invertebrata,</hi> 1855).</p>
                <p>Tracing the nervous system in the Crustacea from its simplest type, a vermiform
                    cord with a series of independent nerve centres, we see these becoming
                    successively conjoined in a greater and greater degree, as if in obedience to
                    home law of attraction, until in the crab the maximum Centralization of the
                    class is attained. But in whatever form it exists in this section of the
                    Arthropoda we may bear in mind the conclusion that</p>
                <p>“the nervous system of the Crustacea consists uniformly of medullary nuclei
                    (ganglions) the normal number of which is the same as that of the members or
                    rings of the body, and that all the modifications encountered, whether at
                    different periods of the incubation, or in different species of the series,
                    depend especially on the approximation, more or less complete, of these nuclei
                    (an approximation Which takes place from the sides towards the median line, as
                    well is in the longitudinal direction), and to an arrest of development
                    occurring in a variable number of the nuclei.”—(Milne-Edwards.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Divisions of the Nerves in the Crustacea.</hi> —Three
                    principal divisions have been recognized in the nervous system of the Crustacea
                    :—</p>
                <p>(1.) All those nervous filaments which take their rise in, and are exclusively
                    connected with, the supraaesophageal nerve-centre, forming the true <hi

                    to the abdominal columns with their nervous filaments, serving for the automatic
                    reception and reflection of stimuli, forming the <hi rend="italic">motor</hi>
                    system. (3.) The stomato-gastric nerves, connected partly with the brain and
                    partly with the oesophageal columns (analogous to the great sympathetic or
                    organic nerves of the Vertebrata), forming a third group, the <hi rend="italic"

                    regards the relative size of the several ganglions in the nervous chain of the
                    Crustacea generally, there is little difference between the anterior and
                    posterior masses, and often a disparity between the supra-as compared with the
                    infra-aesophageal ganglions,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> In <hi rend="italic">Maia squinado,</hi> for example,
                    although the supra-aesophageal or «ephalic ganglion is large, yet, in

                    is fully three times its size. See <hi rend="italic">supra,</hi> fig.
                    9.</p></note> yet, nevertheless, it is generally admitted that in these animals
                    there is an evident tendency observable towards a centralization of the nervous
                    functions in the anterior portion of the ganglionic chain, viz., the
                    supra-aesophageal ganglion. But still there is a wide interval between this
                    first indication and the concentration of the faculties of perception and of
                    will in a single organ—the brain—of which every other portion of the nervous
                    system then becomes a mere dependency.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Organs of Feeling.</hi> —As regards the development of the
                    individual senses, one may reasonably conjecture that the sense of touch can be
                    but feebly exercised by the common integument of the Crustacea, if indeed it can
                    be said to exist at all, except in those parts of the body which remain soft and
                    undefended by a calcareous crust, such as the under side of the abdomen or the
                    soft body of the hermit-crabs. The hairs with which many of the Crustacea are
                    indued may to some extent compensate for this low endowment of the tactile
                    sense.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt, however, that the sense of touch is mainly concentrated in
                    the two pairs of long, manyjointed, and highly flexible antennae with which
                    numbers of this class are provided. These special organs of touch are directly
                    connected with the cephalic ganglion, and are well adapted, both by actual
                    exploration and as media for conveying vibratory sensations, to furnish to the
                    brain most correct and rapid ideas of surrounding objects.</p>
                <p>The smaller but similarly-formed flabelliform appendages attached to the maxillae
                    and maxillipeds doubtless perform a similar office in the testing of all objects
                    brought near to the mouth; these latter, however, are not directly connected
                    with the supra-aesophageal, but with the mandibular ganglion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Organs of Sight.</hi> —The eyes of Crustacea present a
                    greater variety in their gradation than is to be found in any other class of the

                <p>It has been doubted by some naturalists whether the eyes are organs of so much

                    water, or even in a shallow aquarium, can hardly be deemed as either a
                    conclusive or a satisfactory test of the sensitiveness of the cornea in an eye

                    as an effect of a kind of retrograde metamorphosis which the animal undergoes
                    that the organs of vision disappear in the adult. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    Two forms of visual organs are met with in the Crustacea, namely, smooth or <hi
                    rend="italic">simple</hi> eyes <hi rend="italic">(ocelli</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">stemmata)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">compound</hi> eyes; but
                    though there are some few forms in which (as in <hi rend="italic">Λpus</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Limulus)</hi> both ocelli and compound eyes are present, the
                    latter form of eyes is that most generally met with in the class.</p>
                <p>The structure of the <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> eye does not differ greatly
                    from that observed among higher animals. There is, firstly, a transparent
                    cornea, smooth and rounded, which is, in fact, only a part of the general
                    tegumentary covering modified. Immediately behind the cornea is the crystalline
                    lens, generally of a spherical form; this is again followed by a gelatinous mass
                    analogous to the vitreous humour, and this mass is, in its turn, in contact with
                    the extremity of the optic nerve. A layer of pigment of a deep colour envelops
                    the whole of these parts, lining the internal wall of the globe of the eye up to
                    the point at which the cornea begins to be formed by the thinning of the
                    tegumentary envelope rendering it transparent. The number of these simple eyes
                    does not exceed two or three.</p>
                <p>In the Branchiopoda <hi rend="italic">(Nebalia, Branfhipus, Daphnia)</hi> behind
                    a simple cornea, undivided externally, we find a variable number of distinct
                    crystalline lenses and vitreous humours, each included in a pigmentary cell, and
                    terminating by contact with the optic nerve. These are, no doubt, an aggregation
                    of stemmata under a common cornea.</p>
                <p>In some of the Edriophthalmia a still further advance to a true compound eye is
                    met with. In these the cornea appears to consist of two transparent laminae, the
                    external layer being smooth and the internal one facetted, each facet being a
                    distinct cornea resting on a separate crystalline lens of its own. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">compound eye,</hi> properly so called, the two membranes, external
                    and internal, constituting the cornea, are both divided into facets, each facet
                    seemingly being equivalent to a distinct ocellus, furnished with its own
                    crystalline cone (or lens) and nerve rod; each invested with its own pigment
                    coating, which, being darker at intervals, gives to a section through the
                    compound eye as a whole the appearance of pigment-bands repeated at various
                    depths beneath the cornea, and in front of the expanded termination of the optic
                    nerve <hi rend="italic">(retina).</hi> Although these facets are always
                    hexagonal in the eye of an insect, they are variable in form among the
                    Crustacea. Thus in <hi rend="italic">Homarus, Ástacus, Penaeus, Galathaea,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Scyllarus,</hi> the facets are square; whilst in <hi

                    rend="italic">Callianassa,</hi> and the crabs, they are hexagonal. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Limulus</hi> and the Trilobites the lenses are <hi rend="italic"
                    >round,</hi> not being in actual close contact with each other. Milne-Edwards
                    mentions that in <hi rend="italic">Idotea</hi> each facet has a kind of
                    supplemental lens of a <hi rend="italic">circular shape</hi> set within the
                    cornea in front of each proper crystalline lens, and equal in size to the
                    corneal facet, and apparently evolved in the substance of the cornea itself, but
                    under favourable circumstances capable of being detached from it. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Phacops</hi><hi rend="italic">caudatus</hi> the small circular
                    lenses of the external compound eyes drop out, leaving a corresponding concavity
                    beneath.</p>
                <p>Emmerich long since proposed to use the external characters of the eyes of
                    Trilobites as a means of classification, dividing them into “hyaline eyed and
                    “facetted’’-eyed groups; but he does not seem to have been aware of the perfect
                    analogy which the structure of the eyes of the modern Edriophthalmia afford in
                    illustration of this ancient and extinct group.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stemmata</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ocelli</hi> are always
                    immovable and sessile; the compound eyes with smooth corneae, although usually
                    sessile, are, however, occasionally supported on pedicles, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Nebalia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Branaehipus.</hi></p>
                <p>The compound facetted eyes are subject to the same variations,—genera being found
                    with hyaline and facetted corneae in the same order. In some of the compound
                    sessile eyes the facets are round; but in all the pedunculated compound eyes
                    they are either square or hexagonal.</p>
                <p>The peduncles supporting the eyes in the Stomapoda and Decapoda vary greatly in
                    length, but every consideration tends to the conclusion that these movable
                    eye-stalks are really the pair of appendages of the first cephalic ring. Indeed,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Sqιιilla</hi> one is actually able to separate the
                    eye-stalks with the segment upon which they are borne from the cephalic
                    shield.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Macrophthalmus</hi> and some other crabs the eye-stalk is of

                    Bell, and others consider the external organ connected with the sense of hearing
                    to be situated on the first joint of the outer and larger antennae in the
                    lobster and other Macroura, and to consist of a conical process beneath which is
                    a cavity having a round orifice closed by a membrane. Behind the process, and
                    connected with the cavity, is a large sac filled with a clear liquor; a nerve
                    arising in common with the external antennal nerve is spread upon the delicate
                    walls of the supposed acoustic sac.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Maia</hi> and other crabs the membrane is replaced by a
                    movable calcareous disc pierced by a small oval opening, over which is stretched
                    a thin elastic membrane (which might be termed the internal auditory membrane),
                    near to which the auditory nerve appears to terminate.</p>
                <p>The auditory apparatus of the Crustacea consequently consists essentially of a
                    cavity full of fluid, over which a nerve adapted to perceive sonorous impulses
                    is distributed, assisted by an elastic membrane, and placed near the base of the
                    antennae which, like a rigid stem, assists in rendering certain vibrations

                    parts which needs to be specially noticed here.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Organs of Nutrition.—</hi> In the larval stages of the
                    higher Crustacea, andalso among the adult lower andsimpler forms, fewer of the
                    somites have their paired appendages differentiated to perform special offices.
                    Thus in the larval Decapod the chief natatory organs are the maxillipeds; this
                    is also the case in the Merostomata. In <hi rend="italic">Limulus</hi> (fig. 12)
                    all the locomotory organs are also subservient to the duties of nutrition, being
                    organs of locomotion at their distal, and mandibles and maxillae at their
                    proximal extremity.</p>
                <p>In fact, as already stated, we have abundant evidence to prove that the maxillary
                    organs of the Malacostraca are but modifications of entire limbs, translated
                    from the locomotive series and set apart as special mouth-organs. By far the
                    larger proportion of the Crustacea have a proper normal mouth furnished with
                    suitable organs .of mastication, but among the parasitic Copepoda and certain
                    aberrant parasitic Isopods, &lt;fcc., they become merely organs of attachment,
                    the mouth being suctorial; or (as in the Rhizocephala) it may be altogether
                    wanting, and the limbs completely lost, and from the point of attachment
                    root-like tubes may be developed, which, sinking deep into the body of the host,
                    convey to the parasite its nutriment ready digested and prepared.</p>
                <p>If instead of these latter we examine the Decapoda we shall find the mouth placed
                    centrally near the front and upon the under side of the cephalon. It is provided
                    with a small simple median piece, called a <hi rend="italic">labrum,</hi> or
                    upper lip, in front, and a bifid <hi rend="italic">metastoma,</hi> or lower lip,
                    behind; the paired appendages (mandibles, maxillae, &amp;c.) being placed on
                    either side of the buccal orifice.</p>
                <p>The food, whether living or dead, being first seized by the forcipated thoracic
                    feet, is brought near to the maxillipeds, and by the help of these external
                    organs of prehension portions are separated and introduced by the maxillae to
                    the trenchant and powerful mandibles, when having undergon e further subdivision
                    they are swallowed.</p>
                <p>No organ corresponding to a tongue exists in the Crustacea, the mouth being only
                    the anterior and outward expansion of the aesophagus, which is short, rises
                    vertically, and terminates directly in the stomach.</p>
                <p>The wall of the stomach is composed of twomembranous layers, separated by one of
                    muscular fibres, which increase in thickness at the openings leading from the
                    aesophagus and into the intestine.</p>
                <p>The stomach is globular in form and of great capacity, and maybe divided into an
                    anterior or “cardiac” part, and a posterior or “pyloric” region. The food on
                    reaching the “cardiac” region of the stomach is subjected to a further process
                    of mastication, by means of a complex apparatus composed of several calcareous
                    pieces, moved by appropriate muscles, inserted in the membranous wall of the
                    stomach (fig. 13, la), armed with a smooth median plate and two lateral
                    molar-like-organs, having a singular <hi rend="italic">mimetic</hi> and
                    superficial resemblance to the molar teeth of some small marsupial rodent. Two
                    smaller points (bicuspid in the lobster, tricuspid in the crab) complete the
                    calcareous apparatus; in the pylorus a series of fine hairs are placed, which,
                    doubtless, act like a strainer, preventing the escape of the coarser particles
                    of the food until they have repeatedly been subjected to the molar-like action
                    of the gastric teeth. A long and straight intestine continues from the stomach
                    backwards, and terminates beneath the telson.</p>
                <p>Two caecal salivary glands of a greenish colour are situated on either side of

                <p>The liver in the Decapoda is of large size, and bilaterally symmetrical: its
                    structure is highly ramified, not solid like the human liver. The secreted fluid

                <p>This organ, so large in the crab, undergoes great modifications in the various
                    orders; in the Edriophthalmia only three pairs of biliary vessels, analogous to
                    those of insects, remain. No vessels have as yet been detected by •which the
                    chyle or nutritious fluid elaborated by the digestive processes is taken up, as
                    it passes along the intestinal canal, and transferred to the circulatory system;
                    we can only, therefore, conclude that it is transferred by absorption to the
                    irregular venous receptacles which are in contact with the walls of the
                    intestines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Circulatory System.</hi> —In most of the Crustacea the
                    circulation is of the same simple character as that observed in the aquatic
                    larvae of insects, save that in the Crustacea the blood is conveyed to the gills
                    for the purpose of oxygenation; but where no special respiratory organs are
                    developed, the fine hairs and filamentous appendages attached to the feet
                    doubtless subserve that office, or in some the entire surface of the body. The
                    heart consists of an elongated contractile dorsal vessel, larger behind than
                    before, connected anteriorly and posteriorly by several branches with the
                    inferior or returning vessels, which running along the whole body receive the
                    blood from the anterior extremity, and carry it into the posterior extremity of
                    the dorsal vessel.</p>
                <p>In the male <hi rend="italic">Entoniscus</hi><hi rend="italic">Cancrorum</hi> the

                    with two pairs of fissures, and is situated in the last segment of the thorax
                    and the first of the abdomen. Lastly, in the young <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anilocra</hi> the heart (fig. 16) extends through the whole length of the
                    abdomen, and is furnished with four or five fissures which are not placed in
                    pairs; but alternately to the right and left in successive segments (Fritz
                    Müller, <hi rend="italic">Für</hi><hi rend="italic">Darwin,</hi> pρ. 41-42).</p>
                <p>In the Decapoda the heart is placed near the dorsal surface of the cephalic
                    shield immediately beneath the integument above the intestinal tube, and is
                    retained in its place by lateral pyramidal muscles. It consists of a single
                    chamber or ventricle, suspended in a large sac, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pericardium,</hi> but wholly distinct from the part so named in man. The
                    structure of the heart is made up of the interlacement of numerous muscualr
                    fibres fixed by their extremities to neighbouring parts, and passing for some
                    distance over the aggregate at each end, the whole structure reminding one of a
                    number of stars superposed on each other, the rays of which do not correspond
                    (Milne - Edwards). The ventricle has three pairs of apertures so closed by
                    valves as to readily allow the entrance of blood from the pericardium, but to
                    hinder its regurgitation. It has three other pairs of openings, each of which is
                    the commencement of an arterial trunk conveying blood all over the body. These
                    arteries have valves at their origin, and ramify and end ultimately in
                    capillaries, which open into what are called venous sinuses, because they are
                    channels without any definito shape. The venous blood collects in a great
                    sternal sinus, and thence passes up into the gills to be oxygenated, after which
                    it proceeds to the pericardium to find its way into the ventricle (fig.</p>

                    communicate with the ventricle, and return a portion of carbonized or venous
                    blood to the heart; the circulation is, therefore, to some extent mixed, and as
                    both venous and arterial blood reach the ventricle, they are propelled thence
                    through the system (see fig. 18). The returning blood is not redistributed

                    protected by their own somite, as, if it had passed over them, the branchial
                    appendages would have become internal, their character and constitution would
                    therefore be changed; they would cease to be external; in fact, they would cease
                    to be branchiae. These appendages, however, exist as branchiae, and are
                    nevertheless securely covered and protected; not, indeed, by their own somite,
                    but by the great development of the mandibular and posterior antennal somites
                    incorporated together, forming the carapace so characteristic of the typical
                    Crustacean.</p>
                <p>The branchial appendages are thus external in relation of the body of the animal,
                    but covered over and protected by the lateral walls of the carapace. To complete
                    this so as effectually to prote:t these organs without pressing on them or
                    interfering with their functions, a very considerable amount of lateral
                    development has taken place, and a peculiar reflection so as to bring the margin
                    of the carapace below the branchial appendages, and to protect them from rude
                    contact with the limbs. Externally, the carapace covers and protects both the
                    hepatic and branchial organs; but, internally, a calcareous wall of demarcation
                    exists between the two. This wall, which Milne-Edwards terms the <hi
                    rend="italic">apodema,</hi> is continued into a thin membranous tissue that
                    makes a distinct and well-defined separation between the branchial appendages
                    and the internal system, so that the aqueous element so necessary for the
                    aeration of the blood as it passes through the branchiae may have full power to
                    play upon the gills, and yet leaving no passage that would admit it to the
                    internal viscera so as to derange the general economy of the animal (Spence
                    Bate). The gills are not ciliated, and thus they require that the water within
                    the branchial caι ity in which they are placed should be incessantly renewed by
                    other means. In the crabs two passages communicate with the branchial chamber,
                    one for the entrance, the other for the exit of the water necessary to
                    respiration. The efferent orifice always opens on each side in front of the
                    mouth under the posterior maxilliped. The afferent opening varies greatly in
                    position in the different groups.</p>
                <p>In the Macroura (lobsters), and in some of the Anomoura (hermit-crabs), the
                    margin of the carapace is not accurately fitted to the thorax along its lower
                    lateral border; the branchial cavity is thus open along the whole extent of its
                    inferior edge, and so the water finds its way readily into the respiratory
                    chamber.</p>
                <p>In the Brachyura (crabs), the afferent orifice is more circumscribed, but varies
                    in a still greater degree. In nearly all it exists as <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    cleft of considerable breadth in front of the base of the first pair of
                    ambulatory appendages between the carapace and the thorax.</p>
                <p>In the Ocypoda, the third and fourth pair of feet are more closely approximated
                    than the rest, and their margins bear a dense border of long silky
                    peculiarly-formed hairs. Between the basal-joints of these feet, Fritz Müller
                    has discovered a round orifice opening into the branchial cavity, and he finds
                    this to be a true incunent orifice for the admission of air or water into the
                    branchial chamber.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    respiratory in-current enters near the front in the usual manner, but when air
                    is breathed, the anterior incurrent orifice being closed, and the hinder border
                    of the carapace elevated, a wide fissure is opened upon each side above the last
                    pair of feet leading directly into the branchial chamber.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Leucosia</hi> the two apertures are close together, the
                    incurrent opening being situated in front of the mouth, and the water passing in
                    by a conduit parallel to the excurrent canal. The circulation of the medium
                    within the respiratory atrium is brought about partly by the movements of the
                    legs to which the branchiae are attached, and partly by the epipodites which
                    ascend between the gills. Tlιe main agent, however, is the “scaphognathite,” a
                    flabelliform appendage of the second pair of maxillipeds, which, rising and
                    falling continually, occasions a rapid current from behind forwards in the
                    water, filling the branchial chamber.</p>
                <p>Branchiae such as we have described, enclosed beneath the overarching lateral
                    walls of the carapace, are specially characteristic of the Decapoda (crabs and

                <p>In the Amphipoda the head shield is small, and no longer covers the thoracic
                    somites, as in the Decapoda. The branchiae, however, are still borne on the
                    coxal joint of the thoracic legs, but they depend unprotected from each limb,
                    and are bathed in the surrounding medium, which is made to pass rapidly over
                    them by the action of the abdomina 1 flabellae.</p>

                    float freely in the water which bathes the entire surface of the animal.</p>
                <p>In the Isopoda the abdominal appendages are all devoted to respiration, the

                    covering the succeeding five branchigerous pairs, and also the reproductive
                    organs (see fig. 12).</p>

                <p>No Macrouran Decapod, so far as ascertained, voluntarily quits the water,
                    although the common lobster, the river crayfish, and the spiny lobster, all
                    display great tenacity of life when removed from their native element. Their
                    inability to leave the water is, no doubt, due to the fact that the carapace is
                    less acurately fitted to the thorax than in the crabs. Certain of the Anomoura,
                    or hermit-crabs, however, find no difficulty in adapting themselves to
                    terrestrial conditions. The writer has kept the <hi rend="italic">Cenobita
                    Diogenes</hi> from the Antilles, tenanting an <hi rend="italic">Achatina</hi>
                    shell, alive in a Wardian case for three months, during which period he
                    displayed great activity and most remarkable powers as a climber. These West
                    Indian crabs are not infrequently brought over alive to England with cargoes of
                    guano and other natural products (fig. 20).</p>
                <p>Darwin refers to the abundance of hermit-crabs on Keeling Island in the Indian
                    Ocean <hi rend="italic">(Voyage of the Beagle,</hi> p. 544), all living on the
                    cocoa-nut, and each ensconced in some shell obtained from the neighbouring
                    beach. On the same island is found another most remarkable and very large
                    terrestrial Anomourous Crustacean, the <hi rend="italic">Birgus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">latro,</hi> living in burrows at the base of the cocoa-nut trees,
                    upon the fruit of which it subsists. This large hermit-crab seeks no artificial
                    covering for its fleshy body, the integument of which is chiefly membranous, but
                    has the tergal pieces of its abdominal somites calcified. It is said (by Darwin)
                    to visit the sea nightly for the purpose of moistening its gills, and the young
                    are hatched in the water, and pass there their earlier stages of existence.</p>
                <p>Many of the shore-crabs, as <hi rend="italic">Graρsus,</hi> and the freshwater
                    crab, <hi rend="italic">Thelphusa,</hi> are not only able to leave the water
                    temporarily; the former <hi rend="italic">habitually</hi> lives out of that
                    element, whilst many sub-tropical forms, as <hi rend="italic">Gecarcinus,
                    Gelasimus,</hi> &lt;fcc., frequently live at a distance from the sea, and
                    certainly possess the power of breathing air. But in all land-crabs it seems
                    essential that the gills should, if not immersed in water, at least have the air
                    surrounding them <hi rend="italic">saturated with moisture.</hi> Milne-Edwards
                    found that <hi rend="italic">Gecarcinus</hi> (fig. 21) has the membrane lining
                    the walls of the respiratory cavity modified in a manner analogous to that
                    observed in fishes of the order Acanthopterygiae. Sometimes this provision
                    consisted of folds and <hi rend="italic">lacunae</hi> serving as reservoirs for
                    the water; sometimes, as in <hi rend="italic">Birgits,</hi> of a spongy mass
                    well calculated to store up the fluid necessary to keep the branchiae
                    sufficiently moistened to enable them to perform their functions.</p>
                <p>The swift-footed sand-crabs (Ocypoda) are exclusively terrestrial, and can
                    scarcely live for a single day in water; in a much shorter period, a state of
                    complete relaxation occurs, and all voluntary movements cease. In fact, these
                    Lnd-dwelling crabs are as truly asphyxiated by immersion in water, as the
                    aquatic species of <hi rend="italic">Cancer</hi> become when taken from that

                    choosing terrestrial plants for their abode, sometimes at an elevation of 1500

                    from the sea.</p>
                <p>All the Oniscidae are terrestrial in their habits, livingunc er stones, moss, or
                    decaying wood, and in similar damp situations; they breathe air (which, however,
                    must be saturated with moisture) by the aid of a series of respiratory branchial
                    plates on the under side of the abdominal somites, in the same manner as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Idotea</hi> (already noticed), and in addition to this by the
                    inspiration of air by means of certain spiracular orifices on several of the
                    basal pairs of these same appendages (6g. 22).</p>
                <p>In a large number of the lower and simple forms, including also the parasitic
                    Crustacea and the Cirripedia, no special organs of respiιa-tion exist, and we
                    are led to conclude that this office is performed by the surface of the body and
                    its appendages generally.</p>

                    easily to be discerned in most of the Crustacea, but the analogy between these
                    parts in the male and female is so great in many genera as to need the most
                    careful examination in order to discriminate between the two. Generally,
                    however, the males may be discerned by their having cue or more pairs of limbs
                    especially modified to assist in the marital act.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the Cirripedia the two sexes appear never to exist together
                    in the same individual among the Crustacea.</p>
                <p>The small size and great dissimilarity of the males of some of the parasitic
                    genera caused them to remain long unknown, and led to the error of supposing the
                    females to be hermaphrodite, as Darwin has shown to be really the case in the
                    Cirripedes. But even in this division <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n676/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0676-0643"/> Darwin has found small males parasitic on the
                    female which he has named “complemental males.” They are destitute of a mouth,
                    aud appear to exist only for the performance of this one function of
                    reproduction (Darwin, <hi rend="italic">Cirripedia,</hi> Ray Soc. 1851).</p>
                <p>Bilateral symmetry generally prevails among the members of this class, and as a
                    consequence we find always a pair of these organs arranged one on either side of
                    the body, perfectly distinct, and often wholly independent of each other. The
                    male is provided with a paired gland or testes, and two excretory ducts, by
                    which the spermatozoa are discharged on reaching the efferent openings, usually
                    situated on either side in the basal joints of the seventh pair of thoracic
                    appendages, or the first pair of abdominal limbs. In both the Crab and Lobster
                    tho first pair of abdominal appendages of the male are specially modified to
                    take part in the process of fecundating the female.</p>
                <p>Milne-Edwards denies that these appendages have any claim to be considered as
                    fulfilling the office of conveying the fecundating fluid to the body of the
                    female, but Spence Bate has frequently taken <hi rend="italic">Carcinus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">maenas</hi> with these styliform appendages deeply inserted within
                    the vulvae of the female. He has also shown the existence of a <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The ovaries in the crab resemble four cylindrical tubes placed longitudinally in
                    the thorax, and divided into two symmetrical pairs, each opening into a distinct
                    oviduct, yet communicating with each other by a transverse canal and by the
                    intimate union of the two posterior tubes. The oviducts and ovaries are of a
                    whitish colour, and become united to a kind of sac <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> on each side, the neck of which opens externally in the sternal pieces of
                    the fifth thoracic somite, which bears the third pair of walking appendages.</p>
                <p>In the Anomoura and Macroura there are no copulatory pouches, and the vulvae open
                    on the basal joint· of the third pair of ambulatory legs. It is possible,
                    therefore, that in these forms the fecundation of the ova does not take place
                    until the eggs are actually extruded, which we know to be the case in <hi

                    secretion which thickens into threads, and causes the eggs to adhere to each
                    other and to the fine hairs with which the swimmerets of the abdomen of the
                    lobster and the female crab are fringed (fig. 23). Fig. 24 shows the method of
                    attachment of the eggs. Here they are retained securely until the period of
                    hatching has arrived, when the brood in most cases is dispersed.</p>

                    dozen young ones adhering to the false abdominal feet of the parent,—the young,
                    except in size, agreeing perfectly with the parent.</p>

                    thoracic feet in the female are developed into a broad plate on either side, and
                    bent under the sternum, thus forming together an incubatory pouch or marsupium,
                    in which the eggs are first deposited, and within which the young are secluded
                    during their minority. In Thysanopoda the eggs and young are contained in a pair
                    of oval sacs dependent from the posterior feet, forcibly reminding one of the

                    met with two broods of different ages, clearly demonstrating that the maternal

                <p>He has shown that in this species the metamorphosis is a perfectly gradual one,
                    and that, dissimilar as is the zoëa when it quits the egg from the adult animal,
                    yet nevertheless the change at each moult is so small that it is only by a
                    comparison between the earliest and the last stages that we perceive the amount
                    of the change which has actually taken place.</p>
                <p>“The most important peculiarities,” writes Fritz Müller, “which distinguish this
                    zoëa-brood from the adult animal are as follows. The middle body (thorax), with
                    its appendages, those five pairs of feet to which these animals owe their name
                    of Decapoda, is either entirely wanting, or scarcely indicated; the abdomen and
                    tail are destitute of appendages, and the latter consists of a single piece
                    (fig. 26). The mandibles, as in the Insecta, have no palpi. The maxillipeds, of
                    which the third pιir is often wanting, are not yet brought into the service of
                    the mouth, but appear in the form of biramose natatory feet. Branchiae are
                    wanting, or where their first rudiments may be detected as small verruciform
                    prominences, these are dense cell-masses through which the blood does not yet
                    flow, and which have therefore nothing to do with respiration. An interchange of
                    the gases of the water and the blood may (and no doubt does) occur all over the
                    thin-skinned surface of the body; but the lateral parts of the carapace may
                    unhesitatingly be indicated as the chief seat of respiration.</p>
                <p>“They consist, exactly as described by Leydig in the Daphniae, of an outer and
                    inner lamina, the space between which is traversed by numerous transverse
                    partitions dilated at their ends; the spaces between these partitions are
                    penetrated by a more abundant flow of blood than occurs anywhere else in the
                    body of the zoëa. A constant current of water passes beneath the carapace from
                    behind forwards, maintained as in the adult animal by a foliaceous appendage
                    from the second pair of maxillae.</p>
                <p>“The zoëae of the crabs are usually distinguished by long, spini∙ form processes
                    of the carapace (fig. 27). One of these projects up wards from the middle of the
                    back, a second downwards from the forehead, and frequently there is a shorter
                    one on each side near the posterior inferior angles of the carapace. But in the

                <p>“The following are the more important peculiarities in the zoëa of the crabs,
                    although less striking than these processes of the carapace, which, in
                    combination with the large eyes, often give them so singular an appearance. The
                    anterior (inner) antennae are simple, not jointed, and bear two or three
                    olfactory filaments at the extremity; the outer antennae frequently form a long
                    spine-like process, and bear a minute squamiform process like the antennal scale
                    in prawns. Of the natatory feet (afterwards <hi rend="italic">maxillipeds)</hi>
                    only two pairs are present, the third is entirely wanting, or present, like the
                    five following pairs of feet, only as minute buds. The tail in zoëa is very
                    variable in form, but nearly always bears three pairs of setae upon its hinder

                <p>When the young zoëa first escapes from the egg, it is enveloped by a membrane
                    veiling the spinous processes of the carapace, the setae of the feet, and the
                    antennae; but this is cast off in a few hours. The zoëae of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Porcellana</hi> (fig. 28) seem to differ widely from true crabs, but really
                    approach them very closely. The dorsal spine is wanting, but the frontal and
                    lateral spines are of extraordinary length, and directed straight forward and
                    backward. The tail bears <hi rend="italic">five</hi> pairs of setae.</p>
                <p>The zoëa of <hi rend="italic">Hippa</hi><hi rend="italic">eremita</hi> also
                    resembles that of the crab in general appearance and in mode of locomotion (fig.
                    29). The carapace has only a short broad frontal process; and the caudal plate
                    is edged with numerous short setae. The zoëae of hermit-crabs (fig. 30) have
                    simple antennules like those in the Brachyuran zoëae. The antennae bear a
                    scale-like appendage on the outside analogous to tlιat in the prawn. There are
                    only two pairs of well-developed natatory feet (maxillipeds), but the third pair
                    are present in the form of two-jointed rudimentary appendages destitute of
                    setae. The hinder border of the tail bears five pairs of setae.</p>
                <p>The zoëae of the shrimps and prawns agree closely with the Anomoura. They have a
                    small median eye between the large compound ones. The third pair of maxillipeds

                    one of these species the intermediate forms which lead from the nauplius to the
                    prawn have been discovered by Fritz Müller in a nearly continuous series <hi

                <p>After successive moults the nauplius gives place to the zoëa period, during which
                    the paired eyes, the segments of the thorax and abdomen, and the various
                    appendages are produced in budlike succession. The zoëa next passes into the
                    røysſs-stage; the antennae cease to serve for locomotory organs, and their place
                    is taken by the thoracic feet clothed with setae (fig. 34). The abdomen,
                    furnished with powerful muscles, jerks the animal through the water in a series
                    of lively jumps.</p>
                <p>In the case of those Crustacea in which the young, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mysis,</hi> are retained within the incubatory pouch of the parent after
                    quitting the egg, the larva emerges from the egg in a far more rudimentary and
                    destitute condition than in those genera in which no such protective arrangement
                    exists. Van Bernden, whose description of the development of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mtjsis</hi> is confirmed by Fritz Müller, mentions the very curious fact that
                    the first segment that makes its appearance is the tail. In other stalk-eyed
                    Crustacea the embryo has the ventral surface of the anterior and posterior
                    halves of the body folded together, and the dorsal surface forms the external
                    convexity of tl∙a young animal within the egg; but in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mysis</hi> the ventral surface is external and convex. The tail soon acquires
                    the furcate form characteristic of the zoëa of the prawn; two thick ensiform
                    appendages next make their appearance at the anterior end of the body, and
                    behind these a pair of <pb break="no"

                    At this immature stage of its development the egg-membrane bursts before any
                    internal organ, or even any tissue except the cells of the cutaneous layer, is
                    formed. The young animal may now be said to be in its nauplius-stage, but its
                    nauplius-skin resembles more nearly a second egg-membrane within which its
                    further development proceeds. The ten pairs of appendages of the cephalic and
                    thoracic divisions of the body make their appearance simultaneously, and at a
                    later period the five abdominal feet. Soon after the young <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mysis</hi> has cast its nauplius envelope, it leaves the brood-pouch of its
                    mother.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Squilla</hi><hi rend="italic">mantis</hi> the eggs do not
                    adhere to the abdominal feet of the parent (which in this genus are
                    branchiferous), but are (says Fritz Müller) deposited in the form of thin,
                    round, yellow plates within its submarine burrow. The spawn is consequently
                    difficult to procure, and quickly dies when removed from its natural
                    hatchingplace. In the embryo of <hi rend="italic">Squilla</hi> the heart is
                    short; the body is long and segmented, but without appendages; the tail is
                    bilobate, and there are indications of the rudiments of six pairs of limbs. If
                    it acquires more limbs before exclusion, the youngest larva must be on a par
                    with the youngest of <hi rend="italic">Euphausia</hi> observed by Claus. Only
                    two larval forms of <hi rend="italic">Squilla</hi> are mentioned by Fritz
                    Müller; the elder of these zoëa (fig. 35) resembles the mature <hi rend="italic"
                    >Squilla,</hi> particularly in the structure of the great raptorial thoracic
                    feet and of the last cephalic pair; but the six pairs of feet which follow these
                    are still wanting, although their somites are clearly seen. The abdomen shows
                    rudiments of four pairs of branchial feet and one or two pairs of biramose
                    natatory feet, but the tail has no appendages and still appears as a simple
                    lamina.</p>

                    have been placed in the Podophthalmia near to <hi rend="italic">Mysis.</hi> In
                    general aspect the adult animal presents the most larval and embryonic
                    characters, and might with propriety have been treated as a larval form, had not
                    Goodsir, and subsequently Kröyer, actually taken the young from the brood-pouch
                    of the parent. The antennae are very small, the thoracic feet are, inmost,
                    furnished with setae; in <hi rend="italic">Cuma</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alauna</hi> the abdominal segments are moniliform and destitute of appendages.
                    The caudal segment bears two long bifurcated styles. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bodotria</hi> (fig. 36) five of the abdominal somites bear finlets. The young
                    examined by Kröyer, taken from the brood-pouch of the female (which resembles
                    that in <hi rend="italic">Mysis),</hi> were already one-fourth the length of the
                    parent, which they resembled in every respect. Whether or not there is a
                    considerable development of the young of <hi rend="italic">Cïimaceae</hi> within
                    the brood-pouch of the parent is not certainly known. In the embryo the caudal
                    portion is bent upwards as in the Isopoda, and the last pair of thoracic feet
                    are wanting.</p>
                <p>The development of the Edriophthalmia, or sessile-eyed Crustacea, is more simple
                    than that of the stalk-eyed forms. In the “rock-slater,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ligia</hi> (fig. 37), the embryo is bent <hi rend="italic">upwards</hi> within
                    the egg, as in <hi rend="italic">Mysis,</hi> and has also, like <hi
                    rend="italic">Mysis,</hi> a larval membrane within which the young <hi
                    rend="italic">Ligia</hi> is developed. In <hi rend="italic">Mysis</hi> this
                    larval skin may be compared to a nauplius; in <hi rend="italic">Ligia,</hi>
                    however, it is destitute of appendages, and resembles a maggot with a long
                    simple tail (fig. 37). The dorsal surface of the young <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ligia</hi> is united to the larval skin a little behind the head. A foliaceous
                    appendage is produced at this point, but exists only for a short time, and
                    disappears before the young slater quits the brood-pouch of the mother. The
                    young animal, when it commences to take care of itself, resembles the parent,
                    save that it has only six, instead of seven pairs of ambulatory feet, and the
                    last thoracic somite is but slightly developed and is destitute of appendages.
                    The sexual peculiarities in this as in the young of other Crustacea are not
                    developed at this early period; thus the males lack the hand-like enlargements
                    of the anterior ambulatory feet, and the copula tory appendages are also
                    absent.</p>

                    development of this abundant freshwater Isopod. As in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ligia</hi> the embryo is bent upwards within the egg. It quits the egg in a
                    most imperfect state, more so, says Rathke, than any other articulated or
                    vertebrated animal. It is furnished in its earliest stages with two lateral
                    external appendages, which probably are homologous with the foliaceous appendage
                    observed by Fritz Müller at the back of the head in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ligia.</hi> These zoëal appendages are subsequently moulted. Moreover in the
                    young <hi rend="italic">Asellus</hi> there are only six leg-bearing segments,
                    and six, instead of seven, pairs of legs as in the adult. The curvature of the
                    embryo upwards, instead of downwards, seems to have been generally observed by
                    Rathke, Dohrn, Fritz Müller, and others. The larval skin is in some genera so
                    closely applied to the egg itself as possibly to be mistaken for an inner
                    egg-membrane. The absence of the last pair of thoracic feet seems also a
                    constant character; all the other limbs are usually well developed in the young
                    of normal Isopods; but in the remarkable and aberrant genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tanais</hi> (fig. 38) all the abdominal feet are wanting, but not the caudal
                    appendages; they make their appearance, however, simultaneously with the last
                    pair of the thoracic feet.</p>
                <p>Among the many interesting facts relative to the development of the Crustacea not
                    the least remarkable are the series of retrograde metamorphoses which certain
                    Isopods undergo as a consequence of their assuming a parasitic mode of life when
                    adult. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Cymothoa∙,</hi> or “Fish-lice,” which in the
                    adult state live parasitic on fishes, clinging firmly by means of their short
                    recurved hook-like feet, arc lively free-swimming Crustacea in the larval state.
                    Still greater is the metamorphosis which the adult female under goes in <hi
                    rend="italic">Bopyrus</hi> (fig. 39), <hi rend="italic">Phryxus</hi> (fig. 40),
                    <hi rend="italic">Ione, Gyge,</hi> and several other allied genera, which are
                    parasitic on crabs and lobsters, taking up their abode within the branchial
                    cavity. The adult is usually quite destitute of eyes; the antennae are
                    rudimentary; the broad and flat body is frequently unsymmetrically developed in
                    consequence of the confined space in which it lives; its segments are more or
                    less amalgamated together; the feet are stunted, and the abdominal appendages
                    transformed into foliaceous or highly branched gills. The males are diminutive
                    in size, but usually they have their eyes, antennae, and feet better preserved
                    than the females; the abdomen is, however, rudimentary, and not unfrequently
                    altogether destitute of appendages.</p>
                <p>Among the Isopoda, in the remarkable genera <hi rend="italic">Cryptothiria,

                    lower order, viz., the Cirripedia.</p>
                <p>The history of <hi rend="italic">Cryptothiria pygmaea</hi> (Rathke, sp.) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cryptoniscus planaridides</hi> (F. Müller) is perhaps still more
                    remarkable. Professor Bell had long ago noticed the frequent presence of a
                    singular parasite on the inner surface of the abdomen of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Portunus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Carcinus</hi> on our coasts, having <hi

                    immature eggs. This had keen described by Rathke in 1841 as an Entozoarian, but
                    has since been proved by its transformations to be a Cirripede, and was named
                    <hi rend="italic">Peltogaster.</hi> In 1858 Lilljeborg found what he deemed to
                    be a female <hi rend="italic">Peltogaster</hi> with an egg-sac; but a careful
                    dissection led to the discovery that another parasite of a higher order, namely
                    a <hi rend="italic">Cryptothiria,</hi> had become <hi rend="italic">parasitic
                    upon the parasite.</hi> The most curious part of this super-parasitic history
                    is, that the roots of <hi rend="italic">Sacculina</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peltogaster</hi> (two forms of rhizocephalous Cirripedia parasitic on crabs and
                    hermit-crabs) seem constantly to be made use of by two parasitic Isopods,
                    namely, a <hi rend="italic">Bopyrus</hi> and the before-mentioned <hi
                    rend="italic">Cryptoniscus planaridides.</hi> These take up their abode beneath
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sacculina,</hi> and cause it to die away by intercepting
                    the nourishment conveyed by the roots; the roots, however, continue to grow,
                    even without the <hi rend="italic">Sacculina,</hi> and frequently attain an

                    the head being destitute of eyes or antennae; the thorax has become an irregular
                    inarticulate sac, beset with enormous brood laminae; the long vermiform and
                    extremely mobile abdomen has sword-shaped legs; and swelling out above it in a
                    globular form, as if in a hernial sac, the heart lies at the base of the first
                    segment. The young of this singular parasite closely resembles that of <hi

                <p>The embyro of the Amphipoda can be distinguished from that of the Isopoda at a
                    very early period; the former being bent downwards with the dorsal surface
                    external, whilst the latter is bent backwards with the ventral surface external.
                    The embryo in all the genera which have been examined is attached on the
                    anterior part of the back to the inner egg membrane by a peculiar
                    structure—reminding one of the union of the young Isopoda with the larval
                    membrane, and of the unpaired “adherent organ” on the nape of the Cladocera, so

                <p>The metamorphosis of the young Amphipod after it quits the egg seems greatly
                    reduced and simplified, for before quitting the egg it acquires its full number

                    “Even peculiarities in the structure of the limbs, so far as they are common to

                    amalgamated together, or where one or more segments are deficient in the adult,
                    we find the same fusion and the same deficiencies in the young animals taken
                    from the brood-pouch of their m )ther. The development of the Ilyperiidae, an
                    oceanic group of Amphipods found only in the gill-cavities of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Medusx,</hi> is very exceptional and remark ιble. Thus, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hyperia</hi> the youngest larvae, taken by Fritz Muller from the
                    brood-pouch of the mother, already possessed the whole of the thιracic feet; on
                    the other hand, those of the abdomen were not as yet developed. All the feet are
                    at first simple, but soon become converted into highly denticulated prehensile
                    feet. In this state they remain for a very long time,—the abdominal appendages
                    growing into powerful natatory organs, whilst the eyes, at first wanting or very
                    minute, expand into large hemispheres occupying the entire lateral, and even
                    encroaching upon the dorsal anil frontal walls of the head. The females <hi
                    rend="italic">(bi</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">per id)</hi> are
                    distinguished by a very broad thorax, and the males <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Leslrigonufi)</hi> by their long antenne. The youngest larvae c ιnnot swim,
                    but are provided with chelate feet (as shown by Spence Bate) by which they cling
                    firmly to the swimming-laminae of their host. The feet of the adults are simple,
                    but they are then excellent swimmers, and are not unfrequently met with free in
                    the open sea. The diversity in structure of the antennae in the adult male and
                    female Hyρeriidae is so great as to have led naturalists to place them in
                    separate genera or even families; but this difference is developed only when the
                    animals are full-grown. Up to this period the young of both sexes resemble the
                    females. In the male shore-hoppers <hi rend="italic">(Orchestid)</hi> the second
                    pair of the anterior feet is provided with a powerful hand (fig. 45), as in the
                    majority of Amphipoda, but quite different from the fem ιle; the young
                    nevertheless resemble the female. This is also the case in the adult male in <hi
                    rend="italic">Limulus,</hi> in which the second pair of appendages (antennae)
                    are peculiarly modified (see 3ct in fig. 12 above); but in the young male they
                    exactly resemble those of the adult female. According to Spence Bate and Fritz
                    Müller, this second pair of antennae are absent in the females of <hi
                    rend="italic">Βrachyscelus,</hi> although the male possesses them, like other
                    Amphipcds.</p>
                <p>In the foregoing brief sketch of the evolution of the young in the Malaccstraca,
                    it will be perceived that certain lines of development are followed, but these
                    are subject to great diversity, and often vary greatly in the same order.<note

                    high tides. It comes up to near high-water mark, spawning under water; thus the
                    eggs are daily exposed to the sun’s warmth for a short time at low water. Great
                    numbers arrive in pairs, the male grasping the sides of the shield of the female
                    with his strong and peculiarly modified chelate antennae. The eggs are deposited
                    by the female in a hole in the sand, and are fecundated by the male after
                    deposition, and are then left to hatch. Only one other similar case is on
                    record, namely, that of the common freshwater cray-fish, in which, according to
                    Μ. Chantran, the eggs are fecundated after expulsion from the oviducts. The eggs
                    occupy from fifty to seventy days in hatching, according to the favourable or
                    unfavourable conditions under which they are deposited; some which Dr Lock wood
                    set aside in a jar of sea-water in a dark place hatched after 350 days!</p>
                <p>The egg has two membranes, a dense inelastic chorion and an inner elastic
                    protoderm.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> Dohrn calls
                    the inner membrane in the egg of Limulus the “chorion” and the outer the
                    exochorion, but Packard’s term “protoderm” appears pre!erable for the
                    former.</p></note> This chorion remains entire so long as development is
                    arrested or is sluggish, but as soon as the embryo increases in size, the tough
                    chorion splits asunder, and the inner elastic protoderm enlarges, becomes dense,
                    and vicariously fulfils the duties of the former (fig. 46).</p>
                <p>A similar splitting of the external egg-membrane has been noticed in <hi
                    rend="italic">A pus.</hi> Fritz Müller points out that in some Isopoda (as for
                    instance <hi rend="italic">PhHoscia)</hi> the larval skin is not only without
                    any folds or sac-like diverticula, but is closely applied to the egg-membrane.
                    This second eggmembrane in <hi rend="italic">Limulus</hi> may perhaps therefore
                    correspond to this first larval skin. Certainly, when the embryo first appears,
                    its position is the same as in <hi rend="italic">Asellus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ligia, Philoscia,</hi> and other Isopcds, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> with its
                    ventral sur face convex (figs. 47 and 48). In its first stage the larval <hi
                    rend="italic">Limulus</hi> has six bud-like indications on each side of the
                    mesial line, where the paired <hi rend="italic">cephalic</hi> appendages will be
                    developed (fig. 47). In later stages (figs. 48-52) we have first two, then more,
                    up to six pairs, of <hi rend="italic">thoracic</hi> natatory feet (which in the
                    adult become branchiferous), and traces of as many as nine post-cephalic
                    somites, but the last three never attain appendages. As the young <hi
                    rend="italic">Limulus</hi> increases in size, the yolk gradually becomes
                    absorbed, and the larva assumes the position of an Amphipod in the egg, having
                    its dorsal surface convex, instead of its ventral, which is now concave (fig.
                    52). There appears to be no stage seen in larval <hi rend="italic">Limulus</hi>
                    which can be compared with the nauplius stage of <hi rend="italic">Apus</hi> (as

                    perforate, and lastly separated into linear processes.” It seems more probable
                    that the margin of the head-shield was originally digitate, then gradually
                    closed up, leaving only perforations along the sutures in some, and only plicae
                    in others. We have an analogous case in <hi rend="italic">Haliotis,

                    in which a slit becomes partially or wholly closed up, leaving perforations at

                    and these suffice to render fertile several generations of females. The females
                    let their eggs fall to the bottom of the water, where they remain until hatched
                    by the sun’s warmth. The eggs of <hi rend="italic">Apus</hi> occupy from two to

                    form (4 in fig. 57). The nauplius, being short-bodied, does not display those

                    rather by a series of jerks like the adult <hi rend="italic">Cyclops.</hi> At

                    their appearance or their form. All the feet are of the same pattern, and
                    resemble the maxillae of the higher Crustacea.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Of the developmental history of the Ostracoda but little is known. Zenker states

                    the two following pairs being bifurcate. The eye is single, and the labrum and
                    mouth already occupy their permanent positions. The hinder body is short, the
                    abdominal segments not being yet developed. In subsequent moults these posterior
                    segments appear, and new limbs sprout forth. In the second stage a fourth pair
                    of extremities is added; these are the future maxillae; then follow three new
                    pairs of limbs, the maxillae, and two anterior pairs of natatory feet. The three
                    anterior pairs of appendages still represent rowing-feet. At the next moult the
                    first cyclops-stage is arrived at, when there is a resemblance to the adult in
                    the structure of the an <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> ennae and buccal organs,
                    but the number of body-segments and appendages is still much less than in the
                    parent. Only the rudiments of the third and fourth pairs of natatory feet are
                    seen, and the body is made up of an oval cephalothorax, the second, third, and
                    fourth thoracic segments, and an elongated terminal joint. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cgclo-pidae</hi> the posterior antennae have lost their secondary
                    branch, and the mandibles have completely thrown off the previously existing
                    character of natatory feet; whilst in other families these appendages are
                    persistent, although more or less altered. Many of the parasitic Copepoda do not
                    pass beyond this stage of free development. Such forms as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lernanthropus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chondr acanthus</hi> never acquire the
                    third and fourth pairs of limbs, nor does the fifth thoracic somite separate
                    from the abdomen. Others, such as <hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >htheres,</hi> even fall to a still lower grade, by the subsequent 1 J3s of the
                    two pairs of natatory feet. But all free Copepoda and most of the parasitic
                    Crustacea pass through a longer or shorter series of stages of development, in
                    which the limbs acquire a higher degree of division into joints in continuous
                    sequence, the posterior pairs of feet are developed, and the last thoracic
                    segment and the different abdominal segments are successively separated from the
                    common terminal portion (Claus). Some parasitic Copepods, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Achtheres</hi><hi rend="italic">percarum,</hi> certainly quit the
                    <hi rend="italic">egg</hi> like the rest in the nauplius-stage; the oval
                    astomatous body bears two pairs of simple rowing feet, and behind these are two
                    inflations marking the third pair, each having a long seta. Beneath this
                    nauplius-skin a very different larva lies concealed, which in a few hours bursts
                    its clumsy envelope, and makes its appearance in a form which agrees both in the
                    segmentation of its body and the development of its extremities with the first
                    cyclops-stage. The entire series of nauplius-stages which are passed through by
                    the free Copepods are in this case completely overleapt.</p>
                <p>Although the parasitic species of Copepoda are all more or less permanently fixed
                    when adult, they pass their youthful stages as freely locomotive larvae. To this
                    rule there is a singular exception in the genus <hi rend="italic">Caligus.</hi>
                    The young animal (described by Burmeister as a peculiar genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chalimufi)</hi> lies at anchor upon a fish by means of a cable springing from
                    its forehead, and having its extremity firmly seated in the skin of the fish.
                    When sexual maturity is attained the cable is cut, and the adult <hi

                    captured swimming freely in the sea (Fritz Müller).</p>
                <p>The animals belonging to the last division comprise two orders, the Rhizocephala
                    and the Cirripedia. They have long been kept distinct from the Crustacea, and,
                    together with various parasitic forms of Copepoda, whose developmental history
                    w∙as not known, classed as Epizoa and Cirripedia.</p>
                <p>By later zoologists the Rhizocephala have been placed with the Paecilopoda, but
                    as this division includes many genera which prove to be merely parasitic forms
                    of</p>
                <p>Copepoda, it will be more convenient to separate them. All the animals of this
                    last division, which for convenience wo would designate under the general name
                    of Anchoracephala, are attached when adult;—in the Cirripedia by means of cement

                <p>The nauplii of the Anchoracepha- 11 are distinguished from the Copepoda by
                    possessing a d)rsal shield or ca-rapxc3, which sometimes, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Sacculina purpurea,</hi> projects far beyond the body all round.
                    They a’re also farther distinguished by possessing a pair of so-called
                    “olfactory filaments,” which spring directly from the head. These filaments, or
                    horns of the carapace (which are interpreted as the second pair of antennae by
                    Darwin), are believed by Fritz Müller to be the homologue of the so-called
                    “green gland,” which opens at the end of a conical process at the base of the
                    inferior antennae in the Decapoda, and of the conical process, with an efferent
                    duct traversing it, seen on the inferior antennae of the Amphipoda.</p>
                <p>Tue abdomen of the young Cirripede is produced into a long tail-like furcate
                    extremity, that of the young in Rhizocephala into a movable caudal fork.</p>
                <p>The young Cirripedes have a mouth, stomach, &lt;fcc., and their posterior pairs
                    of limbs are fitted for organs of prehension and mtnducation. In the young of
                    Rhizocephala all these organs are wanting. The young Cirripede, having to
                    undergo several moults as a nauplius, is provided with organs to sustain its
                    life. The young Rhizocephalon being astomatoιs, cannot sustain life in its
                    nauplius state for long, and must therefore more rapidly pass through its
                    transformitions. They both at length arrive at an equally ast imitons
                    p;¢pa-stage. In this stage we see the young animιl with its carapace folded
                    together like a bivalved shell; the foremost limbs become transformed into very
                    peculiar adherent feet, and the two folle wing pairs, like the frontal horns,
                    are cast off with the nauplius-skin. Behind these are six pairs of powerful
                    biramose nιtatory feet, with long setae and two short setigerous caudal
                    appendages. The young pupae of the Rhizocephala and Cirripedia agree in every
                    particular, save that the latter possesses a pair of composite eyes; sometimes
                    also traces of the frontal horns seem to persist.</p>
                <p>When the proper time arrives the pupae of the Cirripedia attach themselves by
                    means of their prehensile antennae to rocks, shells, turtles, cetacea,
                    drift-wood, ships, &amp;c.; the carapace becomes converted into the peculiar
                    sessile-shell of the <hi rend="italic">Balanus,</hi> or the pedunculated <hi
                    rend="italic">Lepus;</hi> the natatory feet grow into long cirri by which
                    nourishment is whirled to the mouth, now open and furnished with mandibles and
                    maxillae. The pupae of Rhizocephala in like manner attach themselves to the
                    abdomen of crabs, <hi rend="italic">Porcdlanae,</hi> and hermit-crabs; but they
                    remain astomatous, lose all their limbs completely, and appear as sausage-like,
                    sack-shaped, or discoidal excrescences upon their host, filled with ova (figs.
                    82 and 83); <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the point of attachment closed tubes,
                    ramifying like roots, sink deep into the interior of the host, twisting around
                    the intestine, or are diffused among the sac-like tubes of the liver. The only
                    manifesta tions of life which persist in this most retrogressively metamorphosed
                    Crustacean are powerful contractions of the roots and alternate expansion and
                    contraction of the body, causing water to flow into the brood-cavity, to be
                    again expelled through a wide orifice (Fritz Müller).</p>
                <p>Darwin has recorded various anomalous Cases of development in the Cirripedia;
                    amongst others, that of <hi rend="italic">Cryptophialus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >minutus</hi> (which forms a separate section Abdominalia, Darwin), parasitic in

                    elliptical, becomes broader anteriorly, then acquires three club-shaped horns,
                    one at each anterior angle and one behind. Subsequently the posterior horn
                    disappears, and the adherent feet may be recognized within the anterior ones.
                    From this “egg-like larva” the pupa is directly produced. Its carapace is but
                    slightly compressed laterally, and is hairy as in <hi rend="italic">Saccubna
                    purpurea;</hi> the adherent feet are large, the natatory feet wanting, as are
                    also the corresponding cirri in the adult animal. Mr Spence Bate mentions a
                    similar case in a Rhizocephalon, in which the nauplius-stage is overleaped and
                    the young quits the eggs as a pupa-form larva.</p>

                    we have already seen, the young Crustacean, on quitting the egg, usually

                    considerable variation even among closely-allied forms. Eventually, whether by a
                    direct or an indirect route, a form is attained in all, which, save in size,
                    closely agrees with the adult.</p>
                <p>Amongst the Insecta the larva usually undergoes repeated moults during its

                    many of the higher forms takes place annually with great regularity until the
                    growth is completed, which in many species is not the case before the animal is
                    many years old. This is proved by the extent to which the size increases at each
                    moult, compared with the difference between the young and the old animal; and it
                    is evident that after the growth has reached its maximum, the crust ceases to be
                    changed, from the fact which I have seen in several instances, as in the common
                    crab, the lobster, and some others, where the carapace of the still living
                    creature was the seat of barnacles so large, that several years must probably

                    bell-animalcules depend on the moulting of their carapace as their only chance
                    of surviving and escaping these prolific parasites.</p></note></p>
                <p>In casting its-shell a crab not only parts with every joint and plate of its
                    limbs and carapace, of its long and slender antennae, its external eyestalks,
                    the plates of the tail, the appendages of the mouth, the lining of its gills,
                    but even its stomach, with the gastric teeth and the slender apode ∙ mata, which
                    give support to the muscles of the limbs and body—so that when the crab has
                    escaped from its old suit, the cast-off shell seems nearly as perfect as the
                    animal itself</p>
                <p>When exuviating, the crab and lobster both escape from their old shells by a line
                    of dehiscence which opens between the posterior border of the carapace and its
                    union with the abdomen. Professor Bell also states that in the great crab <hi

                    the carapace divides at the junction of the epimera with the dorsal piece or

                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Limulus</hi> the carapace splits all round the anterior

                    >Limulus</hi> sheds its shell five to six times during the fii¾t year, and

                <p>Sir John Dalyell, Mr Couch, Mr Gosse, Mr Spence Bate, Mr Warrington, and others,
                    have given excellent accounts of the process of moulting of various Crustacea.
                    An accurate observer, Mr Harper, states<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Glimpses of Ocean Life</hi>
                    (1860).</p></note> that he confined six small specimens of the common shore-crab
                    <hi rend="italic">(Carcinus</hi><hi rend="italic">mamas)</hi> in separate
                    glasses, and fed them daily, until one of them showed that something was amiss
                    by refusing food. Soon after it cast its shell, an operation which only occupied
                    five minutes. When very young this crab moults frequently. The same author
                    registered the dates, and preserved the exuviae of one which moulted on April
                    11, 1858, andon May 22, July 3, August 30, and September 26 of the same year;
                    the acceleration of the last moult is attributed to the creature having been fed
                    daily, “like a prize beast,” on purpose to try the effect on its growth. Some of
                    these little crabs had lost part of their limbs, but after a moult new limbs
                    appeared of very diminutive size; after a second moult each new limb had
                    increased to one-half as large as the rest, and in the third moult it had
                    reached to its proper bulk and form. Hermit-crabs shed their hard shell before
                    pulling off the exuviae of the tail; their increase at each moult is much less
                    rapid than in the common crab. Prawns exuviate more frequently. Mr Warrington
                    saw the change occur with much regularity every twelve days in the summer
                    season. With the exception then of certain parasitic forms of Crustacea, which,
                    like the Rhizocephala, have undergone such a complete retrograde metamorphism
                    that no trace of articulations or appendages remain, all the Crustacea
                    periodically exuviate their dermal covering, whether calcareous, chitinous, or
                    membranaceous. In the Cirripedia it would not be possible to exuviate the
                    adherent shell of the adult <hi rend="italic">Balanus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >or</hi> the peduncle of <hi rend="italic">Lepas</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scalpellum,</hi> but, even in this aberrant division, the lining membrane of
                    the shell and the many-jointed cirri are regularly moulted.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> The frequency with which they exuviate,
                    together with the durability of the cast-off integuments, explains the
                    astonishing masses of exuviae which Mr C. W. Peach observed annually off
                    tbecoastof Cornwall, especially in the months of April and May; but he has seen
                    quantities also in September. He could easily have filled several quart-measures
                    with them (Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Balanidae,</hi> p. 157).</p><p>In
                    connection with the exuviation of the Cirripedia Darwin mentions a most
                    remarkable fact <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.</hi> p. 15): “In regard to the
                    fernab organs, the ovarian tubes and caeca inosculate together; there are rae
                    oviducts; the ova, connected together by membrane, and so forming the ovigerous
                    lamellae, become exposed <hi rend="italic">by the exuviations of the lining
                    tunic</hi> of the carapace or sack, and by the formation of a new tunic on the
                    underside of these lamellae,·—a process unknown in other
                    Crustaceans.”</p></note></p>
                <p>It has long been known that Crustacea possess the power of voluntarily casting
                    their limbs, and of restoring such as have thus been lost by the animal’s will
                    or by accident.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> It is a
                    well-authenticated fact that the roll of thunder and the discharge of artillery
                    over that part of the sea where lobsters resort will cause them to throw off
                    their great claws. The same effect is also produced by the infliction of any
                    sudden injury. If <hi rend="italic">Porcellana platycheles</hi> be seized by the
                    claw it immediately casts it off and beata a retreat without it.</p></note> If
                    one or more distant phalanges of a limb be torn off, the animal has the power to
                    throw off the remaining part of the limb also. This separation always occurs
                    near the basal extremity of the first phalanx. When the limb is thrown off, the
                    blood-vessels and nerve retract, thus leaving a small cavity; from this the germ
                    of the future leg springs, and is at first seen as a nucleated cell. A cicatrix
                    forms over the raw surface caused by the separation, which afterwards forms a
                    sheath for the young leg.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    of the Trilobita among these may be looked upon as inappropriate. If, however,
                    we admit that the Trilobita had (as there seem good grounds for allowing) true
                    special locomotory appendages other than gill-feet or jaws, as in the
                    Malacostraca generally, then we submit that they are appropriately classed. The
                    main characteristic of the Malacostraca seems to be, not so much the possession
                    of twenty-one segments, an inheritance really common to the whole class, but the
                    presence of the seven anterior (cephalic) appendages especially set apart for
                    the senses and nutrition, with separate post-cephalic organs of
                    locomotion;—whereas the peculiarity of the Entomostraca seems to be that the
                    seven anterior (cephalic) organs are not specially set apart as organs of sense
                    and nutrition, but are employed in nearly all the class as the chief locomotory
                    organs, the posterior feet being branchial or ovarian lamellae, or altogether
                    want· ing. The writer ventures to propose therefore, instead of</p>
                <p>Explanation.—The letters at the top of each column represent the several orders
                    and sub-orders of Crustacea,—one family of the Arachnida, the Scorpionidae,
                    being placed beside the Eurypterida to show its range in time and probable
                    derivation from the Crustacea. The vertical lines show the actual range in time,
                    the black dots denote the strata in which remains of each order have been met
                    with. The curved lines, uniting order to order, are intended to show the
                    probable evolution of the class fron a common great ancestor; but numerous as
                    are the indications of affinities afforded by the Crustacea, the group is too
                    ancient to be certainly traced back in time to a common parent; even the lowest
                    Cambrian rocks have yielded evidence of two orders, namely, the Trilobita and
                    Ostracoda, whilst the Middle Cambrian furnishes a Phyllopod Crustacean
                    (Hymenocaris). As the branches of this genealogical tree of the Crustacea are
                    not arranged in a circular manner, they cannot of course be made to show the

                    sugar-cane, rice, or maize. The <hi rend="italic">Gecarcinus</hi><hi

                    land-crabs, but deposit their eggs, when near the time of hatching, in the
                    freshwater streams, the banks of which they are known to frequent. Many of the
                    land-crabs have the chelate limbs largely developed, usually more strongly so in
                    the males, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the male of <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">very large)</hi> always holds it closely pressed against, its
                    body. Vast numbers of landcrabs are met with on the sea-shore and among rocks
                    along the coast, especially in the warmer temperate and sub-tropi cal regions of
                    the earth. Of the genus <hi rend="italic">Thelphusa</hi> one freshwater species
                    ( 7 <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi>. <hi rend="italic">fluviatilis)</hi> is a
                    native of the rivers of southern Europe. It is eaten by Catholics during Lent,
                    and hence called “Lenten crab.” This crab is also common to the rivers of
                    India.</p>
                <p>Although some land-crabs are certainly vegetarians in diet, the class, as a
                    whole, are carrion feeders, greedily devouring animal matter even in a

                    itself to the smooth inner lip of the shell, so that when the hermit is feeding,
                    the mouth of the anemone is just below that of the crab, and ready to receive
                    any fragment he may let fall. When the <hi rend="italic">Adamsia</hi> is very
                    young, less than half-an-inch in diameter, its outline is circular; but as it
                    grows older it expands laterally, forming two lobes, which creep along the mouth
                    of the shell, until they meet and coalesce on its outer lip. The base of the
                    cloak-anemone is then perforated, and through this opening the hermit puts out
                    or retracts his head and legs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    caudal plates are also more rudimentary. In <hi rend="italic">Pagurus</hi> (fig.
                    67), the abdomen is naked, only a mere trace of the shelly plates remaining. In

                    to the same cause, viz., disuse of the abdomen and caudal fin for natation, and
                    to their constant habit of living in concealment.</p>

                    in the order Decapoda. is here both shorter and narrower, and the body less
                    complet. Taking <hi rend="italic">Squilla</hi> (fig. 71) as an example, the
                    segments are much less coalesced than in the lobster. Those bearing the eyes and
                    the antennules are readily separable from the front of the head, and are not
                    covered by the carapace, which only conceals eight segments, whereas in the
                    lobster it covers fourteen, and in the crab twenty-one. The gills are borne by
                    the abdominal swimming feet, free and uncovered. The first pair of thoracic
                    limbs are developed into a pair of large and formidable claws, the terminal

                    noticed in 1843 by Mr Harry Goodsir, who obtained them from the Firth of Forth.
                    They closely resemble Copepoda in aspect, and might readily be confounded with

                    Podophthalmia we pass now to the sessile-eyed Edriophthalmia, in which the eyes
                    with one exception are fixed immovably on the surface of the head. As in the
                    higher forms, the eyes are compound, consisting in the young of some ten or
                    twelve lenses only, but in the adult of as many as sixty to eighty. In nearly
                    all, the body is distinctly divisible into three parts—the head usually very
                    small, the seven thoracic segments well and evenly developed, the abdominal
                    somites more or less coalesced. The general conformity in size and function of
                    the thoracic somites and their seven pairs of legs characterizes the majority of
                    the Isopoda. These legs are nearly uniform, and are fitted either for walking or
                    for swimming, or as powerful hooklike organs to enable them to adhere to the
                    fishes on which they are parasitic. The branchiae in this order are transferred
                    from the thoracic legs to the abdominal appendages, which are converted into
                    special organs of respiration.</p>

                    antennae are inserted beneath and within the margin of the head-shield;
                    apparently it does not roll itself into a ball.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Sphaeromidae</hi> are very littoral in their habits; they
                    range from the equatorial latitudes to the colder temperate zones, but are not
                    found in Polar regions. They are vegetable feeders, and some (like <hi
                    rend="italic">Limnoria)</hi> are guilty of destroying timber. When molested or
                    alarmed they roll themselves up into a ball. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sphaeromidae</hi> present many points of analogy, if not of affinity, with the
                    extinct Trilobites.</p>
                <p>In this order we find the <hi rend="italic">Limnoria terebrans</hi> (or the
                    “gribble,” as it is called by the fishermen). It is one of the most destructive
                    creatures, attacking all woodwork below tidemarks; the only wood which it cannot
                    destroy is teak. Although its ravages had gone on for ages, it was only made
                    known to the scientific world and described by Dr Leach in 1811.</p>
                <p>In the aberrant genus <hi rend="italic">Tanais</hi> (fig. 38) the first pair of
                    thoracic legs are converted into chelae, and the head-shield is covered by a
                    carapace, abundantly traversed by currents of blood, beneath which a stream of
                    water passes, maintained as in the zoëae and adult Decapoda by a flabelliform
                    appendage of the second pair of maxillae, which is wanting in all other
                    Edriophthalmia. The abdominal feet, which in other Isopoda act as respiratory
                    organs, are simple natatory feet in <hi rend="italic">Tanais.</hi> These
                    characters, together with the pedunculated eyes and the great chelate hands,
                    give to <hi rend="italic">Tanais</hi> a very decapod-like aspect (see fig.

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Idoteidae</hi> contain representatives of some of the

                    >Trilobita.</hi> —So long ago as 1821 Audouin placed the Trilobites with the
                    Isopoda, whilst Macleay assigned them a distinct order between the Isopoda and
                    the Phyllopoda. Later researches by Milne-Edwards and others have caused the
                    Trilobita to be referred to the Entomostraca, on account of the very variable
                    number of body-rings observed in the several genera (from six to twenty-six)
                    evidencing a much lower type of structure than the Isopoda, in which the thorax
                    is composed of seven free and movable segments with a head-shield and anchylosed
                    caudal somites. Moreover, until the discovery of presumed ambulatory appendages

                    previously observed was the hypostome or lip-plate. There seems, however, no
                    good reason to urge against the conclusion that the Trilobita were an earlier
                    and more generalized type of Crustacea, from which the later and more
                    specialized Isopoda have arisen,—a view which the writer is glad to say he
                    shares with the distinguished carcinologists, Professor Dana<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> Professor Dana writes, “The

                    Entomostraca. Yet they show an aberrant character in two important points.
                    First, the segments of the body are multiplied much beyond the normal number, as
                    in the Phyllopqda among the Entomostraca; and Agassiz has remarked upon this as
                    evidence of that larval analogy which characterizes in many cases the earlier
                    forms of animal life. In the second place, the size of the body far transcends
                    the ordinary Isopodan limit. This might be considered a mark of superiority; but
                    it is more probably the reverse. It is an enlargement beyond the normal and most
                    effective size, due to the same principle of vegetative growth which accords
                    with the (occasional) inordinate multiplication of the segments in the body” <hi

                <p>We thus perceive that the number of those forms of Trilobites which have a great
                    excess of <hi rend="italic">free segments</hi> is not large when we consider the
                    group as a whole.</p>
                <p>In the higher and more specialized forms of Isopoda of the present day, we do not
                    find the number of segments absolutely adhered to without any variations; on the
                    contrary, we constantly meet with individuals in which more or fewer segments
                    are welded together, so as to conceal the normal number of seven thoracic
                    somites between the head and the abdomen. Such being the case, we cannot be
                    surprised to find considerable variation in a group like the Trilobita, which,
                    if they really are the remote ancestors of the recent Isopoda, must, according
                    to the views suggested above, be the prototypes of the larvae rather than of the

                <p>In his researches among the Trilobites of Bohemia Μ. Barrande has discovered
                    forms which, there is every reason to believe, exhibit (as he has so admirably
                    shown in his great work) the gradual development of the Trilobite from the
                    earliest form on quitting the egg to the adult. We give seven of the earliest
                    stages of <hi rend="italic">Trinucleus</hi><hi rend="italic">ornatus</hi> and

                <p>One most striking feature in the Trilobita is the remarkable development of their
                    compound eyes (fig. 11), a subject ably discussed and illustrated long ago by Dr
                    Buckland in his <hi rend="italic">Bridgewater Treatise</hi> (1836).</p>
                <p>Perhaps the eye of the Trilobite may be best compared with that of <hi

                <p>We have an analogous development of the organs of vision amongst some of the

                    “facial suture” in the head-shield of the Trilobita, which separates the lateral
                    genal portion from the glabella, was for a long time considered as peculiar to
                    Trilobites and <hi rend="italic">Limuli,</hi> but C. Spence Bate has ably shown
                    that it homologizes with the suture which traverses the inferior surface in the

                    group among the Edriophthalmia, parallel with the Macreura among the
                    Podophthalmia, whilst the Isopoda may represent the broad and flattened
                    Brachyura, the <hi rend="italic">Caprellae</hi> offering a kind of parallelism
                    with <hi rend="italic">Squilla</hi> and its allies. As in the Isopoda, the head
                    is small and carries only the organs of sense and nutrition; the sessile
                    eyes<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> The outer

                    the eyes appear to be wanting; but this is probably caused by the absence of any
                    colouring pigment. In <hi rend="italic">Niphargus</hi> the eyes are obsolete or
                    rudimentary. In <hi rend="italic">A mpelisca</hi> they appear like four simple
                    organs resembling the ocelli of true insects (Spence Bate and Westwood, <hi

                    >Thaumops),</hi> covering the entire sides of the head.</p>
                <p>The seven thoracic segments, constituting the middle-body, are well developed and
                    nearly equal in size; all the segments are compressed laterally as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Palaemonidae.</hi></p>
                <p>The two anterior pairs of the seven thoracic legs (see Th. 8, 9 in fig. 1), which
                    are jaw-feet in the Podophthalmia, are here developed into arm-like legs, having
                    an enlarged penultimate joint or hand, against which the seventh and terminal
                    joint doubles back, like a finger against the palm, and so forms a prehensile
                    organ similar in form to the claws in the <hi rend="italic">Crangonidae.</hi>
                    The best-formed claws are seen in <hi rend="italic">Orchestia Darwinii</hi>
                    (fig. 45), and in <hi rend="italic">Melita exilii</hi> (fig. 76).</p>
                <p>The ova are nourished within a pouch formed by a series of foliaceous plates
                    attached to the four anterior pairs of legs; except in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hyperiidae,</hi> which are parasitic on Medusae, as already mentioned. The
                    males in the Amphipoda closely resemble the females (save in those forms in
                    which the hands are enlarged in the male), but contrary to the general rule the
                    females are much smaller than the males.</p>
                <p>This division, like the preceding one, has its terrestrial representatives, <hi
                    rend="italic">Talitrus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Orchestia,</hi> the

                    turn they afford a repast to the ring-plover, the common wood-pigeon, and
                    numerous shore-birds which rapidly devour them, as well as some coleopterous

                    to conclude they are as truly indigenous to these underground water-courses in
                    the Chalk, Oolite, or Carboniferous Limestone, as are the numerous species of
                    blind Crustacea met with in the waters flowing through the Mammoth Cave,
                    Kentucky.</p>
                <p>A curious subdivision of Amphipods is formed by the <hi rend="italic">Podocerides
                    (Amphithoë</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Podocerus),</hi> all the species of which
                    invariably construct nests in which they take shelter and nourish their young.
                    These abodes are built of wood or stones, mud, clay, &lt;fcc., united together
                    by a cement excreted by the animals themselves. Some closely resemble miniature
                    birds’-nests, others are in the form of tubes.</p>
                <p>This division includes another most destructive woodborer, the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Finally, we come to the minute aberrant forms of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dulichiidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Caprellidae</hi> (fig. 78), in which the
                    body is reduced to a slender elongated cylindrical form, the· thorax having only
                    about six somites (one being absent and two soldered together), and the abdomen
                    being quite rudimentary. They have long antennae and feet, all fitted for
                    climbing and holding on by. Their singular appearance has caused them to be
                    called “spectre shrimps,”</p>
                <p>With these aberrant forms are associated the <hi rend="italic">Cyamidae</hi>
                    (fig. 79), a family which affix themselves by their strong recurved legs to the
                    rough portions of the Cetacea upon which they feed. The feet are all prehensile;
                    the third and fourth somites bear the branched or simple branchiae. The abdomen,
                    as in the <hi rend="italic">Caprellidae,</hi> is rudimentary; the eggs and young
                    are sheltered by four broad lamellar plates, developed from the appendages on
                    the under side of the body of the female. Spence Bate and Westwood have figured
                    five species. They approach in many respects to the Pycnogonidae, which also
                    live parasitic on Cetacea (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Arachnida,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    276-77), but we must not attempt to discuss their affinities here. A fragment of
                    a presuined Amphipodous Crustacean has been described by the writer from the
                    Upper Silurian (the <hi rend="italic">Necrcgammarus Salweyi)</hi> another, the

                    forms occur in the lithographic stone of Bavaria. The world-wide distribution of
                    the Amphipoda accords well with their range in time, which was as great or even
                    greater than the Isopoda.</p>

                    remarkable type of crustacean closely related to the extinct Eurypterida. Found
                    living in the seas of China and Japan and on the north-east coast of North
                    America, it exemplifies a peculiar and most ancient order, the affinities of
                    which are not at first readily recognized because its nearest allies have passed
                    away. The head-shield is enormously expanded so as to shelter all the anterior
                    appendages beneath it; and the succeeding segments are so soldered together as
                    to appear like one piece, although all the hind-segments are free and movable in
                    the larva. The eyes are fixed on the head-shield; the antennules are chelate,
                    and placed in front of the mouth. The antennae, mandibles, maxillae,
                    maxillipeds, are all converted into walking legs, forming also chelate
                    appendages and, at their bases, jaws; thus serving admirably to illustrate the
                    most prominent characteristic of the sub-class <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>The thoracic feet are flattened out into broad bilobed plates which cover the

                    represented by the posterior portion of the hinder shield, and partly by the
                    long ensiform tail-spine (?) (See Owen’s Memoir, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Linn.
                    Soc.,</hi> vol. xxxviii., 1873.) But in the larvae, as has been already shown,
                    these post-cephalic somites are free and unanchylosed, and the tail-spine is
                    undeveloped, thus connecting the modern king-crab with its far-off ancestors in
                    the Coal and Silurian periods. The oldest species known is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Neolimulus</hi><hi rend="italic">falcatus,</hi> H. Woodw. (õ in fig. 80), from
                    the Upper Silurian of Lanarkshire, in which the segments are apparently all free
                    and unanchylosed</p>
                <p>In the Coal-measures no fewer than three genera and eight species of small
                    Limuloid Crustaceans have been met with, viz. <hi rend="italic">Bellinurus</hi>
                    (four species), <hi rend="italic">Prestwichia.</hi> (three species), and <hi

                    >Eurypterida.</hi> —In this order we become acquainted with the second extinct
                    type of the Crustacean class, and by far the most interesting, because all the
                    appendages as well as the bodyrings have been preserved to us, whereas in the
                    Trilobita the former are remarkable by their almost entire absence.</p>
                <p>Unlike <hi rend="italic">Limulus,</hi> in which all the segments in the adult are
                    soldered together into a fore and hind body and telson, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eurypterida</hi> the body is long and well adapted for swimming, the segments
                    being quite distinct and well developed; the feet are also fitted for natation
                    (see 5 in fig. 73, and fig· 81).</p>
                <p>We again observe the reiteration of the same well-marked characteristics in the
                    legion Merostomata—already noticed in the Edriophthalmia and Podophthalmia;
                    namely, the division into <hi rend="italic">Brachyuran</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Macrouran</hi> forms which exemplify the crawling and swimming
                    types, by the soldering together of the body-segments in the one and the
                    retention of free movement in the somites in the other. The characters of these
                    two orders of the Merostomata are summarized in the subjoined table.<note

                    (6 in fig. 80), and three Russian forms, <hi rend="italic">Exapinu-rus,

                    Of the shieldbearing forms the fresh-water <hi rend="italic">Apus</hi> may serve
                    as a good example. The eyes are placed in front on the dorsal surface of the
                    carapace and are nearly confluent. The first pair of feet (maxillipeds) are long
                    and branching; to these succeed about sixty pairs of branchial feet. The
                    thoracic and abdominal somites are nearly cylindrical and are composed of about
                    thirty articulations, terminated by two long, many jointed tail-spines.</p>
                <p>Probably <hi rend="italic">Apus</hi> has more articulations to its appendages and
                    body than any other Crustacean. Schaffer tabulated them, and found they numbered
                    1,802,604; Latreille puts them down at not less than 2,000,000. <hi

                    the mere vegetative repetition of parts is carried to an extreme distance beyond
                    the normal number of body-rings so characteristic of the class.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Nebalia,</hi> the marine type (1 in fig. 57), the carapace
                    or head-shield has a well-marked rostrum, and is more compressed laterally than
                    in <hi rend="italic">Apus,</hi> covering the head and thorax and even a part of
                    the abdomen. The eyes in <hi rend="italic">Nebalia</hi> are placed on peduncles
                    beneath the carapace; the number of segments is not excessive as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Apus.</hi></p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Estheria</hi> (fig. 56), the carapace is composed of two
                    valves, subovate in outline, like a bivalve molluscan shell, which it also
                    resembles in being united by the umbones of each valve on the anterior dorsal
                    border, and in each valve being marked by regular concentric lines of
                    growth.</p>

                    >Artemia</hi> are destitute of any carapace, so that the elegant wave-like
                    motion of their many-jointed transparent bodies and branchial feet can be freely
                    observed. The former inhabits our fresh waters, the latter is marine, being
                    peculiarly prolific in the brine-pans at Lymington, where the workmen firmly
                    believe that the “brine-shrimp” aids in some way the rapid deposit of salt,
                    through the constant agitation caused by such myriads of these minute and

                    pairs of short feet, may be seen protruded from the carapace, which is compact
                    and brittle, yet is capable of protecting the living animal during long periods

                    the former existence of these little bivalved Crustacea, often in vast numbers;
                    their size in early times was much larger, <hi rend="italic">Leperditiae</hi> as

                    have the head and thorax closely enveloped in a carapace with which the front
                    rings of the thorax are confluent. The abdominal somites are much diminished in
                    sizo and cylindrical. The single or paired external ovisacs are attached to two
                    of the posterior somites, which are usually welded together. The single sessile
                    median eye is situated near the front of the head; in the males of <hi
                    rend="italic">Diaptomus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Anomalocera</hi> the eye is
                    pedunculated. The antennae are very long and powerful natatory organs (in <hi

                    >Diaptomus</hi> equalling the entire length of the animal’s body); in the males
                    one or both of the antennae have a swelling near the centre or towards the
                    extremity, followed by a movable joint which acts like a hinge and serves as a
                    clasper to detain the female. There are five pairs of rowing feet, one pair of
                    which are usually rudimentary.</p>
                <p>The species belonging to this family are to be found in both fresh water and the
                    sea. In the muddiest and most stagnant pools and in the clearest springs <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyclops</hi> abound (3α in fig. 58). The marine species frequent
                    the pools along shore and the open ocean in equal abundance. They assist in
                    producing that luminous appearance in the sea called “phosphorescence,” for want
                    of a better name (5 in fig. 58).</p>

                    though those species which have but a single ovisac do not carry so many, their
                    number is still very considerable. Jurine isolated female specimens of <hi

                    three months,—each time about forty eggs. At the end of a year one female would
                    have produced 4,442,189,120 young! <hi rend="italic">Cetochilus</hi> (4 in fig.
                    58) is so abundant, both in the Northern Seas andin the South Atlantic, as to
                    serve for food to such an immense animal as the whale. They colour the sea for
                    many miles in extent, and when the experienced whaler sees this ruddy hue upon
                    the ocean he knows he has arrived at the “pasture of the whales.” They are to be
                    seen in vast quantities off the Isle of May in the Firth of Forth during the
                    summer months; many Cetacea are attracted thither, and vast shoals of fish also
                    come to feed upon them. One anomalous type of free Copepods is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Notodelphys acidicola,</hi> described by Allman, which is found
                    swimming freely in the branchial sac of the <hi rend="italic">Ascidia
                    communis.</hi> In this species the female has the fourth anterior segment of the
                    body peculiarly modified, so as to form on its dorsal surface a marsupium for
                    receiving and retaining the ova until they are hatched, when they escape by an
                    opening between the sac and the upper surface of the body-ring.</p>

                    are divisible into two groups, the fir.&gt;t comprising the peripatetic genera,
                    in which the male and female both retain their organs of locomotion in the adult
                    state, and can change their habitat whenever needful; this division would
                    include the fresh-water <hi rend="italic">Argulidae</hi> and the marine <hi
                    rend="italic">Caligidae.</hi> The second division embraces the fixed parasites,
                    in which the females when adult lose their locomotory appendages and become
                    fixed, deriving their nourishment by a true suctorial mouth, armed with
                    styliform mandibles, from the fishes and other animals upon which they are
                    parasitic. The larvae when they emerge from the egg are nauplii, like those of
                    other Copepods. The males and females are then alike; after attachment the
                    female often attains a large size, and is soon litt <hi rend="superscript">

                    antennae are formed into recurved hooks for holding on by, when the animal
                    shifts its position. The second pair of footjaws are converted into powerful
                    suckers by which it attaches itself to its host. The mouth is tubular, and has a
                    sharp styliform organ within it, affording good evidence of its suctorial
                    habits. There are four pairs of biramose natatory feet. The animal, when
                    detached, swims with extreme rapidity and elegance, and no fish, however rapid,
                    can escape from its adherence.</p>
                <p>The female is much larger than the male. She leaves the fish on which she is
                    parasitic when desirous to deposit her eggs, which she fixes to a stone or other
                    inorganic body at the bottom of the water. As many as 400 are deposited at one
                    time by a single female. <hi rend="italic">Argulus catostomi</hi> is said to lay

                    extremity of the abdomen,—in all these respects differing from other Crustacea
                    in which the male organ is laterally double. In the female organs the ovarian
                    tubes and caeca inosculate together; there are no oviducts, the ova connected
                    together by membrane, and so forming the “ovigerous lamellae,” become exposed by
                    the exuviation of the lining tunic of the carapace or sack, and by the formation
                    of a new tunic on the under side of the lamellae, a process unknown in any other
                    Crustacean. The Thoracica are mainly divided into <hi rend="italic"
                    >Balanidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lepadidae;</hi> in the former, the animal
                    when adult is inclosed in the parietes of its shell, and fixed to some living or
                    dead object by a broad shelly basis, the aperture being protected by the
                    opercular valves. In the <hi rend="italic">Lepadidae</hi> the animal is attached
                    by the extremity of a more or less long muscular peduncle, and its body is
                    lodged within the shelly valves of the capitulum. In some species, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Pollicipes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Scalpellum,</hi> the
                    peduncle is covered with more or less numerous rows of scales or squamae. This
                    peduncle in <hi rend="italic">Pollicipes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scalpellum</hi> corresponds with the basis in <hi rend="italic">Balanus,</hi>
                    as may clearly be seen if a <hi rend="italic">Pollicipes</hi> with a short
                    peduncle and a <hi rend="italic">Balanus</hi> with a deep cup-formed or
                    cylindrical basis be compared, the animal being in part lodged in both, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Ibla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lithotrya.</hi> The scales
                    which surround the base of the valves in <hi rend="italic">Pollicipes</hi>
                    correspond with the parietes of the walls of <hi rend="italic">Balanus,</hi> the
                    valves of the capitulum of the former being homologous with the opercular valves
                    in the latter (fig. 84). The body consists of six, perhaps of seven, posterior
                    thoracic somites. In the division Thoracica the abdomen is undeveloped.<note

                    this order, and in the mature animal of the two other orders (the <hi

                    of three segments.</p></note> The thoracic segments support six pairs of cirri.
                    Each cirrus consists of a two-jointed pedicel, carrying two multi-articulated
                    rami. The mouth has a labrum, palpi, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae;
                    within the sack a folded membrane forms the branchiae. Darwin concludes that in
                    the Cirripedia the body may be said to be composed, at most, of bat seventeen
                    segments.</p>

                    which are actually present in the larva, retained for the sake of completing the
                    comparison. “All that we externally see of a Cirripede, w hether pedunculated or
                    sessile, is the three anterior segments of the head of a Crustacean, with its
                    anterior end permanently cemented to a surface of attachment, and with its
                    posterior end projecting vertically from it” (Darwin).</p>
                <p>The thoracic appendages of the Cirripedia present us with yet another wonderful
                    modification of the Crustacean type; these biramous multi-articulated cirri are
                    neither natatory, nor ambulatory, nor branchial, but “captorial,” or fitted for
                    sweeping the water, and thus catching prey,— their alternate extensile and
                    retractile wave-like movements bringing all floating particles and minute

                <p>Cirripedia occur attached to the most varied objects, living and dead, throughout

                    forms are similarly widely distributed. Fritz Müller calls attention to one
                    anomalous form described by Darwin, the <hi rend="italic">Anelasma
                    squalicola,</hi> parasitic upon sharks in the North Sea, which seems to offer a
                    remarkable analogy to the Rhizocephala. This Lepadide, he says, seems in a fair
                    way to lose its cirri and buccal organs altogether. “The widely-cleft shell-less
                    test is supported upon a thick peduncle, which is imbedded in the skin of the
                    shark The surface of the peduncle is beset with much-ramified hollow filaments,
                    which penetrate the shark’s flesh like roots.” Cement glands and cement were not
                    visible. “It seems to me,” says Fritz Müller, “hardly doubtful that the ramified
                    hollow filaments are themselves nothing but the cement ducts converted into
                    nutritive roots, and that it is in consequence of the development of this new
                    source of nourishment that the cirri and buccal organs are in the highest degree
                    aborted.” All the mouth organs are minute and rudimentary; the cirri thick,
                    inarticulate, and destitute of bristles; the muscular tissue without transverse
                    striation, and the stomach perfectly empty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>“The <hi rend="italic">Lepadidaef</hi> writes Darwin, “include a much greater
                    range of forms than the <hi rend="italic">Balanidae,</hi> and this is what might
                    have been expected, for it is the most ancient family, and extinction has done
                    its work in separating genera which, according to analogy, were once more nearly
                    connected by intermediate forms.”</p>
                <p>The most ancient sessile Cirripede found fossil is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyrgoma</hi><hi rend="italic">cretacea,</hi> H. Woodw., from the Chalk.
                    Previous to 1865 the oldest-known pedunculated Cirripede was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pollicipes rhaeticus,</hi> Moore. In that year the writer
                    described a curious and most anomalous form of Cirripede, from the Upper
                    Silurian of Dudley, with imbricated calcareous plates (fig. 86), under the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Turrilepas Wrightii,</hi> previously described as a <hi
                    rend="italic">Chiton.</hi> The fossil form with which it has been compared is
                    more perfect and equally bizarre, viz., the <hi rend="italic">Loricula
                    pulchella</hi> (see 6 in fig. 70), originally discovered in the Chalk of
                    Rochester and since in that near Norwich. It affords evidence of a most aberrant
                    form of Lepadide, in which the capitulum is very small; the body of the animal
                    was lodged in a broadly-expanded peduncle, clothed in five rows of smooth
                    loricate! calcareous scales, which, if both sides were perfect, would have
                    possessed ten rows and the plates would have exceeded 200 in number. In Bate and
                    Westwood’s <hi rend="italic">Sessileeyed Crustacea</hi> (vol. ii. p. 268) is
                    figured a larval form of <hi rend="italic">Cryptothiria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Balani</hi> (reproduced in fig. 41 above), which seems to afford evidence of a
                    similar arrangement of plates. Possibly <hi rend="italic">Loricula</hi> was
                    parasitic like <hi rend="italic">Bopyrus.</hi></p>
                <p>In conclusion, sufficient evidence has been adduced to show that the normal
                    development of the Crustacean class has been one of progressive advancement, the
                    forms of to-day, when viewed as a whole, being more highly developed and more
                    differentiated than those which the geological record has preserved to us. But
                    in any large community or class it is only the few that outstrip the many in the
                    struggle for existence. Thus the Podophthalmia and Edriophthalmia present
                    numerous examples of high advancement, both in intelligence and in attaining to
                    a terrestrial life, especially in the Dec.ιpoda-Brachyura. The Ostracoda,
                    Phyllopoda, and Xiphosura are good instances of merely persiàtent forms. They
                    are orders the members of which have branched out long since into byways of
                    their own, where, being checked from further progress, they have, by their great
                    tenacity of life and large powers of reproduction, held their ground through the
                    long lapse of ages from Silurian times to the present day, whilst higher orders
                    have been modified or swept away.</p>
                <p>But the history of some Crustacea has been <hi rend="italic">retrogressive,</hi>
                    probably in a few instances from arrested larval development, as, for example,
                    in the case of the imperfectly-developed fifth pair of legs in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Porcellana, Galathea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Munida;</hi> in most
                    instances, however, retrogression seems clearly traceable to the parasitic or
                    sedentary mode of life which the members have adopted. We have examples of this
                    in the loss of eyesight in Crustacea passing their lives in subterranean
                    caverns, wells, and streams; the loss and atrophy of a part of the defensive
                    armature of the body in the burrowing <hi rend="italic">Thalassinidae;</hi> the
                    complete loss of the abdominal calcareous covering in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pagurus;</hi> the general atrophy of limbs and loss of symmetry of the body in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bopyridae</hi> through residence within the branchial
                    chambers of other Crustacea; and the complete or partial loss of all or nearly
                    all recognizable Crustacean characters in the adult female, or in both sexes, by
                    parasitism on Crustacea, fishes, &lt;fcc., in certain of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bopyridae,</hi> in the Copepoda, in the Rhizocephala, and in the
                    Cirripedia.</p>
                <p>Viewed as a whole, the Crustacea probably offer the best illustration of a class
                    constructed on a common type, retaining its general characteristics, but capable
                    of endless modifications of its parts, so as to suit the extreme requirements of
                    every separate species.</p>
                <p>The outline of this great class here attempted necessarily lacks many important
                    details; these must be filled in by the reader from the various works referred
                    to throughout the article. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h.</hi> W.)</p>
