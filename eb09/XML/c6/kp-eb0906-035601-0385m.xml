                <p><label type="entry">COPYRIGHT</label> is the exclusive right of multiplying for
                    sale copies of works of literature or art, allowed to the author thereof or his
                    assignees. As a recognized form of property it is, compared with others, of very
                    recent origin, being in fact the result of the facility for multiplying copies
                    created by the discovery of printing and kindred arts. Whether it was recognized
                    at all by the common law of England was long a legal question of the first
                    magnitude,— and the reasons for recognizing it, and the extent of the right
                    itself, are not quite clear from controversy even now. The short paragraph in
                    Blackstone may still be read with interest. He thinks that “this species of
                    property, being grounded on labour and invention, is more properly reducible to
                    the head of occupancy than any other, since the right of occupancy itself is
                    supposed by Mr Locke and many others to be founded on the personal labour of the
                    occupant.” But he speaks doubtfully of its existence,— merely mentioning the
                    opposing views, “that on the one hand it hath been thought no other man can have
                    a right to exhibit the author’s work without his consent, and that it is urged
                    on the other hand that the right is of too subtle and unsubstantial a nature to
                    become the subject of property at the common law, and only capable of being
                    guarded by positive statutes and special provisions of the magistrate.” He
                    notices that the Roman law adjudged that if one man wrote anything on the paper
                    or parchment of another, the writing should belong to the owner of the blank
                    materials, but as to any other property in the works of the understanding the
                    law is silent, and he adds that neither with us in England hath there been (till
                    very lately) any final determination upon the rights of authors at the common
                    law.</p>
                <p>The nature of the right itself, and the reasons why it <pb break="no"

                    beginning been the subject of bitter dispute. By some it has been described as a
                    monopoly, by others as a kind of property. Each of these words covers certain
                    assumptions from which the most opposite conclusions have been drawn. As a
                    monopoly it is argued that copyright should be looked upon as a doubtful
                    exception to the general law regulating trade, und should at all events be
                    strictly limited in point of duration. As property, on the other hand, it is
                    claimed that it should be perpetual, There would appear to be no harm in
                    describing copyright either as property or monopoly, if care be taken that the
                    words are not used to cover suppressed arguments as to its proper extent and
                    duration. Historically, and in legal definition, there would appear to be no
                    doubt that copyright, as regulated by statute, is a monopoly. The Parliamentary
                    protection of works of art for the period of fourteen years by the 8 Anne c. 19
                    and later statutes appears, as Blackstone points out, to have been suggested by
                    the exception in the Statute of Monopolies, 21 James I. c. 3. The object of that
                    statute was to suppress the royal grants of exclusive right to trade in certain
                    articles, and to reassert in relation to all such monopolies the common law of
                    the land. Certain exceptions were made on grounds of public policy, and among
                    others it was allowed that a royal patent of privilege might be granted for
                    fourteen years “to any inventor of a new manufacture for the sole working or
                    making of the same.” Copyright, like patent right, would be covered by the legal
                    definition of a monopoly. It is a mere right to prevent other people from
                    manufacturing certain articles. But objections to monopolies in general do not
                    apply to this particular class of cases, in which the author of a new work in
                    literature or art has the right of preventing others from manufacturing copies
                    thereof and selling them to the public. The rights of persons licensed to sell
                    spirits, to hold theatrical exhibitions, &amp;c., are also of the nature of
                    monopolies, and may be defended on special grounds of public policy. The
                    monopoly of authors and inventors rests on the general sentiment underlying all
                    civilized law, that a man should be protected in the enjoyment of the fruits of
                    his own labour.</p>
                <p>The first Copyright Act in England is 8 Anne c. 19. The preamble states that
                    printers, booksellers, and other persons were frequently in the habit of
                    printing, reprinting, and publishing “books and other writings without the
                    •consent of the authors or proprietors of such books and writings, to their very
                    great detriment, and too often to the ruin of them and their families.” “For
                    preventing, therefore, such practices for the future, and for the encouragement
                    of learned men to compose and write useful books, it is enacted that the author
                    of any book or books already printed, who hath not transferred to any other the
                    copy or copies of such book or books in order to print or reprint the same,
                    shall have the sole right and liberty of printing auch book or books for the
                    term of one-and-twenty years, and that the author of any book or books already
                    composed, and not printed and published, or that shall hereafter be composed,
                    and his assignee, or assignees, shall have the sole liberty of printing and
                    preprinting such book or books for the term of fourteen years, to commence from
                    the day of first publishing the same, and no longer.” The penalty for offences
                    against the Act was declared to be the forfeiture of the illicit copies to the
                    true proprietor, and the fine of one penny per sheet, half to the Crown, and
                    half to any person suing for the same. “After the expiration of the said term of
                    fourteen years the sole right of printing or disposing of copies shall return to
                    the authors thereof, if they are then living, or their representatives, for
                    another term of fourteen years.” The last provision points to a particular view
                    of the nature of copyright, to which we shall call attention further on. To
                    secure the benefit of the Act registration at Stationers’ Hall was necessary. In
                    section <hi rend="italic">4</hi> is contained the provision that if any person
                    thought the price of a book “too high and unreasonable,” he might complain to
                    the archbishop of Canterbury, the lord chancellor, the bishop of London, the
                    chiefs of the three courts at Westminster, and the vice-chancellors of the two
                    universities in England, and to the lord president, lord justice general, lord
                    chief baren of the Exchequer, and the rector of the college of Edinburgh in
                    Scotland, who may fix a reasonable price. Nine copies of each book were to be
                    provided for the royal library, the libraries of the universities of Oxford and
                    Cambridge, the four Scotch universities, Sion College, and the faculty of
                    advocates at Edinburgh. The copyright of the universities was not to be
                    prejudiced by the Act.</p>
                <p>It was believed for a long time that this statute had not interfered with the
                    rights of authors at common law. Ownership of literary property at common law
                    appears to have been recognized in some earlier statutes. The Licensing, Act, 13
                    and 14 Car. II. c. 33, prohibited the printing of any work without the consent
                    of the <hi rend="italic">owner</hi> on pain of forfeiture, &amp;c. This Act
                    expired in 1679, and attempts to renew it were unsuccessful. The records of the
                    Stationers’ Company show that the purchase and sale of copyrights had become an
                    established usage, aud the los.) of the protection, incidentally afforded by the
                    Licensing Act, was felt as a serious grievance, which ultimately led to the
                    statute of Anne. That statute, as the judges in Millar <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Taylor pointed out, speaks of the ownership of literary property as a known
                    thing. One of the petitions in support of the proposed legislation in 1709
                    states that by common law a bookseller can recover no more costs than he can
                    prove damages. “Besides,” it continues, “the defendant is always a pauper, and
                    so the plaintiff must lose his costs of suit. No man of substance has been known
                    to offend in this particular; nor will any ever appear in it.” Therefore the
                    confiscation of counterfeit properties is prayed for. And many cases are
                    recorded in which the courts protected copyrights not falling within the periods
                    laid down by the Act. Thus in 1735 the master of the Rolls restrained the
                    printing of an edition of the <hi rend="italic">Whole Duty of Man,</hi>
                    published in 1657. In 1739 an injunction was granted by Lord Hardwicke against
                    the publication of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> at the instance of
                    persons claiming under an assignment from Mil ton in 1667. The question,
                    however, was raised in the case of Millar <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Taylor (4
                    Burrow, 2303) in 1769, in which the plaintiff, who had purchased the copyright
                    of Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Seasons</hi> in 1729, claimed damages for an
                    unlicensed publication thereof by the defendant in 1763. The jury found that
                    before the statute it was usual to purchase from authors the perpetual copyright
                    of their works. Three judges, among whom was Lord Mansfield, decided in favour
                    of the common law right; one was of the contrary opinion. The majority thought
                    that the Act of Anne was not intended to destroy copyright at common law, but
                    merely to protect it more efficiently during the limited periods. Millar <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Taylor, however, was speedily overruled by the case of
                    Donaldson <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Beckett in the House of Lords in 1774. The
                    judges were called upon to state their opinions. A majority (seven to four) were
                    of opinion that the author and his assigns had at common law the sole right of
                    publication in perpetuity. A majority (six to five) were of opinion that this
                    common law right had been taken away by the statute of Anne, and a term of years
                    substituted for the perpetuity. Lord Mansfield did not deliver an opinion, as it
                    was unusual for a peer to support his own judgment on an appeal to the Lords.
                    Lord Camden argued against tho existence of a common law right, and on his
                    motion, seconded by the lord chancellor, the decree of the court below was
                    reversed. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n387/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0387-0358"/> decision appears to have taken the trade by
                    surprise. Many booksellers had purchased copyrights not protected by the
                    statute, and they now petitioned Parliament to be relieved from the consequences
                    of the decision in Donaldson <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Beckett. A bill for this
                    purpose actually passed the House of Commons, but Lord Camden’s influence
                    succeeded in defeating it in the House of Lords. The university copyrights were,
                    however, protected in perpetuity by an Act passed in 1775. The arguments in the
                    cases above mentioned raise the fundamental question whether there can be any
                    property in literary works, and are really arguments for and against the
                    desirability of recognizing the rights on general principles. Lord Camden was
                    the great opponent of copyright, both as a legislator and as a judge. His
                    sentiments may be judged by his answer to the plea that copyright was a reward
                    to men of genius :—“Glory is the reward of science, and those who deserve it
                    scorn all meaner views. I speak not of the scribblers for bread, who teaze the
                    press with their wretched productions. Fourteen years are too long a privilege
                    for their perishable trash. It was not for gain that Bacon, Newton, Milton, and
                    Locke instructed and delighted the world. When the bookseller offered Milton
                    five pounds for his <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> he did not reject it
                    and commit his poem to the flames, nor did he acoept the miserable pittance as
                    the reward of his labour; he knew that the real price of his work was
                    immortality, and that posterity would pay it.”</p>
                <p>The battle of copyright at this time appears to have been fought mainly in the
                    interests of the booksellers, and more particularly of the London booksellers.
                    One member presented petitions from the country booksellers, another from the
                    booksellers of Glasgow against the Booksellers’ Copyright Bill. Burke supported
                    the bill, and Fox opposed it. In both Houses the opponents of the bill denounced
                    the booksellers vehemently. Speaking of the Stationers’ Company, Lord Camden
                    said, “In 1681 we find a by-law for the protection of their own company and
                    their copyrights, which then consisted of all the literature of the kingdom; for
                    they had contrived to get all the copies into their own hands.” Again, owner was
                    the term applied to every holder of copies, and the word author does not occur
                    once in all their entries. “All our learning will be locked up in the hands of
                    the Tonsons and Lintons of the age, who will set that price upon it their
                    avarice chooses to demand, till the public become their slaves as much as their
                    hackney compilers now are. Instead of salesmen the booksellers of late years
                    have forestalled the market, and become engrossers.” In the discussions which
                    preceded the. last Copyright Act, the interests of the authors are more
                    prominent, but there are still curious traces of the ancient hostility to
                    booksellers. The proceedings both in Donaldson <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Beckett
                    and in the Booksellers’ Copyright Bill are recorded at considerable length in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary History,</hi> vol. xvii.</p>
                <p>By the 41 Geo. III. c. 107 the penalty for infringement of copyright was
                    increased to threepence per sheet, in addition to the forfeiture of the book.
                    The proprietor was to have an action on the case against any person in the
                    United Kingdom, or British dominions in Europe, who should print, reprint, or
                    import without the consent of the proprietor, first had in writing, signed in
                    the presence of two or more credible witnesses, any book or books, or who
                    knowing them to be printed, &amp;c., without the proprietor’s consent should
                    sell, publish, or expose them for sale; the proprietor to have his damages as
                    assessed by the jury, and double costs of suit. A second period of fourteen
                    years was confirmed to the author, should he still be alive at tho end of the
                    first. Further, it was forbidden to import into the United Kingdom for sale
                    books first composed, written, or printed and published within the United
                    Kingdom, and reprinted elsewhere. Another change was made by the Act 54 Geo.
                    III. c. 156, which in substitution for the two periods of fourteen years gave to
                    the author and his assignees copyright for the full term of twenty-eight years
                    from the date of the first publication, “and also, if the author be living at
                    the end of that period, for the residue of his natural life.”</p>
                <p>The Copyright Act now in force is the 5 and 6 Vict. c. 45, which repealed the
                    previous Acts on the same subject. The principal clause is the following (§ 3)
                    :—That the copyright in every book which shall after the passing of this Act be
                    published in the lifetime of its author shall endure for the natural life of
                    such author, and for the further term of seven years, commencing at the time of
                    his death, and shall be the property of such author and his assignees; provided
                    always that if the said term of seven years shall expire before the end of
                    forty-two years from the first publication of such book the copyright shall in
                    that case endure for such period of forty-two years; and that the copyright of
                    every book which shall be published after the death of its author shall endure
                    for the term of forty-two years from the first publication thereof, and shall be
                    the property of the proprietor of the author’s manuscript from which such book
                    shall be first published and his assigns. The benefit of the enlarged period is
                    extended to subsisting copyrights, unless they are the property of an assignee
                    who has acquired them by purchase, in which case the period of copyright will be
                    extended only if the author or his personal representative agree with the
                    proprietor to accept the benefit of the Act. By section 5 the judicial committee
                    of the Privy Council may license the republication of books which the proprietor
                    of the copyright thereof refuses to publish after the death of the author. The
                    sixth section provides for the delivery within certain times of copies of all
                    books published after the passing of the Act, and of all subsequent editions
                    thereof, at the British Museum. And a copy of every book and its subsequent
                    editions must be sent on demand to the following libraries :—The Bodleian at
                    Oxford, the public library at Cambridge, the Library of the Faculty of Advocates
                    in Edinburgh, and that of Trinity College, Dublin. The other libraries entitled
                    to this privilege under the old Acts had been deprived thereof by an Act passed
                    in 1836, and grants from the treasury, calculated on the annual average value of
                    the books they had received, were ordered to be paid to them as compensation. A
                    book of registry is ordered to be kept at Stationers’ Hall for the registration
                    of copyrights, to be open to inspection on payment of one shilling for every
                    entry which shall be searched for or inspected. And the officer of Stationers’
                    Hall shall give a certified copy of any entry when required, on payment of five
                    shillings; and such certified copies shall be received in evidence in the courts
                    as <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> proof of
                    proprietorship or assignment of copyright or licence as therein expressed, and,
                    in the case of dramatic or musical pieces, of the right of representation or
                    performance. False entries shall be punished as. misdemeanours. The entry is to
                    record the title of the book, the time of its publication, and the name and
                    place of abode of the publisher and proprietor of copyright. Without making such
                    entry no proprietor can bring an action for infringement of his copyright, but
                    the entry is not otherwise to affect the copyright itself. Any person deeming
                    himself aggrieved by an entry in the registry may complain to one of the
                    superior courts, which will order it to be expunged or varied if necessary A
                    proprietor may bring an action on the case for infringement of his copyright,
                    and the defendant in such an action must give notice of the objections to the
                    plaintiff’s title on which he means to rely. No person except the proprietor of
                    the copyright is allowed to import into the British dominions for sale or <pb

                <p>The Copyright Act was the result of a Parliamentary movement conducted by Mr
                    Sergeant Talfourd and afterwards by Lord Mahon. Talfourd’s bill of 1841 proposed
                    to extend copyright to a period of sixty years after the author’s death. The
                    proposer based his claim on the same grounds as other property rights,—which
                    would of course, as Macaulay pointed out, go to justify a perpetual copyright.
                    He refused to accept any shorter term than sixty years. He was answered by
                    Macaulay in a speech full of brilliant illustration and superficial argument. If
                    copyright is to be regarded, as Macaulay regarded it, as a mere bounty to
                    authors,— a tax imposed upon the public for the encouragement of people to write
                    books,—his opposition to an extended term is not only justified, but capable of
                    being applied to the existence of the right for any period whatever. The system
                    of bounty, or of taxation for the special benefit of any class of citizen, is
                    condemned by the principles of political economy and the practice of modern
                    legislation. But if copyright is defended on the same principles which protect
                    the acquisitions of the individual in other lines of activity, the reasoning of
                    Macaulay and the opponents of perpetuity is altogether wide of the mark. The use
                    of the phrase perpetual copyright has caused much confusion. A perpetual
                    copyright is precisely the same sort of right, in respect of duration, as a
                    fee-simple in land, or an investment in consolidated bank annuities. When
                    Macaulay therefore says, “Even if I believed in a natural right of property
                    independent of utility and anterior to legislation, I should still deny that
                    this right could survive the original proprietors,” his argument applies equally
                    to property in land and in bank annuities. The original purchaser of a bank
                    annuity acquires a right to the receipt of a certain sum every year for ever,
                    and such right he may assign or bequeath to any body he chooses. The writer of a
                    book, if the law recognized a perpetual copyright, would acquire an exclusive
                    right to the profits of its publication for ever, and might assign or bequeath
                    that right as he chose. In both cases the right survives the owner—if indeed
                    such a phrase can properly be used at all. Again, Macaulay points out that a
                    copyright fifty years after one’s death is at the present moment comparatively
                    worthless:—“An advantage to be enjoyed half a century after we are dead, by
                    somebody, we know not whom, perhaps by somebody unborn, by somebody utterly
                    unconnected with us, is really no motive at all to action.” No doubt there is a
                    point in the future at which a right coming into existence would for us now
                    living be virtually worth nothing. But this is true of all rights, and not
                    merely of the rights called copyright; and this reasoning would justify the
                    cutting off at some point in the future of all individual rights of property
                    whatever. The present value of a right to rent, a right to annuities, and a
                    copyright—to arise a hundred years hence—is probably next to nothing. There may
                    be good reasons for saying now that no such perpetuity of right ought to be
                    recognized, that the state ought to pass a law to take for itself all profits
                    arising out of land, and all annuities from the public funds, from and after the
                    year 1977. The injury done to the present owners would be precisely of the same
                    sort and extent as in the case of a copyright being cut short a hundred years
                    hence. Macaulay asks, “Would a copyright for sixty years have roused Dr Johnson
                    to any vigorous effort, or sustained his spirits under depressing
                    circumstances?&gt;” A sixty years’ copyright, or a perpetual copyright, would
                    have been to Dr Johnson in his last days of the same value as a sixty years’
                    lease or a fee-simple respectively of property yielding the same amount of
                    income.. Again, says Macaulay, the property would be certain to leave the
                    author’s family; the monopoly would fall into the hands of a bookseller. The
                    same thing may be said of all property that is assignable; and if there is any
                    good reason for preventing the assignment of property in certain circumstances,
                    whether by a law of entail or otherwise, that reason may be urged in the case of
                    copyright with the same force, and only with the same force, as in the case of
                    land. The old animus against the bookseller is still apparent in such objections
                    as the last.</p>
                <p>A former Copyright Act, as we have already noticed, gave the author two periods
                    of fourteen years, the second to be conditional on his surviving the first. The
                    object of this enactment is evidently to prevent the copyright from falling into
                    the hands of a bookseller. The legislature appears to have deemed authors
                    incapable of managing their own affairs. To prevent them from being made the
                    victims of unscrupulous publishers they put it out of their power to assign the
                    entire copyright, by making the second period a mere contingency. It was
                    forgotten that future profits have a present money value, and that if an author
                    sells his copyright for its fair market value, as he surely may be left to do,
                    he reaps the advantage of the entire period of copyright as completely as if he
                    remained the owner to the end. From this point of view the condition attached to
                    the second period was a positive hardship to the author, inasmuch as it gave him
                    an uncertain instead of a certain interest. It is the difference between an
                    assignable annuity for a certain period of twenty-eight years, and two
                    assignable annuities for fourteen years—the second only to come into existence
                    if the original annuitant survives the first period. The same fallacy lurks
                    under Talfourd’s complaint that as copyright is usually drawing towards an end
                    at the close of the author’s life, it is taken away at the very time when it
                    might be useful to him in providing for his family. But if the period fixed is
                    otherwise a fair period, the future of the author’s family is an irrelevant
                    consideration. Ho has, by supposition, the full property rights to which he is
                    entitled, and he may sell them or otherwise deal with them as he pleases, and he
                    will make provision for his family as other men do for theirs. Nothing short of
                    a strict Entail Act can keep copyright, any more than other property, in his or
                    his family’s possession. The attempt to do this by making the latter portion of
                    the period conditional has disappeared from legislation, but the same fallacy
                    remains in the objections urged against long terms of copyright.</p>

                <p>What would be a fair term may depend on a variety of considerations, but the
                    chance or certainty of copyrights becoming publishers’ property is certainly not
                    one of them.</p>
                <p>Macaulay’s speech convinced the House of Commons, and Talfourd’s bill was
                    defeated. Lord Mahon’s bill in 1842 reduced the proposed period to twenty-five
                    years after death; Macaulay proposed forty-two as the fixed number in all cases.
                    It was at Macaulay’s suggestion that the clause against the possible suppression
                    of books by the owners of copyright was introduced. Under a longer period of
                    copyright the danger apprehended might possibly become a real one; at present we
                    are not aware of any complaint having been made to the judicial committee under
                    this section.</p>
                <p>The preceding narrative records the changes in the law of copyright in books
                    only. In the meantime the principle had been extended to other forms of mental
                    work. The 8 Geo. II. c. 13 is an Act “for the encouragement of the arts of
                    designing, engraving, and etching historical and other prints by vesting the
                    properties thereof in the inventors and engravers during the time therein
                    mentioned.” It gave to every person who should "invent and design, engrave,
                    etch, or work in mezzotinto or chiaro-oscuro, or from his own works and
                    invention should cause to be designed and engraved, etched, or worked in
                    mezzotinto or chiaro-oscuro, any historical or other print or prints, which
                    shall be truly engraved with the name of the proprietor on each plate and
                    printed on every such print or prints,” a copyright for fourteen years— the
                    period fixed by the statute of Anne,—and inflicts a penalty on those who
                    engrave, &lt;kc., as aforesaid, without the consent of the proprietor. The 7
                    Geo. III. c. 38 extended the protection to those who should engrave, &amp;c.,
                    any print taken from any picture, drawing, model, or sculpture, either ancient
                    or modern, in like manner as if such print had been graved or drawn from the
                    original design of such graver, etcher, or draughtsman; and in both cases the
                    period is fixed at twenty-eight instead of fourteen years. Ten years later a
                    further remedy was provided by giving a special action on the case against
                    persons infringing the copyright. By the 38 Geo. III. c. 71 the sole right of
                    making models and casts was vested in the original proprietor for the period of
                    fourteen years.</p>
                <p>Stage right was first protected by the 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 15, which provided
                    that the author (or his assignee) of any tragedy, comedy, play, opera, farce, or
                    other dramatic piece or entertainment composed, or which should thereafter be
                    composed, and not printed or published by the author, should have as his own
                    property the sole liberty of representing or causing to be represented at any
                    place of dramatic entertainment in the British dominions any such production,
                    and should be deemed the proprietor thereof; and that the author of any such
                    production printed and published within the ten years preceding the passing of
                    the Act, or which should thereafter be so published, should hâve sole liberty of
                    representation for twenty-eight years from the passing of the Act, or the first
                    publication respectively, and further during the natural life of the author if
                    he survived that period.</p>
                <p>The publication of lectures without consent of the authors or their assignees is
                    prohibited by 5 and 6 Will. IV. c. 65. This Act excepts from its provisions—(1)
                    lectures of which notice has not been given two days before their delivery to
                    two justices of the peace living within five miles of the place of delivery, and
                    (2) lectures delivered in universities and other public institutions. Sermons by
                    clergy of the Established Church are believed to fall within this exception.</p>
                <p>Musical compositions are protected by a section of the Copyright Act 5 and 6 Vic.
                    c. 45 above mentioned. The increased period of copyright fixed by that Act is
                    extended to the right of representing dramatic pieces and musical
                    compositions—the first public representation or performance being the equivalent
                    of the first publication of a book. In such cases the right of representation is
                    not conveyed by the assignment of the copyright only.</p>
                <p>Lithographs, hitherto a doubtful subject, were brought within the provisions
                    relating to prints and engravings by a clause of the 15 and 16 Vict. c. 12.</p>
                <p>Lastly, in 1862, an Act was passed, 25 and 26 Vict. c. 68, by which the author of
                    every original painting, drawing, and photograph, and his assigns, obtained the
                    exclusive right of copying, engraving, reproducing, and multiplying it, and the
                    design thereof, for the term of the natural life of the author and seven years
                    after his death. The Acta relating to copyright of designs will be noticed
                    below.</p>
                <p>We may now notice a few of the more important principles developed and applied by
                    courts of justice in administering the law of copyright. One of them is that
                    there can be no copyright in any but innocent publications. Books of an immoral
                    or irreligious tendency have been repeatedly decided to be incapable of being
                    made the subject of copyright. In a case (Lawrence <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Smith) before Lord Eldon, an injunction had been obtained against a pirated
                    publication of the plaintiff’s <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Physiology,
                    Zoology, and the Natural History of Man,</hi> which the judge refused to
                    continue, “recollecting that the immortality of the soul is one of the doctrines
                    of the Scriptures, and considering that the law does not give protection to
                    those who contradict the Scriptures.” The same judge refused in 1822 to restrain
                    a piracy of Lord Byron’s <hi rend="italic">Cain,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Juan</hi> was refused protection in 1823. It would appear from a recent case,
                    arising out of a different subject matter,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    that the courts are still disposed to enforce these principles. To refuse
                    copyright in such cases is futile as a mode of punishment or repression,
                    inasmuch as it directly opens up a wider circulation to the objectionable works.
                    When the authorship of a book is misrepresented with intent to deceive the
                    public, copyright will not be recognized.</p>
                <p>The writer of private letters sent to another person may in general restrain
                    their publication. It was urged in some of the cases that the sender had
                    abandoned his property in the letter by the act of sending; but this was denied
                    by Lord Hardwicke, who held that at most the receiver only might take some kind
                    of joint property in the letter along with the author. Judge Story, in the
                    American case of Folsom <hi rend="italic">V.</hi> Marsh, states the law as
                    follows :—“The author of any letter or letters, and his representatives, whether
                    they are literary letters or letters of business, possess the sole and exclusive
                    copyright therein; and no person, neither those to whom they are addressed, nor
                    other persons, have any right or authority to publish the same upon their own
                    account or for their own benefit.” But there may be special occasions justifying
                    such publication.</p>
                <p>A kind of property in unpublished works, not created by the copyright Acts, has
                    been recognized by the courts. The leading case on the subject is Prince Albert
                    <hi rend="italic">υ.</hi> Strange (2 <hi rend="italic">De Gex and Smale's
                    Reports).</hi> Copies of etchings by the Queen and Prince Albert, which had been
                    lithographed for private circulation, fell into the hands of the defendant, a
                    London publisher, who proposed to exhibit them, and issued a catalogue entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">A Descriptive Catalogue of the Royal Victoria and Albert
                    Gallery of Etchings.</hi> The Court of Chancery restrained the publication of
                    the catalogue, holding that property in mechanical works, or works of art, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n390/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0390-0361"/> does certainly subsist, and is invaded, before
                    publication, not only by copying but by description or catalogue.</p>
                <p>The question what is a piracy against copyright has been the subject of much
                    discussion in the courts. It was decided under the statute of Anne that a
                    repetition from memory was not a publication so as to be an infringement of
                    copyright. In the recent case of Reade <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Comquest the
                    same view was taken. The defendant had “dramatized” the plaintiff’s novel, and
                    the piece was performed at his theatre. This was held to be no breach of
                    copyright; but the circulation of copies of a drama, so taken from a copyright
                    novel, whether gratuitously or for sale, is not allowed. Then again it is often
                    a difficult question to decide whether the alleged piratical copyright does more
                    than make that fair use of the original author’s materials which the law
                    permits. It is not every act of borrowing literary matter from another which is
                    piracy, and the difficulty is to draw the line between what is fair and what is
                    unfair. Lord Eldon put the question thus,—whether the second publication is a
                    legitimate use of the other in the fair exercise of a mental operation deserving
                    the character of an original work. Another test proposed is “whether you find on
                    the part of the defendant an <hi rend="italic">animus furandi—</hi> an intention
                    to take for the purpose of saving himself labour.’’ No one, it has been said,
                    has a right to take, whether with or without acknowledgment, a material and
                    substantial portion of another’s work, his arguments, his illustrations, hi ι
                    authorities, for the purpose of making or improving a rival publication. When
                    the materials are open to all, an author may acquire copyright in his selection
                    or arrangement of them. Several cases have arisen on this point between the
                    publishers of rival directories. Here it has been held that the subsequent
                    compiler is bound to do for himself what the original compiler had done. When
                    the materials are thus <hi rend="italic">in medio,</hi> as the phrase is, it is
                    considered a fair test of piracy to examine whether the mistakes of both works
                    are the same. If they are, piracy will be inferred. Translations stand to each
                    other in the same relation as books constructed of materials in common. The <hi
                    rend="italic">animus furandi,</hi> mentioned above as a test of piracy, does not
                    imply deliberate intention to steal; it may be quite compatible with ignorance
                    even of the copyright work. This is shown by the case of Reade <hi rend="italic"
                    >v.</hi> Lacy. The plaintiff wrote a drama called <hi rend="italic">Gold,</hi>
                    and founded on it a novel called <hi rend="italic">Never too Late to Mend.</hi>
                    The defendant dramatized the novel,—his play reproducing scenes and incidents
                    which appeared in the original play. The vice-chancellor, presuming that the
                    defendant had a right to dramatize the novel, found that the second play was an
                    infringement of the copyright in the first. Abridgments of original works appear
                    to be favoured by the courts—when the act of abridgment is itself an act of the
                    understanding, “employed in carrying a large work into a smaller compass, and
                    rendering it less expensive.” Lord Hatherly, however, in Tinsley <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Lacy, incidentally expressed his disapproval of this
                    feeling,—holding that the courts had gone far enough in this direction, and that
                    it was difficult to acquiesce in the reason sometimes given that the compiler of
                    an abridg ment is a benefactor to mankind by assisting in the diffusion of
                    knowledge. A mere selection or compilation, so as to bring the materials into
                    smaller space, will not be a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> abridgment; “there
                    must be real substantial condensation, and intellectual labour, and judgment
                    bestowed thereon” (Justice Story.) A publication professing to be A. <hi
                    rend="italic">Christmas Ghost Story, Reoriginated from the Original by Charles
                    Dickens, Esq , and Analytically Condensed expressly for this Work,</hi> was
                    found to be an invasion of Air Dickens’s copyright in the original. In the case
                    of a musical composition Lord Lyndhurst held that it is piracy when the
                    appropriated music, though adapted to a different purpose, may still be
                    recognized by the ear. The quasicopyright in names of books, periodicals,
                    &lt;fcc., is founded on the desirability of preventing one person from putting
                    off on the public his own productions as those of another. The name of a journal
                    is a species of trade-mark on which the law recognizes what it calls a “species
                    of property.” The <hi rend="italic">Wonderful Magazine</hi> is invaded by a
                    publication calling itself the <hi rend="italic">Wonderful Magazine, New Series
                    Improved. Bell's Life in London</hi> is pirated by a paper calling itself the
                    <hi rend="italic">Penny Bell's Life.</hi> So the proprietors of the <hi
                    rend="italic">London Journal</hi> got an injunction against the <hi
                    rend="italic">Daily London Journal,</hi> which was projected by the person from
                    whom they had bought their own paper, and who had covenanted with them not to
                    publish any <hi rend="italic">weekly</hi> journal of a similar nature. A song
                    published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Minnie,</hi> sung by Madame Anna
                    Thillon and Miss Dolby at Monsieur Jullien’s concerts, was invaded by a song to
                    the same air published as <hi rend="italic">Minnie Dale, Sung at Jullien's
                    Concerts by Madame Anna Thillon.</hi></p>
                <p>Dramatic and musical compositions, it should be observed, stand on this peculiar
                    footing, that they may be the subject of two entirely distinct rights. As
                    writings they come within the general Copyright Act, and the unauthorized
                    multiplication of copies is a piracy of the usual sort. This was decided to be
                    so even in the case of musical compositions under the Act of Anne. The Copyright
                    Act now includes a “sheet of music” in its definition of a book. Separate from
                    the copyright thus existing in dramatic or musical compositions is the right of
                    representing them on the stage; this was the right created by 3 and 4 Will. IV.
                    c. 15, above mentioned in the case of dramatic pieces. The Copyright Act, 5 and
                    6 Vict. c. 45, extended this right to musical compositions, and made the period
                    in both cases the same as that fixed for copyright. And the Act expressly
                    provides (meeting a contrary decision in the courts), that the assignment of
                    copyright of dramatic and musical pieces shall not include the right of
                    representation unless that is expressly mentioned. The 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 15,
                    prohibited representation “at any place of public entertainment,” a phrase which
                    has been omitted in the later Act, and it may perhaps be inferred that the
                    restriction is now more general and would extend to any unauthorized
                    representation anywhere. A question has also been raised whether, to obtain the
                    benefit of the Act, a musical piece must be of a dramatic character. The
                    dramatization of a novel, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the acting of a drama
                    constructed out of materials derived from a novel, is not an infringement of the
                    copyright in the novel, but to publish a drama so constructed has been held to
                    be a breach of copyright (Tinsley <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Lacy, where
                    defendant had published two plays founded on two of Miss Braddon’s novels, and
                    reproducing the incidents and in many cases the language of the original). Where
                    two persons dramatize the same novel, what, it may be asked, are their
                    respective rights? In Toole <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Young (9 Q. B., 523) this
                    point actually arose. A, the author of a published novel, dramatized it and
                    assigned the drama to the plaintiff, but it was never printed, published, or
                    represented upon the stage. B, ignorant of A’s drama, also dramatized the novel
                    and assigned his drama to the defendant, who represented it on the stage. It was
                    held that any one might dramatize A’s published novel, and that the
                    representation of B’s drama was not a representation of A’s drama. This case may
                    be compared with Reade <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Lacy mentioned above.</p>
                <p>For preventing the importation of pirated copies of books, the commissioners of
                    customs are required to make out a list of books on which copyright subsists,
                    and of which they have received notice from the owner or his agent, and such
                    lists are to be exposed at the ports of the United Kingdom. If notice is not
                    sent the importation of books will not be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n391/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0391-0362"/> interfered with. If any one wrongfully causes a
                    book to be entered on the custom lists, any one injured thereby may apply to a
                    judge in chambers to have the entry expunged.</p>
                <p>Newspapers stand at present on a somewhat peculiar footing with reference to the
                    law of copyright. Their position was put in issue in the case of Cox <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Land and Water</hi> Journal Company
                    <hi rend="italic">(Law Reports,</hi> 9 Eq. 324), in which the plaintiff sought
                    to restrain the defendant from publishing a “List of Hounds” taken from
                    plaintiff’s paper—the <hi rend="italic">Field.</hi> It was argued that there was
                    no copyright in a newspaper article, or, if there were, that it was lost by
                    non-registration. Vice-Chancellor Malins held that a newspaper is not within the
                    copyright Acts, that therefore the rules as to non-registration do not apply,
                    and that the proprietor of a paper acquires such a property (not copyright) in
                    every article for which he pays under the 18th section of the Act, or by the
                    general rules of property, as will entitle him to prohibit any other person from
                    publishing the same thing in any other newspaper. The substantial justice of
                    this decision is beyond impeachment, but as a matter of law it is by no means
                    satisfactory. The right to prohibit publication is copyright and nothing else;
                    and it is difficult to see how it can be enjoyed at all outside the Copyright
                    Act, or how, if it is acquired in virtue of compliance with any of the
                    provisions of the Act, it can avoid forfeiture as a penalty for
                    non-registration. It is highly improbable that this decision would be confirmed,
                    should the question ever come before a higher court. The property of a
                    newspaper, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the good-will of printing and publishing
                    it, and the exclusive right to its title, are not rights of the same nature as
                    copyright.</p>
                <p>A special kind of perpetual copyright in various publications has for various
                    reasons been recognized by the law (1) in the Crown and (2) in the universities
                    and colleges. The various copyright Acts, including the last, except from their
                    provisions the copyrights vested in the two English and the four Scotch
                    universities, Trinity College, Dublin, and the colleges of Eton, Westminster,
                    and Winchester. Crown copyrights are saved by the general principle which
                    exempts Crown rights from the operation of statutes unless they are expressly
                    mentioned. Among the books in which the Crown has claimed copyright are the
                    English translation of the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer, statutes, orders of
                    Privy Council, proclamations, almanacs, Lilly’s Latin Grammar, year books, and
                    law reports. The copyright in the Bible is rested by some on the king’s position
                    as head of the church; Lord Lyndhurst rested it on his duties as the chief
                    executive officer of the state charged with the publication of authorized
                    manuals of religion. The right of printing the Bible and the Book of Common
                    Prayer is vested in the queen’s printer and the universities of Oxford and
                    Cambridge. These copyrights do not extend to prohibit independent translations
                    from the original. The obsolete copyright of the Crown in Lilly’s Latin Grammar
                    was founded on the fact of its having been drawn up at the king’s expense. The
                    universities have a joint right (with the Crown’s patentees) of printing Acts of
                    Parliament. Law reports were decided to be the property of the Crown in the
                    reign of Charles II.; by Act of Parliament they were forbidden to be published
                    without licence from the chancellor and the chiefs of the three courts, and this
                    form of licence remained in use after the Act had expired. The courts still
                    maintain their right to restrain the publication of reports of their
                    proceedings, but on quite other grounds than those pertaining to the law of
                    copyright. University and college copyrights are made perpetual by an Act of
                    George III., but only on condition of the books being printed at their printing
                    presses and for their own benefit.</p>
                <p>The rights of foreigners under the copyright Acts produced an extraordinary
                    conflict of judicial opinion in the English courts. A foreigner who during
                    residence in the British dominions should publish a work was admitted to have a
                    copyright therein. The question was whether residence at the time of publication
                    was necessary. In Cocks <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Purday, the Court of Common
                    Pleas held that it was not. In Boosey <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Davidson, the
                    Court of Queen’s Bench, following the decision of the Court of Common Pleas in
                    Cocks <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Purday, held that a foreign author might have
                    copyright in works first published in England, although he was abroad at the
                    time of publication. But the Court of Exchequer, in Boosey <hi rend="italic"
                    >v.</hi> Purday, refused to follow these decisions, holding that the legislature
                    intended only to protect its own subjects,—whether subjects by birth or by
                    residence. The question came before the House of Lords on appeal in the case of
                    Boosey <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Jeffreys, in which the Court of Exchequer had
                    taken the same line. The judges having been consulted were found to be divided
                    in opinion. Six of them held that a foreigner resident abroad might acquire
                    copyright by publishing first in England. Fourmain-tained the contrary. The
                    views of the minority were affirmed by the House of Lords (Lord Chancellor
                    Cranworth and Lords Brougham and St Leonards). The lord chancellor’s opinion was
                    founded upon “the general doctrine that a British senate would legislate for
                    British subjects properly so called, or for such persons who might obtain that
                    character for a time by being resident in this country, and therefore under
                    allegiance to the Crown, and under the protection of the laws of England.” Lord
                    Brougham said that</p>
                <p>“The statute of Anne had been passed for the purpose of encouraging learned men,
                    and with that view that Act had given them the exclusive right in their
                    publications for twenty-one years. This, however, was clear, they had no
                    copyright at common law, for if they had there would have been no necessity for
                    the passing of that statute. It could scarcely be said that the legislature had
                    decided a century and a half since that an Act was to be passed to create a
                    monopoly in literary works solely for the benefit of foreigners. In the present
                    case he was clearly of opinion that the 'copyright did not exist, and therefore
                    that foreign law should not prevail over British law where there was such
                    diversity between the two.”</p>
                <p>Against the authority of this case, however, must be set the opinion of two of
                    the greatest lawyers who have occupied the woolsack in this generation—Lord
                    Cairns and Lord Westbury. In the case of Routledge <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Low
                    <hi rend="italic">(Law Reports,</hi> 3 House of Lords, 100) Lord Cairns
                    said,</p>
                <p>“The aim of the legislature is to increase the common stock of the literature of
                    the country; and if that stock can be increased by the publication for the first
                    time here of a new and valuable work composed by an alien who has never been in
                    the country, I see nothing in the wording of the Act which prevents, nothing in
                    the policy of the Act which should prevent, and everything in the professed
                    object of the Act and in its wide and general provisions which should entitle
                    such a person to the protection of the Act, in return and compensation for the
                    addition he has made to the literature of the country.”</p>
                <p>And Lord Westbury said, in the same case,</p>
                <p>“The case of Jeffreys <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Boosey is a decision which is
                    attached to and depends on the particular statute of which it was the exponent,
                    and as that statute has been repealed and is now replaced by another Act, with
                    different enactments expressed in different language, the case of Jeffreys <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Boosey is not a binding authority in the exposition of
                    this later statute. The Act appears to have been dictated by a wise and liberal
                    spirit, and in the same spirit it should be interpreted, adhering of course to
                    the settled rules of legal construction. The preamble is, in my opinion, quite
                    inconsistent with the conclusion that the protection given by the statute was
                    intended to be confined to the works of British authors. . The real condition of
                    obtaining its advantages is the first publication by the author of his work in
                    the United Kingdom. Nothing renders necessary his bodily presence here at the
                    time, and I find it impossible to discover any reason why it should be required,
                    or what it can add to the merit of the first publication. If the intrinsic
                    merits of the reasoning on which Jeffreys <hi rend="italic">υ.</hi> Boosey was
                    decided be considered, I must frankly admit that it by no means commands my
                    assent.”</p>
                <p>These conclusions appear to follow also from the recent Naturalization Act of
                    1870, which enacts that real and personal property of every description may be
                    taken, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n392/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0392-0363"/> acquired, held, and disposed of by an alien in
                    the same manner in all respects as by a natural born British subject. As the
                    latter can acquire copyright by first publication, without residence in England,
                    and as copyright is personal property, it would seem that an alien also must
                    have copyright without the necessity of residence. It is quite clear, at all
                    events, that residence in any part of the British dominions—not merely the
                    United Kingdom—is sufficient; but the first publication must be in the United
                    Kingdom. But the copyright once created extends to the whole of the British
                    dominions.</p>
                <p>Colonial copyright, however, is subject to a special Act, the 10 and 11 Vict. c.
                    95. Under English copyright books of the United Kingdom were protected in the
                    colonies, and copies of them printed or reprinted elsewhere could not be
                    imported into the colonies. At the same time books published in the colonies are
                    not, as we have just mentioned, within the protection of the Copyright Act. By
                    the Colonial Copyright Act, 10 and 11 Vict. c. 95, it is now enacted that when
                    the legislative authority in any British possession makes proper provision by
                    Act or ordinance for the protection of the rights of British authors, the Crown
                    may, by Order in Council, suspend the prohibition against the importation,
                    &amp;c, of foreign reprints of English copyright books, so far as such colony is
                    concerned, and the local Act shall thereupon come into operation. The following
                    colonies have taken advantage of the Act :—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince
                    Edward's Island, Bermuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Canada, St Lucia, St Vincent,
                    British Guiana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Newfoundland, Granada, St Christopher,
                    Antigua, Nevis, Cape of Good Hope, Natal (Shortt).</p>
                <p>In 1875 an Act was passed to give effect to an Act of the Parliament of the
                    Dominion of Canada respecting copyright. An Order in Council in 1868 bad
                    suspended the prohibition .against the importation of foreign reprints of
                    English books into Canada, and the Parliament had passed a Bill on the subject
                    of copyright as to which doubts had arisen whether it was not repugnant to the
                    Order in Council. Her Majesty in Council is therefore authorized to assent to
                    the Canadian Bill (which is printed as a Schedule to the Act); and it is also
                    enacted that, after the Bill comes into operation, if an English copyright book
                    becomes entitled to Canadian copyright, no Canadian reprints thereof shall be
                    imported into the United Kingdom, unless by the owner of the copyright. The
                    following points in the Canadian Act are worth noting. Any person printing or
                    publishing an unprinted manuscript without the consent of the author or legal
                    proprietor shall be liable in damages (§ 3). Any person domiciled in Canada, or
                    in any part of the British Possessions, or being a citizen of any country having
                    an international copyright treaty with the United Kingdom, who is the author of
                    any book, map, &amp;c., &amp;c.,—shall have the sole right and liberty of
                    printing, reprinting, publishing, &amp;c., for the term of twenty-eight years.
                    The work must be printed and published, or reprinted or republished in Canada,
                    whether before or after its publication elsewhere; and the Canadian privilege is
                    not to be continued after the copyright has ceased elsewhere. And “no immoral or
                    licentious, or irreligious, or treasonable, or seditious literary scientific or
                    artistic w ork” shall be the subject of copyright (§ 4). A further period of
                    fourteen years will be continued to the author or his widow and children. An
                    “interim copyright” pending publication may be obtained by depositing in the
                    office of the minister of agriculture (who keeps the register of copyrights) a
                    copy of the title of the work; and works printed first in a series of articles
                    in a periodical, but intended to be published as books, may have the benefit of
                    this interim copyright. If a copyright work becomes out of print, the owner may
                    be notified of the Act through the minister of agriculture, who, if he does not
                    apply a remedy, may license a new edition, subject to a royalty to the owner.
                    Anonymous books may be entered in the name of the first publisher.</p>
                <p>Books published in a colony stand on the same footing, so far as the United
                    Kingdom is concerned, as books published in a foreign country. Their protection
                    in England depends on the International Copyright Acts.</p>
                <p>The International Copyright Acts were passed in order to give foreign authors the
                    same sort of privilege as is accorded to English authors, on the basis of
                    reciprocity. The principal Act is the 7 and 8 Vict. c. 12, repealing an earlier
                    Act, 1 and 2 Vict. c. 59, and amended by 15 Vict. c. 12.</p>
                <p>Her Majesty may, by Order in Council, grant the privilege of copyright to the
                    authors of books, &lt;kc., first published in any foreign country to be named in
                    such order—provided always that “dueprotection has beemsecured by the foreign
                    power, so named in such Order in Council, for the benefit of parties interested
                    in works first published in the dominions of Her Majesty similar to those
                    comprised in such order.” Different provisoes may be fixed for different
                    countries and different classes of works protected. No right of property shall
                    be recognized in any book, &lt;fcc., first publ ished out of Her Majesty’s
                    dominions, save such as is created by this Act. Hence British as well as foreign
                    authors first publishing abroad, have no protection in England unless there is a
                    convention between England and the country in which they publish under the
                    International Copyright Act. Thus in Boucicault <hi rend="italic">υ.</hi>
                    Delafield,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> The same
                    question was decided in the same way in the recent case (Nov. 1876) of the same
                    plaintif! against Mr Chatterton for representing “Shaughraun,” a play first
                    brought out by plaintiff in America.</p></note> the plaintiff had first
                    performed a drama in New York, and afterwards registered it in England on the
                    first day of its performance there, and now sought to have its unauthorized
                    representation restrained. The court refused, holding that the Act 7 and 8 Vict.
                    c. 12, § 19 says in effect that if “any person, British subject or not, chooses
                    to deprive this country of the first representation of his work, then he may get
                    the benefit of copyright if he can, under any arrangement which may have been
                    come to between this country and the country which he so favours with his
                    representation.” If there is no such treaty or arrangement, then this country
                    has nothing more to say to him. The publication in the British dominions of
                    unauthorized translations of works published abroad may be prohibited by the
                    authors for a period of five years, except in the case of political articles in
                    the newspapers, Arc Copyright in foreign works of art, prints, articles of
                    sculpture, &lt;fcc., may also be protected under the conditions applicable to
                    copyright in the same subjects in England. The right of representing in England
                    dramatic pieces, &amp;c., first performed abroad, may also be recognized in the
                    same way. The authors of dramatic pieces first performed abroad may also acquire
                    (under the 15 Vict. c. 12) the right to prevent the representation of any
                    unauthorized translation of such dramatic pieces for a period not exceeding five
                    years from the date of first publication or representation of an authorized
                    translation. Section 6 of this Act contains the important exception that
                    “nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to prevent fair imitations or
                    adaptations to the English stage of any dramatic piece or musical composition
                    published in any foreign country.” This clause has given great dis satisfaction,
                    and it has been virtually repealed by 38 Viet, c. 12.<note anchored="true"

                    enactments in force for protecting domestic stage rights are available for them;

                    the original as accurately as is possible by means of an English version; and in

                <p>In all these cases, it must be remembered, the Crown can grant copyright to
                    foreign productions, only on condition .that a convention securing reciprocal
                    rights is concluded with the foreign power in question, in terms of the
                    International Copyright Act. The countries with which conventions have been
                    concluded are the following :—Prussia, Saxony, and other German states, in 1846
                    and 1847; France, 1852; Belgium, 1855; Spain, 1857; Sardinia; and Hesse

                <p>An Association to Protect the Rights of Authors has recently been formed with the
                    object of calling attention to •the more glaring defects of the existing laws of
                    copyright. The chief points noticed by this association are the loss of rights
                    by first production out of the United Kingdom; the loss by dramatization of
                    novels; the unfair conditions of stage-right in translations of foreign plays,
                    and especially the hardship of the “fair adaptation” clause; the loss caused by
                    the inefficient prohibition of pirated copies in Canada since the International
                    Copyright Act was passed, and the absence of an international copyright treaty
                    with the U nited States. Of these defects the “adaptation clause” has been
                    repealed since the association was formed, and the Act already noticed was
                    passed in 1875 to give effect to a new Copyright Act of the Canadian Parliament.
                    In 1876 a royal commission was appointed to consider the whole question of home,
                    colonial, and international copyright.</p>
                <p>The question of international copyright between England and the United States has
                    for sometime been the subject of active discussion among the authors and
                    publishers of "both countries. The chief opposition to a convention proceeds
                    from various sections of the publishing trade in America. An interesting
                    statement of the various groups of opinion on this subject in the United States,
                    and of the attempts to frame a satisfactory International Copyright Act, will be
                    found in an article by Dr C. E. Appleton in the <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly
                    Review</hi> for February 1877. At present a sort of customary copyright in
                    English books is recognized by certain leading firms. When one of them has, by
                    arrangement with the author, obtained the advance sheets of an English work,
                    there is a tacit understanding that the others are not to reprint that
                    particular work; but this arrangement, it appears, “is practically confined to
                    those who are able to retaliate when the trade courtesy is violated.” These
                    great publishers have a monopoly of the English trade, and those who would
                    gladly become their competitors, the booksellers of the Middle and Western
                    States, would, according to Dr Appleton, oppose any International Copyright Act
                    which did not aid them to break down that monopoly. Some of the resolutions of a
                    meeting of the opponents of International Copyright at Philadelphia in January
                    1872 are worth quoting :—</p>
                <p>1. That thought, unless expressed, is the property of the thinker; when given to
                    the world it is as light, free to all.</p>
                <p>. 2. As property it can only demand the protection of the municipal law of the
                    country to which the thinker is subject.</p>
                <p>3. The author of any country, by becoming a citizen of this, and assuming and
                    performing the duties thereof, can have the same protection that an American
                    author has.</p>
                <p>4. The trading of privileges to foreign authors, for privileges to be granted to
                    Americans, is not just, because the interests of others than theirs are
                    sacrificed thereby.</p>
                <p>5. Because the good of the whole people, and the safety of our republican
                    institutions, demand that books shall not be made too costly for the multitude
                    by giving the power to foreign authors to fix their price here as well as
                    abroad.</p>
                <p>Copyright of designs applicable to manufactures is protected by the 5 and 6 Vict.
                    c. 100, and subsequent Acts amending the same. Before designs in general were
                    protected, the copyright in designs for the manufacture of linens, cottons,
                    calicos, and muslins had been recognized. The 5 and 6 Vict. c. 100. § 3, enacts
                    “with regard to any new and original design, whether such design be applicable
                    to the ornamenting of any article of manufacture, or of any substance,
                    artificial or natural or partly artificial and partly natural, and whether for
                    the pattern, for the shape or configuration, or for the ornament thereof, and by
                    whatever means the same may be applicable, whether by printing, painting,
                    &amp;c., the proprietor shall have the sole right of applying such design, for
                    the terms specified in the Act, which vary according to the class of manufacture
                    in question.” By 6 and 7 Vict. c. 65, copyright for three years was granted for
                    designs “having reference to some purpose of utility, so far as design shall be
                    for the shape or configuration of such article.” Registration in both cases is
                    necessary. The period of protection varies from nine months to five years, and
                    in certain cases an extended period may be granted by the Board of Trade. Cases
                    under these Acts are more nearly allied to patents than to copyrights.</p>

                    >France.—</hi> Copyright in France is recognized in the most ample manner. Two
                    distinct rights are secured by law—1st, the right of reproduction of literary
                    works, musical compositions, and works of art; and 2d, the right of
                    representation of dramatic works and musical compositions. The period is for the
                    life of the author and fifty years after his death. After the author’s death the
                    surviving consort has the usufructuary enjoyment of the rights which the author
                    has not disposed of in his lifetime or by will, subject to reduction for the
                    benefit of the author’s protected heirs if any. The author may dispose of his
                    rights in the most absolute manner in the forms and within the limits of the
                    Code Napoléon. Piracy is a crime punishable by fine of not less than 100 nor
                    more than 2000 francs; in the case of a seller from 25 to 500 francs. The
                    pirated edition will be confiscated. Piracy also forms the ground for a civil
                    action of damages to the amount of the injury sustained—the produce of the
                    confiscation, if any, to go towards payment of the indemnity (Penal Code, Art.
                    425-429). The piracy on French territory of works published in a foreign country
                    is, by a decree of 28th March 1852, brought within the above provisions.
                    “However, when a convention has been concluded with any state this treaty
                    modifies the effects of the decree of 28th March, in so far as its provisions
                    may be in opposition to the said decree; the prescriptions of the new convention
                    become the special law of the parties, and the rights of the authors and artists
                    of that state are regulated in France by the intervening convention” <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> The first legislation on the subject of
                    literary property in the United States appears at the close of the revolution.
                    In 1783 laws were passed by Connecticut and Massachusetts securing to authors
                    for specified periods the exclusive property in their literary productions, and
                    prescribing penalties for its violation. Similar laws were passed by Virginia in
                    1785, by New York in 1786, and by other States. Under this system it was
                    necessary for authors, in order to enjoy the benefits of protection in States
                    other than that in which they resided, to copyright their works in each State
                    having such laws. Authors’ rights therefore depended on the legislation in the
                    several States, as there was no national law relating to copyright. In order to
                    afford to literary property, as well as to useful inventions and discoveries,
                    adequate protection throughout the United States by a general law, the Federal
                    Constitution, which came into force in 1789, empowered Congress “to promote the
                    progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and
                    inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.”
                    Pursuant to this provision the first copyright law of the United States was
                    passed, May 31,1790, entitled “An Act for the Encouragement of Learning by
                    securing the Copies of Maps, Charts, and Books to the Authors and Proprietors of
                    such Copies during the times therein mentioned.” This statute gave to authors,
                    who were citizens or residents of the United States, their heirs and assigns,
                    copyright in maps, charts, and books for fourteen years, and provided for a
                    second term of the same duration, if the author should be living at the
                    expiration of the first. The penalty prescribed for publishing, importing, or
                    selling a book in violation of the Act was forfeiture of copies to the author or
                    proprietor, “who shall forthwith destroy the same,” and the payment of 50 cents
                    for every sheet found in possession of the offender, one-half to go to the
                    author or proprietor, and the other half to the United States. The Act also
                    provided a remedy against the unauthorized publication of manuscripts belonging
                    to citizens or residents of the United States. In 1802 the provisions of the Act
                    of 1790 were extended to “the arts of designing, engraving, and etching
                    historical and other prints.” In 1831 the several Acts relating to copyrights
                    were amended and consolidated by a general law, which extended the term of
                    protection from fourteen to twenty-eight years, with provision for a renewal for
                    fourteen years to the author, his widow or children. Musical compositions were
                    now for the first time expressly provided for, being placed upon the same
                    footing as books. In 185(&gt; was passed the first statute for giving to
                    dramatists the exclusive right of representing their plays in public, and in
                    1865 photographs and negatives were declared subjects of copyright in the same
                    manner as books, engravings, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> All statutes
                    relating to copyright were repealed by the general law of 1870, which, with an
                    amendment passed in 1874, now regulates the entire subject. This law may be
                    found in the revised statutes of the United States of 1873, and the amendment in
                    the statutes at large of 1873-74. The term of protection is the same as that
                    under the Act of 1831. To the subjects of copyright protected by previous
                    statutes were added paintings, drawings, chromos, statues, statuary, and models
                    or designs intended to be perfected as works of the fine arts.</p>
                <p>Every author or owner, native or foreign, of an unpublished literary composition
                    or work of art has-exçlu-sive property therein at common law. Before publication
                    he may make of it any use which does not interfere with the rights of »others.
                    When the work is published the owner’s common law rights are lost. The author or
                    proprietor of a manuscript, if a citizen or resident of the United States, has
                    also a statutory remedy for damages· against its unlicensed publication.</p>
                <p>In 1834 was contested in the Supreme Court of the United States the same question
                    which had been so elaborately argued in the English case of Millar <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Taylor, decided by the Court of King’s Bench in 1769, and
                    finally settled by the House of Lords five years later in Donaldson <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Becket, viz., whether copyright in published works exists
                    by the common law, and is therefore of unlimited duration, or is created by and
                    wholly governed by statute. The Supreme Court, following the authority of the
                    House of Lords, held that there was no copyright after publication except for
                    the limited term given by the statute. Of the seven judges four concurred in
                    this conclusion, two delivered elaborate dissenting opinions, and one was
                    absent. This judgment has since continued to be the supreme law.</p>
                <p>The policy of the American Government in relation to foreign authors has been far
                    less liberal than that of England. No special arrangement for international
                    copyright, such as subsists between Great Britain and many Continental
                    countries, has been entered into between the United States and any foreign
                    Government. While a foreigner in the United States is entitled to common law
                    protection for his unpublished works, his rights after publication are
                    determined wholly by statute. The question concerning the status of a foreign
                    author under the copyright laws, as well as of a citizen who derives title from
                    a foreigner, is freed from much of the doubt and difficulty that have surrounded
                    it in the English courts. While Parliament from the reign of Anne to the present
                    time has legislated for the benefit of “authors,” leaving to the courts to
                    determine whether that general language is applicable to all authors or is
                    limited to those of Great Britain, the American Congress, in all its legislation
                    for the encouragement of literature from the Act of 1790 to that of 1870, has
                    extended protection only to such author as may be a “citizen of the United
                    States or resident therein.” Thus by express words is a foreigner excluded from
                    the benefits of the statute. This language has nevertheless given rise to some
                    discussion as to who may be regarded as a “resident.” That word has been
                    judicially construed to mean any person domiciled in the United States with the
                    intention of making there his permanent abode. Neither naturalization nor a
                    formal declaration of such intention is required. No definite period of time and
                    no specific acts are indicated as necessary to constitute such residence. The
                    question is to be determined by the intention of the person at the time of
                    recording his title, while his abode is in the United States, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n395/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0395-0366"/> and by his acts so far as they indicate what that
                    intention was. If at that time he intended to remain there and make the country
                    his place of permanent abode, his home, he becomes during the continuance of
                    that intention a resident within the meaning of the Act, though he may
                    afterwards change his mind and return to his native land. How long such
                    intention shall continue the courts have not determined; but if it exists <hi
                    rend="italic">bona fide</hi> at the time of recording the title, valid copyright
                    vests, and will not be defeated by any subsequent acts or change of mind on the
                    part of the claimant. On the other hand, if a foreign author should come to the
                    United States intending to stay temporarily, although with that intention he
                    should actually remain a year or ten years, he would be a mere sojourner, and
                    would not acquire a residence within the meaning of the Act. To determine thus
                    the intention in the mind of a person will in many cases be attended with
                    difficulty and even with fraud. It is a question of fact for the jury, whose
                    finding will determine the law. In case of a work composed jointly by a foreign
                    and a native author, and copyrighted by either one or both, the copyright in the
                    part contributed by the foreign author if it could be distinguished, would not
                    be valid. The assignee—although a citizen—of a foreign author, can acquire no
                    more rights under the statute than the latter has.</p>
                <p>There is, however, nothing in the statute to prevent a citizen or resident from
                    acquiring copyright in certain works of art which he has purchased from a
                    foreign author. By section 4952 copyright is vested in “any citizen of the
                    United States, or resident therein, who shall be the author, inventor, designer,
                    or <hi rend="italic">proprietor</hi> of a book, map, chart, dramatic or musical
                    composition, engraving, cut, print, photograph, or negative thereof, or of a
                    painting, drawing, chromo, statue, statuary, and of models or designs intended
                    to be perfected as works of the fine arts.” Under this section any “proprietor,”
                    who is a citizen or resident, might acquire copyright in a work purchased from a
                    foreign author. But a subsequent section, 4971, declares that nothing in the Act
                    “shall be construed to prohibit the printing, publishing, importation, or sale
                    of any book, map, chart, dramatic or musical composition, print, cut, engraving,
                    or photograph, composed or made by any person not a citizen of the United States
                    nor resident therein.” This language clearly disqualifies a foreigner, or any
                    one deriving title from him, from acquiring in the United States copyright in
                    the works mentioned. But no mention is made of paintings, drawings, chromos,
                    statues, statuary, models, or designs which are included in the previous
                    section. Whether this omission is intentional or otherwise cannot bo determined
                    from the Act, but in the absence of any judicial or legislative light on this
                    point, the only sound interpretation would seem to be that if a citizen or
                    resident of the United States, having purchased from a foreign author any work
                    of art of these classes, should take the requisite steps to secure copyright
                    therein, his title would be valid. A citizen of the United States may acquire
                    copyright while temporarily resident in a foreign country.</p>
                <p>Tne same liberal construction given to the word “book” by the English courts has
                    been accepted in the United States. A brief literary composition on a single
                    sheet may be copyrighted as a book. There is no special provision concerning
                    copyright in an encyclopaedia, review, magazine, or periodical as is prescribed
                    by sections 18 and 19 of the 5 and 6 Viet, c. 45. Such works are protected in
                    the same manner as books. In the absence of special agreement to the contrary,
                    the copyright of an article contributed to a magazine or other periodical would
                    doubtless remain with the author for all purposes which would not deprive the
                    purchaser of any advantage arising from its publication in the magazine. The
                    right of subsequent publication in book form would belong to the author and not
                    to the owner of the periodical. Such publication might be made at any time after
                    the issue of the magazine, provided the circulation of the latter "was not
                    thereby injured. In practice newspapers are not copyrighted; hence any
                    uncopyrighted article first published in a newspaper becomes <hi rend="italic"
                    >publid juris,</hi> and valid copyright could not be subsequently obtained for
                    it. But either the entire newspaper or any article published in it may be
                    copyrighted by a compliance with the general statutory provisions relating to
                    books. Authors may reserve the right to dramatize or to translate their own
                    works, by printing a notice to that effect in the book. The copyright law does
                    not protect a title independently of the book; but a title may be registered as
                    a trade mark, or its unlawful use may be restrained on the general principles of
                    equity. Nor is there any provision in the copyright law, as in England, for the
                    protection of designs for industrial products. The statute of 1874 prescribes
                    that the words “engraving,” “cut,” and “print” shall be applied only to
                    pictorial illustrations or works connected with the fine arts, and that no
                    prints or labels designed to be used for any other articles of manufacture shall
                    be entered under the copyright law, but must be registered in the patent
                    office.</p>
                <p>The statute now in force grants to authors, and their executors, administrators,
                    or assigns, copyright for twentyeight years from the time of recording the
                    title. At the expiration of that period the author or his widow or children may
                    obtain an additional term of fourteen years. In order to secure copyright every
                    applicant is required to perform three acts :—1st, before publication to
                    transmit to the librarian of Congress in Washington a printed copy of the title
                    of the book, map, chart, dramatic or musical composition, engraving, cut, print,
                    or photograph, or a description of the painting, drawing, chromo, statue,
                    statuary, model, or design; 2d, within ten days after publication to send to the
                    same official two copies of such book or other article, or in the case of a
                    painting, drawing, statue, model, or design a photograph thereof; 3d, to print
                    on the title page, or the page next following, of every copy of a book, or in
                    the case of a map, chart, musical composition, print, cut, engraving,
                    photograph, painting, drawing, chromo, statue, statuary, model, or design to
                    inscribe upon some visible portion of it, or upon the substance upon which it is
                    mounted, the notice of entry for copyright in the form prescribed. Two forms are
                    prescribed, either of which may be used :—1. “Entered, according to Act of
                    Congress, in the year by , in the office of the librarian of Congress at
                    Washington;” 2. “Copyright 18 . . by ”. The year when the copyright was entered
                    and the name of the person, persons, or firm by whom entered are to be given.
                    Compliance with all these conditions is essential to valid copyright. Until they
                    are performed an action at law for infringement cannot be maintained. But equity
                    will protect the copyright as soon as the title is recorded, and before the
                    performance of the other two requisites. When the right is perfected an action
                    at law may be maintained for any infringement after the recording of the title.
                    A penalty of $25 is further prescribed for failure to deliver to the librarian
                    of Congress, within ten days after publication, two copies of the best edition
                    of the book, or description or photograph of the other articles above mentioned,
                    and a copy of every subsequent edition containing substantial changes. A penalty
                    of $100 is imposed upon any person who causes notice of copyright to be inserted
                    in a book, or impressed upon any other article for which a copyright has not
                    been obtained. The fee for securing copyright is 50 cents, to be paid to the
                    librarian for recording the title. A copy of such record may be obtained for 50
                    cents. The librarian receives $1 for recording and certifying an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n396/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0396-0367"/> assignment, and SI for every copy of an
                    assignment furnished. Another essential condition to valid copyright is
                    publication, and the work must be first published in the United States; but a
                    contemporaneous publication abroad will not prejudice the author’s rights. The
                    production must also be original and innocent in character. Copy right will not
                    vest in an unpublished work. But the statute provides that every person who
                    shall print or publish any manuscript, without the consent of the author or
                    proprietor, if the latter is a citizen or resident of the United States, shall
                    be liable for damages. There is nothing in the Act to exclude a resident
                    assignee of a foreign author from the benefits of this provision.</p>
                <p>Copyrights pass to heirs and are assignable in law by any instrument of writing.
                    Every assignment must be recorded in the office of the librarian of Congress
                    within sixty days after its execution, in default of which it becomes void as
                    against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration
                    without notice.</p>
                <p>The existing statute provides that if any person without due authority shall
                    print, publish, or import a copyrighted book, or knowing it to be so printed,
                    published, or imported shall sell or offer it for sale, he shall forfeit every
                    copy to the proprietor and pay such damages as may be recovered in a civil
                    action. In case of piracy of a map, chart, musical composition, print, cut,
                    engraving, photograph, or chromo, the offender is made liable to forfeit the
                    plates and every sheet copied or printed, and to pay $1 for every sheet found in
                    his possession either printing, printed, copied, published, imported, or exposed
                    for sale For every pirated copy of a painting, statue, or statuary found in his
                    possession, or which he has sold or offered for sale, the offender must pay $10.
                    The injured person may obtain from a court of equity an injunction against the
                    publication and sale of the pirated work, and may recover at law the damages
                    sustained by such publication. All actions at law and suits in equity under the
                    copyright statutes must be brought in the circuit or district courts of the
                    United States, except in the District of Columbia or any territory where the
                    proper tribunal is the Supreme Court. Appeal lies to the Supreme Court of the
                    United States. All actions for forfeitures or penalties must be brought within
                    two years after the cause of action has arisen. Redress for the invasion of
                    common law rights in unpublished works must be sought in a State court, unless
                    the parties to the con troversy are citizens of different States, in which case
                    the courts of the United States have jurisdiction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stage right in the United States.—</hi> Until 1856 there was no
                    statute giving to dramatists control over the public representation of their
                    plays. This want was met by the Act of August 18 of that year, which was passed
                    expressly to confer upon the author or owner of a dramatic composition the sole
                    liberty of performing, or causing it to be performed, in public; and any one
                    infringing this right was made liable to damages in a sum not less than $100 for
                    the first and $50 for every subsequent unauthorized performance. The provisions
                    of this Act have been held to apply only to cases in which copyright was secured
                    under the Act of 1831; and as the benefits of that law were by express words
                    limited to citizen or resident authors, foreign dramatists acquired no rights by
                    the statute of 1856. The Act of 1870 gives to dramatists, besides the exclusive
                    right of publishing in print, the sole liberty of representing their dramatic
                    compositions on the stage, and declares that any person who publicly represents
                    a copyrighted dramatic composition, without authority, shall be liable to
                    damages in a sum not less than $100 for the first and $50 for each subsequent
                    performance. This right is secured by copyrighting the dramatic composition as a
                    book and endures for the same term as does the copyright in the book, The Act
                    must be construed as giving the sole liberty of representation only in cases
                    where the exclusive right of publication has been secured. In other words, the
                    copyright in the printed production is made to include the right of public
                    representation. As the former can be acquired only by citizens and residents,
                    foreign dramatists and their assignees, as under the Act of 1856, are excluded
                    from the benefits of the statutes. There is no statutory provision, as in
                    England, giving to either native or foreign dramatists the exclusive right to
                    represent their manuscript plays. While foreign dramatists are entitled to no
                    statutory protection whatever, their manuscript plays are protected by the
                    common law. In this respect the rights of native and foreign dramatists are the
                    same. Such protection ceases when the play is published. When published in print
                    the owner’s rights are lost, unless in the case of a citizen, protected by
                    statute. Whether the authorized public performance of a manuscript play,
                    unprotected by statutory copyright, is such a publication as will give to any
                    βne, without licence from the owner, the right either to represent it on the
                    stage or to publish it in print, is a question which is not determined by
                    statute, as in England, but is left entirely to the courts. It has been much
                    discussed in several leading cases since 1860; and its importance is enhanced by
                    the fact that many, if not most, of the dramas which American managers are
                    expected and even required to provide for an exacting public and a critical
                    press are from the pens of English and French playwrights. It is well settled
                    that the public performance of a manuscript drama is not such a publication as
                    will invalidate a copyright subsequently obtained by the author; and that no
                    one, without leave, may publish in print, or publicly represent the play, if
                    obtained by stenography, the use of writing, or in any other way than through
                    the memory of one or more persons who have witnessed its lawful representation.
                    The theory has been advanced, and has received some judicial approval, that the
                    owner of an uncopyrighted manuscript play cannot lawfully prevent another from
                    publicly representing it, when the latter has obtained a copy through the memory
                    of any person who has witnessed the authorized performance. This doctrine is
                    supported by a single case decided in the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in
                    1860. Its soundness has been questioned by high authority, and there is little
                    doubt that when the direct issue shall be presented for judicial determination
                    such unlicensed use of the play will be held to be piracy. It may be regarded as
                    conceded that the courts would not hesitate to declare unauthorized publication
                    in print to be an invasion of the owner’s rights.</p>
                <p>Property in unpublished musical compositions, lectures, sermons, works of arts,
                    &amp;c., are governed by the same principles that apply in the case of dramatic
                    productions. There îs no statute, as in England, regulating the author’s rights
                    in manuscript lectures. The writer of an unpublished letter, whether possessing
                    literary value or not, may prevent at common law its unauthorized publication by
                    the receiver, unless publication is necessary to protect the latter against
                    injurious representations made by the former. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. r.— e. s.
