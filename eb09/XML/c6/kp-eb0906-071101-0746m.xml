                <p><label type="entry">CURLEW</label>, in French <hi rend="italic">Courlis</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Corlieu,</hi> a name given to two birds, of whose cry it is an
                    imitation, both belonging to the group <hi rend="italic">Limicolae,</hi> but
                    possessing very different habits and features.</p>
                <p>1. The Long-billed Curlew, or simply Curlew of most British writers, the <hi
                    rend="italic">N^umenius</hi><hi rend="italic">arquata</hi> of ornithologists, is
                    one of the largest of the family <hi rend="italic">Scolopacidae, or</hi> Snipes
                    and allied forms, It is common on the shores of the United Kingdom and most
                    parts of Europe, seeking the heaths and moors of the interior and more northern
                    countries in the breeding-season, where it lays its four brownish-green eggs,
                    suffused with cinnamon markings, in an artless nest on the ground. In England it
                    has been ascertained to breed in Cornwall and in the counties of Devon, Dorset,
                    Salop, and Derby—though sparingly. In Yorkshire it is more numerous, and thence
                    to the extreme north of Scotland, as well as throughout Ireland, it is, under
                    the name of Whaup, familiar to those who have occasion to traverse the wild and
                    desolate tracts that best suit its habits. So soon as the young are able to
                    shift for themselves, both they and their parents resort to the sea-shore or
                    mouths of rivers, from the muddy flats of which they at low tide obtain their
                    living, and, though almost beyond any other birds wary of approach, form an
                    object of pursuit to numerous gunners. While leading this littoral life the food
                    of the Curlew seems to consist of almost anything edible that presents itself.
                    It industriously probes the mud or sand in quest of the worms that lurk therein,
                    and is also active in seeking for such crustaceans and mollusks as can be picked
                    up on the surface, while vegetable matter as well has been found in its stomach.
                    During its summer-sojourn on the moorlands insects and berries, when they are
                    ripe, enter largely into its diet. In bulk the Curlew is not less than a Crow,
                    but it looks larger still from its long legs, wings, and neck. Its bill, from 5
                    to 7 inches in length, and terminating in the delicate nervous apparatus common
                    to all birds of its family, is especially its most remarkable feature. Its
                    plumage above is of a drab colour, streaked and mottled with very dark brown;
                    beneath it is white, while the flight-quills are of a brownish black.</p>
                <p>Nearly allied to the Curlew, but smaller and with a more northern range, is the
                    Whimbrel (A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">phaeopvs),</hi>
                    called in some parts Jack-Curlew, from its small size·—May-fowl, from the month
                    in which it usually arrives—and Titterel from one of its cries.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> The name Spowe <hi

                    resembles the former in habit and appearance that no further details need be
                    given of it. In the countries bordering on the Mediterranean occurs a third
                    species <hi rend="italic">(N. tenuir</hi><hi rend="italic">ostris),</hi> the
                    home of which has yet to be ascertained, Some fifteen other species, or morç,
                    have been described, but it is probable that this number is too great. The genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Numenius</hi> is almost cosmopolitan. In North America three
                    very easily recognized species are found—the first (AE <hi rend="italic"
                    >longirostris)</hi> closely agreeing with the European Curlew, but larger and
                    with a longer bill; the second (√V. <hi rend="italic">hudsonicus)</hi>
                    representing our Whimbrel; and the third (A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi
                    rend="italic">borealis),</hi> which has several times found its way to Britain,
                    very much less in size—indeed the smallest of the genus. All these essentially
                    agree with the species of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0747-0712"/> the Old World in habit; but it is remarkable that
                    the American birds can be easily distinguished by the rufous colouring of their
                    axillary feathers—a feature which is also presented by the American Godwits <hi
                    rend="italic">(Limosa).</hi><hi rend="italic">2.</hi> The Curlew of inlanders,
                    or Stone-Curlew—called also, by some writers, from its stronghold in this
                    country, the Norfolk Plover, and most wrongly and absurdly the Thick-Knee or
                    Thick-Kneed Bustard—is usually classed among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Charadriidae,</hi> but it offers several remarkable differences from the more
                    normal Plovers. It is the <hi rend="italic">Clιaradrius</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >oedicnemus</hi> of Linnaeus, the <hi rend="italic">C. scolopax</hi> of Sam.
                    Gottl. Gmelin, and the <hi rend="italic">Oedicnemus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >crepitans</hi> of Temminck. With much the same cry as that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Numeniì,</hi> only uttered in a far sweeter tone, it is as fully
                    entitled to the name of Curlew as the bird most commonly so called. In England
                    it is almost solely a summer-visitor, though an example will occasionally linger
                    throughout a mild winter; and is one of the few birds whose distribution is
                    affected by geological formation, since it is nearly limited to the
                    chalk-country—the open spaces of which it haunts, and its numbers have of late
                    years, been sensibly diminished by their inclosure. The most barren spots in
                    these districts, even where but a superficial coating of light sand and a thin
                    growth of turf scarcely hide the chalk below, supply its needs; though at night
                    (and it chiefly feeds by night) it resorts to moister and more fertile places.
                    Its food consists of snails, coleopterous insects, and earth-worms, but larger
                    prey, as a mouse or a frog, is not rejected. Without making the slightest
                    attempt at a nest, it lays its two eggs on a level spot, a bare fallow being
                    often chosen. These are not very large, and in colour so closely resemble the
                    sandy, flint-strewn surface that their detection except by a practised eye is
                    difficult. The bird, too, trusts much to its own drab colouring to elude
                    observation, and, on being disturbed, will frequently run for a considerable
                    distance and then squat with outstretched neck so as to become almost invisible.
                    In such a case it may be closely approached, and its large golden eye, if it do
                    not pass for a tuft of yellow lichen, is perhaps the first thing that strikes
                    the searcher. As autumn advances the Stone-Curlew gathers in large flocks, and
                    then is as wary as its namesake. Towards October these take their departure, and
                    their survivors return, often with wonderful constancy, to their beloved haunts
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 766). In size this species
                    exceeds any other European plover, and looks even still larger than it is. The
                    bill is short, blunt, and stout; the head large, broad, and flat at the top. The
                    wings and legs long—the latter presenting the peculiarity of a singular
                    enlargement of the upper part of the tarsus, whence the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oedicnemus</hi> has been conferred. The toes are short and fleshy, and the
                    hind-toe, as in most <hi rend="italic">Charadriidae,</hi> is wanting. This
                    Curlew seems to have been an especial favourite with Gilbert White, in whose
                    classical writings mention of it is often made. Its range extends to North
                    Africa and India. Five other species of <hi rend="italic">Oedicnemus</hi> from
                    Africa have also been described as distinct: whether there are so many may be
                    doubted. Australia, however, possesses a very distinct species <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Oe.</hi><hi rend="italic">grallarius),</hi> and the genus has two members in
                    the Neotropical Region <hi rend="italic">(Oe.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bistriatus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oe.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >superciliaris).</hi> The analogy of all these birds to the Bustards <hi
                    rend="italic">(Otididae)</hi> is manifest, but that they have any really close
                    affinity to that family is questionable. An exaggerated form of <hi
                    rend="italic">Oedicnemus</hi> is found in <hi rend="italic">Aesacus,</hi> of
                    which two species have been described, one <hi rend="italic">(Ae.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">recurυirostris)</hi> from the Indian, and the other <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ae. magnirostris)</hi> from the hbrthern parts of the Australian
                    Region. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
