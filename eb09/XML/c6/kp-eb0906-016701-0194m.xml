                    original name was Crimthan, and that he received the surname of Columba from the
                    dove-like simplicity uf his character, but it is more probable that the latter
                    was his baptismal name. He was afterwards known as Columbkille, or Columba of
                    the Churches, to distinguish him from others öf the same name. Ireland was
                    already famous for the learned men who taught in its numerous monasteries; and
                    Columba studied for some time under one of the most distinguished of these, St
                    Finian of Moville Almost as a matter of course, under such circumstances, he
                    embraced the monastic life. He was ordained deacon while at Moville, and
                    afterwards, when about thirty years of age, was raised to the priesthood. During
                    his residence in Ireland he founded two famous monasteries, one named Dair
                    Calgach, on the banks of Lough Foyle, the other Dair-magh in Leinster, better
                    known by their modern names of Derry and Durrow.</p>
                <p>When upwards of forty years of age he left his native island, accompanied by
                    twelve disciples, and went on a mission to Northern Britain. Argyll and the
                    neighbouring islands were at this time portions of the Christian kingdom of the
                    Scots, and from its sovereign Conal he received the Island of Hy, or Iona, where
                    he fixed his residence. His first task was to erect a church and
                    monastery—humble structures of timber and reeds, according to the fashion of the
                    country and the age. Having spent some years in preparation, he began the great
                    work of his life,—the conversion of the heathen kingdom of the Northern Picts.
                    Crossing over to the mainland he proceeded to the residence, on the banks of the
                    Ness, of Brude, king of the Picts. By his preaching, his holy life, and, as his
                    earliest biographers assert, by the performance of miracles, he converted the
                    king and many of his subjects. The precise details, except in a few cases, are
                    unknown, or obscured by exaggeration and fiction; but it is certain that the
                    whole of northern Scotland was converted by the labours of Columba and his
                    disciples, and the religious instruction of the people provided for by the
                    erection of numerous monasteries.</p>
                <p>The monastery of Iona was reverenced as the mother house of all these
                    foundations, and its abbots were obeyed as the chief ecclesiastical rulers of
                    the whole nation of the Northern Picts. There were then neither dioceses nor
                    parishes in Ireland and Celtic Scotland; and by the Columbite rule the bishops
                    themselves, although they ordained the clergy, were subject to the jurisdiction
                    of the abbots of Iona, who, like the founder of the order, were only presbyters.
                    The controversies connected with this subject are well known to the students of
                    ecclesiastical history, and need not here be farther adverted to. Similar
                    disputes have existed regarding the doctrines of Columba and his followers. This
                    point also is beyond the range of the present article. It may be sufficient to
                    mention that there is no real difficulty as to their belief in its general
                    features. It was the same as that of the Western Church on the Continent, with
                    which also their ritual agreed except in a few unimportant particulars, such as
                    the precise time of keeping Easter. The confusion iu these matters has been
                    chiefly owing to the careless and incorrect identification of the Columbites
                    with the clergy afterwards known by the name of Cui dees.</p>
                <p>Columba was honoured by his countrymen, the Scots of Britain and Ireland, as much
                    as by his Pictish converts, and in his character of chief ecclesiastical ruler
                    or primate he gave formal benediction and inauguration to Aidan, the successor
                    of Conal, as king of the Scots. He accompanied that prince to Ireland in 590,
                    and took a leading part in a council held at Drumceat in Ulster, where a
                    controversy was settled which had existed between the king of Ireland and the
                    sovereign of the British Scots. The last years of Columba’s life appear to have
                    been spent at Iona. There he was already revered as a saint, and whatever credit
                    may be given to some portions of the narratives of his biographers, there can be
                    no doubt as to the wonderful influence which he exercised, as to the holiness of
                    his life, and as to the love which he uniformly manifested to God and to his
                    neighbour.</p>
                <p>In the summêr of 597 he knew that his end was approaching. On Saturday the 8th of
                    June he was able, with the help of one of his monks, to ascend a little hill
                    above the monastery and to give it his farewell blessing. Returning to his cell
                    he continued a labour in which he had been engaged, the transcription of the
                    Psalter. Having finished the verse of the 34th Psalm where it is written, “They
                    who seek the Lord shall w ant no manner of thing that is good,” he said, “Here I
                    must stop :—what follows let Baithen write;” indicating, as was believed, his
                    wish that Baithen should succeed him as abbot. He was present at evening in the
                    church, and when the midnight bell sounded for the nocturnal office early on
                    Sunday morning he again went thither unsupported, but sank down before the altar
                    and passed away as in a gentle sleep.</p>
                <p>The original materials for a life of St Columba are unusually full. The earliest
                    biography was written by one of his successors, Cuminius, who became abbot of
                    Iona in 657. Much more important is the enlargement of that work by Adamnan, who
                    became abbot of Iona in 679. These narratives are supplemented by the brief but
                    most valuable notices given by the Venerable Bede. The first modern writers who
                    discussed the life and actions of Columba, with any approach to critical
                    accuracy, were two learned clergymen of the Roman communion,—Thomas Innes, the
                    Scottish antiquary, and Dr John Lanigan, the ecclesiastical historian of
                    Ireland. In 1857 Dr Reeves, now dean of Armagh, published his edition of
                    Adamnan’s <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> enriched with notes and dissertations
                    which throw light on all the events of the saint’s personal history and on
                    everything connected with the state of Celtic Britain at the time. Later still
                    we have an account of Columba by Count Montalembert, who, in his third volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Monks of the West,</hi> gives us, to use Gibbon’s
                    well-known words about Pope’s Homer, “a portrait endowed with every merit
                    excepting that of likeness to the original.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(g.
