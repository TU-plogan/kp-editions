                <p>The opening and laying out, or, as it is generally called, “winning,” of new
                    collieries is rarely undertaken without a preliminary examination of the
                    character of the strata by means of borings, either for the purpose of
                    determining the number and nature of the coal-seams in new ground, or the
                    position of the particular seam or seams which it is proposed to work in
                    extensions of known coal-fields.</p>
                <p>The principle of proving a mineral field by boring is illustrated by figure 3,
                    which represents a line direct from the dip to the rise of the field, the
                    inclination of the strata being one in eight. No. 1 bore is commenced at the
                    dip, and reaches a seam of coal A, at 40 fathoms; at this depth it is considered
                    proper to remove nearer to the outcrop, so that lower strata may be bored into
                    at a less depth, and a second bore is commenced. To find the position of No. 2,
                    so as to form a continuous section, it is necessary to reckon the inclination of
                    the strata, which is 1 in 8: and as bore No. 1 was 40 fathoms in depth, we
                    multiply the depth by the rate of inclination, 40 × 8 = 320 fathoms, which gives
                    the point at which the coal seam A should reach the surface. But there is
                    generally a certain depth of alluvial cover which requires to be deducted, and
                    which we call 3 fathoms, then (40 - 3 = 37) × 8 = 296 fathoms <hi rend="italic"
                    >; or</hi> say 286 fathoms is the distance that the second bore should be placed
                    to the rise of the first, so as to have for certain the seam of coal A in clear
                    connection with the seam of coal B. In bore No. 3, where the seam B, according
                    to the same system of arrangement, should have been found at or near the
                    surface, another seam C is proved at a considerable depth, differing in
                    character and thickness from either of the preceding. This derangement being
                    carefully noted, another bore to the outcrop on the same principle is put down
                    for the purpose of proving the seam C; the nature of the strata at first is
                    found to agree with the latter part of that bored through in No. 3, but
                    immediately on crossing the dislocation seen in the figure it is changed, and
                    the deeper seam D is found.</p>
                <p>The evidence therefore of these bores (3 and 4) indicates some material
                    derangement, which is then proved by other bores, either towards the dip or the
                    outcrop, according to the judgment of the borer, so as to ascertain the best
                    position for sinking pits.</p>
                <p>The methods of boring are similar to those adopted for deep wells, or in other
                    departments of mining. For shallow<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n75/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0075-0062"/> bores, the boring is generally with wrought iron
                    rods screwed together in lengths, armed with a cutting chisel, and working by
                    percussion, the tool being lifted by hand and allowed to fall with its full
                    weight upon the rock. The pounded material is removed at intervals, by
                    substituting a shell pump or tube with valves at the bottom, whose action is
                    similar to that of the foot valves of an ordinary lifting pump. The sludge
                    brought to the surface indicates the nature of the ground passed through. In
                    very deep borings, however, the use of rigid rods and fixed tools is found to
                    present two serious evils, namely, the excessive weight on the tool caused by
                    the increased length of the rods, and the great length of time required to
                    withdraw the tool and remove the detritus. The first of these difficulties has
                    been overcome by the use of the free falling cutters, where the tool, instead of
                    being attached rigidly to the rod, moves in a guide-block in such a manner as to
                    be lifted with the rods, falling freely when the top of the stroke is reached.
                    The rods, when lowered, pick up the tool at the bottom of the hole in readiness
                    for the next lift. By this means the momentum of the tool is kept constant
                    whatever may be the weight of rods employed.</p>
                <p>The use of a wire rope winding on a drum, instead of rods for suspending the
                    boring tool, allows the latter to be withdrawn and replaced with much greater
                    rapidity than can be done with rods. This method has been very successfully
                    adopted by Messrs Mather &amp; Platt of Salford. But perhaps the best methods of
                    expeditious boring are those (Fauvelle’s) whereby the detritus is removed as it
                    forms by continuously flushing out the hole with water, hollow rods being used
                    down which the water flows while it rises through the annular space between the
                    rod and the lining tube of the bore hole. This has the advantage of giving a
                    clear surface for the tool to cut on, instead of its having to work through its
                    own sludge, as is the case when the shell pump is only used at intervals. Of
                    late years the value of boring for exploratory purposes has been much increased
                    by the adoption of tubular or crown borers, which cut out an annular groove,
                    leaving a core of unbroken rock in the centre, which is then brought out by a
                    grapnel in a solid piece. One of. the most successful of these methods is that
                    due to Leschot of Geneva, where a rotating cutter, armed with amorphous black
                    diamond, the hardest known substance, is used, the detritus being continuously
                    removed by water on Fauvelle’s plan. The machinery adopted for this purpose, as
                    modified by Messrs Beaumont &amp; Appleby, has been employed with great success
                    to bore holes exceeding 2000 feet in depth.</p>
                <p>The working of coal may be conducted either by means of levels or galleries
                    driven from the outcrop in a valley, or by shafts or pits sunk from the surface.
                    In the early days of coal mining, open working, or quarrying from the outcrop of
                    the seams, was practised to a considerable extent; but there are now few if any
                    places in England where this can be done. In 1873 there could be seen, in the
                    thick coal seams of Bengal, near Raniganj, a seam about 50 feet thick laid bare,
                    over an area of several acres, by stripping off a superficial covering varying
                    from 10 to 30 feet, in order to remove the whole of the coal without loss by
                    pillars. Such a case, however, is quite exceptional. The operations by which the
                    coal is reached and laid out for removal are known as “winning,” the actual
                    working or extraction of the coal being termed “getting.” In the accompanying
                    figure, No. 4, A B is a cross cut-level, by which the seams of coal 1 and 2 are
                    won, and C D a vertical shaft by which the seams 1, 2, and 3 are won. When the
                    field is won by the former method, the coal lying above the level is said to be
                    “level-free.” The mode of winning by level is of less general application than
                    that by shafts° as the capacity for production is less, owing to the smaller
                    size of roadways by which the coal must be brought to the surface, levels of
                    large section being expensive and difficult to keep open when the mine has been
                    for some time at work. Shafts, on the other hand, may be made of almost any
                    capacity, owing to the high speed in drawing which is attainable with proper
                    mechanism, and allow of the use of more perfect arrangements at the surface than
                    can usually bo adopted at the mouth of a level on a hill side. A more cogent
                    reason, however, is to be found in the fact that the principal coal-fields are
                    in flat countries, and where the coal can only be reached by vertical
                    sinking.</p>
                <p>The methods adopted in driving levels for collieries are generally similar to
                    those adopted in other mines. The ground is secured by timbering, or more
                    usually by arching in masonry or brick-work. Levels like that in fig. 4, which
                    are driven across the stratification, or generally anywhere not in coal, are
                    known as “stone drifts.” The sinking of colliery shafts, however, differs
                    considerably from that of other mines, owing to their generally large size, and
                    the difficulties that are often encountered from water during the sinking. The
                    actual coal measure strata, consisting mainly of shales and clays, are generally
                    imperγious to water, but when strata of a permeable character are sunk through,
                    such as the magnesian limestone of the north of England, the Permian sandstones
                    of the central countries, or the chalk and greensand in the north of France and
                    Westphalia, special methods are required in order to pass the waterbearing beds,
                    and to protect the shaft and workings from the influx of water subsequently. Of
                    these methods one of the chief is the plan of tubbing, or lining the excavation
                    with an impermeable casing of wood or iron, generally the latter, which is built
                    up in segments forming rings, that are piled upon each other throughout the
                    whole depth of the water-bearing strata. This method necessitates the use of
                    very considerable pumping power during the sinking, as the water has to be kept
                    down in order to allow the sinkers to reach a water-tight stratum upon which the
                    foundation of the tubbing can be placed. This consists in a heavy cast-iron
                    ring, known as a wedging crib, or curb, also fitted together in segments, which
                    is lodged in a square-edged groove cut for its reception, tightly caulked with
                    moss, and wedged into position. Upon this the tubbing is built up in segments,
                    usually from 10 to 12 being required for the entire cir cumference, the edges
                    being made perfectly true. The thickness varies according to the pressure
                    expected, but may be taken at from ¾ to 1∣ inches. The inner face is smooth, but
                    the back is strengthened with angle brackets at the corners. A small hole is
                    left in the centre of each segment, which is kept open during the fitting to
                    prevent undue pressure upon any one, but is stopped as soon as the circle is
                    completed. In the north of France and Belgium wooden tubbings, built of
                    polygonal rings, were at one time in general use. The polygons adopted were of
                    20 or more sides approximating to a circular form.</p>
                <p>The second principal method of sinking through waterbearing ground is that which
                    was first adopted by Μ.</p>

                <p>Triger, in France, and has also been used by civil engineers in putting down deep
                    foundations for bridge piers, namely, by compressed air. The shaft is lined with
                    a cylinder of "wrought iron, within which a tubular chamber, provided with doors
                    above and below, known as an air-lock, is fitted by a telescopic joint, which is
                    tightly packed so as to close the top of the shaft air-tight. Air is then forced
                    into the inclosed space by means of a compressing engine, until the pressure is
                    sufficient to oppose the flow of water into the excavation, and to drive out any
                    that may collect i n the bottom of the shaft through a pipe which is carried
                    through the air-sluice to the surface. The miners work in the bottom in the same
                    manner as divers in an - ordinary diving-bell. Access to the surface is obtained
                    through the double doors of the air sluice, the pressure being reduced to that
                    of the external atmosphere when it is desired to open the upper door, and
                    increased to that of the working space below when it is intended to communicate
                    with the sinkers, or to raise the stuff broken in the bottom. This method has
                    been adopted in various sinkings on the Continent. At Bracquenie, near Mons, the
                    miners worked in an atmosphere up to 45 ft pressure on the square inch, without
                    experiencing any great difficulty, but they were found to be more susceptible to
                    pulmonary disorder upon changes of weather than those who worked under the
                    ordinary conditions of pressure.</p>
                <p>The third method of sinking through water-bearing strata is that of boring,
                    adopted by Messrs Kind &amp; Chaudron in Belgium and Germany. For this purpose a
                    horizontal bar armed with vertical cutting chisels is used, which cuts out the
                    whole section of the shaft simultaneously. In the first instance, a smaller
                    cutting frame is used, boring a hole from 3 to 5 feet in diameter, which is kept
                    some 50 or 60 feet in advance, so as to receive the detritus, which is removed
                    by a shell pump of large size. The large trepan or cutter weighs about 16 tons,
                    and cuts a hole of from 9 to 15 feet in diameter. The water-tight lining may be
                    either a wrought iron tube, which is. pressed down by jack screws as the bore
                    hole advances, or cast-iron tubbing put together in short complete rings, in
                    contradistinction to the old plan of building them up of segments. The tubbing,
                    which is considerably let« in diameter than the bore hole, is suspended by rods
                    from the surface until a bed suitable for a foundation is reached, upon which a
                    sliding length of tube, known as the moss box, bearing a shoulder, which is
                    filled with dried moss, is placed. The whole weight of the tubbing is made to
                    bear on the moss, which squeezes outwards, forming a completely water-tight
                    joint. The interval between the back of the tubbing and the sides of the bore
                    hole is then filled up with concrete, which on setting fixes the tubbing firmly
                    in position.</p>
                <p>The introduction of these special methods has considerably simplified the problem
                    of sinking through water-bearing strata. Some of the earlier sinkings of this
                    kind, when pumps had to be depended on for keeping down the water, were
                    conducted at great cost, as, for instance, at South Hetton, and more recently
                    Ryhope, near Sunderland, through the magnesian limestone of Durham.</p>
                <p>The size and form of colliery shafts varies in different districts, but the
                    tendency is now generally to make them round, and from 12 to 15 feet in
                    diameter. In the Midland counties, from 7 to 9 feet is a very common size, but
                    larger dimensions are adopted where a large production is required. At Bagillt,
                    on the Dee, a shaft of 22 feet in diameter was commenced a few years ago, but
                    was reduced in diameter a short distance down. Since the accident at Hartley
                    colliery, caused by the breaking of the pumping engine beam, which fell into the
                    shaft and blocked it up, whereby the whole company of men in the mine were
                    starved to death—it has been made compulsory upon mine owners to have two pits
                    for each working, in place of the single one divided by walls or brattices which
                    was formerly thought sufficient. The use of two independent connections—whether
                    separate pits or sections of the same pit, between the surface and the
                    workings—is necessary for the service of the ventilation,—fresh air from the
                    surface being carried down one, known as the “downcast,” while the foul or
                    return air of the mine rises through the other or “upcast” pit back to the
                    surface. Where the mine is heavily watered, it is often necessary to establish a
                    special engine pit, with pumps permanently fixed, or a division of one of the
                    pits may be devoted to this purpose. The use of direct-acting high-pressure
                    pumping engines placed at the bottom of the shaft has become common during the
                    last ten years. They have the advantage of doing away with the heavy
                    reciprocating rod from the engine at the surface, and may be worked either by
                    steam pipes carried down the pit, or, what is now more common, by boilers
                    underground, which supply also steam for the underground hauling engines. Where
                    the water does not accumulate very rapidly'it is a very common practice to allow
                    it to" collect in a pit or sump below the working bottom of the shaft, and to
                    draw it off in a water tub or bucket by the main engine, when the latter is not
                    employed in raising coal.</p>
                <p>The laying out of a colliery, after the coal has been won, by sinkings or levels,
                    may be accomplished in various ways, according to the nature of the coal, its
                    thickness and dip, and the extent of ground to be worked. In the South
                    Staffordshire and other Midland coal-fields, where only shallow pits are
                    required, and the coals are thick, a pair of pits may be sunk for a very few
                    acres, while in the North of England, on the other hand, where sinking is
                    expensive, an area of some thousands of acres may be commanded from the same
                    number of pits. In the latter case, which represents the most approved practice,
                    the sinking is usually placed about the centre of the ground, so that the
                    workings may radiate in every direction from the pit bottom, with the view of
                    employing the greatest number of hands to advantage. Where a large area cannot
                    be commanded, it is best to sink to the lowest point of the field for the
                    convenience of drawing the coal and water which become level-free in regard to
                    the pit. Where properties are much divided, it is always necessary to maintain a
                    thick barrier of unwrought coal between the boundary of the mine and the
                    neighbouring workings, especially if the latter are to the dip. If a prominent
                    line of fault crosses the area, it may usually be a convenient division of the
                    field into sections or districts. The first process in laying out the workings
                    consists in driving a gallery on the level along the course of the coal seam,
                    which is known as a “dip head level,” and a lower parallel one, in which the
                    water collects, known as a “lodgment level.” Galleries driven at right angles to
                    these are known as “dip” or “rise headings,” according to their position above
                    or below the pit bottom. In Staffordshire the main levels are also known as
                    “gate roads.” To secure the perpendicularity of the shaft, it is necessary to
                    leave a large mass or pillar of the seam untouched around the pit bottom. This
                    pillar is known in Scotland as the “pit bottom stoop.” The junction of the
                    levels with the pit is known as the “pit eye;” it is usually of an enlarged
                    section, and lined with masonry or brickwork, so as to afford room for handling
                    the waggons or trams of coal brought from the working faces. In this portion of
                    the pit are generally placed the furnaces for ventilation, and the boilers
                    required for working steam-engines underground, as well as the stables and lamp
                    cabin.</p>
                <p>Figs. 5 and 6 represent the pit bottom arrangements at Cambois colliery in
                    Northumberland, which are of an extremely commodious character. There are four
                    large Cornish boilers, supplying steam to the engines drawing <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0077-0064"/> coals from the workings, as well as to a
                    direct-acting pumping engine, the flame and smoke being discharged by drifts
                    into the upcast pit. For the purpose of handling large pieces of machinery and
                    boilers, the level at the bottom is increased to a chamber 18 feet high, and
                    roofed with rolled iron girders of a double T section. To protect the fillers
                    working at the bottom, strong diagonal guard timbers are placed at S in order to
                    deflect any materials falling down the shaft, and prevent them falling into the
                    workings. This is an unusually large example, but is taken from a pit in the
                    highest state of development, and making a very large daily outturn.</p>
                <p>The removal of the coal after the roads have been driven may be effected in many
                    different ways, according to the custom of the district, These may, however all
                    be considered as modifications of two systems viz., pillar work and long-wall
                    work, In the former, which is also known as “port and stall” or “bord and
                    pillar” in the north of England, “pillar and stall” in South Wales, and “stoop
                    and room” in Scotland, the field is divided into strips by numerous openings
                    driven parallel to the main rise headings, called “bords” or “bord gates,” which
                    are again divided by cutting through them at intervals, so as to leave a series
                    of pillars arranged chequer-wise over the entire area. These pillars are left
                    for the support of the roof as the workings advance, so as to keep the mine open
                    and free from waste. Fig. 1, Plate III. represents the oldest form of this class
                    of working as practised in Scotland, from which it will be seen that if the size
                    of the pillar is equal to the width of the stall or excavation, about ¾ of the
                    whole seam will be removed, the remainder being left in the pillars. A portion
                    of this may be got by the process known as robbing the pillars, but the coal so
                    obtained is liable to be very much crushed from the pressure of the
                    superincumbent strata. This crushing may take place either from above or below,
                    producing what are known as “creeps” or “sits.”</p>
                <p>A coal seam with a soft pavement and a hard roof is the most subject to a
                    “creep.” The first indication is a dull hollow sound heard when treading on the
                    pavement or floor, probably occasioned by some of the individual layers parting
                    from each other as shown at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> fig. 7; the succeeding
                    stages of creep are shown at δ, <hi rend="italic">c, d, f,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">g,</hi> in the same figure; the last being the final stage, when
                    the coal begins to sustain the pressure from the overlying strata, in common
                    with the disturbed pavement.</p>
                <p>“Sits” are the reverse of creeps; in the one case the pavement is forced up, and
                    in the other the roof is forced or falls down, for want of proper support or
                    tenacity in itself. This accident generally arises from an improper size of
                    pillars <hi rend="italic">; some</hi> roofs, however, are so difficult to
                    support that sits take place where the half of the coal is left in pillars.</p>
                <p>Fig. 8 will convey a general idea of the appearance of sits,— <hi rend="italic"
                    >k,</hi><hi rend="italic">m,</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi> showing different
                    stages.</p>
                <p>The modern method of pillar working is shown in Plate IV. In the Northumberland
                    steam-coal district, where it is carried out in the most perfect manner, the
                    boards are 5 to 6 yards in width, while the pillars are 22 yards broad and 30
                    yards long, which are subsequently got out on coming back. In the same figure is
                    also shown the method of working whole coal and pillars at the same time, a
                    barrier of two or three ranges of pillars or a rib of solid coal being left
                    between the working in the solid and those in the pillars. The space from which
                    the entire quantity of coal has been removed is known in different districts as
                    the “goaf,” “gob,” or “waste.”</p>
                <p>Fig. 9 represents the Lancashire system of pillarworking. The area is laid out by
                    two pairs of level drifts, parallel to each other, about 150 yards apart, which
                    are carried to the boundary. About 100 yards back from the boundary a
                    communication is made between these levels, from which other levels are driven
                    forward, dividing the coal into ribs of about 25 or 30 yards wide, which are
                    then cut back by taking off the coal in slices from the level towards the rise
                    in breadths of about six yards. By this method the whole of the coal is got
                    backwards, the main roads being kept in solid coal; the intermediate levels not
                    being driven till they are wanted, a greater amount cf support<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n82/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0082-0065"/> is given, and the pillars are less crushed than
                    is usual in pillar working.</p>
                <p>In the South Wales system of working, cross headings are driven from the main
                    roads obliquely across the rise to get a sufficiently easy gradient for horse
                    roads, and from these the stalls are opened out with a narrow entrance, in order
                    to leave support on either side of the road, but afterwards widening to as great
                    a breadth as the seam will allow, leaving pillars of a minimum thickness. The
                    character of such workings is very irregular in plan, and as the ventilation is
                    attended with considerable difficulty, it is now becoming generally superseded
                    by more improved methods.</p>
                <p>The second great principle of working is that known as long-wall or long-work, in
                    which the coal is taken away either in broad faces from roads about 40 or 50
                    yards apart and parallel to each other, or along curved faces between roads
                    radiating from the pit bottom—the essential feature in both cases being the
                    removal of the whole of the coal at once, without first sub-dividing it into
                    pillars, to be taken away at a second working. The roof is temporarily supported
                    by wooden props or pack walling of stone, for a sufficient breadth along the
                    face to protect the workmen, and allow them to work together behind. The general
                    character of a long-wall working is shown in fig. 10, which represents an area
                    of about 500 acres of the bottom hard steam coal at Shipley in Derbyshire. The
                    principal road extends from the shafts southward; and on both sides of it the
                    coal has been removed from the light-shaded area by cutting it back
                    perpendicularly towards the boundaries, along faces about 50 yards in length,
                    those nearest to the shaft being kept in advance of those farther away,
                    producing a step-shaped outline to the face of the whole coal. It will be seen
                    that by this method the whole of the seam, with the exception of the pillars
                    left to protect the main roadways, is removed. The roads for drawing the coal
                    from the working faces to the shaft are kept open by walling through the waste
                    or goaf produced by the fall of the unsupported roof. The straight roads are the
                    air-ways for carrying pure air from the down-cast shaft to the working faces,
                    while the return air passes along the faces and back to the up-cast by the
                    curved road. The above is the method of working long-wall forward, t.e., taking
                    the coal in advance from the pit towards the boundary, with roads kept open
                    through the gob. Another method consists in driving towards the boundary, and
                    taking the coal backward towards the shafts, or working homeward, allowing the
                    waste to close up without roads having to be kept open through it. This is of
                    course preferable, but is only applicable where the owner of the mine can afford
                    to expend the capital required to reach the limit of the field in excess of that
                    necessary when the raising of coal proceeds <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi>
                    with the extension of the main roads. Fig. 9 is substantially a modification of
                    this kind of long-wall work. Plate III. fig 2, represents a method of working
                    practised in the South Yorkshire district, known as bords and banks. The field
                    is divided by levels and headings into rectangular banks, while from the main
                    levels bords or wickets about 30“ yards wide, separated from each other by banks
                    of about the same width, are carried forward in longwall work, as shown on the
                    left side of the figure, the waste being carefully packed behind so as to secure
                    the ventilation. When these have been worked up to the extremity, as shown on
                    the right side, the intermediate bank is removed by working backward towards the
                    level. This system, therefore, combines both methods of long-wall working, but
                    is not generally applicable, owing to the difficulty of ventilation, due to the
                    great length of air-way that has to be kept open around the waste on each
                    bank.</p>
                <p>The relative advantages of the different methods may be generally stated as
                    follows. Long-wall work is best suited for thin coals, and those having a good
                    roof, <hi rend="italic">iae.,</hi> one that gives way gradually and fills up the
                    excavation made by removing the coal without scaling off suddenly and falling
                    into the working faces, when practically the whole of the coal may be removed.
                    Against these advantages must be placed the difficulties attending the
                    maintenance of roads through the goaves, and in some cases the large proportion
                    of slack to round or large coal obtained. Pillar working, in the whole coal, is
                    generally reputed to give a more advantageous proportion of round coal to slack,
                    the latter being more abundantly produced on the removal of the pillars, but as
                    these form only a small portion of the whole seam, the general yield is more
                    advantageous than in the former method. The ventilation of pillar working is
                    often attended with difficulty, and the coal is longer exposed to the influence
                    of the air, a point of importance in some coals, which deteriorate in quality
                    when exposed to a hot damp atmosphere. The great increase in the size of the
                    pillars in the best modern collieries worked upon this principle has, however,
                    done much to approximate the two systems to an equality in other respects.</p>
                <p>The working of very thick seams presents certain special peculiarities, owing to
                    the difficulties of supporting the roof in the excavated portions, and supplying
                    fresh air to the workings. The most typical example of this kind of working in
                    England is afforded by the thick coal of South Staffordshire, which consists of
                    a series of closely associated coal seams, varying from 8 to 12 or 13, divided
                    from each other by their partings, but making together one great bed of from 25
                    to 40 feet or more in thickness. The partings together do not amount to more
                    than 2 or 3 feet. The method of working which has been long in use is
                    represented in fig. 11. The main level or gate road is driven in the benches
                    coal, or lower part of the seam, while a smaller drift for ventilation, called
                    an air heading, is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n83/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0083-0066"/> carried above it in one of the upper beds called
                    the slipper coal. From the gate road a heading called a bolt-hole is opened, and
                    extended into a large rectangular chamber, known as a “side of work,” large
                    pillars being left at regular intervals, besides smaller ones or cogs. The order
                    in which the coal is cut is shown in the dotted and numbered squares in the
                    figure. The coal is first cut to the top of the slipper coal from below, after
                    which the upper portion is either broken down by wedging or falls of itself. The
                    working of these upper portions is exceedingly dangerous, owing to the great
                    height of the excavations, and fatal accidents from falls of roof are in
                    consequence more common in South Staffordshire than in any other coal-field in
                    this country. The air from the down-cast shaft enters from the gate road, and
                    passes to the up-cast through the air heading above. About one-half of the total
                    coal (or less) is obtained in the first working; the roof is then allowed to
                    fall, and when the gob is sufficiently consolidated, fresh roads are driven
                    through it to obtain the ribs and pillars left behind by a second or even, in
                    some cases,.a third working. The loss of coal by this method is very
                    considerable, besides great risk to life and danger from fire. It has,
                    therefore, been to some extent superseded by the long-wall method, the upper
                    half being taken at the first working, and removed as completely as possible,
                    working backwards from the boundaries to the shaft. The lower half is then taken
                    in the same manner, after the fallen roof has become sufficiently consolidated
                    to allow the mine to be re-opened.</p>
                <p>In the working of thick seams inclined at a high angle, such as those in the
                    south of France, and in the lignite mines of Styria and Bohemia, the method of
                    working in horizontal slices, about 12 or 15 feet thick, and filling up the
                    excavation with broken rock and earth from the surface, is now generally adopted
                    in preference to the systems formerly used. At Monceaux les Mines, in France, a
                    seam 40 feet thick, and dipping at an angle of 20 degrees, is worked in the
                    following manner. A level is driven in a sandstone forming the floor, along the
                    course of the coal, into which communications are made by cross cuts at
                    intervals of 16 yards, which are driven across to the roof, dividing up the area
                    to be worked into panels· These are worked backwards, the coal being taken to a
                    height of 20 feet, the opening being packed up with stone sent down from the
                    surface. As each stage is worked out, the floor level is connected with that
                    next below it by means of an incline, which facilitates the introduction of the
                    packing material. Stuff containing a considerable amount of clay is found to be
                    the best suited for the purpose of filling, as it consolidates readily under
                    pressure.</p>
                <p>The actual cutting of the coal is chiefly performed by manual labour, the tool
                    employed being a sharp-pointed double-armed pick, which is nearly straight,
                    except when required for use in hard rock, when the arms are made with an
                    inclination or “anchored.” The terms pike, pick, mandril, and slitter are
                    applied to the collier’s pick in different districts, the men being known as
                    pikemen or fiewers. In driving levels it is necessary to cut grooves vertically
                    parallel to the walls, a process known as shearing; but the most important
                    operation is that known as holing or kirving, which consists in cutting a notch
                    or groove in the floor of the seam to a depth of about 3 feet, measured back
                    from the face, so as to leave the overhanging part unsupported, which then
                    either falls of its own accord within a few hours, or is brought down either by
                    driving wedges along the top, or by blasting with gunpowder. The process of
                    holing in coal is one of the severest kinds of human labour. It has to be
                    performed in a constrained position, and the miner lying on his side has to cut
                    to a much greater height, in order to get room to carry the groove in to a
                    sufficient depth, than is required to bring the coal down, giving rise to a
                    great waste in slack as compared with machine work. This is sometimes obviated
                    by holing in the beds below the coal, or in any portion of a seam of inferior
                    quality that may not be worth working. This loss is proportionately greater in
                    thin than in thick seams, the same quantity being cut to waste in either case.
                    The method of cutting coal on the long-wall system is seen in fig. 12,
                    representing the working at the Shipley colliery. The coal is 40 inches thick,
                    with a seam of fire-clay and a roof of black shale , about 6 inches of the upper
                    part, known as the roof coal, not being worth working, is left behind. A groove
                    of triangular section of 30 inches base and 9 inches high is cut along the face,
                    inclined timber props being placed at intervals to support the overhanging
                    portion until the required length is cut. These are then removed, and the coal
                    is allowed to fall, wedges or blasting being employed when necessary. The roof
                    of the excavation is supported as the coal is removed, by packing up the waste
                    material, and by a double row of props, two feet from each other, placed
                    tern-porarily<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n86/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0086-0067"/> along the face. These are placed 5 feet apart,
                    the props of the back row alternating with those in front. The p^rops used are
                    preferably of small oak or English larch, but large quantities of fir props, cut
                    to the right length, are also imported from the north of Europe. As the work
                    proceeds onwards, the props are withdrawn and replaced in advance, except those
                    that may be crushed by the pressure or buried by sudden falls of the roof.</p>
                <p>In Yorkshire hollow square pillars, formed by piling up short blocks of wood or
                    chocks, are often used instead of props formed of a single stem. Iron pit props
                    have been proposed at different times, but their use has not become general.
                    When the coal has been under-cut for a sufficient length, the struts are
                    withdrawn, and the overhanging mass is allowed to fall during the time that the
                    workmen are out of the pit, or it may be brought down by driving wedges, or if
                    it be of a compact character a blast of gunpowder in a bore hole near the roof
                    may be required. Sometimes, but rarely, it happens that it is necessary to cut
                    vertical grooves in the face to determine the limit of the fall, such limits
                    being usually dependent upon the cleet or divisional planes in the coal,
                    especially when the work is carried perpendicular to them or on the end.</p>
                <p>The substitution of machinery for hand labour in cutting coal has long been a
                    favourite problem with inventors, the earliest plan being that of Menzies, in
                    1761, who proposed to work a heavy pick underground by power transmitted from an
                    engine at the surface, through the agencies of spear-rods and chains passing
                    over pulleys; but none of the methods suggested proved to be practically
                    successful until the general introduction of compressed air into mines furnished
                    a convenient motive power, susceptible of being carried to considerable
                    distances without any great loss of pressure. This agent has of late years been
                    applied in various ways, in machines which either imitate the action of the
                    collier by cutting with a pick or make a groove by rotating cutters attached to
                    an endless chain or a revolving disc or wheel. The most successful of the first
                    class, or pick machines, is that of Mr William Firth of Sheffield, represented
                    in fig. 13. It consists essen tially of a horizontal piston and cylinder engine
                    fixed upon a platform carried upon four wheels, which are coupled together by
                    side rods, so that on motion being communicated by means of a mitre wheel in the
                    hind axle, it can be moved forward by hand. On the forward end of the frame are
                    two bosses forming the centres for a pair of bell cranks or bent levers placed
                    close to the ground, and facing in opposite directions, either one of which can
                    be con nected with the piston rod. The outer arm of each lever carries a square
                    socket, into which is fixed the pick, which has two cutting heads, one placed a
                    little in front of the other so as to cut to the whole depth at one operation.
                    In the older forms picks of different length were used, and it was necessary to
                    go over the work a second or third time, in order to hole to the full depth. The
                    cutting points are loose, being secured by cotters to the pick head, so that
                    broken or blunted ones can be readily replaced without removing the pick arm.
                    The power used is air, at about 40 to 60 ft&gt; above atmospheric pressure. It
                    is conducted from the reservoir connected with a compressing engine at the
                    surface, through iron pipes fixed in the pit, and along the main roads to the
                    working face, where thick vulcanized india-rubber pipes are used, sufficient
                    length of pipe lying loose on the ground to allow the engine to move freely, the
                    connection being made by a screwed joint at the back of the slide-valve chest.
                    The valve is worked by tappets on the piston-rod, so as to be perfectly
                    self-acting when properly adjusted; it can also bo moved by hand. The pick
                    holders face in opposite directions, in order that the machine may be worked
                    from either side. The size of the machine as ordinarily made is about 4 feet in
                    length, 2 feet 2 inches high, and from 18 to 24 inches gauge of rails. The
                    weight is about 15 cwt. The working speed is from 60 to 90 strokes per minute,
                    corresponding to a length of from 10 to 20 yards, cut to a depth of 3 feet per
                    hour. At the former rate, or 60 yards per shift of 6 hours, the work done
                    corresponds to that of twelve average men. The width of the groove is from 2 to
                    3 inches at the face, diminishing to 1∣ inches at the back, the proportion of
                    waste being very considerably diminished as compared with the system of holing
                    by hand. The use of this machine has allowed a thin seam of cannel, from 10 to
                    14 inches in thickness, to be worked to profit, which had formerly been
                    abandoned as too hard to be worked by hand-labour.</p>
                <p>An earlier form of the second class of machine, in which the cutters have a
                    continuous motion like those of a slotting machine, is that invented by Mr
                    William Peace in the Wigan district, which is reproduced from the last edition
                    as illustrating the principle which has since been carried out by other
                    inventors in a more convenient and simplified form. It is represented in Plate
                    V., figs. 1, 2, and 3. AAA is the frame, upon which are fixed one or more
                    cylinders B, arranged so as to turn a crank shaft C, fixed to the frame, as is
                    also another shaft D. This latter is capable of being turned by the former, by
                    means of mitre or bevel wheels EEE; upon the lower end of the latter shaft D is
                    placed a wheel termed the driving wheel, having upon its periphery a groove with
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n87/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0087-0068"/> suitable projections for working into and
                    propelling a chain or band. Beneath or to the side of the frame (or both) is
                    fixed temporarily or otherwise a lever, the extremity of which is constructed to
                    carry a wheel called the terminal wheel, marked IIH; a chain or band is made to
                    pass round the driving and terminal wheels, and by means of the driving wheel FF
                    it is made to revolve. Into the chain are °fixed cutters of different forms (see
                    the parts marked, figs. 4, 5, 6, and 7), which, when the machine is in action,
                    revolve with it, and upon being pressed or drawn against the coal, erode and
                    excavate the same. The distance of the excavation from the face of the coal is
                    governed by the dimensions of the machine, and by the length of the lever and
                    the distance between the driving and terminal wheels. The arrangements of the
                    lever allow it to revolve, and to excavate any given range; see dotted lines
                    fig. 1.</p>
                <p>If found necessary, two or even three levers may be in operation at the same
                    time, and arranged to cut in any direction. Other parts of the machine not
                    particularly described are capable of elevating and depressing the front part of
                    the machine, marked V, T, U, W; and those marked X, Y, Z, and K are capable of
                    propelling the machine whilst at work, by acting against the prop.</p>
                <p>The Gartsherrie machine of Messrs Baird is of the same character, but the chain
                    of cutters works round a fixed frame or jib projecting at right angles from the
                    engine carriage, instead of traversing upon a centre, an arrangement which makes
                    it necessary to cut from the end of the block of coal to the full depth, instead
                    of holing into it from the face. The forward feed is given by a chain winding
                    upon a drum, which hauls upon a pulley fixed to a prop about 30 yards in
                    advance. This is one of the most compact form of machines, the smaller size
                    being only 20 inches high. With an air pressure of from 35 to 40 tt&gt; per
                    square inch, a length of from 300 to 350 feet of coal is holed, 2 ft, 9 in.
                    deep, in the shift of from 8 to 10 hours.</p>
                <p>One of the simplest forms of coal-cutting machines is that of Messrs Winstanly
                    &amp; Barker (fig. 14), which is driven by a pair of oscillating engines placed
                    on a frame ru’n- ∏ing on rails in the usual way. The crank shaft carries a
                    pinion which gears into a toothed wheel of a coarse pitch, carrying cutters at
                    the ends of the teeth. This wheel is mounted on a carrier which, being movable
                    about its centre by a screw gearing worked by hand, gives a radial sweep to the
                    cutting edges, as in the machine figured in Plate V. When at work it is slowly
                    turned until the carrier is at right angles to the frame, when the cut has
                    attained the full depth. The forward motion is given by a chain-winding upon a
                    crab placed in front, which is worked by a boy who hauls it slowly forward. With
                    25 lb pressure it will hole 3 feet deep, at the rate of 30 yards per hour, the
                    cut being only 2¾ in. high, but it will only work on one side of the
                    carriage.</p>
                <p>Another kind of application of machinery to coal mining-is that of Messrs Bidder
                    &amp; Jones, which is intended to replace the use of blasting with gunpowder for
                    bringing down the coal, a practice which in fiery collieries is often attended
                    with considerable danger from the flash of the explosion firing the gas given
                    off the coal. It consists of a small hydraulic press, which forces a set of
                    expanding bits or wedges into a bore-hole previously bored by a long screw augur
                    or drill, worked by hand, the action of the press being continued until a
                    sufficient strain is obtained to bring down the coal. The arrangement is, in
                    fact, a modification of the plug and feather system used in stone quarrying for
                    obtaining large blocks, but with the substitution of the powerful rending force
                    of the hydraulic press for hand-power in driving up the wedges. This apparatus
                    has been used at Harecastle in North Staffordshire, and found to work well, but
                    with the disadvantage of bringing down the coal in unmanageably large masses.
                    The use of gunpowder in very fiery mines is always attended with danger, and a
                    method of wedging down coal sufficiently perfected to be of general application
                    would add greatly to the security of the colliers in working such mines.</p>
                <p>The removal of the coal when broken from the working faces to the pit bottom or
                    to the main levels is effected mainly by hand labour when the mine is small, and
                    the distances to be traversed inconsiderable, and in mines of greater extent by
                    horse or steam traction. The simplest method is that of loading the broken coal
                    on to a sledge, which is dragged along the floor to the level, but now the
                    practice of carrying railways to the face is almost universal. The old form of
                    flat rail or tram is still largely used, the waggons having sharp-edged disc
                    wheels, but probably edge rails and flanged wheels are now more general. The
                    class of rail used is generally a flat-bottomed or bridge section, weighing from
                    15 to 25 tt&gt; per yard, laid upon cross sleepers, which, in roads that are
                    intended to be kept open for some time, are fixed down firmly, but are laid in a
                    temporary manner along the working faces, and in similar positions where it is
                    necessary to be continually shifting them, as, for instance, wheie coal-cutting
                    machines are used. The arrangement of the drawing roads at the face of a
                    long-wall colliery is seen in the plan fig. 12, where the rails are brought to
                    the face upon a smooth’ iron plate, upon which the trams can be easily handled
                    by turning on the flanges of the wheels. The names applied to the vehicles in
                    which the coal is carried vary considerably, as do also their size and capacity.
                    The word “corf” or “corve,” representing the old basket sledge, is one of the
                    most generally used, as are “tram,” signifying a tram waggon, and “tub,” of the
                    same signification as the last, but a representative of the old method of
                    drawing in wooden buckets. In South Staffordshire and other Midland districts, a
                    contrivance called a “skip” is the representative method of conveyance; this
                    consists of a platform with tram wheels, upon which the coal is built up to a
                    considerable height, the large pieces round the sides being kept together by
                    loose rings of sheet iron, and the intermediate spaces packed full with small
                    coal,—the whole arrangement representing a kind of cask. This, however, like
                    most of the similar primitive methods, is giving way to the more improved system
                    of tubs or trams. These are small railway trucks, generally with flanged wheels
                    and squaresided bodies, either of wood or wrought iron, varying in capacity from
                    4 cwt. in thin seams to 10 or 12 cwt. in thicker seams.</p>
                <p>In the removal of the coal from the workings the first portion of the journey is
                    generally performed by hand <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n88/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0088-0069"/> power, boys being employed to push the trams
                    before them to the main roads. In the thin seams of South Yorkshire and other
                    places, considerable journeys are often performed in this way, the boys known,
                    as “hurriers” or “putters” being obliged to crawl at full length, owing to the
                    lowness of the excavation. As a general rule boys are not allowed to work in
                    collieries when below 12 years of age, but in these thin mines special
                    exemptions are granted, permitting the use of younger boys as putters when
                    required. Where the levels are large, horse traction is in common use; tho trams
                    are formed up into trains, and from 6 to 15 vehicles are drawn by one horse. A
                    considerable number of ponies are imported into the northern ports of this
                    country from Norway and Iceland for this purpose every year. The supply of
                    horses is, however, becoming scarcer, and the price higher, so that the use of
                    underground engines is generally adopted where the output is sufficiently large
                    to justify the expenditure. This is done by hauling or, as it is calledin the
                    North of England, leading the trains of tubs by rope traction. In a large
                    colliery where the shafts are situated near the centre of the field, and the
                    workings extend on all sides, both to the dip and rise, the drawing roads for
                    the coal may be of three different kinds,—(1) levels driven at right angles to
                    the dip, suitable for horse roads, (2) rise ways, known as jinny roads,
                    jig-brows, or up-brows, which, when of sufficient slope, may be used as
                    self-acting planes, f.e., the loaded waggons may be made to pull back the empty
                    ones to the working faces, and (3) dip or down-brows, requiring engine power. A
                    road may be used as a self-acting or gravitating incline when the gradient is 1
                    in 30 or steeper, in which case the train is lowered by a rope passing over a
                    pulley or brake drum at the upper end, the return empty train being attached to
                    the opposite end of the rope and hauled up by the descending load. The
                    arrangements for this purpose vary, of course, with the amount of work to be
                    done with one fixing of the machinery; where it is likely to be used for a
                    considerable time, the drum and brake are solidly constructed, and the ropes of
                    steel or iron wiτe carefully guided over friction rollers, placed at intervals
                    between the rails to prevent them from chafing and wearing out on the ground.
                    Where the load has to be hauled up a rising gradient, underground engines,
                    driven by steam or compressed air, are now generally used. In some cases steam
                    generated in boilers at the surface is carried in pipes to the engines below,
                    but this can be done with less loss of power by sending down compressed air in
                    the same way. The use of underground boilers placed near the upcast pit, as in
                    fig. 6, so that the smoke and gases help the ventilating furnace, is most
                    convenient in the majority of cases. Water-pressure engines, driven by a column
                    of water equal to the depth of the pit, have also been employed for hauling.
                    These can, however, only be used advantageously where there are fixed pumps, the
                    fall of water generating the power resulting in a load to be removed by the
                    expenditure of an equivalent amount of power in the pumping engine above that
                    necessary for keeping down the mine water.</p>
                <p>There are four principal methods in which steam power can be applied to
                    underground traction. These, which have been discussed in the fullest manner in
                    the Report of the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers for 1867- 68,
                    are as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. Tail rope system.</p>
                <p>2. Endless chain system.</p>
                <p>3. Endless rope system on the ground.</p>
                <p>4. Endless rope system overhead.</p>
                <p>The three last may be considered as modifications of the same principle. In the
                    first, which is that generally used in Northumberland and Durham, a single line
                    of rails is used, the loaded tubs beiug drawn “out bye,” t'.e., towards the
                    shaft, and the empty ones returned “in bye,” or towards the working faces, by
                    reversing the engine; while in the other systems, double lines, with the rope
                    travelling continuously in the same direction, are the rule. On the tail rope
                    plan the engine has two drums worked by spur gearing, which can be connected
                    with, or cast loose from, the driving shaft at pleasure. The main rope, which
                    draws out the loaded tubs, coils upon one drum, and passes near the floor over
                    guide sheaves placed about 20 feet apart. The tail rope, which is of lighter
                    section than the main one, is coiled on the second drum, passes over similar
                    guide sheaves placed near the roof or side of the gallery round a pulley at the
                    bottom of the plane, and is fixed to the end of the train or set of tubs. When
                    the load is being drawn out, the engine pulls directly on the main rope, coiling
                    it on to its own drum, while the tail drum runs loose paying out its rope, a
                    slight brake pressure being used to prevent its running out too fast. When the
                    set arrives ont bye, the main rope will be wound up, and the tail rope pass out
                    from the drum to the end and back, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> twice the length
                    of the way; thq set is returned in bye, by reversing the engine, casting loose
                    the main, and coupling up the tail drum, so that the tail rope is wound up, and
                    the main rope paid out. This method, which is the oldest, having been in use for
                    twenty-five years or more in the North of England, is best adapted for ways that
                    are nearly level, or when many branches are intended to be worked from one
                    engine, and can be carried round curves of small radius without deranging the
                    trains; but as it is intermittent in action, considerable engine-power is
                    required in order to get up the required speed, which is from 8 to 10 miles per
                    hour. From 8 to 10 tubs are usually drawn in a set, the ways being often from
                    2000 to 3000 yards long. In dip workings the tail rope is often made to work a
                    pump connected with the bottom pulley, which forces the water back to the
                    cistern of the main pumping engine in the pit.</p>
                <p>For the endless chain system, which is much used in the Wigan district a double
                    line of w ay is necessary, one line for full and the other for empty tubs. The
                    chain passes over a pulley driven by the engine, placed at such a height as to
                    allow it to rest upon the tops of the tubs, and round a similar pulley at the
                    far end of the plane. The forward edge of the tub carries a projecting pin or
                    horn, with a notch into which the chain falls which drags the tub forward. The
                    road at the outer end is made of a less slope than the chain, so that on arrival
                    the tub is lowered, clears the pin, and so becomes detached from the chain. The
                    tubs are placed on at intervals of about 20 yards, the chain moving continuously
                    at a speed of from 2∣ to 4 miles per hour. This system presents the greatest
                    advantages in point of economy of driving power, especially where the gradients
                    are variable, but is expensive in first cost, and is not well suited for curves,
                    and branch roads cannot be worked continuously, as a fresh set of pulleys worked
                    by bevel gearing is required for each branch.</p>
                <p>The endless rope system may be used with either a single or double line of w ay,
                    but the latter is more generally advantageous. The rope, which is guided upon
                    sheaves between the rails, is taken twice round the head pulley; or a Fowler’s
                    clip pulley may be used. It is also customary to use a stretching pulley to keep
                    the rope strained when the pull of the load diminishes. This is done by passing
                    a loop at the upper end round a pulley mounted in a travelling frame, to which
                    is attached a weight of about 15 cwt. hanging by a chain. This weight pulls
                    directly against the rope; so if the latter slacks, the weight pulls out the
                    pulley frame and tightens it up again. The tubs are usually formed into sets of
                    from 2 to 12, the front one being coupled up by a short length of chain <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n89/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0089-0070"/> to a clamping hook formed of two jaws moulded to
                    the curve of the rope which are attached by the “run rider,’ as the driver
                    accompanying the train is called. This system in many respects resembles the
                    tail rope, but has the advantage of working with one-third less length of rope
                    for the same length of way.</p>
                <p>The endless rope system overhead is substantially similar to the endless chain.
                    The waggons are attached at intervals by short lengths of chain lapped twice
                    round the rope and hooked into one of the links, or in some cases the chains are
                    hooked into hempen loops on the main rope.</p>
                <p>One of the most important branches of colliery work is the management of the
                    ventilation, involving as it does the supply of fresh air to the men working in
                    the pit, as well as the removal of inflammable gases that may be given off by
                    the coal. This is effected by carrying through the workings a large volume of
                    air which is kept continually moving in the same direction, descending from the
                    surface by one or more pits known as intake or downcast pits, and leaving the
                    mine by a return or upcast pit. Such a circulation of air can only be effected
                    by mechanical means when the workings are of any extent, as will be apparent
                    from the following considerations :—</p>
                <p>If the shafts A and B, fig. 15, were of equal depth from the horizontal plane,
                    and connected by the mine C, the air would fill the openings and remain
                    quiescent. If the one were to the dip of the other, but communicating with the
                    surface at a higher level, as by fig. 16, it would sometimes happen, in summer,
                    that D would be the downcast, and E the upcast, and in winter, E the downcast,
                    and D the upcast. These conditions are induced by the temperature of the earth
                    at a certain depth being nearly constant, while the atmosphere is
                    changeable,—the column of air in D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> being at a lower
                    temperature in summer than the column of air E e, and the reverse in winter.</p>
                <p>The methods actually adopted are—(1 ) The rarefaction of the air in the upcast
                    pit by a furnace placed at the bottom; and (2) Exhaustion by machinery at the
                    surface. The former plan, although hitherto most generally used, is in many
                    places becoming replaced by some form of machine.</p>
                <p>The usual form of ventilating furnace is a plain firegrate placed under an arch,
                    and communicating with the upcast shaft by an inclined drift. It is separated
                    from the coal by a narrow passage walled and arched in brickwork on both sides.
                    The size of the grate varies with the requirements of the ventilation, but from
                    6 to 10 feet broad and from 6 to 8 feet long are usual dimensions. At Shireoaks
                    Colliery, in Nottinghamshire, a furnace consuming 6 tons of slack per 24 hours
                    upon a grate surface of 72 square feet maintains a circulation of about 120,000
                    cubic feet per minute. At Hetton Colliery, Durham, the grate is a long, narrow
                    rectangle, 25 feet by 5 feet, with numerous furnace-doors on the long side, so
                    arranged that the surface fired may be varied according to the amount of draught
                    required. There are two bunker-ìioles for coals, and a stoking passage, 7 feet
                    wide, in front of the furnace. The fire should be kept as thin and bright as
                    possible, to reduce the amount of smoke in the upcast. When the mine is free
                    from gas, the furnace may be worked by the return air, but it is better to take
                    fresh air directly from the downcast by a scale, or split, from the main
                    current. The return air from fiery workings is never allowed to approach the
                    furnace, but is carried into the upcast by a special channel, called a dumb
                    drift, some distance above the furnace drift, so as not to come in contact with
                    the products of combustion until they have been cooled below the igniting point
                    of fire-damp. Where the upcast pit is used for drawing coal, it is usual to
                    discharge the smoke and gases through a short lateral drift near the surface
                    into a tall chimney, so as to keep the pit-top as clear as possible for working.
                    Otherwise the chimney is built directly over the mouth of the pit.</p>
                <p>Various kinds of machines for ventilation, both by direct exhaustion and
                    centrifugal displacement, have been tried both in England and in Belgium. Of the
                    former class are the great bell machines, resembling gasometers, 12 feet to 22
                    feet in diameter, and 9 feet high, moving in a water-tank with balanced flap
                    valves for alternately admitting and exhausting the air. These were used at
                    Marihaye, near Liège, and at Cwm Avon in South Wales, by Mr Struvé. Perhaps the
                    largest of the class of piston machines is that at Nixon’s Navigation Pit, near
                    Aberdare, which has rectangular pistons, 30 feet by 22 feet, moving horizontally
                    through a stroke of 7 feet, the lower edge being supported by rollers running on
                    rails. The great weight of the moving parts in this class of machine makes them
                    incapable of acting at any very high speed, and consequently expensive for the
                    amount of work done. This is in some degree obviated in the rotary piston
                    machines of Fabry and Lemielle, the former resembling in principle Root’s
                    blower, now so much used in blowing foundry and smiths’ fires, but on a larger
                    scale. Lemielle’s ventilator is a vertical drum revolving eccentrically within a
                    cylindrical casing. The drum carries three jointed blades, which are drawn in or
                    out by radius bars as it revolves, so as to enclose and sweep out at each
                    revolution the body of air included between the two cylinders. This is one of
                    the best machines of its class, producing a comparatively high effect for the
                    power expended. An American machine of this kind is described and figured in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Bellows,</hi> vol. iii. p. 552, fig. 5.</p>
                <p>Of late years, various kinds of centrifugal machines, or fans, have come into use
                    instead of ventilating furnaces. One of the most successful of these is that
                    invented by Mr Guibal of Liège, represented in fig. 17. The fan has eight arms,
                    framed together of wrought-iron bars, with diagonal struts, so as to obtain
                    rigidity with comparative lightness, carrying flat close-boarded blades at their
                    extremities. It revolves with the smallest possible clearance in a chamber of
                    masonry, one of the side walls being perforated by a large round hole, through
                    which the air from the mine is admitted to the centre of the fan. The lower
                    quadrant of the casing is enlarged spirally, so as to leave a narrow rectangular
                    opening at the bottom, through which the air is discharged into a chimney of
                    gradually increasing section carried to a height of about 25 feet. The size of
                    the discharge aperture can be varied by means of a flexible wooden shutter
                    sliding <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n90/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0090-0071"/> in a groove in a cast-iron plate, curved to the
                    slope of the casing. By the use of the spiral guide casing and the chimney, the
                    velocity of the effluent air is gradually reduced up to the point of final
                    discharge into the atmosphere, whereby a greater useful effect is realized than
                    is the case when the air streams freely from the circumference with a velocity
                    equal to that of the rotating fan. The power is applied by steam acting directly
                    on a crank at one end of the axle. In most of the newer examples, which are
                    generally of large size, the power is divided, an engine being placed on each
                    side. At Washington Colliery, Durham, a machine of 36 feet diameter, 12 feet
                    breadth of face, and 13 feet diameter of intake passage, draws 120,000 cubic
                    feet of air per minute, when making 38 revolutions. Another at Us worth, 48 feet
                    diameter and 12 feet breadth of face, driven by two high-pressure engines, with
                    cylinders 3 feet in diameter and 3 feet stroke, equal to about 280 horse-power,
                    exhausts 200,000 cubic feet per minute. The useful effect realized under the
                    most favourable conditions is as much as 50 per cent, of that of the steam power
                    employed.</p>
                <p>Waddle’s fan, represented in fig. 18, is an example of another class of
                    centrifugal ventilator, in which a close casing is not used, the air exhausted
                    being discharged from the circumference directly into the atmosphere. It
                    consists of a hollow sheet-iron drum formed by two conoidal tubes, united
                    together by numerous guide blades, dividing it up into a series of rectangular
                    tubes of diminishing section, attached to a horizontal axle by cast-iron bosses
                    and wrought-iron arms. The tubes at their smallest part are connected to a
                    cast-iron ring, 10 feet in diameter, but at their outer circumference they are
                    only 2 feet apart. The extreme diameter is 25 feet. A fan of these dimensions at
                    Brownhills in Staffordshire, in making 50 revolutions per minute, circulates
                    47,000 cubic feet of air through the workings. It has also been in use for some
                    years in South Wales, and is found to work well; it is less expensive in first
                    cost than Guibal’s, although proportionally less economical from the smaller
                    effect realized for the power expended.</p>
                <p>Another method of colliery ventilation is that by jets of steam blowing off at a
                    high velocity into the upcast shaft, and producing a draught similar to that of
                    the exhaust blast in the chimney of a locomotive. This plan found several
                    advocates some years since, and was the subject of numerous comparative trials
                    against the ventilating furnace in the North of England, but the results were
                    unfavourable, the amount of air circulation produced being exceedingly small for
                    the fuel expended. It seems probable, however, that this want of success was in
                    great part due to the defective character of the apparatus applied, and that,
                    with properly-constructed aspirators and discharge passages, the steam jet may
                    prove to be a very efficient means of ventilation.</p>
                <p>The comparative merits of furnace and machine ventilation have long been
                    discussed without any definite result. The former was at one time regarded in
                    England as practically superior in every respect, but this opinion has been
                    modified since the introduction of the improved forms of fans which have been
                    worked to a considerable extent. In France and Belgium, on the contrary, machine
                    ventilation has been more generally in favour. For a deep and extensive mine
                    where the coal is not fiery, the furnace is undoubtedly the simplest and most
                    efficacious method of producing a large circulation of air; but for moderate
                    depths, especially with fiery return air, a ventilating machine at the surface
                    is in many cases to be preferred. There is also an important advantage procured
                    by the latter, namely, that of reserve power, so that a larger circulation may
                    be obtained immediately in case of need, e.g., when the barometer falls
                    suddenly, by merely increasing the speed of rotation, which cannot so readily be
                    done with the furnace, which has a tendency to slacken at the time when the
                    increased work is wanted.</p>
                <p>The quantity of air required for a large colliery depends upon the number of men
                    employed, as for actual respiration from 100 to 200 cubic feet per minute should
                    be allowed. In fiery mines, however, a very much larger amount must be provided
                    in order to dilute the gas to the point of safety. Even with the best
                    arrangements a dangerous increase in the amount of gas is not unfrequent from
                    the sudden release of stored up masses in the coal, which, overpowering the
                    ventilation, produce magazines of explosive material ready for ignition when
                    brought in contact with the flame of a lamp or the blast of a shot. The
                    management of such places, therefore, requires the most constant vigilance on
                    the part of the workmen, especially in the examination of the working places
                    that have been standing empty during the night, in which gas may have
                    accumulated, to see that they are properly cleared before the new shift
                    commences.</p>
                <p>The actual conveyance or coursing of the air from the intake to the working faces
                    is effected by splitting or dividing the current at different points in its
                    course, so as to carry it as directly as possible to the places where it is
                    required. In laying out the mine, it is customary to drive the levels or roads
                    in pairs, communication being made between them at intervals by cutting through
                    the intermediate pillar, the air then passes along one, and returns by the
                    other. As the roads advance other pillars are driven through in the same manner,
                    the passages first made being closed by stoppings of broken rock, or built up
                    with brick and mortar walls, or both. When it is desired to preserve a way from
                    one road or similar class of working to another, double doors placed at
                    sufficient intervals apart to take in one or more trams between them when closed
                    are used, forming a kind of lock or sluice. These are made to shut air-tight
                    against their frames, so as to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n91/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0091-0072"/> prevent the air from taking a short cut back to
                    the upcast, while preserving free access between the different districts without
                    following the whole round of the airways. The ventilation of ends is effected by
                    means of brattices or temporary partitions of thin boards placed midway in the
                    drift, and extending to within a few feet of the face. The air passes along one
                    side of the brattice, courses round the free end, and returns on the other side.
                    In many cases a light but air-proof cloth, specially made for the purpose, is
                    used instead of wood for brattices, as being more handy and more easily removed.
                    In large mines where the air-ways are numerous and complicated, it often happens
                    that currents travelling in opposite directions are brought together at one
                    point In these cases it is necessary to cross them in the manner shown in fig.
                    2, Plate III. The return air is usually made to pass over the intake by a curved
                    drift carried some distance above in the solid measures, both ways being arched
                    in brickwork, or even in some cases lined with sheet-iron so as to ensure a
                    separation not likely to be destroyed in case of an explosion. The relation of
                    the ventilation to the workings under the different systems is indicated on the
                    several plates by arrows and other signs, from which the general character of
                    the arrangements adopted can be made out without further description.</p>
                <p>The lighting of underground workings in collieries is closely connected with the
                    subject of ventilation. In many of the smaller pits in the Midland districts,
                    and generally in South Staffordshire, the coals are sufficiently free from gas,
                    or rather the gases are not liable to become explosive when mixed with air, to
                    allow the use of naked lights, candles being generally used. Oil lamps are
                    employed in many of the Scotch collieries, and are almost universally used in
                    Belgium and other Continental countries. The buildings near the pit bottom, such
                    as the stables and lamp cabin, and even the main roads for some distance, are
                    often in large collieries lighted with gas brought from the surface, or in some
                    cases the gas given off by the coal is used for the same purpose. Where the
                    gases are fiery, the use of protected lights or safety lamps becomes a
                    necessity.</p>
                <p>The nature of the gases evolved by coal when freshly exposed to the atmosphere
                    has been investigated by several chemists, more particularly by Playfair and
                    Meyer. The latter observer found the gases given off by coal from the district
                    of Newcastle and Durham to contain carbonic acid (anhydride), marsh gas or light
                    carburetted hydrogen (the fire-damp of the miner), oxygen, and nitrogen. A newer
                    investigation, by Mr J. W. Thomas, of the gases dissolved or occluded in coals
                    from South Wales basin shows them to vary considerably with the class of coal.

                    in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society,</hi> were obtained by
                    heating samples of the different coals in vacuo for several hours at the
                    temperature of boiling water.</p>

                <p>In one instance, about 1 per cent, of hydride of ethyl was found in the gas from
                    a blower in a pit in the Rhondda district, which was collected in a tube and
                    brought to the surface to be used in lighting the engine-room and pit-bank. The
                    gases from the bituminous house coals of South Wales are comparatively free lrom
                    marsh gas, as compared with those from the steam coal and anthracite pits. The
                    latter class of coal contains the largest proportion of this dangerous gas, but
                    holds it more tenaciously than do the steam coals, thus rendering the workings
                    comparatively safer. It was found that, of the entire volume of occluded gas in
                    an anthracite, only one-third could be expelled at the temperature of boiling
                    water, and that the whole quantity, amounting to 650 cubic feet per ton, was
                    only to be driven out by a heat of 300° C. Steam coals being softer and more
                    porous give off enormous volumes of gas from the working face in most of the
                    deep pits, many of which have been the scene of disastrous explosions.</p>
                <p>The gases evolved from the sudden outbursts or blowers in coal, which are often
                    given off at a considerable tension, are the most dangerous enemy that the
                    collier has to contend with. They consist almost entirely of marsh gas, with
                    only a small quantity of carbonic acid, usually under 1 per cent., and from 1 to
                    4 percent, of nitrogen.</p>
                <p>Fire-damp when mixed with from four to twelve times its volume of atmospheric air
                    is explosive; but when the proportion is above or below these limits, it is
                    inflammable, burning quietly with a pale blue flame. When a lighted candle is
                    exposed in a non-explosive mixture of this gas, the flame gradually elongates,
                    forming a conical cap, floating above the wick, which may be extinguished by
                    cautious withdrawal without communicating the fire to the surrounding
                    atmosphere. This method of testing for gas in the working places and wastes,
                    which is obviously only to be trusted in skilled hands, used to be commonly
                    practised, but since the introduction of safety lamps it has fallen into
                    disuse.</p>
                <p>The principle involved in the construction of safetylamps consists in surrounding
                    the flame of a lamp by a protecting metal case, perforated with numerous small
                    holes, through which the air for feeding the flame may freely enter, and the
                    products of combustion pass out, while the passage of flame, or gases
                    sufficiently heated to cause the ignition of the external air when laden with
                    explosive gases, is prevented. In 1816 Sir Humphrey Davy made the great
                    discovery that these conditions are fulfilled by the use of tubes reduced to a
                    mere section, such as the apertures in wire gauze, when the substance of the
                    wire is rightly proportioned to the size of the aperture. The standard adopted
                    as the limit for safety at that time was a gauze of 28 iron wires to the linear
                    inch, having 784 apertures per square inch, which has been used ever since. The
                    common safety or Davy lamp consists of a small cylindrical oil lamp, covered
                    with a cylinder of wire gauze about 6 inches long and 1J inches in diameter,
                    with a flat gauze top. The upper part of the gauze is doubled to prevent its
                    being worn into holes by the products of combustion, and the air for feeding the
                    flame enters round the wick. The gauze is mounted in a cage, consisting of three
                    upright wires, screwed into a flat brass ring at each end. A handle is attached
                    to the upper ring, while the lower one screws on to a collar on the oil-vessel
                    of the lamp. When the two parts are screwed together the lamp is locked by a
                    bolt passing through both parts, which is screwed down flush with or below the
                    surface of the outer ring, so that the gauze cannot be removed without the use
                    of a key.</p>
                <p>In Stephenson’s safety-lamp, generally known as the “Geordie,” from the inventor
                    George Stephenson, the light is covered by a glass chimney, surrounded by an
                    outer casing and top of wire gauze. The feed air is admitted through numerous
                    small holes in a copper ring a little below the level of the wick. This is one
                    of the safest forms of lamp, but requires considerable care in use, especially
                    in keeping the small feed holes clear from dust and oil; the glass protects the
                    gauze from becoming overheated.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n92/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0092-0073"/>
                <p>and when the air is dangerously charged with gas the light is extinguished.</p>
                <p>Various forms of safety-lamps have been introduced at different times, for the
                    purpose of increasing the amount of light by substituting a glass cylinder for
                    the lower portion of the wire gauze. The oldest of these is that of Dr Clanny,
                    contemporary with those of Davy and Stephenson. The air for supplying the flame,
                    entering at the bottom of the gauze, and passing down the inner side of the
                    glass, protects the latter to some extent from becoming overheated, but a large
                    amount of light is lost by absorption in the glass, so that there is no great
                    advantage over the ordinary Davy lamp to compensate for the extra weight and
                    cost, especially as the safety property of the lamp depends upon the glass
                    cylinder, which may be readily broken when subjected to the ordinary accidents
                    of working. A more perfect form of lamp of the same character is that of
                    Museler, which is extensively used in Belgium. It differs from Clanny’s lamp by
                    the addition of a conical chimney above the flame, which produces a rapid
                    draught, and consequently a more perfect cooling of the glass cylinder by the
                    down-draught of feed air for the flame.</p>
                <p>Boty’s lamp, which was recommended by a commission of the Belgian Government as
                    being safe in use, is essentially that of Dr Clanny with Stephenson’s perforated
                    ring for admitting air at the level of the wick. Another Belgian variety is that
                    of Eloin, in which the glass is shaped to the surface produced by the revolution
                    of a parabolic arc, so as to disperse the light in parallel lines. The air is
                    admitted by a Stephenson ring, combined with an Argand cap, the glass being
                    surrounded by a brass chimney with a gauze top. In another form of the same lamp
                    Museler’s chimney is added.</p>
                <p>The locking of safety-lamps, so as to render them incapable of being opened by
                    the miners when at work, is a point that has given play to a large amount of
                    ingenuity. One of the most favourite devices is a combination of the wick-holder
                    with the locking bolt, so that the latter cannot be withdrawn without lowering
                    the wick and extinguishing the flame. Another method consists in the use of a
                    lead rivet, uniting the two parts of the lamp, impressed with a seal, which
                    cannot be removed without defacing the device. All this class of contrivances
                    have the defect of only being efficacious when the miners are not provided with
                    matches, or other means of obtaining a light. A more physically perfect method
                    is that adopted by Bidder, where the locking bolt is magnetized and held in
                    place by a force which can only be overcome by the application of a battery of
                    heavy and powerful steel magnets. These are kept in the lamp cabin at the pit
                    bottom, where the lamps are cleaned and served out lighted to the miners at the
                    commencement of the shift, and are collected before they return to the
                    surface.</p>
                <p>When a Davy lamp is exposed to an atmosphere containing less than 8 per cent, of
                    marsh gas, the flame lengthens and becomes smoky; when that amount is reached
                    the flame returns to its usual size, but a column of blue flame rises to the top
                    of the gauze. With 10 per cent, the flame of the wick is extinguished, the whole
                    of the space within the gauze being filled with a blue flame of burning gas. If
                    the lamp is allowed to remain too long in a fiery atmosphere it becomes
                    dangerous, as the gauze being heated to redness may fire the gas. The safety of
                    the lamp is also endangered by an exposure to a current of gas moving at the
                    rate of more than 6 or 8 feet per second, as the flame can then be readily
                    driven through the gauze. It is therefore usual to protect the flame by a
                    sliding shield of tin plate, horn, or mica from the direct action of any sudden
                    outburst of gas in the workings. Lamps with glass cylinders are generally very
                    safe, except from the risk of accidental breakage, which, however, is less
                    frequent than might be imagined, and those taking air through a feed ring, such
                    as Stephenson’s, are readily extinguished in a foul atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The danger arising from gas in the workings may be considerably increased by the
                    presence of coal dust in the air. This point has been the subject of
                    investigation by Galloway, who found that an explosion may be produced by
                    ignited particles of coal dust through the agency of a safety-lamp which under
                    ordinary circumstances would be perfectly trustworthy. At Blanzy, in France,
                    several fatal explosions have been traced to the firing of coal dust from the
                    flame of a shot, even in cases where no fire-damp was present in the
                    workings.</p>
                <p>An electric lamp, where the light is obtained from the discharge in a Geissler
                    vacuum tube, has been proposed by Benoit-Dumas, instead of the ordinary safety
                    lamps, or for use in exploring after explosions or in bad air ways. This
                    consists of a box containing a galvanic battery, consisting of two Bunsen cells,
                    and a small induction coil, with connecting wires which convey the current to
                    the lamp. The Bunsen cells may be conveniently replaced by a single
                    bottle-shaped bichromate battery. The cost and complication of this apparatus
                    must necessarily limit its use.</p>
                <p>Apparatus, originating in France, known as aerophores, which enable the miner to
                    carry sufficient fresh air for his own respiration, and to keep a lamp alight
                    for a short time in a totally irrespirable atmosphere, have of late years come
                    into use for the purposes of saving life after explosions, and repairing shafts
                    and pit-work under water. There are two principal patterns, those of Galibert
                    and Denayrouze. The former, which is the simplest, consists of an air-tight bag
                    of about 12 cubic feet capacity, containing air at a little above atmospheric
                    pressure, which is carried on the miner’s back like a knapsack. The air, after
                    being used, is returned with the products of respiration into the bag, and can
                    be used over again until it becomes too impure for further use. It is obvious,
                    therefore, that such an apparatus must be of very limited application, but its
                    simplicity and cheapness are points in its favour for use in sudden emergencies.
                    The Denayrouze apparatus consists of a series of sheet metal cylinders,
                    containing air compressed to 300 or 350 lb to the square inch, which can be
                    carried on the back, and served out at a pressure very slightly above that of
                    the atmosphere by means of a reducing valve, whose construction is essentially
                    the same in principle as that of the ordinary pressure regulator used in
                    gas-works, <hi rend="italic">iae.,</hi> a conical plug dosed against its seat by
                    the pressure of the air in the reservoir, which is constantly opposed by an
                    external force tending to open it. This force is supplied by a disc of
                    vulcanized india-rubber, w hich opens the valve at each inspiration, and allows
                    a fresh supply of air to escape into the chamber of the regulator through the
                    small aperture of the valve. Of course, all communication with the external air
                    must be cut off, so that respiration can only take place through the mouth, the
                    air-tube being attached by an india-rubber mask called a mouth-closer, and the
                    nostrils closed by a spring clip. A similar regulator valve, so constructed as
                    to keep the india-rubber spring under a slight excess pressure in order to
                    maintain a flow of air, is in connection with the lamp. This is of the ordinary
                    Museler construction, with the addition of a chamber outside the gauze to
                    receive the products of combustion, which are discharged through a conical valve
                    at the top, a reflux of the exterior gases being prevented by the pressure of a
                    counter spring. The air is carried to the lamp by an india-rubber tube, which is
                    sufficiently flexible to allow a certain freedom of motion. The distance that an
                    explorer can penetrate with this apparatus is obviously limited by the capacity
                    of the air-cylinders.</p>

                <p>These have been made large enough to supply air to a man with a lamp for an hour,
                    but this is an inconvenient size, being too large to be carried on the back.</p>
                <p>Underground fires are not uncommon accidents in coalmines. In the thick coal
                    workings in South Staffordshire the slack left behind in the sides of work is
                    especially liable to fire from so-called spontaneous combustion, due to the
                    rapid oxidization that is set up, when finely-divided coal is brought in contact
                    with air. The best remedy in such cases is to prevent the air from gaining
                    access to the coal by building a wall round the burning portion, which can in
                    this way be isolated from the remainder of the working, and the fire prevented
                    from spreading, even if it cannot be extinguished. When the coal is fired by the
                    blast of an explosion it is often necessary to completely isolate the mine by
                    stopping up the mouths of the pits with earth, or in extreme cases it must be
                    flooded with water or carbonic acid before the fire can be brought under. There
                    have been several instances of this being done in the fiery pits in the Barnsley
                    district, notably at the great explosion at the Oaks colliery in 1866, when 360
                    lives were lost.</p>
                <p>The drawing or winding of the coal from the pit bottom to the surface is one of
                    the most important operations in coal mining, and probably the department in
                    which mechanical appliances have been brought to the highest state of
                    development. In the simplest case, where the mine is worked by levels, the
                    trains of coal may be drawn from the working faces directly to the level mouth
                    by horse power, or in some exceptional cases locomotives worked by compressed
                    air are used. In South Wales the power for lifting the load in the shaft is
                    still in some small workings furnished by a water balance, that is, a box which
                    is filled with water at a high level, and in descending raises the loaded trucks
                    by a rope passing over a pulley at the surface. This method is only available
                    when there is a free drainage level for the water to run off when the box
                    reaches the lowest point. Other hydraulic motors, such as wheels, pressure
                    engines, &amp;c., are used in different localities as well as animal power,
                    where the amount of coal to be drawn is small, but as a general rule it is
                    necessary to have recourse to steam power to maintain an adequate output. The
                    old custom of drawing the coals in tubs or hutches <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cuffat</hi> of the French miner), swinging freely from the end of the drawing
                    rope, is now almost entirely superseded by the adoption of cages sliding between
                    fixed guides, which allow the load to move freely up and down while checking
                    lateral oscillation. This improvement, which is due to Mr John Curr of
                    Sheffield, was originally introduced in 1798, but made surprisingly little
                    progress for nearly half a century. It was first brought into general use in the
                    North of England, but in many of the smaller pits of the Midland counties the
                    older custom prevailed until recently.</p>
                <p>The different elements making up the drawing arrangements of a colliery are—(1)
                    the cage, (2) the shaft or pit fittings, (3) the drawing-rope, (4) the engine,
                    and (5) the surface arrangements. The cage, as its name implies, consists of one
                    or more platforms connected by an open framework of vertical bars of wrought
                    iron or steel, with a top bar to which the drawing-rope is attached. It is
                    customary to have a curved sheet-iron roof or bonnet when the cage is used for
                    raising or lowering the miners, to prevent them from injury by falling
                    materials. The number of platforms or decks varies considerably; in small mines
                    only a single one may be used, but in the larger modern pits two, three, or even
                    four-decked cages are used. The use of several decks is necessary in old pits of
                    small section, where only a single tram can be carried on each. In the large
                    shafts of the Northern and Wigan districts the cages are made about 8 feet long
                    and 3∣ feet broad, being sufficient to carry two large trams on one deck. These
                    are received upon a railway made of two strips of angle iron of the proper gauge
                    for the wheels, and are locked fast by a latch falling over their ends.</p>
                <p>The guides or conductors in the pit may be constructed of wood, in which case
                    rectangular fir beams, about 3 by 4 inches, are used, attached at intervals of a
                    few feet to buntons or cross-beams, built into the lining of the pit. Two guides
                    are required for each cage; they may be placed opposite to each other, either on
                    the long or short sides—the latter being preferable. The cage is guided by shoes
                    of wrought iron, a few inches long and bell-mouthed at the ends, attached to the
                    horizontal bars of the framing, which pass loosely over the guides on three
                    sides. In some of the large collieries in Northumberland wrought iron guides
                    have been adopted with advantage. They are applied on one side of the cage only,
                    forming a complete vertical railway,—light flange rails such as are used for the
                    roadways underground being used instead of wooden rods and iron cross sleepers,
                    with proper seats for the rails instead of wooden buntons; the cage is guided by
                    curved shoes of a proper section to cover the heads of the rails. Rigid guides
                    connected with the walling of the pit are probably the best and safest, but they
                    have the disadvantage of being liable to distortion, in case of the pit altering
                    its form, owing to irregular movements of the ground, or other causes. Wooden
                    guides being of considerable size, block up a certain portion of the area of the
                    pit, and thus offer an impediment to the ventilation, especially in upcast
                    shafts, where the high temperature, when furnace ventilation is used, is also
                    against their use. In the Wigan district, wire-rope guides have been introduced
                    to a very considerable extent, with a view of meeting the above objections.
                    These are simply wire-ropes, from ∣ to 1∣ inches in diameter, hanging from a
                    cross-bar connected with the pit-head framing at the surface, and attached to a
                    similar bar at the bottom, which are kept straight by a stretching weight of
                    from 30 cwt. to 4 tons attached to the lower bar. In some cases four guides are
                    used—two to each of the long sides of the cage; but a more general arrangement
                    is to have three—two on one side, and the third in an intermediate position on
                    the opposite side. Many colliery managers, however, prefer to have only two
                    opposite guides, as being safer. The cage is connected by tubular clips, made in
                    two pieces and bolted together, which slide over the ropes. In addition to this,
                    it is necessary to have an extra system of fixed guides at the surface and at
                    the bottom, where it is necessary to keep the cage steady during the operations
                    of loading and landing, there being a much greater amount of oscillation during
                    the passage of the cage than with fixed guides. For the same reason it is
                    necessary to give a considerable clearance between the two lines of guides,
                    which are kept from 15 to 18 inches apart, to prevent the possibility of the two
                    cages striking each other in passing. With proper precautions, however, wire
                    guides are perfectly safe for use at the highest travelling speed.</p>
                <p>The cage is connected with the drawing-rope by short lengths of chain from the
                    corners known as tackling chains, gathered into a central ring, to which the
                    rope is attached. Round steel wire-ropes, about 2 inches in diameter, are now
                    commonly used; but in very deep pits they are sometimes tapered in section to
                    reduce the dead weight lifted. Flat ropes of steel or iron wire were and are
                    still used to a great extent, but round ones are now generally preferred. In
                    Belgium flat ropes of aloe fibre are in high repute, being considered preferable
                    by many colliery managers to wire, in spite of their great weight. In South
                    Staffordshire, flat link chains made with three or more parallel links, with a
                    stud of wood filling up the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n94/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0094-0075"/> hollow, are or were in general use in the
                    numerous shallow pits working the thick coal in the neighbourhood of Dudley,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The best modern engines for drawing in collieries are usually direct-acting, with
                    either horizontal or vertical cylinders. In the north of England a single engine
                    with a heavy fly-wheel is often used, but the more general arrangement is to
                    have two engines coupled to the opposite ends of the winding drum-shaft. In
                    almost all cases steam is used at high pressure without condensation.</p>
                <p>The drum, when round ropes are used, is a plain broad cylinder, w ith flanged
                    rims, and cased with soft wood packing, upon which the rope is coiled; the
                    breadth is made sufficient to take the whole length of the rope at two laps. One
                    drum is usually fixed to the shaft, while the other is loose, with a screw link
                    or other means of coupling, in order to be able to adjust the two ropes to
                    exactly the same length, so that one cage may be at the surface when the other
                    is at the bottom, without having to pay out or take up any slack rope by the
                    engine.</p>
                <p>For flat ropes, the drum or bobbin consists of a solid disc, of the width of the
                    rope fixed upon the shaft, with numerous parallel pairs of arms or horns,
                    arranged radially on both sides, the space between being just sufficient to
                    allow the rope to enter and coil regularly upon the preced ing lap. This method
                    has the advantage of equalizing the work of the engine throughout the journey,
                    for when the load is greatest, with the full cage at the bottom and the whole
                    length of rope out, the duty required iu the first revolution of the engine is
                    measured by the length of the smallest circumference; while the assistance
                    derived from gravitating action of the descending cage in the same period is
                    equal to the weight of the falling mass through a height corresponding to the
                    length of the largest lap, and so on, the speed being increased as the weight
                    diminishes, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>
                <p>The same thing can be effected in a more perfect manner by the use of spiral or
                    scroll drums, in which the rope is made to coil in a spiral groove upon the
                    surface of the drum, which is formed by the frusta of two obtuse cones placed
                    wſlth their smaller diameters outwards. This plan, though mechanically a very
                    good one, has certain defects, especially in the possibility of danger resulting
                    from the rope slipping sideways, if the grooves in the bed are not perfectly
                    true. The great size, and weight of such drums are also disadvantages, as giving
                    rather unmanageable dimensions in a very deep pit.</p>
                <p>The use of a counterbalance chain for the winding engines is common in the
                    collieries of the Midland districts of England. In this method a third drum is
                    used to receive a heavy flat link chain, shorter than the main drawing-ropes,
                    the end of which hangs down a special or balance pit. At starting, when the full
                    load is to be lifted, the balance chain uncoils, and continues to do so until
                    the desired equilibrium between the working loads is attained, when it is coiled
                    up again in the reverse direction, to be again given out on the return trip.</p>
                <p>The surface arrangements of a modern colliery are often of considerable extent
                    and complexity, the most important feature being the pit-frame carrying the
                    guide-pulleys or rope-rolls which lead the drawing-ropes from the vertical line
                    of the pit to the engine-drum. This consists essentially of an upright
                    framework, carefully braced together, and strutted by diagonal beams against the
                    wall of the engine-house, or other solid abutment. It is generally necessary to
                    have a clear head-room, 10 or 20 feet or more, for the working arrangements at
                    the surface above the level of the ground, especially in flat countries; the
                    pitframes are made of considerable height, from 50 to 70 feet being not
                    uncommon; and when, as is generally the case, they are made of wood, they afford
                    opportunities for the exercise of skilful carpentry. Of late years, however,
                    wrought iron pit-frames have been adopted to some extent, which allows of a
                    comparatively simpler construction being used, the main elements of the frame
                    consisting of hollow latticed pillars and beams, similar to the construction now
                    generally adopted for the pillars of railway signals, but of course of a more
                    solid construction. They have one great advantage over wooden frames, in not
                    being liable to destruction by fire, an accident which has occasionally happened
                    with the latter. The guide-pulleys for iron or steèl wire-ropes are made of very
                    large dimensions, to avoid strain upon the wires by sudden change of direction
                    when moving at a high speed. The usual construction is a deep channeled rim or
                    tire of cast-iron, from 7 to 20 feet in diameter, supported by numerous thin
                    wrought iron arms, inclining inwards from a central cast-iron boss,—a form
                    combining rigidity with comparative lightness. They are in fact very similar to
                    the driving wheels of the large modern bicycles, supposing a channeled rim to be
                    substituted for the indiarubber tire.</p>
                <p>To prevent accidents from the breakage of the rope on the shaft, or from
                    overwinding when the engine is not stopped at the right moment, whereby the cage
                    may be dragged up to the head pulleys (both which kinds of accident are
                    unhappily not uncommon), various forms of safety catch and disengaging hooks
                    have been proposed. These consist of variously-constructed toothed levers, cams,
                    or eccentrics, mounted upon transverse axes, attached to the top of the cage,
                    whose function is to take hold of the guides, and support the cage in the event
                    of its becoming detached from the rope. They are generally applied by means of
                    springs acting against the pull of the rope. Figs. 19-21 represent a form of
                    safety catch, introduced some years since by Messrs White and Grant of Glasgow.
                    The catches BB consist of partially toothed eccentrics, which when released are
                    forced inwards against the wooden guide <hi rend="italic">a</hi> by the coiled
                    springs <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic

                    rend="italic">c c,</hi> which turn the broad toothed portions outwards, and away
                    from the guides. The connection with the rope is made by the slide bar C and
                    spring catch <hi rend="italic">h</hi> having a projecting trigger, which, if the
                    cage is lifted too high, strikes against the cross-bar of the framing <hi
                    rend="italic">k,</hi> and detaches the cage, which is then left hanging by the
                    catches to the guides in the pit. The use of safety catches is more common in
                    the collieries of France, Belgium, and Germany than in England, where they are
                    not generally popular, owing to their uncertainty in action, as they are often
                    found to fail when most wanted. The constant drag of the catches on the guides
                    when the rope slacks is also objectionable, but this has been overcome to a
                    great extent in a very ingenious contrivance invented by Mr Calow, where the
                    catches are not brought into action unless the cage is actually falling clear of
                    the rope, with a certain acquired momentum of its own. The only real safeguards
                    against accidents in winding are to be found in constant vigilance, in
                    maintaining the ropes in working efficiency, and in the use of proper signals
                    and brake power in the engine house.</p>
                <p>The speed attained by the load in the shaft in the best-appointed English
                    collieries is very considerable, and may be paralleled with that of a fast
                    railway train. At Shireoaks Colliery, Nottinghamshire, the cage with a load of
                    34 cwts. of coal in five tubs, and weighing in all 60 cwts., or with the rope at
                    the bottom 92∣ cwts., is raised from a depth of 516 yards in 45 seconds,
                    corresponding to an average of 35 feet per second, or 24 miles per hour, the
                    maximum speed when the load is mid-way being 50 feet per second, or nearly 35
                    miles an hour. The ropes used are round, of steel wire, weighing 13 lbs. to the
                    yard, winding on to a spiral drum, increasing from 17 to 20 feet in diameter.
                    Thera are two engines with vertical cylinders, 32 inches diameter and 6 feet
                    stroke, developing a useful effect of about 320 horse-power. The guide pulleys
                    are 12 feet in diameter.</p>
                <p>The above may be taken as a good example of the modern class of winding engines,
                    such as are required to draw from 600 to 1200 tons in the shift of 10 hours.
                    When the pits are of small depth it is better to increase the weight of the load
                    than to draw at a very high speed, as the loss of time in filling and unloading
                    or striking the cages is the same for a short as for a long journey, so that it
                    becomes advantageous to diminish the number of journeys for a given quantity of
                    coal drawn.</p>
                <p>The great amount of dead weight required to be raised in the ordinary system of
                    winding <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> in the instance given above, the total
                    weight moved is nearly four times that of the nett load drawn, that of the ropes
                    being nearly 1 ⅛ times as much as the latter), has led to the proposal of
                    various plans to obtain a more mechanically economical method, but none of these
                    have at present been brought into successful use. One of the latest is that of
                    Μ. Blanchet, who proposes to draw a number of tubs linked together into a long
                    vertical train in a closed tube about <hi rend="italic">5⅛</hi> feet in
                    diameter, by exhausting the air above them in the manner adopted in the
                    pneumatic tubes used for the transmission of parcels. An experimental apparatus
                    of this class has been recently constructed at Creusot, in France, designed to
                    lift a cage with 9 tubs, attached to a piston, weighing in all about 12 j
                    tons.</p>
                <p>When the cage arrives at the surface, or rather the platform forming the working
                    top above the mouth of the pit, it is received upon the keeps, a pair of hinged
                    gratings which are kept in an inclined position over the pit-top by
                    counterbalance weights, so that they are pushed aside to allow the cage to pass
                    upwards, but fall back and receive it when the engine is reversed. The tubs are
                    then removed or struck by the landers, who pull them forward on to the platform,
                    which is covered with cast-iron plates; at the same time empty ones are pushed
                    in from the opposite side. The cage is then lifted by the engine clear of the
                    keeps, which are opened by a lever worked by hand, and the empty tubs start on
                    the return trip. When the cage has several decks, it is necessary to repeat this
                    operation for each, unless there is a special provision made for load-ipg and
                    discharging the tubs at different levels. An arrangement of this kind for
                    shifting the load from a large cage at one operation has recently been
                    introduced by Mr Fowler at Hucknall, in Leicestershire, where the trains are
                    received into a framework with a number of platforms corresponding to those of
                    the cage, carried on the head of a plunger movable by hydraulic pressure in a
                    vertical cylinder. The empty tubs are carried by a corresponding arrangement on
                    the opposite side. By this means the time of stoppage is reduced to a minimum, 8
                    seconds for a three-decked cage as against 28 seconds, as the operations of
                    lowering the tubs to the level of the pit-top, discharging, and replacing them
                    are performed during the time that the following load is being drawn up the
                    pit.</p>
                <p>The tub when brought to the surface, after passing over a weigh-bridge, where it
                    is weighed and tallied by a weigher specially appointed for the purpose by the
                    men and the owner jointly, is run into a tipping cage, and the contents are
                    discharged into an inclined screen with bars about 1 inch to 1∣ inches apart.
                    The large coal remaining passes through a spout into a railway waggon placed
                    below, the discharge being regulated by a valve at the lower end. The small coal
                    passing through is either sold as such, or inay be lifted by an elevator to a
                    second series of screens, either fixed or rotating, with half-inch apertures.
                    These make a further separation of larger pieces, which are sold as “nuts,”
                    while the small, or slack, passing through is sent to the coke ovens, if the
                    quality of the coal is suitable. Asa rule, noncaking coals are not very closely
                    screened, as the small is of comparatively little value, and therefore must have
                    a proportion of larger sizes mixed with it to form saleable slack.</p>
                <p>Figs. 22-24, representing the surface arrangements adopted at a pair of pits in
                    the Wigan district, may be taken as fairly representative of the fittings of a
                    large modern colliery, where a considerable output of coal has to be screened
                    and loaded in an ordinary working day of less than twelve hours. The details, of
                    course, will vary, according to the nature of the outlet or vend, which may be
                    by retailing into carts sent by purchasers, or by canals or railways, or by a
                    combination of all three. In the example selected, the coal is loaded directly
                    from the screens into full-sized trucks, each carrying from 6 to 8 tons, on a
                    main line of railway. Of the two pits, one is an upcast, and is surmounted by a
                    chimney at the surface,—the drawing being confined to the downcast, which is 310
                    yards deep and 10∣ feet in diameter. 600 tons of coal are drawn from this depth
                    in 10 hours by a pair of direct-acting engines, with vertical cylinders working
                    a spiral drum, increasing from 13 j feet to 17⅛ feet in diameter. The pit-head
                    frame is of wood, with guide pulleys 7 feet in diameter,— a much smaller size
                    than is now usually adopted; the iron wire drawing-ropes are round, weighing 5
                    lb to the yard. Double-decked cages of a light construction in wrought iron are
                    used, carrying four tubs at a time. The landing platform is raised upon pillars
                    20 feet above the surface of the ground, and covered with iron plates. As soon
                    as the cage arrives at the surface, the tubs are run into tumbling cages, which
                    discharge their contents on to fixed screens, with bars of 1 to l¾ inch
                    aperture. The large coal passes by a shoot directly into the railway waggon,
                    while the first screenings fall into a channel below, which is traversed by a
                    series of scrapers attached to an endless chain, and are <pb break="no"

                    discharged into rotatory drum sieves of about ∣-inch aperture, producing a
                    second size of saleable coal, known as nuts, and slack, which is sent away to
                    the coke ovens attached to the colliery. The whole of the labour required in the
                    screening the output of 600 tons in the day of ten hours is performed by one
                    engineman, who has charge of all the mechanical arrangements, and nine boys, who
                    pick out any large lumps of stone from the coal as it passes the first screens.
                    The engine driving the screens and elevators is in charge of a special
                    engineman.</p>
                <p>Fig, 25 ιepresents one of a pair of pits at Pemberton Colliery, near Wigan,
                    having the pit frames constructed in wrought iron lattice truss-work instead of
                    wood. The screens for large coal (S) are arranged symmetrically on the landing
                    platform, three on each side of the pit top, and discharge directly into waggons
                    on the railway below. The small coal from these screens is passed by a screw
                    creeper C, like those used in flour mills, to a bucket elevator E, which
                    delivers it at the top of the second set of screens R, where the nuts and slack
                    are separated. The platform, as in most of the new collieries in this district,
                    is roofed over to protect the workmen from the weather. The second pit, which
                    occupies a corresponding position on the opposite side of the engine-house, is
                    in every respect similar.</p>
                <p>The large collieries in the steam-coal district of Northumberland are among the
                    most productive; thus, at Bed-lington, near Morpeth, 1200 tons are raised daily,
                    and at North Seaton from 1500 to 1800 tons.</p>
                <p>When the coal is very much mixed with shale, the slack often contains so much
                    mineral matter as to be quite worthless, until at least a partial separation has
                    beeκ⅛ effected. This is now done by means of coal-washing machines, which were
                    first adopted in France, but have now become general in other countries. There
                    are many different forms, but the most usual is a fixed sieve plate, upon which
                    the slack is received and subjected to the action of a current of water forced
                    through the holes by the action of a fast-moving short-stroke plunger pump,
                    which puts the whole of the materials into suspension, and allows them to fall
                    through the water at each stroke. By this means the coal, being the lighter
                    material, travels to the surface, and the heavier shale and stone going to the
                    bottom are discharged through a valve there. The apparatus is in fact a form of
                    the hydraulic jigging hutch used for the dressing of lead and other ores, except
                    that in this case the lighter and not the heavier part is the valuable mineral.
                    In another form of coal-dressing machine introduced by Mr Evrard, the jigging
                    action is produced by a jet of steam acting directly upon the water instead of a
                    plunger piston. Washed slack when suitable is used for conversion into coke, but
                    in France and Belgium it is now generally employed in the production of
                    agglomerated fuel, or briquettes, or what is usually known in England as patent
                    fuel. These consist of coal dust mixed with a sufficient amount of gas-pitch to
                    be moulded into coherent bricks or cylinders, which are afterwards dried at a
                    high temperature, but below the point of carbonization. The consolidation of the
                    slack may also be effected by the use of starch or dextrine, or even by cement
                    or clay. This class of fuel is mueh used upon the French railways, being
                    convenient for stowage and economical in use; but as a rule it is disagreeable
                    to the passengers from the large amount of coal-dust carried off by the exhaust
                    steam, and the unpleasant vapours produced by the burning pitch. The <pb

                    in South Wales.</p>
                <p>The anthracite coal of Pennsylvania is subjected to the exceptional treatment of
                    breaking between toothed rollers, and an elaborate system of screening before it
                    is fit for sale. The largest or lump coal is that which remains upon a riddle
                    having the bars four inches apart; the second, or steamboat coal, is above 3
                    inches; broken coal includes sizes above 2¾ or 2∣ inches <hi rend="italic">;
                    egg</hi> coal, pieces above 2¾ inches square; large stove coal, l¾ inches; small
                    stove, 1 to 1∣ or l¾ inches; chestnut coal, ¾ to ¾ inch; pea coal, ¾ inch; and
                    buckwheat coal, ⅜ inch. The most valuable of these are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >egg</hi> and stove sizes, which are broken to the proper dimensions for
                    household use, the larger lumps being unfit for burning in open fire-places.</p>
                <p>The proportion of coal utilized in the working, as compared with the total
                    contents of the seam, varies very considerably in different districts, being
                    greatest in seams of moderate thickness, from 3 to 5 feet, which on the
                    long-wall system can be entirely removed. In thick coals, such as the ten-yard
                    seam of South Staffordshire, the waste is very considerable. In Cheshire and
                    Lancashire about 1330 tons of saleable coal are obtained from an acre for each
                    foot of thickness in the seam, only 8 per cent, of the total being left behind
                    in the workings.</p>
                <p>At Dowlais, on the north of the South Wales coal-field, the yield is 1190 tons to
                    the foot by long-wall, but only 866 tons when the same seam was worked by the
                    pillar and stall system; but on the south side of the basin, where the seams lie
                    at a steep slope, the loss is often much greater, being from 20 to 50 per cent,
                    on pillar and stall workings. In the Barnsley district, the yield is from 1150
                    to 1280 tons in thick seams, and a maximum of 1417 tons has been obtained in a
                    thin seam, the solid contents of the whole coal being estimated at 1556 tons per
                    foot per acre. In Northumberland about 1200 tons are got out of a total of 1300.
                    In the thick coal of South Staffordshire, from 12,000 to 16,000 tons per acre
                    are got at the first working on an average thickness of 25⅜ feet, or about 640
                    tons to the foot, or from 50 to 60 per cent, of the whole, which is increased by
                    the second and third working to 70 or 75 per cent., making a loss of from 25 to
                    30 per cent. This amount is reduced, however, by the long-wall method of
                    working.</p>
                <p>Probably from 10 to 15 per cent, may be taken as the unavoidable loss in working
                    under the most favourable conditions, but in many cases the proportion is
                    considerably higher.</p>
                <p>In the United Kingdom the ownership of coal, like that of other minerals, is in
                    the proprietor of the soil, and passes with it, except when specially reserved
                    in the sale. The greater number of collieries are worked upon leases, the rents
                    or royalties being variously charged in different localities. A minimum reserved
                    rent to cover a certain output, with a rate per ton on any quantity in excess,
                    is the most general practice; but in Lancashire and Yorkshire the royalties are
                    charged at a fixed rate per acre per annum upon each seam worked, and in South
                    Staffordshire at a proportion (from ⅜ to - <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛) of
                    the coal at the pit’s mouth.</p>
                <p>Coal lying under the sea below low-water mark belongs to the Crown, and can only
                    be worked upon payment of royalties, even when it is approached from shafts sunk
                    upon land in private ownership.</p>
                <p>In the Forest of Dean, which is the property of the Crown as a royal forest,
                    there are certain curious rights held by a portion of the inhabitants known as
                    the Free Miners of the Forest, who are entitled to mine for coal and iron ore,
                    under leases, known as gales, granted by the principal agent or gaveller
                    representing the Crown, in tracts not otherwise occupied. This is the only
                    instance in Great Britain of the custom of free mining under a Government grant
                    or concession, which is the rule in almost every country on the Continent.</p>
                <p>The working of collieries in the United Kingdom is subject to the provisions of
                    the Coal Mines Regulation Act of 1872, 35 and 36 Vict. cap. 76, which is
                    administered by inspectors appointed by the Home Office, and forms a complete
                    disciplinary code in all matters connected with coal-mining. Among the chief
                    provisions of the Act are the following :—</p>
                <p>1. Females and boys under 10 are not allowed to work underground.</p>
                <p>2. Boys between 10 and 12 are not allowed to work except in thin mines.</p>
                <p>3. No boy under 12 to drive a gin horse, or under 18 a steam-engine.</p>
                <p>4. Wages not to be paid at public-houses.</p>
                <p>5. Working of mines by a single shaft prohibited.</p>
                <p>6. Managers to be certificated as competent by a board of examiners.</p>
                <p>7. Annual return of coal wrought to be made to Inspectors.</p>
                <p>8. Notice of accidents to be sent to Inspector.</p>
                <p>9. Openings of abandoned workings to be fenced.</p>
                <p>10. Plans to be kept up to within six months of date.</p>
                <p>11. Plans of abandoned mines to be deposited with Home Office.</p>
                <p>12. General rules for the safety of miners in fiery mines, management of
                    ventilation, safety lamps, and gunpowder, protection against accidents in shafts
                    and levels, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>13. Power to frame special rules subject to approval of the Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <p>Breaches of the provisions of the Act are punishable by fine and imprisonment by
                    a court of summary jurisdiction, subject to appeal to the Quarter Sessions, or
                    to the Circuit Court in Scotland.</p>
                <p>The relation between the number of hands employed and the output of collieries
                    varies considerably in different districts, being highest in those where the
                    coal is moderately thick, soft, easily cut, regularly shaped, and with a good
                    roof, and least in faulted and disturbed seams, and those with a bad roof, where
                    the accessory operations of timbering and driving stone drifts require the
                    employment of a large proportion of the working staff on nonproductive work, <hi
                    rend="italic">iae.,</hi> other than cutting coal. The following figures give the
                    relative force employed above and below ground in two large steam-coal
                    collieries in South Wales, each producing about 500 tons per day :—</p>

                <p>These figures refer to some years back, and are probably not quite accurate at
                    the present date, as the amount of work done by the individual collier has
                    sensibly decreased in most countries. It will be seen that the output is
                    smallest in the thin disturbed measures of the Franco-Belgian coal-field.</p>

                    former and about 600 tons for the latter. The larger comparative yield in
                    lignite mines is due to the fact that a very large proportion are worked as
                    quarries.</p>
                <p>The annual production of coal throughout the world may be roughly estimated at

                <p>There is no trustworthy information as to the produce of China and Japan, but
                    these probably do not exceed 100,000 tons. In the larger coal-producing European
                    countries the output was very high in 1873, the following year having shown a
                    slight falling off, but in America the annual increase was maintained.</p>
                <p>According to the official mineral statistics, the produce of coal in the United
                    Kingdom for the years 1873, 1874, 1875, classified according to districts, was
                    as shown in the following table, from which it will be seen that the checkin 187

                <p>The principal sources of danger to the collier, as distinguished from other
                    miners, are explosion of fire-damp and falls of roof in getting coal,—these
                    together make up about 70 per cent, of the whole number of deaths. It will be
                    seen that the former class of accidents, though attended with great loss of life
                    at one time, are less fatal than the latter. The great increase in the deaths
                    from explosion in 1875, over the preceding year, is to be attributed to the
                    Swaithe Main explosion at Barnsley on December 6th, when 143 lives were

                    The latter quantities are in some degree conjectural, being dependent upon
                    estimated returns of produce, and are probably somewhat too large.</p>

                <p>In Prussia, in the year 1874, there were 484 deaths from accidents, which
                    corresponds to about three deaths per thousand hands employed, or, according to
                    the above <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n99/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0099-0080"/> classification, 1 in 334, with a produce of about
                    65,000 tons of coal for each death. It would appear, therefore, that the
                    proportional loss of life, in the collieries of the United Kingdom, is less than
                    that in foreign countries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Assay and Analysis. —</hi> The chemical examination of a coal
                    may be either complete or partial. When it is desired to obtain information as
                    to the exact composition, the analysis is conducted in the same manner as the
                    analysis of organic compounds by combustion with oxide of copper or chromate of
                    lead in a hard glass tube, the carbonic acid and water formed being absorbed by
                    solution of hydrate of potassium and dry chloride of calcium respectively, and
                    the proportion of carbon and hydrogen being calculated from the increase of
                    weight in the tubes containing the absorbing media. It is usual to operate upon
                    a small sample (about 5 grains), which is very finely powdered and placed in a
                    small trough or boat of platinum in the tube, the combustion being aided by a
                    stream of oxygen from a gasholder. By this means the incombustible residue or
                    ash is left in a condition for weighing, being free from admixture of foreign
                    substances. Sulphur is determined by the fusion of a weighed quantity with a
                    mixture of salt and nitrate of potassium in a platinum vessel, producing
                    sulphate of potassium, which, on the addition of a salt of barium, is
                    precipitated as sulphate of barium. Care must be taken to perform the operation
                    over a flame free from the vapour of sulphur compounds, which may vitiate the
                    result by apparently increas ing the amount of sulphur present. For this reason,
                    the flame of a spirit lamp is to be preferred in making the fusion to that of
                    coal gas, which is rarely free from sulphur compounds. Sulphur existing in the
                    form of gypsum or sulphate of calcium may be removed by washing a sample with
                    boiling water, and determining the sulphuric acid in the solution. The washed
                    sample is then fused with nitre in the usual way to determine the proportion of
                    sulphur existing as iron pyrites. This distinction is of importance in the
                    examination of coals intended for iron smelting, as the sulphates of the earthy
                    metals are reduced by the gases of the furnace to sulphides, which pass into the
                    slag without affecting the quality of the iron produced, while the sulphur of
                    the metallic sulphides in the ash acts prejudicially upon the metal.</p>
                <p>The difference between the original weight of the sample and that of the carbon,
                    hydrogen, sulphur, and ash, after making allowance for hygroscopic water, is
                    attributed to oxygen and nitrogen, which are not directly determined.</p>
                <p>The character of the ash affords some guide to the quality of the coal from which
                    it is derived. Thus, a red tint is generally indicative of the presence of iron
                    pyrites, and a light or white colour of its absence. Phosphorus if present will
                    be found in the ash, and may be determined by the ordinary processes of
                    analysis. A useful approximate method of determining the character of a coal is
                    by exposing a coarsely powdered sample of known weight, in a covered crucible,
                    to a strong red heat as long as inflammable vapours are given off, when it is
                    cooled and weighed. The loss of weight represents the volatile
                    constituents—hydrogen, oxygen, and hydrocarbon gases, produced by destructive
                    distillation, while the residual coke includes the ash, and is called fixed
                    carbon. The character of the button of coke obtained is a good indication as to
                    the caking or non-caking quality of the coal from which it is derived, and the
                    amount of ash may be determined by burning it in a muffle or over the flame of a
                    Bunsen burner. The fitness of a coal for gas-making is usually determined by
                    operating upon a sample of a few pounds’ weight in a special apparatus which
                    reproduces the processes of manufacture upon a small scale.</p>
                <p>One of the most important factors in the economic valuation of a coal, is the
                    so-called calorific power or value, by which is usually understood the number of
                    pounds of water at boiling point that can be evaporated by the complete
                    combustion of one pound of coal. This may be obtained theoretically, when the
                    composition of the coal is known, by computing the heating effect of the carbon
                    and the disposable hydrogen; but in the absence of an analysis, it may also be
                    determined directly by several approximate methods. One of the most convenient
                    instruments for this purpose is Thompson’s calorimeter. This consists of a
                    copper cylinder in which a weighed quantity of coal intimately mixed with
                    chlorate or nitrate of potassium is deflagrated under a copper case like a
                    diving-bell, placed at the bottom of a deep glass jar filled with a known weight
                    of water. The gases produced by the combustion rising through the water are
                    cooled, with a corresponding increase of temperature in the latter, so that the
                    difference between the temperature observed before and after the experiment
                    furnishes a measure of the evaporative power desired. The instrument is so
                    constructed that 30 grains of coal are burnt in 29,010 grains of water, or in
                    the proportion of 1 to 937, these numbers being selected that the observed rise
                    of temperature in Fahrenheit degrees corresponds to the required evaporative
                    value in pounds, subject only to a correction for the amount of heat absorbed by
                    the mass of the instruments, for which a special co-efficient is required, and
                    must be experimentally determined. Another approximate method, due to Berthier,
                    is based upon the reduction of oxide of lead by the carbon and hydrogen of the
                    coal, the amount of lead reduced affording a measure of the oxygen expended,
                    whence the heating power may be calculated, 1 part of pure carbon being capable
                    of producing 34⅜ times its weight of lead. The operation is performed by mixing
                    the weighed sample with a large excess <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> bf
                    litharge in a crucible, and exposing it to a bright red heat for a short time.
                    After cooling, the crucible is broken and the reduced button of lead is cleaned
                    and weighed. The results obtained by this method are less accurate with coals
                    containing much disposable hydrogen and iron pyrites than with those
                    approximating to anthracite, as the heat equivalent of the hydrogen in excess of
                    that required to form water with the oxygen of the coal is calculated as carbon,
                    while it is really about four times as great. Sulphur in iron pyrites also acts
                    as a reducing agent upon litharge, and increases the apparent effect in a
                    similar manner.</p>
                <p>The theoretical evaporative power of a coal found by either of the above methods
                    is always considerably above that obtained by actual combustion under a steam
                    boiler, as in the latter case numerous sources of loss, such as imperfect
                    combustion of gases, loss of unburnt coal in cinders, &lt;kc., come into play,
                    which cannot be allowed for in theoretical experiments. It is usual, therefore,
                    to determine the value of a coal by the combustion of a weighed quantity in the
                    furnace of a standard boiler, and measuring the amount of water evaporated by
                    the heat developed. Various investigations of this kind have been made at
                    different times, both in Europe and America, the most extensive being the
