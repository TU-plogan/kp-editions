                <p><label type="entry">CROCODILE</label><hi rend="italic">(forocodilia),</hi> an
                    order of Reptiles which, in the possession of a four-chambered heart, and of
                    distinct sockets for the teeth, and in the traces of a diaphragm, differs from
                    the other reptilian orders, and shows an approach in organization to
                    warm-blooded animals. The presence of a four-chambered heart does not prevent
                    that commingling of venous and arterial blood previous to its entrance into the
                    system, which is common to all reptiles, as this is effected in the present
                    order by means of a communication between the main arterial and venous tubes,
                    immediately outside the heart. Crocodiles are further characterized by the
                    presence of a partial dermal skeleton, developed in the leathery integument,
                    consisting of numerous square bony plates, keeled in the centre, and forming a
                    complete dorsal shield. The vertebrae of the neck bear upon each other by means
                    of rib-like processes, the neck being thus deprived to a great extent of its
                    mobility; hence the difficulty experienced by crocodiles in turning. The limbs
                    are short and insufficient to support its entire weight; it consequently drags
                    its body somewhat along the ground. The toes, of which there are five on each of
                    the posterior limbs, and four on the anterior pair, are more or less webbed,
                    while the three inner ones only are provided with claws. The nostrils, eyes, and
                    ears have lids or valves by which they can be closed at will, and the nostrils
                    do not open into the cavity of the mouth, but are carried back to the pharynx,
                    which can also be shut off from the outside by means of a valvular apparatus—an
                    arrangement of the greatest possible service to those reptiles in preventing
                    suffocation while seizing and holding their prey beneath the surface of the
                    water. The tongue is attached all round to the bottom of the mouth, and for this
                    reason the crocodile was formerly supposed to be destitute of that organ. The
                    teeth, which are numerous, sharp, and conical, are arranged in a single row in
                    both jaws, each tooth having its own socket, and the hollow at its base
                    containing the germ of a larger one, which by its growth gradually displaces<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n626/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0626-0593"/> the other. Three and even four generations of
                    teeth, incased within each other, are often thus contained in a single socket,
                    but the number of teeth above the surface remains the same at all ages. The
                    fourth tooth on each side of the lower jaw is larger than the others, and fits
                    into a notch or pit in the upper surface. As in snakes, the lower jaw is
                    attached to a process connected with and extending backwards from the skull,
                    which greatly adds to the animal’s gape, while giving it the appearance, in
                    opening its mouth, of moving both jaws. Beneath the lower jaw are two orifices
                    connected with glands which secrete a musky substance.</p>
                <p>Crocodiles are amphibious, leaving the water to bask in the sun on the mud-banks
                    of rivers and marshes, or to devour the prey they have previously drowned. They
                    are oviparous, depositing their eggs—from twenty to sixty in number, and
                    inclosed in a calcareous shell—in holes made in the sand or mud of the river
                    side, where they are left to be hatched by the heat of the sun, or as is the
                    case with certain American species, in hillocks formed by themselves, which they
                    hollow out and fill with leaves and other decaying vegetable matter, where the
                    eggs aro hatched by the heat generated in the decomposing mass. On quitting the
                    egg the young crocodiles are led to the water by the female parent, who feeds
                    them for some time with food which she herself disgorges, and otherwise shows
                    the greatest solicitude for their safety. The male takes no part in rearing the
                    young, but is said on the contrary to attack and devour them when not prevented
                    by his mate. Large numbers also fall victims to the rapacity uι fishes and
                    turtles, while the smaller Carnivora and certain birds destroy great quantities
                    of the eggs. The eggs, which in the common crocodile are nearly as large as
                    those of a goose, are in spite of their musky flavour held in great estimation
                    as an article of food in the regions where they occur, and this leads to a still
                    further diminution of the crocodilian progeny. During the first year the young
                    are said to feed on the larvae of insects and on small fishes. Crocodiles are
                    inhabitants of the rivers and marshy lagoons of tropical and subtropical
                    regions, a few only frequenting the brackish water of estuaries. One species—the
                    Alligator of North America —has a range sufficiently north of the tropics to
                    encounter ice in winter, while one of the Indian crocodiles ascends the courses
                    of the'rivers it frequents to such a height above the sea that the water it
                    occupies is often frozen. During the dry season these reptiles bury themselves
                    in the mud and remain dormant until the return of moister conditions, and they
                    have thus been known to exist without food for a whole year. Tennent states that
                    in Ceylon he has met with the mud case from which the Marsh Crocodile of that
                    island had recently withdrawn, and he also tells of an officer who, camping out
                    one night, was disturbed by a strange motion of the earth beneath his bed—a
                    phenomenon explained in the morning by the emergence of a crocodile. They also
                    bury themselves in the mud on the approach of danger, and when taken unawares
                    they feign death as a means of escape. The writer above alluded to states that
                    on one occasion his party came upon a sleeping crocodile, which on being struck,
                    after it had awakened and seen itself surrounded, lay perfectly quiet and
                    apparently dead; in a little while it was seen to glance furtively about, and
                    then make a rush towards the water. On receiving a second blow it again feigned
                    death, and this time no amount of poking could elicit the slightest sign of
                    life, until a lad by gently tickling it under the fore leg caused the reptile so
                    far to forget itself as to draw up its limb. They resort to a somewhat similar
                    stratagem in order the more readily to reach their prey. Lowering their head and
                    tail they allow themselves to be carried down by the current of the stream, and
                    in this position are said to bear the closest resemblance to floating logs of
                    wood—a disguise well fitted to allay suspicion in the animal they are seeking to
                    approach. They feed on fishes, and on the numerous quadrupeds which visit their
                    haunts in order to drink. The latter they seize and drag into the water, holding
                    them under the surface till life is extinct, and afterwards conveying the dead
                    body to the nearest sand-bank or river island, where it is often hidden until
                    putrefaction has rendered it sufficiently digestible. Although timid they do not
                    hesitate to attack man when off his guard, and bathing in tropical rivers is
                    rendered dangerous by their presence.</p>
                <p>There are three families of living crocodiles—Gavials, True Crocodiles, and
                    Alligators. The Gavials are readily distinguished by their greatly elongated and
                    narrow snout, and by the uniform size of their teeth (the five or six front
                    pairs excepted), of which the Gangetic species has fifty-two or fifty-four
                    above, and fifty or fifty-two below. It inhabits the lower parts of Indian
                    rivers, especially tho Ganges, where it performs the useful office of devouring
                    the carcases of animals that otherwise would pollute the sacred river. It
                    attains a length of over 17 feet, and the male is furnished with a large and
                    prominent swelling in front of the nostrils.</p>
                <p>The true Crocodiles have the so-called canine tooth of the lower jaw fitting into
                    a notch or furrow in the upper surface; the hind legs are bordered by a serrated
                    fringe, and the toes are almost completely webbed. Of these there are twelve
                    species, four of which are Asiatic, occurring eastward from the rivers and
                    estuaries of India to Australia; three are African, one ranging from Egypt to
                    the Cape, the others confined to the rivers of West Africa; while four belong to
                    the Neotropical Region of Central and South America. The Common Crocodile <hi
                    rend="italic">(Crocodilus</hi><hi rend="italic">vulgaris)</hi> may be taken as
                    typical of the family. It inhabits the chief rivers of Africa, but is best known
                    as a denizen of the Nile, where in ancient times the Egyptians regarded it as a
                    divinity. At Memphis and other cities temples were raised in its honour, in
                    which live crocodiles were kept,— these sacred reptiles being reared with the
                    greatest care, fed luxuriously, and adorned with costly trinkets. They were thus
                    rendered perfectly tame, and took part in tho religious processions and other
                    ceremonies performed in their honour. When dead their bodies were embalmed, and
                    extensive grottoes have been discovered at Maabdeh containing large numbers of
                    those reptilian mummies. Tho inhabitants of several Egyptian cities, however,
                    regarded the crocodile with entirely opposite sentiments, considering it to be
                    the incarnation of Typho, the genius of evil; and among these the ichneumon, as
                    the deadliest foe of the crocodile, was thought worthy of divine honours. Once a
                    year the people of Apollinopolis had a solemn hunt, in which they killed as many
                    crocodiles as possible, casting the dead bodies before the temple of their god;
                    and so expert had they grown in this sport that they did not hesitate to enter
                    the Nile, and bring the crocodile ashore by force. Crocodiles appear to have
                    been formerly abundant in all the known parts of the Nile, but have now
                    disappeared from the delta, and according to a recent authority are rarely seen
                    to the north of Beni Hassan, and are evidently receding from below the second
                    cataract. This is largely owing to the constant persecution they are subjected
                    to by the passengers on board the Nile steamers, to which also must be
                    attributed their exceeding wildness, for it is now almost impossible to come
                    within rifle shot of them. A small black-headed plover <hi rend="italic"
                    >(</hi><hi rend="italic">Charadrius</hi><hi rend="italic">ιnelanoce-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">phaluf)</hi> may often be seen perched on the reptile’s back,
                    attracted by the numerous insects which find a congenial residence there; and
                    this active little bird, by rising in the air and uttering a shrill cry, gives
                    its bulky patron timely warning of the approach of man. Towards <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0627-0594"/> the sources of the Nile the crocodile is still
                    abundant. Sir Samuel Baker states that when navigating the Albert Nyanzahe
                    observed every basking place covered with them, the creatures lying parallel to
                    each other like trunks of trees prepared for shipment, and that on one bank he
                    counted twenty-seven of large size. The flesh of this species is eaten by the
                    natives, but it does not seem suited to the European palate. “To my taste,” says
                    the authority just referred to, “nothing can be more disgusting than crocodile
                    flesh. I have eaten almost everything, but although I have tasted crocodile I
                    could never succeed in swallowing it. The combined flavour of bad fish, rotten
                    flesh, and musk is the <hi rend="italic">carte de diner</hi> offered to the
                    epicure.” In Siam the flesh of another species is regularly sold in the market
                    as human food. The Common Crocodile usually measures about 15 feet in
                    length.</p>
                <p>Alligators differ from the preceding group in having the canine tooth fitting
                    into a pit in the upper jaw; the hind legs are also destitute of fringe, and the
                    toes are less completely webbed. They are found in America only, and with one
                    exception are confined to its tropical parts. The Alligator <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Alligator mississippiensifi)</hi> occurs in the rivers and swamps of Mexico
                    and the United States, where it is a source of danger to all animals venturing
                    to enter the water. In winter this species retires into holes on the river
                    banks, and there hybernates. While thus dormant it is often got at by the
                    negroes, who unearth it for the sake of the tail, which they reckon a delicacy.
                    It is said to attain a length of 15 to 18 feet. The remaining eight species of
                    alligators are found chiefly in South America, where they are known as Caymans
                    and Jacarés. They abound in the Amazon and the Orinoco, the silence of whose
                    lonely banks is seldom broken except by their nocturnal bellowings. According to
                    Humboldt they resemble their Old World allies in lying basking in the sunshine,
                    wherever a shallow in the river discloses a sandbank, “with open jaws,
                    motionless, their uncouth bodies often covered with birds.”</p>
                <p>Fossil’remains referable to the order <hi rend="italic">Crocoãìlia</hi> occur for
                    the first time in the Trias, and continue to appear in allied forms during
                    succeeding periods. These have been very fully investigated, and Professor
                    Huxley has given a remarkably complete sketch of the life-history of the entire
                    order, recent and fossil. This he divides into three ' sub-orders. I. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Parasuchia,</hi> among other characters, both pterygoid and
                    palatine bones are destitute of bony plates to prolong the nasal passages, and
                    the centra of the vertebrae are amphicaelian, as in fishes. To this group
                    belongs the earliest of the crocodiles—the Triassic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stagonolepis</hi> of the Elgin sandstone, which somewhat resembled a cayman,
                    with the snout of a gavial. II. In the <hi rend="italic">Mesoszιchia,</hi> the
                    bony plates of the palatine bones prolong the nasal passages and give rise to
                    posterior nares, and the vertebral centra are amphicaelian. This group includes
                    such forms 'as <hi rend="italic">Teleosaιmιs</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Steneosawrus,</hi> ranging from the Liassic to the Cretaceous formations. III.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Eusuchia,</hi> both pterygoid and palatine bones give
                    off plates which prolong the nasal passages, and the centra of the vertebrae are
                    mostly procoelous. The species contained in this group make their appearance in
                    the Greensand of North America and in the Eocene of Europe, and to it belongs
                    all the existing crocodiles. This group was at one time much more generally
                    distributed than it is at present, representatives of gavials, crocodiles, and
                    alligators, now so widely apart, and altogether absent from Europe, being
                    found∙together in the Eocene beds of the south-west of England. The greatly
                    restricted range which characterizes their present distribution seems to mark
                    the crocodiles as a declining group. (J. GI.)</p>
