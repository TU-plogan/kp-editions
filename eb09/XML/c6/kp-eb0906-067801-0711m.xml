                <p><label type="entry">CUBA</label>, the largest and richest of the West Iηdia
                    Islands, and the most important colony of Spain, was discovered by Columbus on
                    28th October 1492, during his first voyage. It was first called Juana in honour
                    of Prince John, son of Ferdinand and Isabella; but after Ferdinand’s death it
                    received the name of Fernandina. It was subsequently designated Santiago, from
                    the patron saint of Spain; and still later Ave Maria, in honour of the Virgin.
                    Its present name is that by which it was known among the natives at the time of
                    its discovery. It was then divided into nine independent principalities, under
                    as many <hi rend="italic">caciques.</hi> The aborigines are described as living
                    in a state of happy tranquillity among themselves, and possessing a religion
                    devoid of rites and ceremonies, but inculcating a belief in the existence of a
                    great and beneficent Being and in the immortality of the soul. Cuba was twice
                    visited by Columbus after its discovery—in April 1494, and again in 1502. In
                    1511 his son Diego Columbus, for the purpose of colonizing the island, fitted
                    out an expedition, consisting of above 300 men, under Diego Velasquez, who had
                    accompanied his father on his second voyage. Their first settlement was Baracoa,
                    and in 1514 they founded Santiago and Trinidad. In July 1515 was planted a town
                    called San Cristoval de la Havana, which name was transferred in 1519 to the
                    present capital, the first-named place being now called Batabano. In 1538 Havana
                    was reduced to ashes by a French privateer; and to prevent a similar disaster in
                    future the Castillo de la Fuerza, a fortress which still exists, was built by
                    Fernando de Soto, governor of Cuba, afterwards famous for his explorations in
                    the southern and western regions of the United States, as well as for the
                    discovery of the Mississippi. In 1554 the French again attacked and destroyed
                    Havana. The early settlers devoted themselves principally to the rearing of
                    cattle; but about 1580 the cultivation of tobacco and the sugar-cane was
                    commenced, and this led to the introduction of the system of negro slavery.
                    Previous to 1600 two other fortresses were built for the defence of Havana—the
                    Moro and the Punta, which are still in existence. For about a century and a half
                    after this period the island was kept in a state of almost perpetual fear of
                    invasion from the French, English, Dutch, or the pirates infesting these seas;
                    and several ineffectual efforts were made to reduce it. About 1665 the walls of
                    Havana were commenced. In 1762 Havana was taken by an English fleet and army
                    under Lord Albemarle, the former consisting of more than 200 vessels of all
                    classes, and the latter of 14,041 men, while the Spanish army numbered 27,610
                    men. The defence was exceedingly obstinate. The English commer ced operations on
                    the 6th of June; but it was not until the 30th of July that the Moro Castle
                    surrendered; and on the 14th August the city capitulated. The spoil divided
                    among the captors amounted to £736,185. By the treaty of Paris, in February of
                    the following year Cuba was restored to the Spaniards, and from that time its
                    progress has been rapid; indeed, this restoration is regarded by native writers
                    as the true era whence its importance and prosperity are to be dated. The
                    administration of Las Casas, who arrived as captain-general in 1790, is
                    represented by all Spanish writers as a brilliant epoch in Cuban history. He
                    promoted with indefatigable perseverance a series of public works of the first
                    utility, introduced the culture of indigo, extended the commercial importance of
                    the island by removing as far as his authority extended the trammels imposed
                    upon it by the old system of privilege and restriction, and made noble efforts
                    to effect the emancipation of the enslaved native Indians. By his judicious
                    administration the tranquillity of the island was maintained uninterrupted at
                    the time of the revolution in San Domingo; although, as is generally believed, a
                    conspiracy was formed at the instigation of the French among the free people of
                    colour in Cuba. In 1795 a number of French emigrants arrived from San Domingo.
                    In 1802 Jesu Maria, a populous suburb of Havana, was destroyed by a fire, which
                    deprived 11,400 people of their habitations. On the deposition of the royal
                    family of Spain by Napoleon (the news of which arrived in July 1808) every
                    member of the Cabildo took oath to preserve the island for the deposed
                    sovereign, and declared war against Napoleon. Since that time the island has
                    been ruled over by a succession of governor-captain-generals from Spain, armed
                    with almost absolute authority, some of whom have conducted themselves
                    honourably, while the names of others arc loaded with infamy, the office having
                    been frequently sought and bestowed only as the means of acquiring a fortune.
                    The deprivation of political, civil, and religious liberty, and exclusion from
                    all public stations, combined with a heavy taxation to maintain the standing
                    army and navy, have resulted in a deadly hatred between the native Cubans and
                    the mass of officials sent from Spain. This has manifested itself in frequent
                    risings for greater privileges and freedom. Of this kind were the conspiracy of
                    the “Black Eagle” in 1829, the insurrection of the black population in 1844, the
                    conspiracy of Narciso Lopez in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0712-0679"/> 1848, his landing with 600 men from the United
                    States in 1850, and his third attempt in 1851, which cost his life and that of
                    many of his followers. Soon after this a reformist party sprang up, desirous of
                    coming to a settlement which should insure the rights of the colony without
                    impairing the interests of Spain, and after protracted efforts this party
                    succeeded in obtaining an inquiry at Madrid on the reforms needed by Cuba; but
                    the only alteration decreed was that of a new system of taxation, more
                    oppressive than the former. Great sympathy had long been shown for the Cubans by
                    the people of the United States, and in 1848 President Polk had gone the length
                    of proposing through the American ambassador at Madrid a transference of the
                    island to the United States for a sum of $1,000,000. A similar proposal was made
                    ten years afterwards in the senate—the sum suggested being $30,000,000—but after
                    debate it was withdrawn. When the Spanish revolution of 1868 broke out, the
                    advanced party in Cuba at once matured their plans for the liberation of the
                    island from the military despotism of Spain, rose in arms at Yara in the
                    district of Bayamo, and made a declaration of independence, dated at Manzanillo,
                    on the 10th of October of that year. This insurrection soon assumed formidable
                    dimensions in the eastern portion of the island; on the 18th of October the town
                    of Bayamo was taken, and on the 28th the jurisdiction of Holguin rose in arms.
                    Early in November the patriots defeated a force which had been sent against them
                    from Santiago de Cuba, and the greater number of the Spanish-American republics
                    hastened to recognize the Cubans as belligerents. During subsequent years, in
                    spite of the large and continued increase of the number of troops sent from
                    Spain, and organized by the Spanish authorities in the island, the yearly
                    campaigns up to the present time have shown that in the eastern interior the
                    Cuban patriots are practically invincible, and that by maintaining a guerilla
                    warfare they can attack and harass and even defeat their enemies who may be bold
                    enough to act on the aggressive.</p>
                <p>In a debate on Cuban affairs in the Cortes of Madrid in November 1876 it was
                    stated that, during the past eight years, in attempting to crush the insurgents,
                    Spain hud sent to Cuba 145,000 soldiers and her most favoured commanders, but
                    with little or no result. On tl.3 other hand Cuba, under the perpetual
                    apprehension of the rebellion, has seen her trade decrease, her crops reduced,
                    and her creoles deserting to the United Statesand Spanish republics; and her
                    taxes have been trebled in vain to meet the ever-increasing expenses and
                    floating debts.</p>
                <p>The island of Cuba is long and narrow, somewhat in the form of an irregular
                    crescent with its convex side towards the north. It divides the entrance to the
                    Gulf of Mexico into two passages, that to the north-west being 130 English miles
                    wide at the narrowest part, between the points of Ycacos in Cuba and Sable on
                    the Florida coast, and the south-west passage of nearly the same width, between
                    the Cabo de San Antonio of Cuba and the Cabo de Catoche, the most salient
                    extremity of the peninsula of Yucatan. On the north-east, east, and south-east,
                    narrower channels separate it from the Bahamas, Hayti, and Jamaica. Cuba lies
                    between 74° and 85° W. long., aud 19° and 23° N. lat. Its length, following a
                    curved line through its centre, is 730 miles, and its average breadth is 80
                    miles. The area of Cuba is 43,319 English square miles; the neighbouring island
                    of Pinos, 1214 square miles; and the smaller coastal islands, 1350 square
                    miles;—in all 45,883 square miles. The coast of Cuba is generally low and flat,
                    and is surrounded by numerous islands and reefs, which render the approach both
                    difficult and dangerous to those not acquainted with the proper channels. The
                    low nature of the shore subjects it to frequent floods and inundations; and
                    especially on the north side of the island there are many large lagoons, from
                    which a considerable quantity of salt is obtained. No island, however, in
                    proportion to its size, has a greater number of excellent harbours, many of them
                    accessible even to ships of the line. Of these the chief are the ports of Bahia,
                    Honda, Mariel, Havana, Matanzas, Cardenas, Nuevitas, and Nipe on the northern
                    side, and Guatanamo, Santiago de Cuba, Trinidad, and Cienfuegos on Xagua Bay on
                    the southern.</p>
                <p>The highest part of the island is in the range extending in the south-east from
                    the Punta de Maysi to Cape Cruz, called the Sierra or Montaños de Maestra or
                    Cobre, the summits of whieh are the Pico de Tarquino, 7670 feet, the highest
                    point of the whole island; Gran Piedra, 5200 feet; Yunque and Ojo del Toro, 3500
                    feet. From this sierra a ridge of much smaller general elevation follows nearly
                    the central line of the island westward throughout its extent, rising to form a
                    more marked range in the extreme west of Cuba, on which the Pan de Guajaibon
                    attains 2530 feet An almost isolated mass, of which the Pico de Potrerillo is
                    the summit, 2990 feet above the sea, rises immediately behind the harbour of
                    Trinidad, near the centre of the southern coastland. The south-eastern sierra is
                    one great calcareous mass, resting on a schistose formation. The summits are for
                    the most part rocky and naked, occasionally interrupted by more gentle
                    undulations. The central and western parts of the island contain two formations
                    of compact limestone, one of clayey sandstone, and another of gypsum. Caverns
                    abound in the limestone formations. The secondary formations, east of Havana,
                    are pierced by syenitic and euphotide rocks united in groups. The syenite strata
                    are intercalated with serpentine, and inclined to the north-west. In some places
                    petroleum runs out of rents in the serpentine; and abundant springs of this
                    fluid are also found in the eastern part of the island.</p>
                <p>The rivers are necessarily short, and flow toward the north and south. The
                    largest is the Cauto, rising in the Sierra del Cobre, and falling into the Bay
                    of Buena Esperanza on the southern coast, after a course of fifty leagues, for
                    twenty of which it is navigable by boats, though at low water obstructed by
                    bars. The Sagua la Grande rises in the Sierra del Escambray, and falls into the
                    sea in front of the Boca de Maravillas, being navigable for five leagues. The
                    principal of the other rivers are the Sagua le Chica, the North and South
                    Iatibonica, the Cuyaguateje, Sasa, Agobama, and Hanabana. North-east of
                    Guantanamo the hills of the south-eastern sierra are known as those of Quibijan
                    and Baracoa, and in the hill of Moa in this range there is formed a huge cavern
                    in which the River Moa descends from a height of 100 yards, forming a superb
                    cascade.</p>
                <p>Situated within and near the border of the northern tropical zone the climate of
                    the low coastlands of Cuba is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n713/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0713-0680"/> that of the torrid zone, but the higher interior
                    of the island enjoys a more temperate atmosphere. As in other lands on the
                    border of the tropics, the year is divided between a hotter and wetter season,
                    corresponding to the northern declination of the sun, and a cooler and drier
                    period. The months from the beginning of May to October are called the wet
                    season, though rain falls in every month of the year. With May spring begins in
                    the island, rain and thunder are of almost daily occurrence, and the temperature
                    rises high with little daily variation. The period from November to April is
                    called the dry season by contrast. On a mean of seven years, the rainfall at
                    Havana in the wet season has been observed to be 27 ’ 8 inches, of the dry
                    months 12 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 or 40 ’ 5 inches for the year. At
                    Havana in the warmest months, those of July and August, the average temperature
                    is 82° Fahr., fluctuating between a maximum of 88° and a minimum of 76°; in the
                    cooler months of December and January the thermometer averages 72°, the maximum
                    being 78°, the minimum 58°; the average temperature of the year at Havana, on a
                    mean of seven years, is 77°. But in the interior, at elevations of over 300 feet
                    above the sea, the thermometer occasionally falls to the freezing point in
                    winter, hoar frost is not uncommon, and during north winds thin ice may form,
                    though snow is unknown in any part of the island. The prevailing wind is the
                    easterly trade breeze, but from November to February cool north winds <hi
                    rend="italic">(los</hi><hi rend="italic">nortes,</hi> or “northers ”), rarely
                    lasting more than forty-eight hours, are experienced in the western portion of
                    the island, to which they add a third seasonal change. From 10 to 12 o’clock are
                    the hottest hours of the day; after noon a refreshing breeze <hi rend="italic"
                    >(la virazon)</hi> sets in from the sea. Hurricanes may occur from August to
                    October, but are less frequent than in Jamaica or Hayti, and sometimes five or
                    six years may pass without such a storm. Slight shocks of earthquake are
                    occasionally felt. There are no diseases specially indigenous to the island; the
                    yellow fever, which breaks out with renewed virulence regularly with the wet
                    season in the coastlands and seaports of Cuba, annually causing great loss of
                    life, is quite unknown in the interior.</p>
                <p>The mineral riches of the island have not yet been explored to any considerable
                    extent. Though gold and silver have undoubtedly been found in the island, the
                    quantity has never been sufficient to repay the labour of search. Gold was sent
                    to Spain from this island by the early settlers, but it was more probably the
                    accumulated wealth of the aborigines in previous centuries, wrested from them by
                    tyranny and rapine at the period of the conquest, than the product of honest
                    labour on the part of the colonists. Traces of auriferous sand are found in the
                    rivers Holguin, Escawbray, &amp;c. Some specimens of the finest gold have been
                    obtained from the workings of Agabama and Sagua la Grande, but at an expense of
                    time and labour that could not remunerate the parties engaged in it. In 1827
                    silver and copper were discovered in the jurisdiction of Villa Clara, and the
                    first ores gave no less than 7 oz. of pure silver to the quintal ( = 107¾ lb) of
                    ore; but they have become less productive, probably from not being properly
                    worked. The Cobre copper mines, twelve miles from</p>
                <p>Santiago, in the eastern part of the island, are of great extent, and very rich;
                    a village of 2000 inhabitants has formed on their site, and a railroad unites
                    them with the shipping port of Punta de Sal. As much as 50 tons of ore are taken
                    out daily, the richest part of which, being broken up, is shipped to Europe;
                    while the poorer part is smelted at the works, yielding about 14 per cent, of
                    metal. These mines were wrought with some success during the 17th century, and
                    had been abandoned for more than 100 years. Coal of a highly bituminous
                    character, affording a strong heat, and leaving very little solid residue in the
                    form of ashes or cinders, is very abundant. In some places it degenerates into a
                    form resembling asphaltum, and near the coast it is often found in a semi-liquid
                    state like petroleum or naphtha. In the quarries near Havana a thick slate is
                    found, fit for floors and pavements. Marbles and jaspers, of various colours,
                    and susceptible of a high polish, are found in many parts of the island, and
                    particularly in the Isle of Pines. It is generally believed that iron exists in
                    various districts of Cuba, and many parts of the great Cordillera undoubtedly
                    contain rocks of a ferruginous nature; but from the difficulty of access, the
                    scarcity of fuel, and the want of capital, no extensive mining operations have
                    been engaged in. Native loadstone, however, has been found in various parts, and
                    chalybeate springs are numerous.</p>
                <p>The only peculiar quadruped known in the island is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >jutia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hutia,</hi> an animal shaped like a rat, and
                    from 12 to 18 inches in length exclusive of the tail. It is of a clear black
                    colour, inhabits the hollows and clefts of trees, and feeds on leaves and
                    fruits. Its flesh is insipid, but is sometimes eaten. A few deer are found about
                    the swamps, but they are supposed to have been introduced from the continent.
                    The woods abound in wild dogs and cats, sprung from these animals in a domestic
                    state, and differing from them only in habits and size. They are very
                    destructive to poultry and cattle. Of domestic animals, the ox, the horse, and
                    the pig are the most valuable, and form a large proportion of the wealth of the
                    island; the sheep, goats, and mules, are less numerous. The manati frequents the
                    shores. The domestic fowls include geese, turkeys, peacocks, and pigeons. The
                    indigenous birds are distinguished by the beauty of their plumage, and are very
                    numerous, including upwards of 200 species. Birds of prey are few. The vulture
                    and turkey-buzzard are protected by law and custom, on account of their services
                    in the removal of offal. The rivers, bays, and inlets are well supplied with
                    fish. Oysters and other shell-fish are numerous, but of inferior quality. The
                    reefs and shallows, and the sandy portion of the beach, abound in turtle; and
                    the crocodile, cayman, and iguana are common. Large numbers of land-crabs are
                    frequently seen; they cross the island from north to south every spring, when
                    the rains commence. Snakes are not numerous; the <hi rend="italic">mcιja</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> 12 or 14 feet in length, and 18 or 20 inches in
                    circumference—is the largest, but is harmless; the <hi rend="italic">juba,</hi>
                    which is about 6 feet long, is venomous. Among the insects may be specially
                    noticed the bee and the phosphorescent fly. These flies are very numerous, and
                    much used amon r the poorer inhabitants. Fifteen or twenty of them confined in a
                    calabash pierced with holes frequently serve during the night as a sort of
                    lantern. The noxious insects are the chigoe or jigger, a species of ant called
                    vivajagua, the mosquito, the sand-fly, the scorpion (less poisonous than that of
                    Europe ∖ and spiders whose bite is malignant enough to produce fever.</p>
                <p>The forests of Cuba are of vast extent, and so dense as to be almost
                    impenetrable. It is estimated that of nearly 20,000,000 acres of land still
                    remaining perfectly wild and uncultivated, nearly 13,000,000 are uncleared
                    forest. Mahogany and other hard woods, such as the Cuban ebony, cedar, sabicei,
                    and granadilla, valuable for manufactures, cabinet work, and ship-building, are
                    indigenous, and are exported to a considerable extent. The palm is the queen of
                    the Cuban forests, and the most valuable tree on the island. The most common
                    species, the <hi rend="italic">Palma Peal (Oreodoxa regia),</hi> is found in all
                    parts, but especially in the west. The fruits of Cuba are those common to the
                    tropics, of which the pine-apple and orange are the most esteemed. Of the
                    alimentary plants, the plantain is by far the most important. Next in order come
                    the sweet and bitter cassava—the sweet root being eaten <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n714/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0714-0681"/> as a vegetable, and the bitter converted into
                    bread after its poisonous juice has been extracted. The sweet potato, and other
                    farinaceous roots, are also common. Indian corn is indigenous, and rice is
                    extensively cultivated; cocoa or chocolate is also grown.</p>
                <p>The chief agricultural products of Cuba are, however, sugar, coffee, and tobacco.
                    The “ingeniös” or sugar estates, with large buildings and mills for
                    sugar-refining and distillation of rum, are the most important industrial
                    establishments of the island, varying in extent from 500 to as much as 10,000
                    acres. Of late years, partly from the effects of the insurrection, and partly
                    from the rapidly extending cultivation of beet-root sugar in other countries,
                    the demand for Cuban sugar has been diminishing, and the sugar estateshave not
                    flourished. The United States take about 70 or 80 per cent, of the sugar grown
                    in Cuba, the greater part of the remainder passing to Europe. The quantity
                    exported in 1873 from the ports of Havana, Matanzas, Cardenas, Sagua la Grande,
                    Remedies, Nuevitas, Santiago de Cuba, Trinidad, and Cienfuegos exceeded 600,000
                    tons, of a value of about £12,000,000. Besides this 242,000 tons of molasses
                    were exported. After the “ingeniös” the “cafetales” or coffee estates are the
                    most important establishments. They vary in extent from 100 to upwards of 1000
                    acres, or even more in the mountain districts,—the number of hands employed
                    being as high as 100 in the low country, but generally averaging fifty or sixty
                    negroes to 1000 acres. The first coffee plantation was established in 1748, the
                    seeds having been brought from San Domingo. Though at one time coffee was sent
                    out from Cuba in enormous quantities, it does not now figure largely in the
                    exports. Tobacco is indigenous to Cuba, and its excellent quality is celebrated
                    in all parts of the world. The estates devoted to its cultivation are scattered
                    over the greater part of the island, but the finest qualities of tobacco are
                    those grown in the country west of Havana, known as the “vuelta abajo.” In 1873,
                    224,765,000cigars were exported, besides nearly 13,500,000 tt&gt; of leaf, to
                    the United States, Great Britain, Hamburg and Bremen, Holland, France, and
                    Spain. Among the other industrial establishments of Cuba may be mentioned the
                    numerous cattle farms, cotton plantations, fruit and vegetable farms, chocolate
                    plantations, and “colmenaries” or farms devoted to the production of honey and
                    wax.</p>
                <p>The imports consist mainly of jerked beef from South America, codfish from the
                    British North American provinces, flour from Spain, rice from Carolina, Spain,
                    and the East Indies, wine and olive oil from Spain, boards for boxes and barrels
                    from North America, coals from Europe and North America, and petroleum from the
                    United States, besides large quantities of British, German, and Belgian
                    manufactures and hardwares. Heavy differential duties in favour of goods
                    Imported into Cuba in Spanish ships are in force, so that the greater part of
                    the imports arrive in these. Cattle are imported from Florida and the coasts of
                    the Mexican Gulf. There are no manufacturing industries of importance in the
                    island.</p>
                <p>Education is in a remarkably backward state in Cuba. In the absence of recent
                    statistics, it is estimated that of perhaps 100,000 children of free parents,
                    not a tenth part receive lettered education of any kind; and even among the
                    higher classes of society liberal education is very far from being universally
                    diffused. A few literary and scientific men, wherever educated, are however to
                    be found both in the higher and middle ranks, and, previous to the disturbances
                    which began in 1868, the question of public instruction excited much interest
                    among the creole population, an impetus to this having been given by the same
                    liberal portion of the population which originated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sociedad Economica</hi> of Havana and Santiago de Cuba, an institution which
                    has for its object the advancement of education and popular industry. At Havana
                    is the royal university with a rector and thirty professors and medical and law
                    schools, as well as an institution called the Royal College of Havana. There is
                    a similar establishment at Puerto Principe, in the eastern interior; and both at
                    Havana and Santiago de Cuba there is a college in which the branches of
                    ecclesiastical education are taught, together with the humanities and
                    philosophy. Besides this there are several private schools, but none are
                    accessible to the masses. The inhabitants of Havana can scarcely be said to have
                    any literature—a few daily and weekly journals, under a rigid censorship, supply
                    almost all the taste for letters in the capital.</p>
                <p>The Roman Catholic is the only religion tolerated by Government. At first there
                    was but one diocese, which included not only the whole island, but also
                    Louisiana and the two Floridas, all under one bishop. In 1788 Cuba was divided
                    into two dioceses, each embracing half the island. The eastern diocese, or that
                    of Santiago de Cuba, was in 1804 erected into an archbishopric, while that of
                    Havana still remains under a bishop.</p>
                <p>Politically the island is a province of Spain ruled over directly by a
                    governor-captain-general of the class of lieutenant-general of the Spanish army,
                    whose authority for the time being is despotic. He is appointed by the Crown,
                    the term of office being generally from three to five years, is responsible only
                    to the sovereign of Spain, and is supreme head of the civil, military, and
                    ecclesiastical jurisdictions of Cuba. The captain-general is assisted by
                    governors of departments, who have under their orders the lieutenant-governors,
                    commanders of the thirty-tw o jurisdictions of the island, each of which is
                    subdivided into “partidos” or captaincies. In each city or town a municipal body
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">ayuntamento,</hi> or town council, is at the head
                    of affairs, but municipal representation exists only in appearance. The military
                    division is into two departments—that of the west with Havana for its capital,
                    and that of the east with Santiago de Cuba for its head-quarters. The boundary
                    between these departments, vhich is also the limit of the dioceses, starts from
                    the brook Yana in front of the eastern part of the island of Yuriguano, and
                    terminates near Sabana-la-Mar.</p>
                <p>The judicial division comprises the whole island, as the territory of the “Real
                    Audiencia Prétorial,” or supreme court. In each of the twenty-six judicial
                    districts into which this is subdivided there is an “alcalde mayor,” having for
                    auxiliary delegates the ordinary “alcaldes,” or local judges. The “Real
                    Audiencia,” holding session at Havana, is a species of council of state which
                    the captaingeneral consults on all difficult matters of administration. The
                    maritime division is subject to a commander-general, and consists of five
                    stations or provinces, with their centres at Havana, Trinidad, San Juan de los
                    Remedies, Nuevitas, and Santiago de Cuba.</p>
                <p>In popular language the different portions of the island are distinguished as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vuelta Abajo,</hi> or the portion extending from the meridian
                    of Havana to the western extremity of the island; the <hi rend="italic">Vuelta
                    Arriba,</hi> from the meridian of Havana towards the east as far as Cienfuegos;
                    <hi rend="italic">Las Cinco Villas</hi> from the meridian of Cienfuegos to that
                    of Santo Espiritu; and <hi rend="italic">Tierra Adentro</hi> from that of Santa
                    Espiritu to Holguin and the extreme east of the island.</p>
                <p>The Crown revenues of the island are the <hi rend="italic">rentas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">maritimas,</hi> including duties on imports, exports, and tonnage,
                    and the local or municipal duties levied at some of the custom-houses; the <hi

                    on home manufactures, the sale of stamped paper, the profits derived from the
                    lottery, and the impost on cock-fights; deductions from the <hi rend="italic"

                    the consolidated fund, the sinking fund, the <hi rend="italic">media</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">annata,</hi> and the annual and monthly revenues of the clergy;
                    personal deductions, such as from the pay of public functionaries, and the price
                    of exemption from military service; miscellaneous receipts, as the produce of
                    the sale of royal lands, the rents of vacant livings and of unclaimed estates,
                    the produce of vendible offices; and casual receipts, including deposits,
                    confiscations, donations, and the recovery of arrears.</p>
                <p>Previous to the outbreak of the insurrection of 1868 the total revenue of Cuba
                    had reached nearly to 26,000,000 dollars, of which sum about 6,000,000 dollars
                    was annually remitted to Spain, leaving the remainder to cover the expenses of
                    the army, navy, and civil service of the island. Since 1868 the imposts have
                    been much increased, but have not been sufficient to cover the enormous increase
                    of expenditure consequent on the rebellion. The Government of the island has
                    thus been compelled to borrow large sums for its war funds. Public finances are
                    specially under the management of the Government bank called the Banco Español,
                    and have fallen into an unsatisfactory and confused state consequent on the
                    steps taken by the island Government for obtaining funds by the emission of
                    large amounts of notes without additional security, and without a special
                    guarantee for each issue from the Madrid Government, resulting in a depreciation
                    of the paper, or a premium on gold and silver.</p>
                <p>The coins in use are chiefly the old Spanish “doblon,” or “onza de oro,” worth
                    about £3, 4s., or 16 silver dollars of Spain, but it is legal tender for 17
                    dollars in the island. Gold coins of half a doblon, “media onza,” of 8 dollars
                    50 cents, and of half and quarter that amount, and the “peso,” or dollar in gold
                    or silver, are also in circulation. There is scarcely any smaller silver
                    currency in Cuba, excepting the American 10 cent piece or dime, called the “real
                    sencilia.”</p>
                <p>The roads of Cuba are generally in a very wretched condition. Several railways
                    have been established. The oldest, opened in 1838, extends from Havana to
                    Guines, a distance of forty-five miles, and has branches to Batabano, San
                    Antonio, and Los Palos. There are lines in operation from Matanzas to Sabanilla,
                    Cardenas to Bamba and Jucaro, and thence to unite with the line which crosses
                    the island between Sagua la Grande and Cienfuegos, as well as from Puerto
                    Principe to Nuevitas. The whole length of lines in operation is nearly 400
                    miles. Coastal communication is kept up by steamers which ply regularly between
                    the different ports. Numerous lines of steamers run between Havana and New York,
                    New Orleans, Key West, Philadelphia, and Baltimore; and with Europe
                    communication is maintained by English mail as well as French and German lines
                    of ocean steamers. The island is connected by telegraph with the mainland and
                    with Jamaica.</p>
                <p>Conflicting accounts render it impossible to arrive at anything like certainty as
                    to the number of inhabitants on the island at the time of its conquest; but it
                    may be estimated at from 300,000 to 400,000. There is little doubt, however,
                    that before 1560 the whole of this population had disappeared from the island.
                    The first census of Cuba was taken in 1774, when the population was 171,620. In
                    1791 it was 272,300. The following table gives the population since that period

                <p>An estimate, based on this census, made in 1869 gives the total population as
                    1,414,508, including 50,000 coolies.</p>
                <p>The following statement appears in The Times, March 16, 1877:—</p>
                <p>“The American press despatch from Havana states that the official figures show
                    that in the year 1870 there were in the island 363,000 slaves; in 1873, 287,000;
                    and 1876, 199,000.</p>
                <p>The numbers of free blacks in the island in 1873 was 26,000; in 1874, 50,000; in
                    1875, 75,000; and in 1876, 84,000. The free blacks in the four jurisdictions in
                    which no census could be taken are estimated at 6000.”</p>
                <p>Writing in 1872, Mr Gallenga quotes an official statement of the population,
                    giving a total of 1,359,437; or 1,034,616 in the western division of which
                    Havana (population, 230,000) is the chief city; 75,725 in the central districts
                    round Puerto Principe (population, 31,000); and 249,096 in the eastern division,
                    the chief town of which is Santiago de Cuba (population, 37,000). The only other
                    town of importance is Matanzas with a population of 36,000.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Cuba are divided into four classes,— the native Spaniards, who
                    occupy nearly all the c ffices of power and trust; the creoles, who are mostly
                    planters, farmers, or lawyers, and are generally looked upon with contempt by
                    the Spaniards; the third class, composed of free mulattoes and free negroes in
                    about equal parts, who are excluded by law from all civil offices; those under
                    servitude, constituting the fourth class, divided into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bozales,</hi> those recently brought from Africa,—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ladinos,</hi> those imported before the law of 1821 prohibiting the slave
                    trade,— and the <hi rend="italic">crioUos</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    f</hi> those born on the island. Cuba was long notorious for the extent to which
                    the slave trade was carried on there, and the ineffectual efforts made to
                    suppress it. The English Government succeeded, however, in 1853 in inducing the
                    Spanish-Government to pledge itself to adopt measures for its suppression; and
                    the importation of African slaves has consequently ceased for a number of years.
                    In their place Asiatic coolies have been introduced in considerable numbers, and
                    the plan has worked well for the planters, though it is almost certain death in
                    a short time to the coolies, who are slaves in almost every sense.</p>
                <p>Under a better and more liberal system of government, there can be no doubt that
                    Cuba would speedily attain a much higher state of prosperity and importance than
                    it has yet enjoyed. Great as is its productiveness at present, some writers
                    assert that under good government it would be increased five-fold; its mineral
                    resources would then be fully developed, and it would be able fully to take
                    advantage of its admirable position to develop its trade.</p>
