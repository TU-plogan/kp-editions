                    consists of three principal parts,—the card, the needle on its lower surface,
                    and the case. The whole is enclosed in the compass-box, or binnacle. The term
                    compass is said to have been applied to the instrument because the card involves
                    or compasses the whole plane of the horizon, or because the needle indicates the
                    whole circle of possible variations of direction. The surface of the card is
                    divided by radiating lines into 32 parts, each containing 1 l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi> 15'; these constitute the 32 points or rhumbs; the
                    half-points and quarters are subdivisions of the same. The north pole is denoted
                    on the card by a <hi rend="italic">fleur-de-lis</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to Mr T. S. Davies, this may
                    originally have been an ornamented cross</p></note><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    the line which joins the north and south poles passes through the axis of the
                    needle. The points are named according to their proximity to the four cardinal
                    points; for instance, the point mid-way between N. and N.E. is called
                    north-north-east, being nearer north than east, and is marked N.N.E; the point
                    mid-way between N. and N.N.E. is termed north by east, and is marked N. by E.
                    The circumference of the card is sometimes divided into 360°. The divisions of
                    the card are shown in the accompanying figure. The card is directed by the
                    needle, which, with it, is pivoted on a vertical axis. With a little variation,
                    the needle points nearly to the geographical north, and hence the mode of
                    steering by the compass. Four or more parallel magnets, with like poles pointing
                    in like directions, may be combined to form the needle; and by this arrangement
                    the magnetic moment is increased for a given weight of steel. The needle is
                    usually suspended on a central cap of ruby or agate, the point of suspension
                    being of a similar hard material. On the inside of the compass-box is a vertical
                    line known as lubber’s point; and since this and the pivot of the card are in
                    the same plane with the ship’s keel, the point on the circumference of the card
                    opposite to lubber’s point shows the angle the ship’s course makes with the
                    magnetic meridian. The compass is kept horizontal by the use of a gimbal, or
                    ring moving freely on an axis, wſlthin which it swings on an axis at right
                    angles. In the azimuth compass the circumference of the card is divided into
                    degrees and parts by a vernier, and is fitted up with sight-vanes to take
                    amplitudes and azimuths, for the purpose of determining the variation of the
                    compass by observation. The variation is applied to the magnetic course shown by
                    the steering compass, and thus the true course with respect to the meridian
                    becomes known.</p>
                <p>The conditions that chiefly affect the use of the mariner’s compass are those of
                    the magnetic declination and deviation. The declination is the angle contained
                    between the geographical or true and the magnetic meridian; or, as Barlowe
                    defines it, the swerving of the pointing of the magnetical needle in the horizon
                    from the meridian line there. The angle of declination varies according to
                    locality, and must be ascertained at sea by means of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0253-0226"/> azimuth compass. The discovery of the variation
                    of declination was made by Stephen Burrowes when voyaging between the north cape
                    of Finmark and Vaigatch (Vay-gates),and was afterwards determined by Gillebrand,
                    professor of geometry at Gresham College. In 1683, in a communication to the
                    Royal Society <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> June 16, p. 214), Dr E.
                    Halley shows that the irregularity observed in the variations of the compass at
                    sea is not due to the attraction of the land, and comes to the conclusion that
                    the whole globe of the earth is one great magnet, having four magnetical poles
                    or points of direction. The declination for any place is subject to secular
                    variations: thus, at Paris in 1681, it was 2° 30' to the W., in 1865 it was 18°
                    44' W. Halley, in a paper entitled “Account of the Cause of the Change of the
                    Variation of the Magnetical Needle” <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> Oct.
                    19, 1692, pp. 563-578), points out, with other instances of secular variation,
                    that between 1580 and 1692 the direction of the needle at Loudon changed from ll
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> 15' E. to 6° W., or more than 17°, and
                    demonstrates that.the direction is in no place fixed or constant, though in some
                    places it changes faster than in others. Besides the secular, there are annual
                    and diurnal variations of small amount. The existence of the latter was
                    discovered by Mr Graham about 1719. The deviation of the compass is the
                    departure of the north and south line from the magnetic meridian, owing to the
                    magnetism of the ship itself, or that induced in it by the earth’s magnetic
                    force. It was first observed during 1772— 74 by Mr Wales, the astronomer of
                    Captain Cook. When surveying along the coast of New Holland in 1801 and 1802,
                    Captain Matthew Flinders made the discovery that there was a difference in the
                    direction of the magnetic needle, according as his ship’s head pointed to the E.
                    or W. —westerly in the former, easterly in the latter case. When the ship’s head
                    was N. or S. the needle took the same direction, or nearly so, that it would on
                    shore, and showed a variation from the true meridian which was about a medium
                    between that given by it when east and when west. He found, also, that the error
                    in variation was nearly proportionate to the number of points which the ship’s
                    head was from the north or south. <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1805, p.
                    186.) The deviation in wooden shipscan be practically obviated, but in iron
                    ships it has to be partly allowed for, partly compensated. Barlow used a
                    correcting plate of iron to overcome the directive action on the compass due to
                    the magnetism of wooden vessels. On Professor Airy’s method, the permanent
                    magnetism of ships is compensated by a steel magnet placed at a given distance
                    below the compass; it is, however, liable to changes of intensity, occasioned by
                    shocks, vibration, unequal heating, and other causes, a fact which led the late
                    Dr Scoresby to propose the employment of a compass aloft, out of the region of
                    the ship’s influence. The induced magnetism of ships can be only imperfectly
                    compensated, since it varies according to the ship’s bearing, and as she rolls
                    and pitches; but corrections can be made for the heeling error. The discovery of
                    the dip of the magnetic needle is ascribed by Gilbert to Robert Norman, a
                    nautical instrument maker at Wapping, who, about 1590, introduced the employment
                    of a sliding weight on the needle for the correction of the dip at different
                    points of the earth’s surface.</p>
                <p>The earliest references to the use of the compass are to be found in Chinese
                    history, from which we learn how, in the sixty-fourth year of the reign of
                    Ho-ang-ti (2634 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> the emperor Hiuan-yuan, or
                    Ho-ang-ti, attacked one Tchi-yeou, on the plains of Tchou-lou, and finding his
                    army embarrassed by a thick fog raised by the enemy, constructed a chariot
                    (Tchi-nan) for indicating the south, so as to distinguish the four cardinal
                    points, and was thus enabled to pursue Tchi-yeou, and take him prisoner.

                    iron is said to be for the first time explicitly mentioned in a Chinese
                    dictionary, finished in 121 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> where the loadstone
                    is defined as “a stone with which an attraction can be given to the needle.” The
                    first mention of the use of the compass for the purpose of navigation—an art
                    that has apparently retrograded rather than advanced among the Chinese—occurs in
                    the Chinese encyclopaedia, <hi rend="italic">Ρoei-wen-yun-fou,</hi> in which it
                    is stated that under the Tsin dynasty, or between 265 and 419 A.D., “there were
                    ships directed to the south by the needle.” The Chinese, Mr Davis informs us,
                    once navigated as far as India, but their most distant voyages at present extend
                    not further than Java and the Malay Islands to the south <hi rend="italic">(The

                    traded in ships to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea in the 9th century. Staunton, in

                    referring to the early acquaintance of the Chinese with the property of the
                    magnet to point southwards, remarks (p. 445), “The nature and the cause of the
                    qualities of the magnet have at all times been subjects of contemplation among
                    the Chinese. The Chinese name for the compass is <hi rend="italic"
                    >ting-nan-ching,</hi> or needle pointing to the south; and a distinguishing mark
                    is fixed on the magnet’s southern pole, as in European compasses upon the
                    northern one.” “The sphere of Chinese navigation,” he tells us (p. 447), “is too
                    limited to have afforded experience and observation for forming any system of
                    laws supposed to govern the variation of the needle. . . . The Chinese had soon
                    occasion to perceive how much more essential the perfection of the compass was
                    to the superior navigators of Europe than to themselves, as the commanders of
                    the ‘Lion’ and ‘H indostan,’ trusting to that instrument, stood out directly
                    from the land into the sea. The number of points of the compass, according to
                    the Chinese, is twenty-four, which are reckoned from the south pole; the form
                    also of the instrument they employ is different from that familiar to Europeans.
                    The needle is peculiarly poised, with its point of suspension a little below its
                    centre of gravity, and is exceedingly sensitive; it is seldom more than an inch
                    in length, and is less than a line in thickness. It appears thus sufficiently
                    evident that the Chinese are not indebted to Western nations fortheir knowledge
                    of the use of the compass. “It may be urged," writes Mr T. S. Davies, “that the
                    different manner of constructing the needle amongst the Chinese and European
                    navigators shows the independence of the Chinese of us, as theirs is the <hi
                    rend="italic">worse</hi> method, and had they copied from us, they would have
                    used the better one ’’ (Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">British Annual,</hi> 1837,
                    p. 291). On the other hand, it does not seem improbable that a knowledge of the
                    mariner’s compass was communicated by them directly or indirectly to the early
                    Arabs, and through the latter was introduced into Europe. Sismondi has remarked
                    <hi rend="italic">(Literature of Europe,</hi> vol i. ) that it is peculiarly
                    characteristic of all the pretended discoveries of the Middle Ages that when the
                    historians mention them for the first time they treat them as things in general
                    use. Gunpowder, the compass, the Arabic numerals, and paper, are nowhere spoken
                    of as discoveries, and yet they must have wrought a total change in war, in
                    navigation, in science, and in education. Tiraboschi <hi rend="italic"

                    Arabs, adduces their superiority in scientific learning, and their early skill
                    in navigation. He quotes a passage on the polarity of the loadstone from a
                    treatise translated by Albertus Magnus, attributed by the latter to Aristotle,
                    but apparently only an Arabic compilation from the works of various
                    philosophers. As the terms <hi rend="italic">Zoron</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aphron,</hi> used there to signify the south and north poles, are neither Latin
                    nor Greek, Tiraboschi suggests that they may be of Arabian origin, and that the
                    whole passage concerning the loadstone may have been added to the original
                    treatise by the Arabian translators.</p>

                    Robertson quotes Sir J. Chardin as boldly asserting “that the Asiatics are
                    beholden to us for this wonderful instrument, which they had from Europe a long
                    time before the Portuguese conquests. For, first, their compasses are exactly
                    like ours, and they buy them of Europeans as much as they can, scarce daring to
                    meddle with their needles themselves. Secondly, it is certain that the old
                    navigators only coasted it along, which I impute to their want of this
                    instrument to guide and instruct them in the middle of the ocean I have nothing

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0254-0227"/> touching this matter, having never met with any
                    person in Persia or the Indies to inform me when the compass was first known
                    among them, though I made inquiry of the most learned men in both countries. I
                    have sailed from the Indies to Persia in Indian ships, when no European has been
                    aboard but myself. The pilots were all Indians, and they used the forestaff and
                    quadrant for their observations. These instruments they have from us, and made
                    by our artists, and they do not in the least vary from ours, except that the
                    characters are Arabic. The Arabs are the most skilful navigators of all the
                    Asiatics or Africans; but neither they nor the Indians make use of charts, and
                    they do not much want them; some they have, but they are copied from ours, for
                    they are altogether ignorant of perspective." The observations of Chardin, who
                    flourished between 1643 and 1713, cannot be said to receive support from the
                    testimony of some earlier authorities. That the Arabs must have been acquainted
                    with the compass, and with the construction and use of charts, at a period
                    nearly two centuries previous to Chardin's first voyage to the East, may be
                    gathered from the description given by Barros of a map of all the coast of
                    India, shown to Vasco da Gama by a Moor of Guzerat (about the 15th July 1498),
                    in which the bearings were laid down “after the manner of the Moors,’ or “with
                    meridians and parallels very small (or close together), without other bearings
                    of the compass; because, as the squares of these meridians and parallels were
                    very small, the coast was laid down by these two bearings of N. and S., and E.
                    and W., with great certainty, without that multiplication of bearings of the
                    points of the compass usual in our maps, winch serves as the root of the
                    others/’ Further, we learn from Osorio that the Arabs at the time of Gama “were
                    instructed in so many of the arts of navigation, that they did not yield much to
                    the Portuguese mariners in the science and practice of maritime matters.' (See

                    navigated the Red Sea at the same period are shown by Varthema to have used the

                <p>Again, it appears that compasses of a primitive description, which can hardly be
                    supposed to have been brought from Europe, were employed in the East Indies
                    certainly as early as several years previous to the close of the 16th century In

                    we read:—“Some fewe yeeres since, it so fell out that I had severall conferences
                    with two East Indians which were brought into England by master Candish [Thomas
                    Cavendish], and had learned our language: The one of them was of Mamil∏a
                    [Manilla] in the Isle of Luzon, the other of Miaco in Japan. I questioned with
                    them concerning their shipping and manner of sayling. They described all things
                    farre different from ours, and shewed, that in steade of our Compas, they use a
                    ιnag-neticall needle of sixe ynches long, and longer, upon a pinne in a dish of

                    his <hi rend="italic">Merchant's Treasure,</hi> a work given to the world in
                    1282, that the magnetized needle, floated on water by means of a splinter of
                    wood or a reed, was employed on the Syrian seas at the time of his voyage from
                    Tripoli to Alexandria (1242), and adds :—“They say that the captains who
                    navigate the Indian seas use, instead of the needle and splinter, a sort of fish
                    made out of hollow iron, which, when thrown into the water, swims upon the
                    surface, and points out the north and south with its head and tail” (Klaproth,
                    <hi rend="italic">Lettre,</hi> p. 57). Furthermore, although the sailors in the
                    Indian vessels in which Niccola de’Conti traversed the Indian seas in 1420 are
                    stated to have had no compass, still, on board the ship in which Varthema, less
                    than a century later, sailed from Borneo to Java, both the mariner’s chart and
                    compass were used; it has been questioned, however, whether in this case the
                    compass was of Eastern manufacture <hi rend="italic">{Travels of Varthema,</hi>
                    Introd, xciv., andp. 249). We have already seen that the Chinese as iate as the
                    end of the 18th century made voyages with compasses on which but little reliance
                    could be placed; and it may perhaps be assumed that the compasses early used in
                    the East were mostly too imp,erfect to be of much assistance to navigators, and
                    were therefore often dispensed with on customary routes. The simple
                    water-compass is said to have been used by the Coreans •so late as the middle of
                    the 18th century; and Dr T. Smith, writing in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1683-4, says of the Turks (p. 439), “They
                    have no genius for Sea-voyages, and consequently are very raw and unexperienced
                    in the art of Navigation, scarce venturing to sail out of sight of land. I speak
                    of the natural <hi rend="italic">Turks,</hi> who trade either into the <hi

                <p>points, the four Cardinal and the four Collateral.” That the value of the compass
                    was thus, even in the latter part of the 17th century, so imperfectly recognized
                    in the East may serve to explain how in earlier times that instrument, long
                    after the first discovery of its properties, may have been generally neglected
                    by navigators.</p>
                <p>The Saracen geographer, Edrîsi, who lived about 1100, is said by Boucher to give
                    an account, though in a confused manner, of the polarity of the magnet (Hallam,
                    <hi rend="italic">Mid. Ages,</hi> vol. iii. chap. 9, part 2); but the earliest
                    definite mention as yet known of the use of the mariner’s compass in the Middle
                    Ages occurs in a treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Utensilibus,</hi> written by Alexander Neckam in the 12th century. He speaks
                    there of a needle carried on board ship which, being placed on a pivot, and
                    allowed to take its own position of repose, shows mariners their course when the
                    polar star is hidden. In another work, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Naturis</hi><hi rend="italic">Herum,</hi> lib. ii. c. 89, he
                    writes,— “Mariners at sea, when, through cloudy weather in the day which hides
                    the sun, or through the darkness of the night, they lose the knowledge of the
                    quarter of the world to which they are sailing, touch a needle with the magnet,
                    which will turn round till, on its motion ceasing, its point will be directed

                    15, 1876). The magnetical needle, and its suspension on a stick or straw in

                    observed at that date. From Torfaeus we learn that the compass, fitted into a
                    box, was already in use among the Norwegians about the middle of the 13th
                    century <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Per. Norvegicarum,</hi> iv. c. 4, p. 345,

                    in Scotland at or shortly subsequent to that time, though King Robert, in
                    crossing from Arran to Carrick in 1306, as Barbour writing in 1375 informs us,

                <p>From the above it will have been evident that, as Barlowe remarks concerning the

                <p>The improvement of the compass has been but a slow process. <hi rend="italic">The

                <p>From this it would seem that the compasses used at that time by English mariners
                    were of a very primitive description. Barlowe, in his treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >Magnetical Advertisements,</hi> printed in 1616 (p. 66), complains that “the
                    Compasse needle, being the most admirable and usefull instrument of the whole
                    world, is both amongst ours and other nations for the most part, so bungerly and
                    absurdly contrived, as nothing more.” The form he recommends for the needle is
                    that of “a true circle, having his Axis going out beyond the circle, at each end
                    narrow and narrower, unto a reasonable sharpe point, and being pure steele as
                    the circle it seife is, having in the middest a convenient receptacle to place
                    the capitell in.” In 1750 Dr Gowan Knight found that the needles of
                    merchant-ships were made of two pieces of steel bent in the middle and united in
                    the shape ot a rhombus, and proposed to substitute straight steel bars of small
                    breadth, suspended edgewise, and hardened throughout. He also showed that the
                    Chinese mode of suspending the needle conduces most to sensibility. In 1820
                    Prof. Barlow reported to the Admiralty that half the compasses in the Royal Navy
                    were mere lumber, and ought to be destroyed. Since then many improved varieties
                    of ships’ compasses have been introduced, of which may be mentioned, those of
                    Pope, Preston, Walker, Dent, Stebbing, Gowland, Gray, Duchemin, and Harris. In
                    the last the needle turns upon a point which is the centre of a doubly-curved
                    bar of copper, fixed as a diameter to a ring of the same metal. In the Admiralty
                    compass the bowl is of copper, the card of mica; and compound magnetic bars, as
                    proposed by Scoresby, are employed.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable and, as shown by trial, most satisfactory form of the
                    compassis that patented in 1876 by Sir William Thomson (see fig. 2). The card
                    consists of a central boss and an outer rim, both of aluminium, connected
                    together by fine silk cords. Eight or twelve small magnets, 2 to 3 inches long,
                    having their corresponding ends tied together by threads of equal lengths, are
                    suspended by silk cords from the rim, to which is attached thin paper marked
                    with the points of the compass and degrees. The Concentration, in this wise, of
                    the greater part of the weight in the rim gives a long period of free
                    oscillation, and consequently great steadiness; and as the card of a 10-ineh
                    compass, with its suspended needle and sapphire, weighs only 178 grains, the
                    frictional error is very slight. Owing to the smallness of the needles, a
                    perfect correction for all latitudes of a quadrantal error of 5 or 6 degrees for
                    a 10-inch, and of 11 or 12 degrees for a 7-inch compass can be effected by means
                    of a couple of iron globes not more than 6 inches in diameter, fixed on opposite
                    sides of the binnacle. The thwart-ship and the fore-and-aft components of the
                    ship’s magnetic force are neutralized by two adjustable correctors placed one
                    over the other, and so arranged that in their zero position the middle line of
                    both is vertically under the centre of the compass. Each corrector consists of
                    two bar magnets movable round a common horizontal axis perpendicular to their
                    lengths. To correct the heeling error, an adjustable magnet is applied below the
                    compass in a line through its centre perpendicular to the deck. For taking
                    bearings, a new instrument, the azimuth mirror, is provided, whereby the image
                    of the object reflected from a plane mirror is thrown, as in a camera lucida, on
                    the graduated circle of the compass card, and is seen through a convex lens.
                    Another improvement is the use of knife edges instead of journals for supporting
                    the gimbals. A hemispherical space below the compass-case, nearly filled with
                    castor-oil, serves to calm the vibrations of the bowl.</p>
