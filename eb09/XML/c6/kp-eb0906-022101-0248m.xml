                    suggested derivation of the word company (from <hi rend="italic">cum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">panis)</hi> may be compared with the original meaning of <hi
                    rend="italic">gild.</hi> A gild was a feast, and the first associations named
                    gilds, like the first associations named companies, had for their object the
                    furtherance of a common entertainment. Corporation, unlike the other words of
                    similar meaning, has in law a very definite signification. It applies only to an
                    association which has been endowed with a fictitious personality, enabling it to
                    sue and be sued, to acquire rights and incur obligations, without the individual
                    members thereof being implicated. Company, on the other hand, may be used
                    generally to describe almost any kind of association. In practice, however, it
                    is confined to two classes of associations. The first are those joint-stock
                    companies whose vast proportions and wide ramifications are among the most
                    striking features of modern industrial life. The other are the livery or city
                    companies, which still retain the name and the constitution, while they have
                    long abandoned the objects of the gilds of the Middle Ages. See <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Joint Stock Companies.—</hi> Commercial companies are a
                    comparatively modern creation in English law. The com mon law appears to have
                    recognized no privileged associations except those which were incorporated by
                    charter, or statute, or prescription. All other associations, no matter what
                    their numbers or purpose, were mere assemblages of individuals. A trading
                    association was at the best only a partnership, and between large partnerships
                    and small partnerships there was no legal difference whatever. Each of the
                    members was responsible for all the debts of the association, and all the
                    members had to unite in instituting or defending any process of law. The
                    inconvenience of such disabilities must have increased with the growth of trade.
                    On the other hand, if the society applied to the Crown for a charter, and
                    succeeded, it became a corporation, and the members were rendered irresponsible
                    for its debts. What was wanted for trade was a society which might sue and be
                    sued like a corporation, while its members remained personally liable for its
                    debts. Joint-stock companies were regarded at first with great disfavour by the
                    Legislature. In 1719 was passed the Bubble Act (6 Geo. I. c. 18). The first part
                    of the Act, reciting the utility of the practice of assuring ships and lending
                    money on bottomry, empowers the king to create by charter two corporations to
                    deal in such ventures; and all assuring of ships, or lending of money on
                    bottomry by any other corporation, partnership, or society, is made illegal.
                    Private persons, acting for themselves, may still continue to underwrite
                    policies and lend money. The Act then recites the growth of dangerous and
                    mischievous undertakings and projects, wherein the undertakers and subscribers
                    have presumed to act as if they were corporate bodies, and have pretended to
                    make their shares transferable, and enacts that “all and every the undertakings
                    and attempts described as aforesaid, and all other public undertakings and
                    attempts tending to the common grievance, prejudice, and inconvenience of bis
                    Majesty’s subjects, or great numbers of them, in their trade, commerce, or other
                    lawful affairs; and all public subscriptions, receipts, payments, assignments,
                    transfers, pretended assignments and transfers; and all other matters and things
                    whatsoever, for furthering, countenancing, or proceeding in any*such undertaking
                    or attempt; and more particularly, the acting or presuming to act as a corporate
                    body or bodies, the raising or pretending to raise transferable stock or stocks,
                    the transferring or pretending to transfer or assign any share or shares in such
                    stock or stocks, without legal authority, either by Act of Parliament or by any
                    charter from the Crown, to warrant such acting as a body corporate, or to raise
                    such transferable stock or stocks, or to transfer shares therein; and all
                    acting, or pretending to act, under any charter formerly granted from the Crown
                    for particular or special purposes therein expressed, by persons who do or shall
                    use, or endeavour to use, the same charters for raising a capital stock, or for
                    making transfers or assignments, or pretended transfers or assignments, of such
                    stock, not intended or designed by such charter to be raised or transferred; and
                    all acting or pretending to act under any obsolete charter, become void by
                    non-user or abuser, or for want of making lawful elections which were necessary
                    to continue the corporations thereby intended, shall (as to all or any such
                    acts, matters, and things, as shall be acted, done, attempted, endeavoured, or
                    proceeded upon after the said 24th day of June 1720) for ever be deemed to be
                    illegal or void, and shall not be practised or in wise put in execution.” And
                    all such undertakings are to be deemed public nuisances. Although wholly
                    powerless to prevent the growth of joint-stock companies, the Bubble Act was not
                    repealed till 1825. The Bubble Act is supposed to have been passed in the
                    interest of the famous South Sea Company. By 9 Anne c. 21 the Crown was
                    empowered to incorporate the persons interested in the public debt, with certain
                    privileges of trade on the South Seas. By 6 Geo. I. c. 4 the company thus
                    created was authorized to increase its stock. The supposed advantages of the
                    company turned out to be a delusion. In the meantime numberless other
                    speculations of a similar character were started, and in many cases pretended to
                    act under charters which were either obsolete or insufficient for the purpose.
                    The South Sea Company prosecuted these adventurers under the Bubble Act, but
                    while it succeeded in exposing their real character it also helped thereby to
                    weaken public confidence in its own. For a period of nearly ninety years the
                    Bubble Act remained inoperative, but at the end of that period several cases
                    under it were brought into court (Collyer <hi rend="italic">On
                    Partnership).</hi> At the same time, by 6 Geo. IV. c. 91 the Crown was enabled
                    to grant charters of incorporation under which members might be made responsible
                    for the corporation’s debts. In 1834 the Crown was empowered to grant to
                    companies<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n249/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0249-0222"/> by letters patent, without incorporation, the
                    privilege of suing and being sued by a public officer. When a charter could not
                    be obtained, companies might be incorporated, or empowered to plead by public
                    officers, under special Acts of Parliament. For such corporate or
                    quasi-corporate privileges application had to be made either to the Crown or
                    Parliament. In 1826 banking companies were allowed to obtain the privilege of
                    suing by public officer on complying with certain rules. In 1844, all companies
                    (with some exceptions) were enabled to obtain a certificate of incorporation
                    without applying for a charter or a special Act. Banking companies, however,
                    were required to apply to the Crown for a charter. Members of companies thus
                    created were still responsible, to the whole extent of their fortune, for the
                    debts of the companies. In 1855 limited liability was introduced by 18 and 19
                    Vict. c. 133, shareholders being made responsible to the extent only of the
                    amount of their shares. Companies with this privilege must use the word
                    “limited” after their names. The dissolution and winding-up of insolvent
                    companies remained to be simplified, and from 1846 to 1850 various measures were
                    introduced, enabling different classes of companies to be wound up, without the
                    usual process by bill to which the shareholders, as partners, necessarily had to
                    appear. The legislative history of companies, thus briefly traced, exhibits
                    their development out of simple partnerships in a not uninstructive manner.
                    Partnerships in the eye of the law, they are looked upon by the Legislature as
                    false pretenders to the character of corporations; they areat first denounced as
                    nuisances, then tolerated, and gradually relieved one by one from those legal
                    incidents of partnership which impede their functions in the organization of
                    commerce. In 1862 a consolidation of the numerous Acts relating to companies was
                    effected by the Act for the incorporation, regulation, and winding-up of trading
                    companies and other associations, which ξave to the Court of Chancery exclusive
                    jurisdiction in winding-up. The following are a few of the chief provisions of
                    this important Act. It prohibits the formation of any company, association, or
                    partnership, of more than ten persons for the business of banking, and of more
                    than twenty persons for any business having for its object the acquisition of
                    gain, unless it is registered under this Act. Companies, formed by Act of
                    Parliament or letters patent, or engaged in mining within the jurisdiction of
                    the stannaries, are exceptions. Or, as it may be otherwise stated, all
                    associations for the acquisition of gain, other than those last mentioned, and
                    excluding banking partnerships of fewer than ten, or other trading societies of
                    fewer than twenty members, will be illegal unless registered under this Act. Any
                    seven or more persons, joining together for the pursuit of any lawful object,
                    may form an incorporated company by subscribing a memorandum of association and
                    registering. The liability of members may be unlimited, or it may be limited to
                    the amount unpaid of the nominal value of their shares, or to sums guaranteed.
                    The memorandum of association must contain particulars as to the name, object,
                    &amp;c., of the proposed company; and companies limited by share or guarantee
                    must use the word “limited” after their names. Companies limited by shares may,
                    and other companies, whether limited by guarantee or unlimited, must also send
                    articles of association, containing regulations for the management of the
                    company. The Act contains in a schedule a table of regulations which may be
                    adopted in such companies, and in the case of companies limited by shares will
                    be held to apply, unless expressly modified or excluded by the articles. The
                    memorandum and articles of association are sent to the registrar, who issues a
                    certificate of incorporation, and the subscribers and persons joining them
                    thereupon become a corporate body with perpetual succession, and a common seal,
                    and power to hold lands, but with liability on the part of members to contribute
                    to the assets of the company in the manner prescribed by the Act. Companies, not
                    intended for the pursuit of gain, may not hold more than 2 acres of land without
                    a licence from the Board of Trade. Part II. deals with the distribution of
                    capital and liabilities of members of companies and associations under this Act.
                    When a company is w ound up, every present and past member shall be liable to
                    contribute to the assets of the company, with the following (among other)
                    qualifications :—No past member shall be liable, if he has ceased to be a member
                    for a year before the w inding-up, nor shall he be liable for any debt
                    contracted by the company after he has ceased to be a member, nor unless present
                    members are unable to satisfy the contributions required. Part III. contains
                    provisions for the protection of creditors and oí members. Part IV, treats of
                    the winding-up of companies, which may be either by the court or voluntary. A
                    company may be w ound up by the court (i.e., the Court of Chancery m England and
                    Ireland, and Court of Session in Scotland) in the following cases, viz., when a
                    special resolution of the company has been passed requiring it; when the company
                    does not begin business within a year from its incorporation, or suspends
                    business for a year; when the members are reduced to less than seven; when it is
                    unable to pay its debts; and when the court thinks it ought to be wound up.
                    Where a voluntary winding-up has been begun, the court may order it to be
                    continued, subject to the supervision of the court. Part V, constitutes a
                    registration office. Part VI. applies the Act to companies registered under the
                    various Joint-Stock Companies Acts. Part VII. defines the companies “authorized
                    to register under this Act.” Part VIII. applies the Act to unregistered
                    companies. Part IX. contains a repealing clause and some temporary provisions.
                    After five years’ experience of the original Act an amending Act was published
                    in 1867, and the two are to be construed together. The Companies Act 1867
                    contains provisions facilitating changes in the constitution of companies. A
                    limited company may have directors with unlimited liability. A company limited
                    by shares may under certain conditions reduce its capital, or divide its capital
                    or part thereof into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by the memorandum of
                    association. Associations not intended for gain may have the privileges of
                    limited liability without being compelled to use the word “limited” after their
                    names. A company may have some shares fully paid and others not. A limited
                    company may issue warrants for shares fully paid up, in name of bearer. There
                    are several sections dealing with contracts made on behalf of a company, and one
                    important section, the 38th, enacts that any prospectus not specifying such
                    contracts shall be deemed fraudulent on the part of the promoters, Ac., issuing
                    the same, as regards any person taking shares in the company on the faith of
                    such prospectus. This section was drawm to meet the practice of concealing from
                    investors contracts which w ould be binding on the intended company when formed,
                    and its somewhat ambiguous phraseology has been the subject of much discussion
                    in the law courts See, for example, <hi rend="italic">in re</hi> Coal

                <p>The objects of certain trading companies, as, for example, railways, involve an
                    interierence with the rights of private persons, which requires the direct
                    authority of the Legislature. Such undertakings are therefore authorized by
                    special Acts of Parliament, which begin as private bills before one or other of
                    the two Houses, and pass through both, and receive the assent of the sovereign
                    in the same manner as public bills (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bill).</hi> The

                    bills has tended to assimilate itself more and more to an ordinary litigation.
                    The committees are tribunals acknowledging certain rules of policy, and hearing
                    evidence from witnesses and arguments from professional advocates. An important
                    point in the history of this kind of legislation is marked by the three
                    Consolidation Acts of 1845 (8 and 9 Vict.) The Companies Clauses Consolidation
                    Act consolidates sundry provisions relating to the constitution and management
                    of joint-stock companies, usually introduced into Acts of Parliament authorizing
                    the execution of undertakings of a public nature by such companies. The Lands
                    Clauses Consolidation Act applies to undertakings authorized by special Act to
                    take or purchase land. The Railways Clauses Consolidation Act applies to Acts
                    authorizing the construction of railways. The clauses of the Consolidation Acts
                    are to be taken as incorporated in a special Act of the class in question,
                    unless they are expressly varied or excepted thereby. A further development of
                    the same tendency may be observed in proposals which have been made from time to
                    time to hand over the authority of Parliament, in relation to such companies, to
                    a permanent tribunal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Livery Companies.—</hi> These societies, now chiefly remarkable
                    as a feature in the municipal organization of London, belong to a class of
                    institutions which at one time were universally prevalent in Europe. In most
                    other countries they have disappeared; in England, while their functions have
                    wholly changed, the organization remains. The origin of the city companies is to
                    be found in the craftgilds of the Middle Ages. The absence of a strong central
                    authority, such as we are now accustomed to, doubtless accounts for thetendency
                    to confederation in thebeginning of modern societies. Artificial groups, formed
                    in imitation of the family, discharged the duties which the family was no IongoΓ
                    able, and which the state was not yet able, to undertake. The inhabitants of
                    towns were forced by external pressure into the societies known as
                    gild-merchants, which in course of time monopolized the municipal government,
                    became exclusive, and so caused the growth of similar societies among their
                    excluded citizens. The craftgilds were such societies, composed of
                    handicraftsmen, which entered upon a severe struggle for power with the earlier
                    gilds and finally defeated them. The circumstances and results of the struggle
                    are stated to have been of much the same character in England and on the
                    Continent. In London the victory of the crafts is decisively marked by the
                    ordinance of the time of Edward II., which required every citizen to be a member
                    of some trade or mystery, and by another ordinance in the 49th of Edw. III.,
                    which transferred the right of election of corporate officers (including members
                    of Parliament) from the ward-representatives to the trading companies.
                    Henceforward, and for many years, the companies engrossed political and
                    municipal power in the city of London.</p>
                <p>The trading fraternities assumed generally the character of corporations in the
                    reign of Edward III. Many of them had been chartered before, but their
                    privileges, hitherto exercised only on sufferance and by payment of their terms,
                    were now confirmed by letters patent. Edward III. himself became a member of the
                    fraternity of Linen Armourers, or Merchant Taylors, and other distinguished
                    persons followed his example. From this time forward they are called livery
                    companies, “from now generally assuming a distinctive dress or. livery.” The
                    origin of the Grocers’ Company is thus described :—“Twenty-two persons, carrying
                    on the business of pepperers in Soper’s Lane, Cheapside, agree to meet together,
                    to a dinner, at the Abbot of Bury’s, St Mary Axe, and commit the particulars of
                    their formation into a trading society to writing. They elect after dinner two
                    persons of the company so assembled</p>
                <p>Rogçr Osekyn and Lawrence de Hallwell—as their first governors or wardens,
                    appointing, at the ^ame time, in conformity with the pious custom of the age, a
                    priest or chaplain to celebrate divine offices for their souls” (Heath’s
                    “Account of the Grocers’ Company,” quoted in Herbert’s <hi rend="italic">Twelve
                    Great Livery Companies,</hi> vol. i. p. 43). The religious observances and the
                    common feasts were characteristic features of those institutions. They were
                    therefore not merely trade unions in the current meaning of that phrase, but may
                    rather be described as forms of industrial self-government, the basis of union
                    being the membership of a common trade, and the authority of the society
                    extending to the general welfare, spiritual and temporal, of its members. It
                    must be remembered that they flourished at a time when the separate interests of
                    master and servant had not yet been created; and indeed, when that fundamental
                    division of interests arose, the companies gradually lost their functions in the
                    regulation of industry. The fact that the craftsmen were a homogeneous order
                    will account for the wide authority claimed by their societies, and the
                    important public powerr which were conceded to them. Their regulations, says
                    Herbert, “chiefly regarded the qualifications of members, keeping of their trade
                    secrets, the regulations of apprenticeship and of the company’s peculiar
                    concerns, the domestic management of the fraternity and its funds, and the
                    uniting together of it in brotherly love and affection. To these may be added,
                    as forming a prominent feature in all the ancient communities, the regulation of
                    their religious and other ceremonies.” In the regulation of trade they possessed
                    extensive powers. They required every one carrying on the trade to join the
                    company. In the 37th of Edward III., in answer to a remonstrance against the
                    mischief caused by “the merchants called grocers who engrossed all manner of
                    merchandize vendable, and who suddenly raised the prices of such merchandize
                    within the realm,” it was enacted “that all artificers and people of mysteries
                    shall each choose his own mystery before next Candlemas, and that, having so
                    chosen it, he shall henceforth use no other.” Dr Brentano <hi rend="italic">(On
                    Gilds)</hi> holds that it is wrong to represent such regulations as
                    monopolistic, inasmuch as there was no question whatever of a monopoly in that
                    time nor until the degeneration of the craftgilds into limited corporations of
                    capitalists. In the regulation of trade the right of search was an important
                    instrument. The wardens of the grocers are to “assay en weights, powders,
                    confeccions, platers, oyntments, and all other things belonging to the same
                    crafte.” The goldsmiths had the assay of metals, the fishmongers the oversight
                    of fish, the vintners of the tasting of wine, &lt;fcc. The companies enforced
                    their regulations on their members by force. Many of their ordinances looked to
                    the domestic affairs and private conduct of the members. The grocers ordain
                    “that no man of the fraternité take his neyghbor’s house y <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> is of the same fraternité, or enhaunce the rent
                    against the will of the foresaid neyghbor.” Perjury is to be punished by the
                    wardens and society with such correction as that other men of the fellowship may
                    be warned thereby. Members reduced to poverty by adventures on the sea,
                    increased price of goods, borrowing and pledging, or any other misfortune, are
                    to be assisted “out of the common money, according to his situation, if he could
                    not do without.”</p>
                <p>Following what appears to be the natural law of their being, the companies
                    gradually lost their industrial character. The course of decay would seem to
                    have been the following. The capitalists gradually assumed the lead in the
                    various societies, and the richer members engrossed the power, and the companies
                    tended to become hereditary and exclusive. Persons might be members who bad
                    nothing to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0251-0224"/> do with the craft, and the rise of great
                    capitalists and the development of competition in trade made the regulation of
                    industry by means of companies no longer possible. For an account of the
                    “degeneration of craftgilds” a general reference may be made to Brentano <hi
                    rend="italic">On Gilds,</hi> c. iv. The usurpation of power on the part of the
                    richer members was not always effected without opposition. Brentano refers to a
                    pamphlet on the Clothworkers’ Company, published in 1649, which asserts that
                    “the commonalty” in the old charters meant, not the whole gild, but only the
                    masters, wardens, and assistants. Herbert records a most interesting dispute in
                    the Goldsmiths’ Company in 1529. The mode of electing officers, and the system
                    of management generally, was challenged by three members who called themselves
                    “artificers, poor men of the craft of goldsmiths.” The company, or rather the
                    wardens, the assistants, and livery, presented a petition to the lord mayor,
                    which was answered by the discontented craftsmen. The dispute was carried into
                    the Court of Chancery and the Star Chamber. The artificers accused the company
                    of subverting their grants, misappropriating the funds, and changing the
                    constitution of the society, and they complain of this being done by the
                    usurpation of persons who “were but merchant goldsmiths, aud had but little
                    knowledge in the science.” In 1531 the three complainants were summarily
                    expelled from the company, and then the dispute seems to have ended. In the last
                    stage of the companies the members have ceased to have any connection with the
                    trades, and in most casestheir regulative functionshave disappeared. The one
                    characteristic which has clung to them throughout is that of owners of property
                    and managers of charitable trusts. The connection between the companies and the
                    municipality is shortly as follows. The ordinance of Edward II. required freemen
                    of the city to be members of one or other of the companies. By the ordinance of
                    49 Edw. III. the trading companies were to nominate the members of common
                    council, and the persons so nominated alone were to attend both at common
                    councils and at elections. An ordinance in 7 Richard II. restored the elections
                    of common councilmen to the wards, but corporate officers and representatives in
                    Parliament were elected by a convention summoned by the lord mayor from the
                    nominees of the companies. An Act of Common Council in 7 Edw. IV. appointed the
                    election of mayor, sheriffs, &amp;c., to be in the common council, together with
                    the masters and wardens of the companies. By 15 Edw. IV. masters and wardens
                    were ordered to associate with themselves the honest men of their mysteries, and
                    come in their best liveries to the elections; that is to say, the franchise was
                    restricted to the “liverymen” of the companies. At this time the corporation
                    exercised supreme control over the companies, and the companies were still
                    genuine associations of the traders and householders of the city. The delegation
                    of the franchise to the liverymen was thus, in point of fact, the selection of a
                    superior dass of householders to represent the rest. When the corporation lost
                    its control over the companies, and the members of the companies ceased to be
                    traders and householders, the liverymen were no longer a representative class,
                    and some change in the system became necessary. The Act 11 Geo. II. c. 18, and
                    the Reform Acts of 1832 and 1867, reformed the representation in several
                    particulars. The liverymen of the companies, being freemen of the city, have
                    still, however, the exclusive power of electing the lord mayor, sheriffs,
                    chamberlain, and other corporate officers.</p>
                <p>The contributions made by the companies to the public purposes of the state and
                    the city are interesting points in their early history. Their wealth and their
                    representative character made them a most appropriate instrument for the
                    enforcement of irregular taxation. The loan of £21,263, 6s. 8d. to Henry VIII.
                    for his wars in Scotland, in 1544, is believed by Herbert to be the first
                    instance of a pecuniary grant to the Crow n, but the practice rapidly gained
                    ground. The confiscation of ecclesiastical property at the time of the
                    Reformation affected many of the trusts of the companies; and they were
                    compelled to make returns of their property devoted to religious uses, and to
                    pay over the rents to the Crown. In course of time the taxation of the companies
                    became “a regular source of supply to Government.” The historians of the city
                    have for the most part described these as unjust and tyrannical exactions, but,
                    looking at the representative and municipal character of the companies and the
                    purposes to which their contributions were applied, we may regard them as a
                    rough but not unfair mode of taxation. The Government, when money was wanted for
                    public works, informed the lord mayor, who apportioned the sums required among
                    the various societies, and issued precepts for its payment. Contributions
                    towards setting the poor to work, erecting the Royal Exchange, cleansing the
                    city ditch, discovering new countries, furnishing military and naval armaments,
                    for men, arms, and ammuniton for the defence of the city, are among what Herbert
                    calls the sponging expedients of the Government. The Crown occasionally
                    interfered in a more unjustifiable manner with the companies in the exercise of
                    their patronage. The Stuarts made strenuous efforts to get the control of the
                    companies. Terrified by the proceedings in the <hi rend="italic">quo
                    warranto</hi> case, most of the companies surrendered their charters to the
                    Crown, but such surrenders were annulled by the Act of 2 William and Mary
                    reversing the judgment in <hi rend="italic">quo warranto</hi> against the city.
                    The livery companies now in existence are the following :—</p>

                <p>The following are the twelve great companies :—Mercers, Grocers, Drapers,
                    Fishmongers, Goldsmiths, Skinners, Merchant Taylors, Haberdashers, Salters,
                    Ironmongers, Vintners, Cloth-workers. The “Irish Society” was incorporatedin the
                    11 James I. as “the governor and assistants of the new plantation in Ulster,
                    within the realm of Ireland.” The twelve companies contributed in equal portions
                    the sum of £60,000 for the new scheme, by which it was intended to settle a
                    Protestant colony in the lands forfeited by the Irish rebels. The companies
                    divided the settlement into twelve nearly equal parts, assigning one to each,
                    but the separate estates are still held to be under the paramount jurisdiction
                    of the Irish Society. The charter of the society was revoked by the Court of
                    Star Chamber in the reign of Charles I., but a new one was granted by Charles
                    II., under which the society still acts.</p>

                <p>Most of the companies administer charities of large but unascertained value. Many
                    of them are governors of important schools, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    Skinners have the Tonbridge Grammar School; the Mercers, St Paul’s School; the
                    Merchant Taylors, the school bearing their name, &amp;c. There is no exact
                    information to be had as to the value of these trusts, or the manner in which
                    they are administered. The <hi rend="italic">History of the Twelve Great Livery
                    Companies,</hi> by W. Herbert (London, 1837), may be referred to on this
                    subject.</p>
                <p>Admission to the companies is now subject to the payment of considerable fees.
                    For example, in the Merchant Taylors the fees are—Upon taking up the freedom, by
                    patrimony or servitude, £1, 3s. 4d., by redemption, £84; on admission to the
                    livery, £80, 8s.; on election to the Court of Assistants, £115, 10s. The
                    hospitality of the companies is well-known. The advantages of being a member,
                    still more of being a liveryman or assistant, of one of the rich companies are
                    doubtless considerable. There are indications that the position of the city
                    companies is likely to be for some time to come the subject of political
                    discussion. It may be briefly said that they are being threatened on two sides—
                    on one side by those who desire to see extensive reforms in the municipal
                    organization of the metropolis; and on the other by those who wish to carry
                    forward the process of inspection and revision of endowments, which has already
                    overtaken the universities, schools, and other charities. <hi rend="smallcaps"
