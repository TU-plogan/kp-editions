                    to the south east, it forms an extensive gulf, named Broughton Bay in honour of
                    a navigator of the 18th century. With this exception it presents no remarkable
                    irregularity of line; but even such superficial surveys as have already been
                    effected show that it affords a considerable number of bays and harbours. Of
                    these the most important are Lazaref, Pingai, and Chosan. The first, called
                    Virginia Bay on the French maps, is situated in 39° 25' N lat, has an area of
                    about 36 square miles, is well protected, and furnishes excellent anchoring
                    ground. Tlιe second in 36° 36' is comparatively small, but completely sheltered
                    by a conical island. The third in 35 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> 2' is large
                    enough to shelter merchant vessels of all sizes and even ships of war below the
                    rank of frigates. Throughout its whole extent this eastern shore presents mainly
                    a succession of steep but not very lofty cliffs, sinking at intervals into
                    irregular dunes, or into stretches of almost level sand. The south and west
                    coasts, on the other hand, are much more varied with inlet and promontory,
                    estuary and peninsula; and the neighbouring sea is occupied by a multitude of
                    islandsand rocks. Of these islands the largest is Quelpart, with a length of 46
                    miles and a breadth of about 20; but of greater importance to the navigator is
                    the Port Hamilton group, on account of the excellent harbour to wſhich it partly
                    owes its name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mountains.—</hi> Corea is eminently a mountainous country, and
                    the general appearance of the surface is compared by a French missionary to that
                    of the sea under a strong gale. The principal range winds through the peninsula
                    from north to south. From the northern frontier, till it reaches 37’ of north
                    latitude, it keeps pretty close to the eastern coast; but from that point it
                    trends westward, and runs obliquely across the southern extremity of the
                    country, leaving the contour of the coast to be defined by a subordinate range.
                    Of individual summits the highest known to Europeans are Hien fung and Tao-kwang
                    in the Pepi Shan Mountains, to the north of Broughton Bay; and these attain no
                    greater elevation than 8114 and 6310 feet respectively. Another of special mark,
                    called Sedlovaya, or the Saddle, by the Russian navigators, is situated in 38°
                    10’ 30" N. lat. The country to the wrest of the main ridge is occupied by
                    irregular spurs; and throughout its whole extent there is no district that can
                    properly be described as a plain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.—</hi> Corea is well furnished with rivers and streams.
                    In the north the boundary line is mainly marked by two of considerable size, the
                    Ya-lu-kiang and the Mi-kiang. The former, known to the Chinese as the Aye-kiang,
                    and to the Coreans as Am-no-kang, or the river of the Green Duck, receives
                    numerous affluents in the early part of its course, flows first north-west and
                    then south-west, and falls into the Y^ellow Sea by three distinct mouths. Its
                    most important tributary, the Tong-kia-ula, comes from the Shan-alin Mountains
                    in Manchuria, and forms its junction about 40’ 50' N. lat. The Mi-kiang, called
                    by the Coreans Tu-man-kang, has a very much shorter course than the Ya-lu-kiang,
                    but owing to the number of its tributaries, it attains no mean proportions
                    before it reaches the eastern sea in 42’ 19’ 5" N. lat. and 130° 38' 51" E.
                    long. At its mouth it is about half a mile wide, and at Hung-chung 300 yards,
                    with a depth of about 20 feet in the middle. Its current is about l¾ knots an
                    hour. Of the numerous streams that find their way to the Sea of Japan nona
                    require special mention till we come to the Nak-tong-kang, which rises in the
                    eastern slopes of the main chain, and after flowing almost directly south,
                    reaches the Strait of Corea in 34° 50' N. lat. Among those of the wrestern coast
                    three at least are of considerable magnitude—the Keum-kang, the Hang-kang, on
                    wſhich Seoul, the capital of the kingdom, is situated, and the Tai-tang-kang,
                    wſhich flows past the city of Pieng-lang.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Agriculture.—</hi> The temperature of Corea, though
                    much more equable than that of the neighbouring continent, is higher in winter
                    and lower in summer than under the same latitudes in Europe. Such advantages as
                    it actually has over the climate of Northern China are mainly due to the effects
                    of the south-west monsoon. In the north the rivers remain frozen for several
                    months in the year, and even in the furthest south the snow lies for a
                    considerable period. In latitude 35° the lowest reading of the thermometer
                    observed by the French missionaries was 5° Fahr.; in 37° or 38° they often found
                    it 13° below zero. The principal articles of cultivation are rice, wſheat,
                    millet, rye, tobacco, cotton, hemp, and ginseng; and of these several afford a
                    good return. The potato, which w as recently introduced, is under a Government
                    interdict, and is only to be found in outlying districts; though its general use
                    might do much to prevent the recurrence of the famines with wſhich the country
                    is ever and anon visited. Almost all the fruits of central Europe are to be
                    obtained; but their quality is greatly deteriorated by the humidity of the
                    climate. Water-melons and the fruit of the <hi rend="italic">Diospyros
                        Lotus</hi> (called kam by the natives) are mentioned as the best.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> Corea has the reputation of being richly
                    furnished w ith mineral resources; gold, silver, copper, iron, and coal are all
                    said to be common. Gold-mining, however, is strictly prohibited; the permission
                    at one time granted to work the silver ore at Sioun-heng-fu was shortly
                    afterwards withdrawn; the copper mines are neglected, and Japanese copper
                    imported; and the general use of coal is confined to certain districts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Animals.—</hi> Of the wild animals the most remarkable are a
                    small species of tiger, the bear, and the w ild boar; and of the domestic kinds
                    the principal are cattle, herses of diminutive proportions but considerable
                    strength, swine, and dogs. The last are a favourite article of food. The king
                    alone has the right of rearing sheep and goats, which are kept for the purpose
                    of being sacrificed in religious ceremonials.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Political Divisions and Towns.—</hi> The kingdom of Corea is
                    divided into eight provinces, of wſhich three, Ham-kieng, Kang-wen, and
                    Kieng-sang lie along the eastern side of the peninsula, while the others,
                    Pieng-an, Hoang-haî, Kieng-kei, Tsiong-tsieng, and Tsien-la face the Yellow Sea.
                    Ham-kieng and Pieng-an are the tw o that border on Manchuria. The former
                    contains fourteen walled towns, among wſhich may be mentioned Ham-heng, the
                    provincial capital, Kieng-wren, and Mou-san; and the latter, with its centre at
                    Pieng-iang, possesses an equal number. The chief town of Kang-wen is λVen-tsiou,
                    situated in the heart of the country to the east of the River Hang-kang; that of
                    Kieng-sang is Tai-kou, near a tributary of the Nak-tong-kang; of Hoangſhai, Hai
                    tsiou on the western coast. Han-iang, Seoul, or Seyool, the chief town of
                    Kieng-kei, is also the capital of the kingdom and the permanent residence of the
                    court; it is situated on the Hang-kang, and surrounded with high and thick
                    walls, 9975 paces in circuit. The chief towns of the two remaining provinces are
                    respectively Kong-tsiou near the River Keum-kang, and Tien-tsiou, at <pb

                    traverses the province.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">king</hi> of Corea, though a vassal of the Chinese empire,
                    is within his own country an absolute monarch, with power of life and death over
                    the noblest in the land. He is the object of almost divine honours; it is
                    sacrilege to utter the name which he receives from his suzerain, and that by
                    which he is known in history is only bestowed upon him after his death by his
                    successor. To touch his person with a weapon of iron is high treason; and so
                    rigidly is this rule enforced that Tieng-tsong-tai-oang suffered an abscess to
                    put an end to his life in 1800, rather than submit to the contact of the lancet.
                    Every horseman must dismount as he passes the palace, and whoever enters the
                    presence-chamber must fall prostrate before the throne. Should the ignoble body
                    of a subject be touched by the royal hands, the honour thus conferred must be
                    ever after commemorated by a badge. In consequence of such punctilious
                    etiquette, personal access to the king is exceedingly difficult; but, as
                    according to theory, his ear ought always to be open to the complaints of his
                    people, an appeal to his authority is nominally permitted. He is ex pected to
                    provide for the poor of his realm, and there are always a large number of
                    pensioners on the royal bounty. The princes of the blood are most jealously
                    excluded from power, and their interference in the slightest degree in a matter
                    of politics is regarded as treason. The nobles, however, have within the present
                    century extended their influence, and infringed on the royal prerogatives. The
                    palaces are poor buildings, but an extensive harem and a large body of eunuchs
                    are maintained.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">government</hi> is practically in the hands of the three
                    principal ministers of the king, who are called respectively <hi rend="italic"
                        >seug-ei-tsieng</hi> or admirable councillor, <hi rend="italic"
                        >tsoa-ei-tsieng</hi> or councillor of the left, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >ou-ei-tsieng</hi> or councillor of the right. They are nominally assisted
                    by six <hi rend="italic">pan-tso</hi> or judges, each of whom has his own <hi
                        rend="italic">tsam-pan</hi> or substitute and <hi rend="italic"
                        >tsam∙</hi><hi rend="italic">ei</hi> or adviser. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >ni-tso,</hi> the first of these judges’ departments, has charge of the
                    public offices and employments; the <hi rend="italic">ho-tso</hi> takes the
                    census, apportions the taxes, and looks after the mints; the <hi rend="italic"
                        >niei-tso</hi> supervises religious and official ceremonial; the <hi
                        rend="italic">pieng-tso</hi> is the department of war; the <hi rend="italic"
                        >hieng-tso</hi> administers the criminal courts; and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >kong-tso</hi> has the oversight of public works, commerce, &amp;c. In the
                    palace there are three <hi rend="italic">sug∙tsi,</hi> or functionaries charged
                    to put on record day by day all the royal words and actions. The eight provinces
                    of the kingdom are each administered by a governor, dependent on the ministerial
                    council; and each of the 332 districts into which the provinces are sub-divided
                    is under a separate mandarin. Military commanders have the chief authority in
                    the four fortified towns of Kang-hoa, Sou-wen, Koang-tsiou, and Siong-to or
                    Kai-seng. Theoretically every one of these posts is open to any Corean who has
                    acquired the necessary degree in the public examinations; but actually they are
                    almost all appropriated by the nobles. A postal system is maintained along the
                    principal highways,—the horses being kept by the Government, and the grooms and
                    riders holding almost the position of royal serfs. The army nominally includes
                    every individual capable of bearing arms, who does not belong to the nobility;
                    but only a small proportion of the men are brought under discipline. The
                    military mandarins, though chosen from the nobles, are in far less estimation
                    than the civil functionaries of corresponding rank. The salaries of the
                    governors and other high officials are large, but as the term is only two years,
                    and the custom of the country is for a person in office to support all his
                    relatives, it is seldom that the position proves genuinely lucrative. In
                    addition to the various regular officials already mentioned there are a number
                    of <hi rend="italic">e-sa,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">anaik-sa,</hi> who are
                    despatched by the king, armed with absolute power, to visit the provinces at
                    irregular intervals and secretly observo the condition of affairs. Corruption,
                    however, universally and openly prevails, and the supervision even of these
                    irresponsible emissaries affords little protection against injustice. The
                    mandarin is for ordinary civil cases the absolute judge within his district; but
                    if the matter is very important it may be referred to the provincial governor,
                    or even ultimately to the king himself. Criminal cases are decided by the
                    military mandarin, and the final appeal is to the great court of the capital,
                    which consists of two parts—the <hi rend="italic">po-tseng</hi> which collects
                    the evidence, and the <hi rend="italic">ieng-tso</hi> which passes the sentence.
                    Public functionaries and culprits accused of treason or rebellion are tried by a
                    special court called the <hi rend="italic">keum-pou,</hi> the members of which
                    are named directly by the king. In a case of high treason the whole family of
                    the guilty person is involved in his fate. A large portion of the real
                    administrative power lies in the hands of the subaltern officials of the civil
                    and military mandarins, who are distinguished by Μ. Dallet as “pretorians” and
                    “satellites.” The former compose a formidable hereditary class, which rarely
                    intermarries with the rest of the community; the latter are recruited from the
                    lower ranks of society. Torture is freely employed in judicial proceedings; and
                    the unhappy victim may either have the bones of his legs dislocated or bent, his
                    calves reduced to rags by blows from a heavy plank, the flesh of his thighs cut
                    through by the continuous friction of a rough cord, or his whole body agonized
                    by a prolonged suspension by the arms. Decapitation is the usual form of
                    execution both in civil and military cases.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">language</hi> of Corea belongs to the Turanian family, and
                    agrees with the other Turanian tongues in all the main grammatical features. It
                    is written alphabetically, by means of fourteen consonants corresponding to the
                    European <hi rend="italic">k, I, n, r, t, m</hi> (or Z&gt;), <hi rend="italic"
                        >p</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">b), s, ng</hi> or nasal <hi rend="italic">n,
                        ts, tsh, kh, th, ph</hi><hi rend="italic">(fi.e.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >p</hi> aspirated, not <hi rend="italic">ſ)</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >h,</hi> and eleven vowels, which go to the composition of thirteen
                    diphthongs. The letters appear either in an ordinary or a cursive form. Every
                    line is written from the top to the bottom of the page, syllable by syllable.
                    The vocabulary is greatly mingled with Chinese words; but these undergo the
                    regular Corean declension. The noun has nine cases, including the nominative.
                    Adjectives proper there are none, the nouns and verbs supplying their place. For
                    the names of the numerals above 90, such as 100, 1000, &amp;c., recourse is had
                    to the Chinese. The verb possesses, besides the simple affirmative, a
                    conditional, an interrogative, an honorific, a causative, and several other
                    forms; but it has no distinctive inflections for number &lt;r person. The
                    honorific form is employed in speaking of dignitaries; and indeed the verb must
                    slightly vary according to the status of the person addressed.</p>
                <p>The study of their native language is greatly neglected by the Coreans, and the
                    educated classes regularly employ Chinese both in literature and social
                    intercourse. The annals of the kingdom, the laws, scientific treatises, public
                    inscriptions, and even shop-signs are all written in the foreign language; at
                    the same time the Corean pronunciation is so peculiar as tobe unintelligible in
                    the ears of the inhabitants of the empire. That at one time there was an
                    extensive native literature there seems no doubt; but it is now represented only
                    by a few poetic collections, popular romances, and nursery tales,—to which,
                    indeed, must be added a number of works composed by the missionaries, who have
                    encouraged the preservation and cultivation of the national language. There is
                    an official translation of the sacred books of Confucianism, in which it is
                    criminal to change a single word without the order of the Government; and a
                    sibylline book, prohibited by the authorities, circulates secretly among the <pb

                    Admiral Roze found a library of 3000 or 4000 books finely covered with green and
                    crimson silk, and arranged and preserved with great care. One volume
                    particularly attracted Μ. Ridel’s attention; it consisted of a number of marble
                    tablets, united by gilt copper hinges; each tablet was protected by a cushion of
                    scarlet silk, and the letters were in gold incrusted on the marble.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> As in China, so in Corea, learning is
                    ostensibly in high estimation, and all public officials must pass certain
                    examinations. The student is left perfectly free to follow any system and
                    receive instruction from any teacher whatever,—the examiners, who are appointed
                    by the Government, taking account of nothing but results. The most important
                    examinations are held once a year in the capital, and candidates flock thither
                    from all the provinces. After the examination is over, those who have passed put
                    on the robes of their new title, and proceed on horseback with sound of music to
                    visit the chief dignitaries of the state, the examiners, &amp;c. Then follows a
                    burlesque initiation which, though not enforced by law, is rendered imperative
                    by custom. The novice has his face stained with ink and besprinkled with flour,
                    and is otherwise subjected to whimsical insults. There are three separate
                    degrees, that of the <hi rend="italic">tcho-si,</hi> that of the <hi
                        rend="italic">tsin-sa,</hi> and that of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >keup-tchiei,—</hi> the last or highest being obtainable at once without the
                    previous possession of the others. The <hi rend="italic">tsin-sa</hi> are
                    destined to fill administrative posts in the province, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >keup-tchiei</hi> the higher positions about the capital and the palace. The
                    military degree, which is also known as the <hi rend="italic">keup-tchiei,</hi>
                    involves but little literary culture, and is sought only by the poorer nobles.
                    The whole system is in a state of great decay, and the purchasing of degrees or
                    of doctoral theses is far from uncommon. Besides the possessors of the
                    above-mentioned degrees there is a special class of scholars, known as the
                    middle class, who devote themselves from father to son to the study of various
                    special branches necessary in public employ :—the interpreters, who are trained
                    either in Chinese, Manchu (Hon-hak), or Mongolian; the <hi rend="italic"
                        >koang-sang-kam,</hi> or school of sciences, devoted to astronomy, geoscopy,
                    and auspication; the <hi rend="italic">ei-sa,</hi> or school of medicine,
                    including a branch for the royal service and another for the public; the <hi
                        rend="italic">sa-tsa-koan,</hi> or school of recorders, employed in the
                    preservation of the archives and the drawing up of official reports for Pekin;
                    the <hi rend="italic">to-hoa-si,</hi> intrusted with the preparation of maps,
                    and the execution of the portrait of the king, which after his death is added to
                    the royal gallery; the <hi rend="italic">nioιd-hak,</hi> or school of law, which
                    deals mainly with the penal code; the <hi rend="italic">kiei-sa,</hi> from which
                    clerks are obtained for the financial and public works department; and the <hi
                        rend="italic">hem-nou-koan,</hi> which is intrusted with the management of
                    the Government hydraulic clock.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion.—</hi> Buddhism, according to native tradition, was
                    introduced into Corea in the 4th century of our era, and under the dynasty of
                    Korio it became the official religion. On the establishment, however, of the
                    Tsi-tsie∏ in the l4th century it gave place to the doctrine of Confucius, which
                    continues to the present day as the established creed. In its main features the
                    Confucianism of Corea is identical with the Chinese system; but it is
                    accompanied and intermingled with various popular superstitions. Worship is
                    offered not only to the Sia-tsik, or patron of the kingdom, but also to the
                    Siang-tiei, whom some regard as a supreme divinity, and others identify with the
                    sky. To the latter public sacrifices, consisting of pigs, sheep, and goats, are
                    offered for the purpose of preventing or obtaining rain, removing epidemic
                    diseases, or otherwise interfering with the course of natural events. The
                    Sía-tsik is hardly known in the provinces; but in the capital his temple is the
                    most sacred of all. Among the educated classes the only form of religion in real
                    force is the worship of their ancestors, and consequently the greatest
                    importance is attached to all the ceremonial details of funerals, mourning, and
                    tombs. In every district there is a temple of Confucius called <hi rend="italic"
                        >kiang-kio,</hi> with an extensive domain attached; and if the revenue is
                    not sufficient to maintain the necessary expenses, the treasury of the district
                    must supply the deficit. There still exist several of the large pagodas erected
                    during the period of the official status of Buddhism; they are built in the
                    Chinese style, and are frequently remarkable for the beauty of their situation.
                    Except in the province of Kieng-sang the Buddhist monks, or bonzes, retain no
                    influence; they have but little learning, and their numbers are diminishing. The
                    belief in evil spirits is common among the Coreans; their action is frequently
                    controlled by the propitious or unpropitious character of times and seasons, and
                    almost every event is the sign of fortune or mishap. The serpent is th¢ object
                    of superstitious respect; and, instead of killing it, the Corean feeds it as
                    regularly as his domestic animals. Of first importance for the happiness of a
                    family is the preservation of the ancestral fire, and every housewife has all
                    the anxiety and responsibility of a Vestal Virgin. The number of astrologers and
                    fortunetellers throughout the country is extraordinary. The blind are reputed to
                    be endowed with special prophetic aptitude, and, as a natural consequence, a
                    large proportion of those who are deprived of sight make gain of their afflic
                    tion. In the capital these blind seers are formed into a regular corporation
                    legally recognized, and their services are in great request for the discovery of
                    secrets, the foretelling of the future, and the exorcizing of devils. In this
                    latter operation they trust principally to noise as a means of frightening the
                    spirits, whom they ultimately catch in a bottle and carry off in triumph.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manners and Customs.—</hi> Women hold a very low position in
                    Corean estimation, and count for little in the sight of the law. Not only are
                    they destitute of all political and social influence, but they are not held
                    personally responsible for their actions, and live in a state of lifelong
                    pupilage. At the same time they enjoy a considerable amount of freedom, and it
                    is only among the upper classes that they are kept in seclusion. Marriage is
                    altogether an affair of etiquette; the terms are settled by the heads of the
                    families, and the bride and bridegroom have no opportunity of seeing each other
                    till they meet on the marriage platform, and bow to each other as man and wife.
                    After marriage there is little social intercourse between the pair, both men and
                    women keeping company with their own sex. Among the lower classes second
                    marriages are equally permissible to both sexes; but among the nobles the second
                    marriage of a widow is considered so reprehensible that the offspring of such a
                    union is branded as illegitimate. Polygamy is not permitted, but concubinage is
                    a recognized institution. Strong affection for their chil Iren is one of the
                    better characteristics of the Coreans, and infanticide and exposure are almost
                    unknown. Adoption is a common expedient to prevent the extinction of a family,
                    and the choice of the child is regulated by a rigid etiquette. Filial piety is
                    in the highest estimation, and the conduct of a son towards his father is guided
                    by innumerable rules. If he meets him on the way, he must do him humblest
                    obeisance; if he writes to him, he must employ the most respectful forms in the
                    language; if the father is sick, the son must attend him; if the father is in
                    prison, the son must be at hand without; if the father is exiled, the son must
                    accompany him on his journey. On the death of his father the eldest son becomes
                    the head of the family, responsible for all the duties of a father towards <pb

                    share in the patrimony, but merely dowries and donations on marriage, &amp;c.
                    Between the various members of a family, even after they have separated from the
                    domestic hearth, there remains the greatest intimacy and affection; and the
                    slightest connection of blood is recognized as a bond of attachment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Industry and Trade.—</hi> The industrial arts are but slightly
                    developed, the peasant himself in most cases supplying by his own labour the
                    greater part of his needs. The one manufacture in which the Corean ranks really
                    high is that of paper, a material employed as in Japan in a great variety of
                    ways. Trade is mainly carried on by means of markets or fairs, but transactions
                    are hampered by the deficiency of the currency. Only one kind of coin, a small
                    piece of copper known as a “sapeke,” is recognized, and even this is not in use
                    in the northern provinces, where barter alone is in vogue. The roads of the
                    country offer but few facilities for traffic; wheeled vehicles are unknown, and
                    much of the transport of goods is effected by porterage. Except at the capital
                    there is hardly, over any of the numerous streams, a structure worthy to be
                    called a' bridge. Foreign commerce there is none, unless the fair which is held
                    annually for several days at Pi en men on the occasion of the passage of the
                    ambassadors, or that which takes place every two years at Hung-chung, is to be
                    counted an exception. The Chinese or Japanese ships are allowed to fish for
                    trepang along the coast of Pieng-an and for herring on that of Hoang-hai; but
                    they are prohibited, not only from landing, but from holding any communication
                    with the Coreans at sea.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dwellings and Dress.—</hi> The houses of the Coreans are of one
                    story, flimsily constructed of wood, clay, and ricestraw, usually covered with
                    thatch and badly provided with windows. Lamentable accounts are given of the
                    general poverty of the common people. Their houses are only about ten or twelve
                    feet square; the floor is the bare earth, covered in rare instances with mats of
                    poor quality; no chairs are in use, people squatting on the floor; and there is
                    nothing worthy of the name of a bed. The ordinary shoe or sandal is formed of
                    straw, and leaves the great toe exposed; but stockings are worn by all. Wide
                    pantaloons and a long vest are the principal articles of attire,—the well-to-do
                    wearing also a large overcoat, which the peasant uses on gala occasions only.
                    The national hat is composed of a framework of bamboos covered with an open kind
                    of haircloth; it protects neither from rain, cold, nor sun, and is altogether
                    very inconvenient. The principal material of the wearing apparel is cotton
                    cloth, rough in texture, and of its natural colour; but a rude kind of silk
                    fabric is not uncommon among the wealthier classes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Corea, or Chosen, as it is called by the
                    natives, appears for the first time in Chinese history in 1122 B.c., as
                    affording an asylum to the refugee viscount of Ke; and since that period it has
                    been claimed as an integral part of the Chinese empire. Neither at that time,
                    nor for centuries afterwards, does it seem to have formed a political
                    unity,—various states, as Hwuy, Shin-han, Pih-tse, ana Sin-lo being mentioned in
                    the Chinese records. In the first century of our era three of these states stand
                    out as important: -—Kao-li in the north and north-east, Pih-tse in the west, and
                    Sin-lo in the south. Out of the civil wars which fill the next ten hundred years
                    Sin-lo emerges predominant; but in the 11th century the king of Kao-li, known as
                    Wang-Han, or Wang the founder, united the whole peninsula under his sway, and
                    established the dynasty which has given its name to the country. The fall of the
                    Mongolian dynasty in China brought about a similar revolution in Corea; and in
                    1392 Tai-tso or Li-tan became the founder of the present dynasty of Tsi-tsien,
                    and the author of the system of administration still in force. The Chinese at
                    that time imposed on the Coreans the use of their chronology and calendar.</p>
                <p>Under Siong-siong, who held the throne from 1506 to 1544, the Coreans carried on
                    a war with Japan, but in 1597 the great Japanese monarch 1 aiko-sama retaliated
                    by a remarkable invasion. According to the journal of ü-o-gawutsi, a Japanese
                    general who took part in the expedition, the force consisted of 163,000
                    horsemen; three-fourths of the country was occupied and several of the oldest
                    cities destroyed, in spite of the fact that two Chinese kings appeared to assist
                    the Coreans with a force of 100,000 horsemen. The death of Taiko-sama in 1598
                    led the Japanese to abandon their conquest; and in 1615 peace was definitively
                    signed, but only on conditions of great hardship for the Coreans. A tribute was
                    exacted and the fort of Fusan-kai was retained; and the Corean king till 1790
                    had to seüd an embassy to Japan to announce his accession. When the Manchu
                    dynasty ascended the throne of China, the Coreans defended the Mings; but being
                    defeated by the new power, they had in 1637 formally to recognize the Manchu
                    sovereignty, and to pay henceforward a heavy annual tribute. Since 1636 there
                    has been no war with China or with Japan; and the Coreans have maintained in
                    regard to every other nation the most absolute isolation. The ambassadors sent
                    annually to Peking have been the means of conveying some little knowledge of
                    Western nations to their countrymen; but the result has rather been to make them
                    more exclusive. It is recorded in a Corean work that Tsiang-tou-wen-i saw a
                    European named Jean Niouk in the Chinese capital, and obtained from him books,
                    pistols, telescopes, and other curiosities; and Ricci’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tien-tsou∙sir-ei,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">True yrrhidisles about
                        God,</hi> are mentioned by Ni-siou-siρong, a Corean author. In 1784
                    Ni-tek-tso having had his attention aroused by some Chinese work on the
                    Christian religion thus introduced, requested his friend Seng-houng-i, soon
                    after sent with the embassy, to make inquiry about the subject. The result was
                    the formation of a Christian sect, which speedily attracted the attention of the
                    Roman Catholic mission, whose agents succeeded, in spite of the jealous watch of
                    the Corean authorities, in making their way into the country. Persecution soon
                    broke out, and has continued at intervals ever since. In 1831 a vicar apostolic
                    was appointed by the Pope, and repeated efforts were made to effect a firm
                    footing; but in 1866 the last Europeans were expelled. To avenge the murder of
                    the French missionaries, Admiral Roze undertook an expedition in the end of that
                    year. He destroyed the city of Kang-hoa, with its important military
                    establishments, but obtained no concessions from the Government. Several
                    American vessels having been burned by the Coreans, the United States in 1867
                    despatched Commander Schufeldt to remonstrate with the native authorities, but
                    he returned as he went. Nothing further was done till 1870, when a force under
                    Admiral Rodgers proceeded up the river towards the capital, with the intention
                    of communicating directly with the Government. It was met by a determined
                    resistance on the part of the Coreans, and though the American vessels were
                    secure against the native artillery, and American guns soon silenced the forts,
                    the admiral was constrained by political difficulties to bring his expedition to
                    a close. In 1875 a convention was arranged by the Coreans with Moriyama, the
                    Japanese ambassador; but its terms were soon infringed and au attack v <hi

                    Government accordingly despatched Karoda as high commissioner, wlιo succeeded in
                    concluding a treaty with important concessions to Japan. The Japanese are now
                    entitled to send a permanent resident to the capital; three ports are opened to
                    Japanese trade; Corean ports may be entered by Japanese vessels in distress; and
                    Japanese mariners are free to survey the Corean coast.</p>
