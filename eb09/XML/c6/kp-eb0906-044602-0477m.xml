                <p><label type="entry">COSMOGONY</label>, a theory of the origin of the world and
                    its inhabitants. Such a theory is never found on the lowest stage of human
                    culture. Thus, “it never occurred to the Eskimos,”says Dr Brinton, “that the
                    earth had a beginning;” and the Abipones of South America “never troubled
                    themselves about what went on in the heavens” (Sir J. Lubbock). And even when á
                    theory of the world’s origin is formed, it is at first of the simplest
                    character. Two elements, no more, are necessary. With regard to the first, there
                    is a consensus of opinion among primitive races that, before the present order
                    of things, water held all things in solution. Thus the Accadiaus, whose
                    mythology passed into that of the Semitic Babylonians, “considered the humid
                    element as the vehicle of all life, the source of all generation” (Lenormant).
                    To “make pregnant” this “vast abyss” a creator or organizer is necessary, who is
                    educed, at least not unfrequently, from the abyss itself. Thus, in a Japanese
                    myth reported by Mr Tylor <hi rend="italic">(shourn. of Anthropol.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lnst.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> July 1876), “while
                    the earth is still soft like mud, or like oil floating on the surface of water,
                    there arises out of the mass the flag or rush called <hi rend="italic">asi,</hi>
                    from which there springs the land-forming god.” Some, content with throwing the
                    speculative difficulty further back, imagine the pressat creation to be rather a
                    re-creation. Hence the notion of world-ages “rounded off by sweeping
                    destructions,” the last of which was the deluge. Thus, among the non-Aryan
                    Santals of Bengal, “the tradition of the creation is mixed up with one of the
                    deluge, if indeed the creation with these less gifted races does not begin with
                    the flood .... The Santal legend describes rather the subsidence of waters than
                    a creation” (Dr Hunter, <hi rend="italic">Rural</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Bengal,</hi> pp. 150-1). Some simple-minded tribes suppose the earth to have
                    been fished up from the depths of the sea, that is, from the transparent depths
                    of their own Pacific (Waitz and Gerland, <hi rend="italic">Anthropologie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">der Naturvölker,</hi> vi. 241). The egg is another common mythic
                    element. It is 'found in Phoenicia, Egypt, India, China, Polynesia, and Finland,
                    associated with one or another of the ideas of mixture, generation, fragility,
                    the dome-like appearance of the sky, and the form of the sun and the planets.
                    The Creator himself assumes the most Protean shapes, ranging from the magnified
                    man to the musk-rat. From this brief introduction we pass on to a few specimen
                    cosmogonies of the more important races.</p>
                <p>Until the year 1876 our materials for the Babylonian cosmogony were almost
                    entirely confined to second-hand extracts from Berosus (1 280-260 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> Many (Niebuhr was not among them) doubted their
                    trustworthiness. But the reign of scepticism is over. The late talented
                    decipherer, George Smith, has, it would seem, actually discovered some of the
                    cuneiform tablets from which the priest of Bel compiled. No doubt Berosus was
                    uncritical—- he was an Euhemerist, like his contemporaries. But he was honest
                    and learned in cuneiform, and enjoyed access to unmutilated documents, whereas
                    the tablets in our possession are fragmentary, and their interpretation is only
                    inchoate. We cannot, therefore, yet afford to ignore the Berosian narratives,
                    which Syncellus and others have preserved. (See Müller’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fragmenta</hi><hi rend="italic">Histor.</hi><hi rend="italic">Gr&lt;xc.,</hi>
                    ii. 497, and with caution Cory’s <hi rend="italic">Ancient Fragments,</hi> by
                    Hodges, pp. 58-60.) One of these contains a cosmogony, or rather two
                    cosmogonies, the latter of which is fragmentary, and fitted rather awkwardly
                    into the former. Its resemblances to Gen. i. are obvious, such as the primaeval
                    flood, which Berosus calls Thauatth( = <hi rend="italic">Tihavtu</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Tihamtzι),</hi> and creation by cutting or dividing. But the
                    divergences are equally striking— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Berosus tells of
                    certain composite beings who dwelt in the dark primaeval water. This seems to
                    indicate that the water means the aether, which is in fact one of its mythic
                    senses, and that the monsters are the constellations. Mr G. Smith compares this
                    narrative with a tablet derived from the city of Cutha <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Chaldaean</hi><hi rend="italic">Accozιnt, foc.,</hi> pp. 102-3), but the
                    parallel is fallacious. Tiamat, the primaeval flood, is only mentioned in the
                    latter incidentally, and the monsters are placed on the earth, not in
                    Tiamat.</p>
                <p>But there is a much more important cosmogony, for which we are indebted to the
                    library of King Assurbanipal (673-626 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> The
                    tablets (probably twelve in number) are copies of much older originals, which Mr
                    G. Smith would place near 2000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> at the beginning of the literary period. This is perhaps too early,
                    to judge from the absence of a statement in the colophon that the copy had an
                    “old ’’original (Mr Sayce in <hi rend="italic">Academy,</hi> ix. 4). But “late”
                    in Babylonian history is still early from the point of view of Greek and Hebrew
                    literary history. The fragments have been arranged by Mr Smith on valid internal
                    grounds in an order corresponding to the cosmogony in Gen. i. The Babylonian
                    parallels are very striking, and would probably be still more so if the tablets
                    were complete. They are—(1) the general arrangement, (2) the introduction of a
                    god speaking, (3) the notion of the primaeval flood, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >tiamat</hi> (feminine) like the <hi rend="italic">tèhõm</hi> (masculine) of
                    Gen. i., (4) the repeated eulogy on the previous creative work as “delightful,”
                    and (5) the mention of the stars as placed to determine the year. The chief
                    differences arise from the polytheism of Babylonia, and yet some have seen a
                    survival of polytheistic language in Gen. i. 26.</p>
                <p>The sacred archives, now lost, of the Phoenicians were known, it seems, to
                    Sanchoniathon, who found a translator(l) in Philo of Byblus (end of 1st century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1). The origin <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0478-0447"/> and value of Philo’s work (only known from the
                    extracts in Eusebius) have been discussed by Ewald and Μ. Renan, with a
                    tolerably satisfactory result. The latter, writing from the shores of Phoenicia,
                    calls it “the admirably faithful mirror of that which I have under my eyes” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Rev.</hi><hi rend="italic">arcħeol.,</hi> iii. 172). Distorted
                    and discoloured as the myths in Philo may be, they are such as no forger could
                    have invented. Among them are parts of two, if not three, cosmogonies (Müller,
                    <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Hist.</hi><hi rend="italic">Gr.,</hi> iii. 565, comp,
                    with caution Cory’s <hi rend="italic">Anc. Fragments,</hi> pp. 1-5). The text is
                    here and there corrupt, and its mythic meaning obscure. Movers and Bunsen are
                    fantastic, nor can we accept Mr Sayce’s theory <hi rend="italic">(Academy,</hi>
                    March 20, 1875), though he k right in seeking for a clue in Babylonia. The first
                    part, however, is clear, with its chaos black as Erebus, and its wind (comp.
                    Gen. i. 2) which became enamoured of its own elements. The explanation of this
                    is due to Μ. de Vogüé <hi rend="italic">(Mélanges,</hi> pp. 60, 61). The wind is
                    the creating deity regarded as one; the dpχαc are the two sides or persons of
                    the deity when analyzed. In the inscriptions we find both Baal and Tanith “the
                    Name, or Face, of Baal,” <hi rend="italic">re.,</hi> the male and female
                    principles, the conjugal union of which produced creation. In another cosmogony
                    we meet with the woman Baau, “which is interpreted Night,” probably the <hi
                    rend="italic">bõhu,ov</hi> chaos of Gen. i. 2 (a Babylonian parallel has also
                    been found). On the whole these cosmogonies agree with the Babylonian and
                    portions of the Hebrew, though laying a somevγhat greater stress on the
                    life-evolving power of matter (which may be due to the systematizers), and in
                    one case (“Chysor, the opener” = the Egyptian demiurge Ptah) influenced from
                    Egypt. The Semitic (and probably pre-Semitic) notion of creation by division is,
                    however, no longer traceable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Such were the myths current among the near relatives of the Israelites. But what
                    beliefs had the Israelites themselves? The Old Testament contains three
                    cosmogonies:— Gen. i. —ii. <hi rend="italic">4a∙,</hi> Gen. ii. 45-7; and Prov.
                    iii. 19, 20, viii. 22-31 (with Job xv. 7, 8). Only the first is perfect. The
                    second seems to be fragmentary, and adds but little to our knowledge. The third
                    is poetical and speculative. All three apparently proceed from the lettered
                    class, and have been attributed to an outburst of historic and prehistoric study
                    in the Babylonian and Persian period. It would be too much to say that the
                    Israelites had no cosmogony before the exile, but the probability is that it was
                    comparatively undeveloped, and in the competition of beliefs had fallen into the
                    background. The chief characteristic of Gen. i. is the union of two apparently
                    inconsistent phraseologies, the supernatural!Stic and the evolutionary. Thus the
                    pre-existence of matter seems to be asserted in vv. 2, 3. “Now the earth was <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> was involved in) chaos [Heb. <hi rend="italic">tõhü
                    va-bõhif\,</hi> and darkness was upon the face of the flood [Heb. <hi
                    rend="italic">tehom</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> and the wind of Elohim was
                    hovering upon the face of the waters”—this describes the circumstances under
                    which the following act took place; “then Elohim said, Let light (the condition
                    of life) be, and light was.” The writer uses language common to other
                    cosmogonies, but strives to accommodate it to his own high type of religion. It
                    was not, he consciously or unconsciously implies, a blind force inherent in
                    nature, which produced the first beginnings of life, nor was the Creator himself
                    the offspring of chaos; <hi rend="italic">his</hi> demiurge was a supernatural
                    being, wſliom some orthodox commentators have identified with the Logos of laten
                    writers, and who was from the first preparing the “rude mass” for its human
                    inhabitants. The peculiar expression, “the wind of Elohim was hovering,”
                    suggests different comparisons; thus, on a far lower stage of religious pro
                    gress, the Polynesians often describe the heaven-and-air∙ god Tangaloa as a bird
                    hovering over the waters (Wartz, vi. 241). In the earliest form of the narrative
                    in Gen. i. it may have been “the bird of Elohim;” “wind” seems to be an
                    interpretation. Another peculiar form of exprès, sion is the creation of the
                    light before the sun (v. 3), which may be supposed to be paralleled by similar
                    expressions elsewhere. The Egyptian god Thoth, the demiurge, is said to have
                    “given the world light when all was darkness, and there was no sun;” and the
                    Orphic light-god Phanes is anterior to the sun. But it is the place of a
                    commentator to trace similar phenomena throughout the first cosmogony, and also
                    to exhibit the evidence of the various redactions through which the section has
                    passed. For, as Dr Schrader (1863) and Mr R. Martineau (1868) have shown, the
                    narrative in its original form did not divide creation into days, but merely
                    -gave a catalogue of divine works. We need only add that the word for “to
                    create” in Gen. i. originally meant “to carve.” The,Hellenistic Jews, it is
                    true, took it in the sense of “to create out of nothing,” but many think this is
                    not favoured by the context in Genesis. The problem of the origin of matter
                    seems not to have arisen among the Jews of the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>The Egyptians have left us no ancient cosmogonical system, though speculation was
                    early rife among them. They appear to have had three great creative deities.
                    Ptah, “the opener” (of the world-egg <hi rend="italic">T),</hi> was <hi
                    rend="italic">probably</hi> the god of the cosmic fire, who prepared matter for
                    Amen Ra to organize. But it was to Ra that the honour of creation was chiefly
                    ascribed (see the unsurpassable hymn in <hi rend="italic">Records of the
                    Past,</hi> ii. 129-136)—to Ra, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the sun-god, as the
                    people supposed, or the <hi rend="italic">anima</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mundi,</hi> as the priests. One of Ra’s (later) manifestations was Chnum, the
                    divine breath which stirred the primeval waters (as in Gen. i. 2, except that
                    Chnum is never represented as a bird), and the fashioner of gods and men (see
                    <hi rend="italic">Records of the Past,</hi> ii. 145, and comp. Gen. ii. 7).
                    Thoth, originally the moon-god, became the principle of creative intelligence,
                    and with him were worshipped the eight cosmic forces called Sesennu. He is
                    called “the tongue of Ra,” though elsewhere Ra himself is said to create 1/ a
                    word, and this ascription of speech to the deity is, according to Μ. Naville,
                    one of the most important points in common between the Egyptian and the Hebrew
                    cosmogonies, to be added therefore to those wé have already mentioned,—chaos,
                    the divine breath, the creation of light before the sun, and the moulding hand
                    of the deity.</p>
                <p>We hasten on to the Aryan nations of the East. The Iranian parallels to the early
                    chapters of Genesis have been greatly exaggerated. The only really valuable ones
                    are those contained in the Avesta, which, though the date of its final redaction
                    is uncertain, is probably in the main earlier than the return of the Jews from
                    Babylon. The cosmogonical parallels are (1) the ascription of creation to the
                    will of a supernatural deity, and (2) the ideal perfection attributed to the
                    newly created world. Yet even here some deduction is necessary. For apparently
                    the world is produced out of pre-existent matter, according to Genesis (see
                    above); out of nothing, according to the Avesta. And though Ahura-mazda (Ormuzd)
                    is generally described in the Avesta as the sole creator, there is an ancient
                    passage (Yasna, ch. XXX.) in which a good and an evil spirit are spoken of as
                    joint-creators. Still, in the period of Darius and Xerxes (to which the first
                    Hebrew cosmogony in its final form probably belongs) we have the best possible
                    evidence for the sole creatorship of Ahura-mazda, for the great cuneiform
                    inscription at Naksh-i-Rustam describes him as “the great God of gods, who made
                    heaven and earth, and made men,” and similar language occurs in the royal
                    inscriptions at Elvend, Van, and Persepolis.</p>

                <p>There is a well-known Vedic hymn (“Nor aught, nor naught existed,” &amp;c.),
                    which has been adduced to prove the antiquity of the most refined speculations
                    among the Hindus. But it seems unwise to adduce this as a typical race-myth, for
                    it probably marks the end rather than the beginning of a theological stage
                    (Goldstücker’s <hi rend="italic">Panini,</hi> p. 144, comp. Max Muller’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Anc.</hi><hi rend="italic">Sanslc.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lit.,</hi> pp. 559-565). Another hymn of the same Mandala (Rig Veda x. 90)
                    embodies the comparatively naive conception of the world as the covering of the
                    divinity, Purusha being represented as a prodigious body, from which the various
                    parts of creation proceeded. This is intermixed, however, with the much less
                    simple theory of the sacrifice of the cosmogonic agent himself, the primitive
                    unity parting into different forms as the limbs of the victim are severed on the
                    altar. In the S’atapatha Brãhmana we meet again with the primeval waters and the
                    world-egg, which according to one account produce Prajãpati, and according to
                    another are produced by him. In the same Brãhmana we find the first mention of
                    the tortoise-theory, the origin of which has been well pointed out by Mr Tylor
                    <hi rend="italic">(Early History of Mankind,</hi> p. 340). The cosmogony in Manu
                    (Dr Muir’s <hi rend="italic">Sanskrit Texts,</hi> iv. 26) is still more deeply
                    tinged with speculation. Here we meet with “the self-existent Lord,” who <hi
                    rend="italic">“with a thought</hi> created the waters, and deposited in them a
                    seed,” which becomes a golden egg, in which egg “he himself is born as Brahma,
                    the progenitor of all the worlds.” Contrast this theory of the speculative
                    Hindu, ascribing creation to a thought, with that of the more energetic Semites
                    and Egyptians—“God said, Let it be, and it was so.”</p>
                <p>Turning to Africa, we find that Old Calabar and Zululand are among the few
                    regions where cosmogonical speculation seems to have at least germinated (see
                    Bastian, Callaway, Tylor). Even the important myths of the American and
                    Polynesian races must on this occasion be dismissed in a few lines. With regard
                    to the former, Dr Brinton’s <hi rend="italic">Myths of the New World</hi> and Mr
                    Bancroft’s <hi rend="italic">Native Races of North America</hi> will supply the
                    reader with much food for thought. Let him not neglect the poetic narrative of
                    the Quichés, with its Hurakan (comp. “hurricane ”), the thunder-god, the Heart
                    of Heaven, and the Creator, nor the still more important myth of the north-west
                    Athapascas, nor, for its curiosity, the “Darwinian theory” of the Ahts of
                    Vancouver Island. With regard to the latter, the sixth volume of Waitz and
                    Gerland, and the works of Sir George Grey <hi rend="italic">(Polynesian
                    Mythology)</hi> and Mr Gill <hi rend="italic">(Myths and Songs of the South
                    Pacific),</hi> are full of suggestive material and remarkable parallels to the
                    myths of more civilized races. The cosmogony, however, which opens Mr Gill’s
                    fascinating collection is too complicated and artificial to be ancient or even
                    (perhaps) indigenous. Even Sir George Grey’s delightful story of the rending
                    apart of Heaven and Earth (comp. Gen. i. 6-10) must be pronounced modern as
                    compared with the simple stories of the heaven-god Tangaroa. It is only in the
                    last stage of a religion that cosmogonies are systematized,—</p>
                <p>“Greek endings, each the little passing bell That signifies some faith’s about to
                    die,” though the death-struggle may be prolonged, and may issue in a higher
                    life.</p>
