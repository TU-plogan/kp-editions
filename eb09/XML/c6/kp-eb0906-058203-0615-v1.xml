                <p><label type="entry">CRIME</label> is a word which, in every-day speech, is
                    sometimes made to include more and sometimes less than the subject of the
                    present article. On the one hand, the breach of a moral principle, with which
                    the law has never concerned itself, is sometimes loosely described as criminal;
                    on the other hand, a distinction is sometimes drawn between crimes and minor
                    offences, though the law prescribes a punishment for minor offences as well as
                    for crimes. But if moral theories and slender shades of difference in guilt are
                    disregarded, crime is simply conduct (either in commission or in omission) of
                    which the state disapproves, and for which it demands a penalty.</p>
                <p>.Though, however, it is possible to give a definition of crime which may hold
                    good for all times and for all countries, it by no means follows that crime is
                    always and everywhere the same. On the contrary, the growth and the changes of
                    criminal laws are among the most curious monuments of revolutions in public
                    opinion as displayed by legislation. Nor can the study of morals be altogether
                    dissociated from the study of crime, because the moralist may and frequently
                    does influence the legislator, and that which is but a moral lapse in one
                    generation may become a criminal offence in another. So also deeds which have
                    been considered praiseworthy at one period, may at another be punishable; and
                    new conditions of society may cause penalties to be exacted for action or for
                    negligence which would be altogether inconceivable to the savage.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that no moral philosopher or legislator, no one even unitingin
                    himself the functions of both, would be able to devise a penal code which would
                    be all-sufficient, and which would be applicable to every possible detail in the
                    development of an ever-expanding civilization. New circumstances demand new
                    laws; and the adaptation of new laws to new circumstances is not the least
                    interesting feature in the history of any country. Religious beliefs, religious
                    and other theories of ethics, the attacks of foreign enemies, the growth of
                    commerce, the progress of science, everything which affects the condition of the
                    community, may affect its criminal legislation.</p>
                <p>In very primitive tribes murder, robbery, and rape are not crimes—not, at least,
                    in the modern sense. For one tribe to attack another by surprise, to slaughter
                    its men, to appropriate its land, and to ravish or enslave its women was, and in
                    some places still is, very meritorious conduct. The first approach towards the
                    reprobation of murder is to be found in the ancient blood-feud which, however,
                    resembles quite as much the ferocity of the wild beast deprived of its young as
                    the indignation of the civilized human being at an attack upon the general
                    security of life. The family of the slain assumed the right to exact vengeance
                    of the slayer and his kin if members of the same tribe as themselves; and the
                    earliest form of vengeance was bloodshed. This was not modified until men had
                    arrived at the notion of property distinguishable from that which was held in
                    common by the tribe—a very important stage in the progress of human affairs.</p>
                <p>It is well established that the tenure of land in severalty is of later date than
                    tenure by the tribe or community at large; and as soon as the claim of any
                    individual to any particular piece of land was recognized, in any form, the
                    right of property in movables must have been recognized also, if indeed the
                    latter did not precede the former. Sooner or later the ownership of certain
                    families was admitted in the case of plots of ground and flocks and herds, the
                    ownership of particular persons in the case of arms and armour and the
                    implements of agriculture. Hence arose the practice of compounding with the
                    avengers of blood. The relatives of the slain agreed to accept cattle, or any
                    movable goods of which they might stand in need, as an equivalent for the life
                    of the kinsman whom they had lost. But Governments which had advanced very
                    little on the path of civilization perceived that the loss of a tribesman was a
                    loss to the community, because—if for no other reason—it represented a
                    diminution of force in a conflict with a rival tribe. When a fine was paid for
                    murder, therefore, a portion of it only was allotted to the kin of the person
                    murdered, and the remainder to the king or other governing power.</p>
                <p>As soon as the state had thus claimed a share of the blood-fine, <hi
                        rend="italic">wer,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">τroιvη,</hi> the foundation of
                    the criminal law had been laid—a distinction had been drawn between injuries
                    affecting the individual alone and injuries affecting the community also. It was
                    perhaps only natural that, when movables were accepted as compensation for a
                    life held to be forfeited for murder, the wrongful appropriation of movables
                    should be punishable by death—a not uncommon penalty in many primitive laws.
                    Extreme severity of punishment for all offences (except homicide) committed
                    within the boundaries of the tribe is indeed the characteristic of all the
                    earliest attempts to deal with crime. The idea of the uncivilized man is that
                    the most <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n616/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0616-0583"/> ferocious chastisement is the most certain
                    deterrent; and as he has won most of that which he possesses by taking it
                    forcibly from others, he is not disposed to attribute to his fellow tribesmen
                    any very high respect for property in the abstract.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, with the tenure of land in severalty, and the acquisition of some
                    personalty, was necessarily developed, in one form or other, the idea of
                    protection for life and property in general. But small tribes continued to be
                    engaged in frequent conflicts with their neighbours; and the principles of right
                    and wrong which were applied to the various individuals composing any one tribe
                    were in practice, if not in theory, long disregarded in dealings with the
                    stranger. Outside a certain circle of no very great extent killing was still no
                    murder, taking no theft or robbery, capture or violation of a woman no rape, in
                    the modern sense. When tribes became united into nations, the rivalry of clan
                    against clan was not immediately extinguished; and the sentiments of the robber
                    chieftain coexisted with governments which sanctioned laws for ⅛e repression of
                    robbers and their deeds of violence. National growth out of these discordant
                    elements is to be traced, with the greatest clearness, in the marvellously
                    complete series of records preserved in the English Public Record Office, and
                    not least in those which concern the Scottish and Welsh borders.</p>
                <p>The law of development is not restricted to one island, or to races speaking one
                    particular language. Its range appears to be as wide as history, and is
                    sometimes to be detected even where history can hardly be said to exist. If, for
                    instance, we compare the Latin word <hi rend="italic">virtus,</hi> the Greek
                    word dvδρ∈ια, and the Cymric word <hi rend="italic">gwroldéb,</hi> with the
                    English word <hi rend="italic">virtue,</hi> we find a curious light thrown upon
                    the progress of human opinion. The first three all had originally the same
                    meaning—“virility ;” and all three acquired precisely the same secondary
                    signification— “courage.” The reason, of course, was that in the most primitive
                    times courage was the one great quality which above all others commanded
                    approbation. The want of a moral attribute so universally approved was in those
                    days a crime, and the <hi rend="italic">imbelles,</hi> or cowards, were, if
                    Tacitus is to be believed, subjected by the Germans to a punishment sufficiently
                    horrible. They were thrown under a hurdle and smothered in filth. But now the
                    word <hi rend="italic">virtue,</hi> which once had the special meaning of
                    strength of muscle and nerve in the man, has (if any special meaning at all)
                    that of chastity in the woman.</p>
                <p>Brave law-breakers, in past times, have not only believed themselves to be good
                    men and true, but have also had the sympathy of great numbers of their
                    fellow-countrymen. Indeed, if we regard the history of criminal legislation and
                    of crime in England, we find the ideas of the primitive tribesman steadily
                    resisting the advance of civilization, retreating very slowly from position to
                    position, and rarely yielding one without a long and desperate struggle. A most
                    prominent example of this tenacity was in the crime of forcible entry, which
                    hardly ceased to be common before the 18th century. When valour was the greatest
                    or only drtue, one clan took land by force from another, and clansman differed
                    from clansman only in the greater or less vigour and courage shown in making the
                    appropriation. Long after this half-savage condition of society, it remained a
                    maxim of the English law that there was no legal possession of land without
                    actual seisin. The law, indeed, would not allow its right hand to know that
                    which was done by its left. It forbade forcible entries in the reign of Richard
                    IL, while forcible entries were an essential part of its theory. As late even as
                    the reign of William IV. the fiction of a forcible entry continued to be one of
                    the chief implements of the conveyancer’s art. Without the</p>
                <p>“common recovery” he would have been unable to carry on the ordinary routine of
                    his business; and the basis of that fictitious action at law was that one person
                    had wrongfully disseised another of his land.</p>
                <p>The much abused Court of Star-Chamber owed its definite constitution under the
                    Tudors to a very laudable desire for the repression of forcible entries and
                    certain other kindred offences. Nor was it altogether unsuccessful in attaining
                    the object for which it was established. Those private feuds in which the
                    nobles, like the heads of tribes, had previously delighted, began to die out
                    when private armies could no longer be kept on foot under the name of retainers,
                    or supplied with uniforms under the name of liveries and tokens. Yet the fact
                    that the Star-Chamber did not entirely put an end to forcible entries is a proof
                    that even the most vigorous legislation is not all-powerful against the human
                    nature and the surrounding circumstances with which it may have to deal. Those
                    circumstances, and even that nature, may to some extent be changed, for were it
                    otherwise the British empire and British civilization could now have no
                    existence. But there is a reciprocal action and reaction of laws upon society
                    and of society upon laws. No edict or statute ever made a sudden and complete
                    alteration in the manners of a whole nation, though the growing wisdom of a
                    nation may frequently have suggested a law, and though a well-devised law may
                    have gradually fostered the growth of national wisdom. If it is true that <hi
                        rend="italic">nemo</hi><hi rend="italic">repente</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >fait</hi><hi rend="italic">turpissimus</hi> it is no less true that <hi
                        rend="italic">nemo</hi><hi rend="italic">repente</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >fait</hi><hi rend="italic">honestissimus.</hi></p>
                <p>The modern security of life and property of every description represents the
                    triumph of new ideas over old. There is or was a popular delusion that the
                    savage was noble, that while his manners were simple his nature was honest, and
                    that he abhorred all such mean arts as those commonly attributed to the huckster
                    and the trader. The truth is that his misdeeds were limited to his own
                    particular sphere of action, which was excessively small, and that if he did not
                    commit some of the offences known in our own time it was because he had not the
                    opportunity. Fraud has never increased in equal proportion with the increase of
                    trade and civilization. It infected commerce at the very beginning, and existed
                    during the darkness of the Middle Ages in every form then possible. It may and
                    it sometimes does assume new shapes as society groups itself anew, as
                    occupations and the relations of man to man are changed. But force is its near
                    relative and ally, and it flourishes in times of violence and anarchy. It made
                    itself conspicuous throughout the age of chivalry, though poets and romance
                    writers have attempted to hide it away. With infinite difficulty has civilized
                    mankind so far gained the victory over its own primitive nature as to concur,
                    with some approach to unanimity, in reprobation of the forgermonk, the
                    brigand-knight, and the man who regarded a woman as a chattel and a tempting
                    object for appropriation.</p>
                <p>It is most necessary to bear in mind the contrast between the habits or ideas of
                    one period and of another, if we wish to estimate correctly the position of the
                    criminal in modern society, or the alleged uniformity of human actions to be
                    discovered in statistics. There is, no doubt, some truth in the statement that
                    in a modern civilized country—Great Britain, for example—the statistics of one
                    year bear a very strong resemblance to the statistics of another in many
                    particulars. But a little reflection leads to the conclusion that there is
                    nothing at all marvellous in such coincidences, and that they do not prove human
                    nature to be unalterable, or circumstances to be unchangeable. They only show
                    what might have been predicted beforehand, that human beings of the same race,
                    remaining in circumstances <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n617/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0617-0584"/> approximately the same, continue to act upon
                    nearly the same motives and to display nearly the same weaknesses.</p>
                <p>The statistics of a quarter of a century, of half a century, even of a whole
                    century (if we had them complete for so long a period), could tell us but little
                    of those subtle changes in human organization which have come to pass in the
                    lapse of ages, and the sum of which has rendered life in Britain in the 19 th
                    century so different as it is from life in the 6th. Some of the earliest
                    statisticians, indeed (and their science is of very recent origin), did an
                    injustice both to themselves and to their favourite study through their own
                    enthusiasm. They were eager to claim for numbers all an:l more than all that had
                    been claimed by the Pythagoreans of old. Not content with praising the virtues
                    of numbers in general, they appeared to believe that the particular numbers of a
                    particular period would suffice for the discovery of social and political
                    principles of universal application. They found certain uniformities in an area
                    so bounded, and a time so short, as to bear to the previous existence of the
                    whole earth and its inhabitants about the same proportion that a drop of water
                    bears to the ocean; and they assumed that they had found a law or laws of a
                    range co-extensive with human existence. But this exaggeration does not impair
                    the real value of the statistical method or of some of the facts which it has
                    brought to light. It has supplied us with some generalizations which are
                    demonstrably true within certain limits, and which constitute useful elements of
                    comparison with others discoverable elsewhere. It has not established that human
                    conduct, regarded as a great whole, is absolutely invariable, but it has
                    supplied a powerful instrument for an inquiry into the conditions by which
                    variation may be determined.</p>
                <p>If, for instance, we look at the statistics of homicide and suicide in England
                    during any ten recent years we perceive that the figures of any one year very
                    little exceed or fall below the general average. Yet no inference could be more
                    erroneous than that homicide has always borne the same proportion to population
                    in England as at present, for in the reign of Edward III. there were in
                    proportion to population at least sixteen cases of homicide to every one which
                    occurs in our own time. On the other hand, according to modern statistics, the
                    number of male suicides is far greater than the number of female; and the
                    inference that the number of male suicides always has been greater is at least
                    supported by records as early as the middle of the 17th century. Again, the
                    homicides in one country may be and are far more numerous than in another, among
                    equal populations; but nowhere does there exist any exception to the rule that
                    there are more male suicides than female. Thus it is clear that any suggestion
                    of uniformity offered by statistics requires the most careful verification
                    before being accepted as even approximately true; but it is also clear that the
                    suggestion may be of the highest value in leading us to distinguish those cases
                    in which uniformity really exists from those in which uniformity is only
                    apparent.</p>
                <p>The criminal statistics of any one country and period should be carefully
                    examined by the light of history, and of any relevant details which can be
                    procured from other parts of the world. Only by the aid of the adequate
                    information thus to be acquired can criminal legislation ever be wise and
                    effective, no matter what definition of crime may be accepted by the
                    legislators. A knowledge of human nature in the widest sense, not excepting,
                    indeed, some of the principles of physiology, may give some power of
                    discriminating between the mutable and the immutable, the possible and the
                    impossible, in human affairs. Without it, well-meaning efforts to improve the
                    condition of society may be not only unsuccessful but even mischievous. Without
                    it, disappointment is apt to follow upon the failure of some apparently
                    well-conceived law to effect the purpose for which it was devised. The
                    disposition inherited from past ages can (in some fields of action and in some
                    individuals at least) as little be changed by the <hi rend="italic">fiat</hi> of
                    a Government, as the ebb and flow of the sea can be controlled by the word of a
                    king. But, nevertheless, there is good reason to believe that judicious
                    lawgivers may gradually effect a salutary change in the manners of a people.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable illustrations of uniformity in the phenomena of crime
                    is one which may be regarded also as an illustration of the influence of past
                    conditions of society upon the present. As the human embryo passes through
                    sundry stages of an inferior state of existence, so, after birth, the human
                    being is before the age of thirty more apt to fall into courses which we now
                    regard as criminal (but which the savage considered laudable) than the human
                    being of more advanced years. This, like the rule of the sexes in suicide, is a
                    rule having no exception at any time or in any country concerning which it is
                    possible to obtain information. But even here the proportions are not absolutely
                    invariable, though the general law holds universally good. From various causes,
                    of which one is the abolition of transportation, another the establishment of
                    reformatories, the criminal age has perceptibly risen in England since the year
                    1851. So also, although the general law that men are more prone to commit
                    suicide than women is altogether beyond dispute, the proportions of the sexes
                    vary considerably in suicide and in various crimes in different countries, and
                    apparently also at different times in the same country. Hence we may infer that
                    there is hardly any social change of which the human species need absolutely
                    despair, though some changes may be far more easily brought about, and may more
                    reasonably be the subject of legislation, than others. But all legislation
                    should be adapted to the possibilities of the existing generation.</p>
                <p>A very curious feature of crimes in the modern sense, though one susceptible of
                    very easy explanation, is the effect upon them of the seasons. Those which are
                    prompted by the animal passions are most common in the summer months; larceny,
                    and offences wholly or partly prompted by want, in the winter months. As might
                    also have been predicted <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> theft increases in
                    times of adversity, and various minor offences, such as drunkenness, in times of
                    prosperity. The metropolitan police returns, indeed, show a very complete
                    descending scale of drunkenness, beginning with a maximum on that day of the
                    week on which wages are paid, and ending with a minimum six days afterwards.</p>
                <p>Insanity, in its relation to crime, is a subject which might appropriately be
                    considered in connection with the tendencies inherited by each human being at
                    birth, but cannot be adequately discussed here. Suffice it to say that as youth,
                    when the instincts and passions are at their strongest, is the period at which
                    the human being is most inclined to commit crimes in general (as now
                    understood), so old age, when both the bodily powers and the intellect are
                    decaying, is the period at which one particular class of sexual offences is most
                    frequently committed; and there is good reason to suppose that persons
                    committing them in earlier years are weak-minded also. Kleptomania and homicidal
                    monomania are asserted by medical theorists to be forms of mental aberration.
                    This doctrine, however, though perhaps sufficiently well-founded, can hardly be
                    established upon the basis of a very wide induction, but only by a subtle
                    reasoning from particular instances upon which it is now impossible to
                    enter.</p>
                <p>With regard to the very complex subjects of the prevention and punishment of
                    crime, it maybe suggested that the broader the view taken by legislators the
                    more likely is <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0618-0585"/> their legislation to be successful. Crime, as
                    defined at any period, may be considered a recognized disease of the body
                    social. But as well might the physician concentrate his whole attention upon
                    each individual pustule of an eruptive fever, one after the other, as the
                    criminal legislator upon actual criminals alone. The symptoms of a malady are of
                    course not to be neglected, and it is necessary to be careful in the treatment
                    of persons who have already fallen into crime. Prison management and every form
                    of punishment are important subjects; but the preservation from guilt of the
                    great majority who are as yet guiltless is of an importance infinitely higher.
                    There is one golden rule taught by history with respect to punishments—let them
                    not afford an evil example of cruelty to the spectators. There is one great
                    preventive of crime, one great antidote to instincts inherited from the past,
                    and that is education. But the education which is effectual is not simply that
                    of the schoolroom; it is the sum of the external circumstances which can in any
                    way affect the character of any individual in the state. So far, therefore, as
                    legislation has the power of diminishing crime, it can exercise its power by
                    indirect means quite as much as by direct—indeed far more. If the crimes of the
                    English in the 19th century are different both in quantity and in kind from
                    those of the l4th, the difference, we may be quite sure, is not wholly nor even
                    principally caused by changes in the criminal law.</p>
