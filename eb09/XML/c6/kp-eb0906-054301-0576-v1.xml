                <p><label type="entry">CRAMP</label>, a painful spasmodic contraction of muscles,
                    most frequently occurring in the limbs, but also apt to affect certain internal
                    organs. This disorder belongs to the class of diseases known as local spasms, of
                    which other varieties exist in such affections as spasmodic asthma and colic.
                    The cause of these painful seizures resides in the nervous system, and operates
                    either directly from the great nerve centres, or, as is generally the case,
                    indirectly by reflex action, as, for example, when attacks are brought on by
                    some derangement of the digestive organs.</p>
                <p>In its most common form, that of cramp in the limbs, this disorder comes on
                    suddenly, often during sleep, the patient being aroused by an agonizing feeling
                    of pain in the calf of the leg or back of the thigh, accompanied in many
                    instances with a sensation of sickness or faintness from the intensity of the
                    suffering. During the paroxysm the muscular fibres affected can often be felt
                    gathered up into a hard knot. The attack in general lasts but a few seconds, and
                    then suddenly departs, the spasmodic contraction of the muscles ceasing
                    entirely, or, on the other hand, relief may come more gradually during a period
                    of minutes or even hours. A liability to cramp is often associated with a
                    rheumatic or gouty tendency, but occasional attacks are common enough apart from
                    this, and are often induced by some peculiar posture which a limb has assumed
                    during sleep. Exposure of the limbs to cold will also bring on cramp, and to
                    this is probably to be ascribed its frequent occurrence in swimmers. Cramp of
                    the extremities is also well known as one of the most distressing accompaniments
                    of cholera. It is likewise of frequent occurrence in the process of parturition,
                    just before delivery.</p>
                <p>This painful disorder can be greatly relieved and often entirely removed by
                    firmly grasping or briskly rubbing the affected part with the hand, or by
                    anything which makes an impression on the nerves, such as warm applications.
                    Even a sudden and vigorous movement of the limb will often succeed in
                    terminating the attack.</p>
                <p>What is termed cramp of the stomach, or gastralgia, usually occurs as a symptom
                    in connection with some form of gastric disorder, such as aggravated dyspepsia,
                    or actual organic disease of the mucous membrane of the stomach, and must be
                    dealt with in reference to those particular ailments.</p>
                <p>The disease known as <hi rend="italic">Writer’s Cramp,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Scrivener's Palsy,</hi> is a spasm which affects certain muscles when
                    engaged in the performance of acts, the result of education and long usage, and
                    which does not occur when the same muscles are employed in acts of a different
                    kind. This disorder owes its name to the relative frequency with which it is met
                    with in persons who write much, although it is by no means confined to them, but
                    is liable to occur in individuals of almost any handicraft. It has been termed
                    by Dr Duchenne <hi rend="italic">Functional Spasm.</hi></p>
                <p>The symptoms are in the first instance a gradually increasing difficulty
                    experienced in conducting the movements required for executing the work in hand.
                    Taking, for example, the case of writers, there is a feeling that the pen cannot
                    be moved with the same freedom as before, and the Jιandwriting is more or less
                    altered in consequence. At an early stage of the disease the difficulty may be
                    to a large extent overcome by persevering efforts, but ultimately, when the
                    attempt is persisted in, the muscles of the fingers and occasionally also those
                    of the forearm, are seized with spasm or cramp, so that the act of writing is
                    rendered impossible. Sometimes the fingers instead of being cramped move in a
                    disorderly manner and the pen cannot be grasped, while in other rare instances a
                    kind of paralysis affects the muscles of the fingers, and they are powerless to
                    make the movements necessary for holding the pen. It is to be noted that it is
                    only in the act of writing that these phenomena present themselves, and that for
                    all other movements the fingers and arms possess their natural power. The same
                    symptoms are observed and the same remarks apply <hi rend="italic"
                        >mutatis</hi><hi rend="italic">mutandis</hi> in the case of musicians,
                    artists, compositors, seamstresses, tailors, and many mechanics in whom this
                    affection may occur. Indeed, although actually a rare disease, no muscle or
                    group of muscles in the body which is specially called into action in any
                    particular occupation is exempt from liability to this functional spasm. Hence
                    the cause has been ascribed to over-use of the parts concerned, although this is
                    regarded as doubtful by many high authorities, since cases have been observed
                    where there had been no excessive strain upon the function of the affected
                    muscles, while again in persons who pursue their special occupation, even to the
                    utmost possible amount of fatigue, the symptoms of this disorder are exceedingly
                    rare. It is, how ever, difficult to account for the phenomena on any other
                    theory, and at all events the complaint is greatly aggravated by over-exertion
                    of the parts.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of this complaint the only effectual remedy is absolute
                    cessation from the work with which the attack is associated. It is sometimes
                    recommended that the opposite hand or ]imb be used so as to afford the affected
                    part entire rest, but this is generally followed with the extension of the
                    disease to that locality also. Peculiar forms of penholder and other mechanical
                    contrivances have been suggested so as to enable the occupation to be carried
                    on, but they do not afford any relief to the disease, for the cure of which the
                    only means that can be relied on is entire rest. (J θ <hi rend="smallcaps"
