                    America. His father was a brewer,—a man of shrewd business qualities, and of a
                    benevolent disposition, and a strict observer of Calvinistic practices; and his
                    children—nine daughters and eight sons—-were placed under a rigid system of
                    religious instruction. In a fragment of autobiography written by Combe shortly
                    before his death, he complains of the irksomeness of the Sunday observances and
                    tasks imposed on his father’s household. His frame was feeble; the Sunday tasks
                    followed weeks of severe mental labour at school, and, so far from cultivating
                    in him a religious spirit, they rendered the church, Sunday, and the Catechism
                    sources of weariness and terror to him. His character was earnest and thoughtful
                    even as a child; and feelings of despondency thus engendered were intensified by
                    the weakness of his constitution. His mind became largely occupied with the
                    current theological theories and, in time, with doubts of their truth. He
                    attended the High School for five years, and then proceeded to the university.
                    In 1804 he entered a lawyer’s office as an apprentice, and applied himself
                    diligently to the acquirement of the details of his profession. At the same time
                    he assisted his younger brothers and sisters in their studies, and read
                    philosophy, history, and general literature; philosophical works, however, had
                    most attraction for him. In 1812 he obtained his commission as writer to the
                    signet, and, soon after, that of notary public. His shrewdness and
                    conscientiousness in dealing with clients speedily obtained for him a degree of
                    practice which exceeded his expectations. Meanwhile, in private, he had vague
                    yearnings to accomplish something which might benefit mankind. In 1815 the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> contained an article on Gall and Spurzheim’s
                    system of <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> ' craniology,” which the reviewer
                    denounced as “a piece of thorough quackery from beginning to end.” Combe laughed
                    like others at the absurdities of this so-called pew theory of the brain, and
                    thought that it must be finally exploded after such an exposure; and when Dr
                    Spurzheim delivered lectures in Edinburgh, in refutation of the statements of
                    his critic, Combe considered the subject unworthy of serious attention. He was,
                    however, invited to a friend’s house where he saw Spurzheim dissect the brain,
                    and he was so far impressed by the demonstration that he attended the second
                    course of lectures. Proceeding tö investigate the subject for himself, he became
                    satisfied, after two years of study and observation, that the fundamental
                    principles of phrenology were true—namely “that the brain is the organ of mind;
                    that the brain is an aggregate of several parts, each subserving a distinct
                    mental faculty; and that the size of the cerebral organ is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >caeteris paribus,</hi> an index of power or energy of function.” He had moved
                    slowly at first; he now pursued his investigations with enthusiasm. He compared
                    the known characteristics of friends with their phrenological developments; he
                    studied anatomy; he visited schools, prisons, and large manufactories; and he
                    became more and more satisfied that he was approaching a truth which would be of
                    great value to humanity. He requested his brother Dr Andrew Combe— who was at
                    that time a medical student in Paris—to give particular attention to the
                    dissection of the brain, in order to be prepared to support or to condemn the
                    new theories on anatomical principles. In 1817 his first essay on phrenology was
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Scots Magazine;</hi> and a series of papers
                    on the same subject appeared soon afterwards in <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">Essays on Phrenology.</hi> His friends became alarmed by his
                    public advocacy of a cause which was the laughing-stock of all men of
                    reputation, and warned him that it would be the ruin of his professional
                    prospects; He was not diverted from his course, and he had the satisfaction of
                    finding his business increase; for the many who laughed at his hobby or
                    regretted it still recognized his assiduity in attending to the affairs of his
                    clients. The <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> gave an extraordinary impetus to the
                    new science; friends and foes became numerous; a phrenological society was
                    founded; the <hi rend="italic">Phrenological Journal</hi> was established, and
                    was published quarterly for twenty years; a volume of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phrenological Transactions</hi> was issued; and Combe’s first work developed
                    into <hi rend="italic">A System of Phrenology</hi> in two large volumes, of
                    which five editions have been published. By his lectures and writings he
                    attracted public attention to the subject on the Continent and in America, as
                    well as at home; and a long discussion with Sir William Hamilton in 1827-28
                    excited general interest.</p>
                <p>The publication of his most popular work, <hi rend="italic">The Constitution of
                    Man,</hi> was determined upon after serious deliberation. He had circulated
                    private copies amongst his friends, several of whom regarded the principles of
                    the essay as dangerous to society and urged him to suppress it. The principle on
                    which he based his argument was that all the laws of nature were in harmony with
                    each other, and that man would best fulfil God’s will, and attain the greatest
                    happiness for himself, by discovering those laws and obeying them. He saw
                    nothing irreligious in this principle; he believed that on the contrary it
                    supplied a philosophic basis to religion. When the book was published in 1828,
                    he was charged by the church party with being a materialist and an atheist; but,
                    on the other hand, he received from near and distant quarters grateful thanks
                    for the new light his work had shed upon religion, and for the satisfaction it
                    afforded to doubting minds. As one indication of the estimation which the work
                    obtained, it is notable that amongst many editions in America there was one for
                    the blind. From this date the current of Combe’s public life broadened; he
                    became strong in his own convictions of the truth, and consequently more
                    resolute in carrying them to practical issues. He might hesitate at
                    first,.doubting himself; but once satisfied that he was right, he never
                    faltered. He saw everything by the light of phrenology, and the light rendered
                    him patient of the opposition of others, and guided him to the most earnest
                    efforts to benefit his fellow-creatures, morally and socially. He gave time,
                    labour, and money to help forward the education of the poorer classes; he
                    established the first infant school in Edinburgh under the direction of Mr
                    Wilderspin; and he originated a series of evening lectures on chemistry,
                    physiology, history, and moral philosophy— the lectures on the latter subject
                    being delivered by himself. He studied the criminal classes, and tried to solve
                    the problem how to reform as well as to punish them; and he strove to introduce
                    into lunatic asylums a humane system of treatment. In 1836 he offered himself as
                    a candidate for the chair of logic in the Edinburgh University, and the
                    testimonials submitted on his behalf on that occasion show that he was held in
                    high esteem by men of very opposite opinions. As he had expected, he was
                    rejected by the town council in favour of Sir William Hamilton.</p>
                <p>Having received numerous invitations to visit America, he proceeded thither in
                    1838, and about two years were occupied in lecturing in the principal States on
                    phrenology, education, and the treatment of the criminal classes. On his return
                    in 1840 he published his <hi rend="italic">Moral Philosophy,</hi> and iu the
                    following year his <hi rend="italic">Notes on the United States of North</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">America.</hi> In 1842 he delivered, in German, a course of
                    twenty-two lectures in the university of Heidelberg—being the first Englishman
                    who had ventured to lecture there in the national language. But the effort
                    resulted in an illness which prostrated him for some time. He continued to
                    travel much on the Continent—inquiring into the management of schools, prisons,
                    and asylums. The commercial crisis of 1855 elicited his remarkable pamphlet on
                    <hi rend="italic">The Currency Question.</hi> The culmination of the religious
                    thought and experience of his life is contained in his work <hi rend="italic">On
                    the Relation between Science and Religion,</hi> first publicly issued in 1857,
                    and now in its fifth edition. Writing pamphlets, contributing to periodicals,
                    lecturing, and correcting the new editions of his works rendered his days busy
                    to the last. He was engaged in revising the ninth edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Constitution of Man</hi> when he died at Moor Park, Farnham, 14th
                    August 1858. He had married in 1833 Cecilia Siddons, a daughter of the great
                    actress. She had been the companion of all his travels, and she was with him at
                    the end. Apart from his position as a phrenologist he earned distinction by his
                    efforts on behalf of education, and by his courage in promulgating certain
                    philosophic truths, which at the time were regarded as subversive of everything
                    good, but are now accepted so entirely as matters of course that his share in
                    obtaining recognition for them is apt to be forgotten. (c. G.)</p>
