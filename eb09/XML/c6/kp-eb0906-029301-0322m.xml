                    state of the market or the need and credit of the Government, to offer a fixed
                    rate of interest, usually three or three and a half per cent., and as the market
                    required to give the lenders an advantage in the principal funded. Thus
                    subscribers of £100 would sometimes receive £150 of three percent, stock. In
                    1815, at the close of the French wars, a large loan was raised at as much as
                    £174 three per cent, and £10 four per cent, stock for £100. Thelow rate of
                    interest was thus purely nominal, while the principal of the debt was increased
                    beyond all due proportion. This practice began in the reign of George IL, when
                    some portions of the debt on which the interest had been successfully reduced
                    were consolidated into three per cent, annuities, and consols, as the annuities
                    were called, and other stocks of nominally low interest, rapidly increased under
                    the same practice during the great wars. In times of peace, when the rate of
                    money has enabled portions of the debt at a higher interest to be commuted into
                    stock of lower interest, it has usually been into consols that the conversion
                    has been effected. Temporary deficits of the revenue have been covered by an
                    issue of consols; exchequer bills when funded have taken the same form, though
                    not constantly or exclusively; and some loans of the Government in recent times
                    for special purposes, such as the relief of the Irish famine and the expenditure
                    in the Crimean war, have been wholly or partly raised in consols. The
                    consequence has been to give this stock a pre-eminence in the amount of the
                    funded debt. It appears from a recent parliamentary return than of £773,313,229
                    of funded debt of the United Kingdom £398,147,075 consisted of consols,
                    £107,227,854 of three percent, reduced annuities, and £225,256,099 of new
                    threes. The funds of the savings’ banks have been applied to the absorption of
                    reduced annuities and new threes in Liger proportion than of consols. The
                    characteristics of this large portion of the debt, though it would seem almost
                    indistinguishable from the three per cent, reduced, which originated about the
                    same period as the consolidated threes, are that the inteιest has never varied;
                    no attempt has been made to convert it to a lower interest or into another form
                    of stock; and not only from its larger amount than other stock is it most
                    convenient to dealers, but from the great number and variety of its holders it
                    is believed to express with the greatest nicety the state of monetary affairs.
                    The price of consols, however, does not in ordinary times vary much. It has a
                    tendency, indeed, to rise when all other securities are most shaken. In periods
                    of panic and extreme pressure for money, it has gone down for a few days between
                    80 and 90; its most customary range may be said to be 95 to 97; and it has
                    occasionally touched par. The legal provisions erecting consols are found in
                    several clauses of 25 George II. c. 27, and the regulations for their redemption
                    in section 24 of the same Act.</p>
