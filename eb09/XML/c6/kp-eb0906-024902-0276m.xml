                    philosophers, but afterwards allowed the intimacy to die out. He was of a
                    serious and dignified character, and devoted himself to a life of laborious
                    study. Like Comte and Mill, he acknowledges himself to have been largely
                    indebted to a lady for his philosophical inspiration. While still young he was
                    appointed preceptor to the duke of Parma, grandson of Louis XV., for whose
                    instruction a large number of his works were composed. He was chosen by the
                    French Academy of Sciences to succeed the Abbé d’Olivet in 1768, but after
                    delivering a discourse on that occasion he never again appeared at the meetings.
                    He lived in retirement on his estate of Flux, near Beaugency, till his death on
                    3d August 1780.</p>
                <p>Condillac’s philosophical opinions are contained mainly in <hi rend="italic"

                    less distinctly on all the topics which are discussed in the others. But the
                    doctrines it contains receive a fuller and more mature statement elsewhere, and
                    them are many important departures from them in the later works.</p>
                <p>Condillac’s philosophical writings may be studied from three points of view. Like
                    Locke, he begins with a polemic against innate ideas and abstract systems. This·
                    takes up a large part of the <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine</hi> and almost the whole of the <hi

                    and the <hi rend="italic">Art</hi><hi rend="italic">de Raisonner</hi> he
                    expounds and illustrates the analytic method, which he regards as the only true
                    method of science, and which is further illustrated in <hi rend="italic">La
                    Langue</hi><hi rend="italic">des Calculs. L’Art de Penser</hi> consists largely
                    of quotations from the <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >l'Origine.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Sensations,</hi> Condillac applies his analytic method to the solution of the
                    psychological problem of the origin of our ideas and the formation of the mental
                    faculties. It cannot be said that he strictly confines himself to the
                    questions-here assigned to his different works. His inveterate antipathy to
                    innate ideas and abstract systems, his favour for analysis, and his peculiar
                    psychological doctrines appear more or less in them all.</p>
                <p>Condillac’s main attacks are directed against the innate ideas of Descartes, Μ al
                    eb ran che’s theory of the mental faculties, the monadology of Leibnitz, and the
                    first part of Spinoza’s <hi rend="italic">Ethiſc.</hi> He thinks that innate
                    ideas were assumed because men had not sagacity and penetration enough to go
                    back to the origin of ideas and trace their genesis, and he finds the
                    consequences of the system to be the multiplication of abstract principles, and
                    a pretence of accounting for everything by the use of abstract terms.
                    Malebranche is justly censured for giving comparisons-instead of reasons in his
                    explanation of understanding and will. In criticizing the monadology of
                    Leibnitz, Condillac exaggerates the vagueness and inadequacy of the ideas
                    furnished by the reason, and the clearness of those of the senses. He cannot
                    comprehend how each monad represents the universe in virtue of its relations
                    toit. But may there not be a sense in which the ultimate particular in the
                    infinitude of its relations is a mirror of the universe? Condillac regarded
                    Spinozism as the best example of an abstract system, and criticized in detail
                    the first part of the <hi rend="italic">Ethik,</hi> in order to show that
                    Spinoza failed both as to clearness of ideas and precision in the use of
                    signs—two essential conditions of the geometrical method which he adopted.
                    Condillac divides the various philosophical systems into three classes :—(1)
                    abstract systems which rest only on abstract principles; (2) hypotheses, or
                    systems grounded on mere suppositions; (3)one true system, that of Locke, which
                    is evolved from the facts of experience. The first he treats with unmitigated
                    scorn; the second he admits under limitations; the third alone he regards as the
                    true method of philosophy.</p>
                <p>An act of reasoning, according to Condillac, consists in detecting a judgment
                    which is implicitly contained in another. Sometimes, to go from the known to the
                    unknown, it is necessary to pass through a series of intermediate judgments,
                    each of which is contained in the one preceding. For example, the judgment that
                    mercury will risa to a certain height in the barometer is contained implicitly
                    in the judgment that air has weight; but we require a seriea of intermediate
                    judgments to see that the former is a consequence of the latter. The evidential
                    force of a reasoning: thus consists in the identity between the judgments of
                    which it consists. They are the same; only the expression changes. Such a
                    principle could not be made to cover all the varieties of reasoning. Accordingly
                    Condillac tries to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n277/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0277-0250"/> reduce them all to the mathematical form. To
                    reason is to calculate, and to calculate is to reason; aud reasoning, like
                    calculation, comes to be a merely mechanical operation. Condillac rejects the
                    common explanation of reasoning, that it is a comparison of two terms with a
                    common third to find their relation to each other. He sees no need for a middle
                    term. The force of the demonstration, he thinks, lies in the identity of the two
                    extremes, which is made evident by decomposing them. Of the syllogism he says
                    that it makes reasoning consist in the form of expression rather than in the
                    development of the ideas, and that most of its rules have been framed with a
                    view to concluding from the genus to the species, whereas thought sets out from
                    particulars.</p>
                <p>Regarding the criterion of truth, he attacks the Cartesian test of truth, and
                    proposes instead of it his own criterion of identity. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic">Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine des
                    Connaissances</hi> he brings two objections against Descartes :—(1) the methodic
                    doubt is insufficient and even useless, because, while calling our ideas in
                    question, it leaves them in all their indeterminateness; (2) it is
                    impracticable, for we cannot doubt about the relations which exist between
                    familiar and determinate ideas like those of numbers. Of the Cartesian criterion
                    of truth, “all that is contained in the clear and distinct idea of a thing may
                    be affirmed of it with truth,” Condillac says that it is both useless and
                    dangerous, and should not have been extended to cases different from the one
                    which gave it birth. For Condillac the sign of truth is identity. The evidence
                    of a proposition is in the identity of the two terms. The evidence of a
                    reasoning is in the identity of the successive propositions. No definition,
                    however, is given of identity. It is said to be recognized when a proposition
                    can be expressed in terms equivalent to these,—“the same is the same.” But
                    •Condillac draws a distinction between identical propositions that are frivolous
                    and those which are instructive, and explains the latter to be those in which
                    the terms are identical in thought, but different in expression. Condillac held
                    that three kinds of evidence are needed to arrive at certainty—the evidence of
                    fact, the evidence of feeling, and the evidence of reason. The evidence of fact
                    informs us of the relations which bodies have to us; it can have no other
                    object. The evidence of feeling enables us to distinguish what passes in us, the
                    modes or states of the mind. Some good remarks are made in chapter iii., part
                    i., of <hi rend="italic">EArt</hi><hi rend="italic">de Penser,</hi> on the
                    attentive observation of consciousness. The evidence of reason is discussed in
                    the first three chapters of the first part of <hi rend="italic">If Art</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Raisonner.</hi> There Condillac merely formulates the principle
                    of identity, and cites as examples the geometrical theorems which his pupil will
                    require, that he may understand the rest of the work.</p>
                <p>Condillac was of opinion that one method of analysis is common to all the
                    sciences. Our cognitions ought to form a system in which all is strictly
                    connected together. Every series of facts should be reduced to an initial fact,
                    of which the others are only transformations. Identity is a rule of method as
                    well as a criterion of certainty; and analogy completes the primary lessons
                    which are given us by nature. Condillac takes as his model the method of
                    mathematics, and reiterates through his logical writings that we must take
                    nature for our guide. On the relation of analysis to language he held that there
                    is an innate language, although there are no innate ideas. This language
                    produces a kind of analysis, since it is necessary for the communication of our
                    ideas to analyze and express in succession what is simultaneous in thought.
                    Analysis then reacts on language and improves it. Finally, perfection of
                    language leads to perfection of analysis, and science is only a <hi
                    rend="italic">langue</hi><hi rend="italic">bien faite.</hi></p>
                <p>The method of invention is discussed chiefly in the <hi rend="italic">Essai
                    sur</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine des Connaissances</hi>
                    and in the <hi rend="italic">Langue des Calculs.</hi> In the former, Condillac
                    bids us take the simple ideas furnished by sensation and reflection, form
                    different collections of them, which in their turn will produce others, aud give
                    distinct names to these different collections. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Langue</hi><hi rend="italic">des Calculs</hi> the idea of analogy is
                    .developed. This is not the analogy set forth in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Art</hi><hi rend="italic">de Raisonner,</hi> which consists only in forming
                    more or less probable conjectures about the unknown from the known. The analogy
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Logique</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Langue
                    des</hi><hi rend="italic">Calculs</hi> is that which creates and regulates
                    languages, which causes us to invent different systems of signs and submit them
                    to uniform rules.</p>
                <p>Reasoning cannot have the purely subjective character which Condillac’s theory
                    assigns to it. It takes its departure from the idea, which is objective, and
                    therefore establishes a real relation between the mind and its object. On the
                    question of the need for a middle term it is not enough to decompose the two
                    ideas. The two decompositions must meet at a point, and that is the middle term.
                    Laromiguière preserves the intermediate ideas, which he thinks are found by
                    analysis of the extremes. So they are. But it has been urged that there is a
                    twofold analysis—of the species into its genera and of the genus into its
                    species —whereby the middle term is found. Condillac is inconsistent with
                    himself in his criticism of Descartes. His first objection to the methodic doubt
                    is based on the opinion that all our errors proceed from the indeterminate
                    character of language, and that the use of definite signs is the only security
                    against error. But he believes that analysis makes language; and the methodic
                    doubt is a kind of analysis, for it remounts to the primary truths. His second
                    objection, that we cannot doubt about mathematical relations, is invalidated by
                    his own statement that mathematics are only part of metaphysics. Condillac is
                    right in saying that the Cartesian criterion of truth lacks a theory of ideas
                    and of their origin. But it is not to be condemned as useless because it is
                    incomplete. Condillac was led away by the supposed need for a sign whereby to
                    recognize truth. As Hegel would have put it, he refused to go into the water
                    until he could swim. But it would be as difficult to determine the value of the
                    sign as that of the truth itself. Some such criterion as identity is the only
                    resource of empiricism. But if the notion of identity is derived from
                    experience, it cannot give certainty. If, that it may serve as the basis of
                    logic, it is regarded as necessary, then empiricism cannot reconcile it with its
                    psychology. Laromiguière tries to get over the difficulty of accounting for
                    progress in a system based on the notion of identity, by drawing a distinction
                    between partial identity and total identity, and saying that the former alone
                    should be admitted. But what is partial identity 1 Condillac himself takes
                    refuge in extreme idealism. Truth, he says, considered in itself and in the
                    divine intelligence, is one and identical. But he had himself laid down the rule
                    to limit our consideration to the condition of human knowledge, and of course he
                    had no idea of developing thought as such from its primal unit by a dialectic
                    process after the manner of Hegel. As to the three kinds of evidence, Condillac
                    in reality reduces the evidence of fact to that of feeling aud that of reason.
                    His numerous contradictions are largely due to his attempts to defend the
                    authority of the senses, while he accepts the idealistic theory of external
                    perception. The objections to identity as a criterion of truth apply as well to
                    Condillac’s statement of the evidence of reason. And if the three kinds of
                    evidence are inadequate taken separately, they cannot suffice when combined.
                    Condillac rightly insisted that there is one fundamental method for all the
                    sciences; but he nowhere <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n278/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0278-0251"/> reconciles this unity of method with the variety
                    of form which it assumes as applied to different objects. By demanding at the
                    outset the initial fact, of which all the others are to be shown to be
                    transformations, he virtually quits the safe road of experience. He errs, too,
                    in thinking that the method of mathematics is applicable to all the sciences.
                    His oft-repeated advice to follow nature would have been advantageously
                    accompanied by a clearer explanation of what nature is. One thing which he
                    certainly excludes from it is the mind viewed as the seat of intellectual
                    principles. Condillac’s analysis combines what are generally regarded as the two
                    distinct processes of analysis and synthesis. Synthesis he conceives to be that
                    method which starts from abstract principles, and accordingly he treats it with
                    supreme disdain. But while banishing the name he retains the thing, and insists
                    that no analysis is complete without a process of recomposition.</p>
                <p>The logic of Condillac finds its most important application in psychology. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">0rigine</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Connaissances</hi> he starts from sensation as the primitive fact, and seeks to
                    show that all the ideas and operations of the mind are only transformations of
                    it. He neglected, however, to make sure of his way back to the primitive fact of
                    sensation, before using it as his starting point. Under the influence of Locke,
                    he simply assumed it, and applied his ingenuity to derive from it all the ideas
                    and operations of the mind. Throughout the <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine</hi> he confounds sensation with
                    perception in a way that vitiates his whole argument. At the outset he affirms
                    that sensations are ideas, because representative of objects. It is difficult to
                    understand in what sense he uses such language. For a long time it was supposed
                    that he regarded the pure sensation as the primary element of consciousness; but
                    his more recent followers have adopted a different interpretation. They try to
                    make out that his meaning was that in the simplest state of consciousness the
                    whole mind is to be found, equipped with all its so-called faculties. Condillac
                    found an opinion prevailing that the mind is partitioned off, as it were, into a
                    variety of different faculties, each having its separate function, which it
                    discharges independently of the others. It was against this opinion, they say,
                    that he contended. He maintained that the mind is not a congeries of faculties,
                    but is one and indivisible, and appears in all its forms of activity in the
                    simplest state of consciousness. This opinion is difficult to reconcile with his
                    avowed purpose, to which he adheres throughout all his psychological treatises,
                    of tracing the genesis of the faculties; for sensation would then not be a
                    primitive fact, from which all the later furniture of the mind is derived by a
                    process of transformation. There would, in fact, be no generation of the
                    faculties, for all would be given in the rudimentary consciousness, and any
                    reasoned account of their relations to each other would need to refer to
                    something anterior to the individual consciousness. Probably the more correct
                    view to take of Condillac’s psychology is that when he tried to deal with
                    sensation, pure and simple, he found it impossible to do so, and was compelled
                    to invest the mere sensation with all the ideas of reason, that it might do duty
                    in his system. No doubt either interpretation would save Condillac’s consistency
                    with his great principle of identity. The sameness of the elementary sensation
                    with the higher faculties and ideas is secured, whether the faculty is degraded
                    to the level of the sensation, or the sensation is raised to the level of the
                    faculty. And there is much in Condillac to countenance either view. But it is
                    probable that if he had been willing to concede that the mind is all in the
                    primary sensation, in the sense in which his later followers understand him, he
                    would have felt the necessity of exhibiting the relations of the different
                    mental onerations, which in such case would be moments of the sensation,
                    anterior to the sensation, instead of subsequent to it, in terms of the
                    relations of different sensations to each other. The opening sentences of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sensations</hi> show that
                    Condillac was aware of the difficulties attending the study of our rudimentary
                    consciousness on the presuppositions of sensationalism. If the mind at birth was
                    a <hi rend="italic">tabula rasa,</hi> there can be no traces left of our primary
                    state. It is in vain therefore to interrogate our consciousness to learn what it
                    was then. To show how all proceeds from sensation, we must consider our senses
                    separately. As Condillac could not do this by examining his own consciousness,
                    he devised the experiment of the statue. It is supposed to be possessed of a
                    mind destitute at first of every sort of ideas, and only to have the use of its
                    senses at the pleasure of the experimenter, who opens them at his choice to
                    their appropriate impressions. A beginning is made with the sense of smell,
                    because it seems to contribute least to our knowledge. The other senses are
                    successively experimented on, singly and in groups, and at last the statue is
                    found to have become an animal able to preserve itself. Condillac claims to have
                    stripped man for the first time of all his habits. Feeling is observed at its
                    birth, and proof is given of how we acquire the use of our faculties. The
                    principle of their development is found in the various degrees of pleasure and
                    pain attaching to our sensations; for none of them are indifferent absolutely.
                    The contrast between pleasure and pain impels us to court some sensations and
                    flee others. A sense of need is produced by the want of an object judged
                    necessary for happiness. Needs beget desires; old needs repeated and new ones
                    formed are the ground of the development of our knowledge and our faculties. The
                    outcome of Condillac’s psychology is given in briefest form in chapters vii. and
                    viii. of the <hi rend="italic">Logique.</hi> Laromiguière corrected Condillac by
                    substituting attention for sensation as the principle of the active half of the
                    mental phenomena. Cousin pointed out that attention is a voluntary act. He
                    showed the essential difference between desire and will, as also between
                    sensation and desire, and remarked that the organic impression must not be
                    confounded with the sensation. If the sensation is the condition of the exercise
                    of the faculties, still it is not the principle of any.</p>
                <p>Condillac defines personality to be a collection of sensations plus the ability
                    to say “me.” But this plus is of vast importance. How comes it that this
                    particular collection of sensations can say “me <hi rend="italic">ì”</hi>
                    Because, answers Condillac, it is a collection of present and remembered
                    sensations. But whether does the statue say “me” because it can remember its
                    sensations, or remember its sensations because it can say “me ”î Is not all that
                    is involved in saying me already involved in memory, so that his answer merely
                    repeats the fact which it professes to explain î Condillac thought so in his
                    first stage, as he then found the feeling of one’s own existence to be an
                    essential element of reminiscence. Then, indeed, reminiscence was distinguished
                    by him from memory, but only in an artificial w ay. A collection of sensations
                    is a less correct account of personality than the synthetic unity of Kant. What
                    renders the collection possible! For Condillac its essential condition, a
                    unifying principle, is wanting. That cannot be found in sensation. It is a
                    condition of the ordering of sensations, and is the all-important unit out of
                    which a true philosophy of spirit must grow. Sensations cannot give an answer to
                    the question what constitutes experience. Even Mill had to confess that it must
                    at least be sensations which have the strange property of turning back upon
                    themselves. Condillac has the very same phrase, “As long as the statue changes
                    not, it exists without any return upon itself.” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n279/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0279-0252"/> Thus, in their own inarticulate way, the
                    sensationalists are compelled, to postulate the synthetic unity of Kant. And
                    just as it is present in the first fibre of personality, the first flash of
                    self-consciousness, its various modes of operation are no less essentially
                    present throughout all the subsequent fabric of experience, and in the full
                    sunlight of conscious life. To trace and treat them is the work of philosophy
                    proper, which may be briefly distinguished from the natural sciences as that
                    which deals with the universal aspect of thought, while they deal with the
                    particular. Both are necessary factors of concrete thought. Experience will
                    never spring out of categories alone, nor will it arise out of particulars
                    alone. The method of observation proper to the natural sciences may lead us to
                    the border ground of the two territories, but for exploring the region of the
                    universals there is needed a keener vision and a deeper principle. It is the
                    fault of Condillac, as of all the sensationalists, that he does not apply the
                    analytic method faithfully enough to bring himself consciously face to face with
                    the universal factor of experience. It is interesting to note in him the
                    progress towards a more thorough use of analysis. In the <hi rend="italic">Essai
                    sur</hi><hi rend="italic">V0rigine</hi> he was of opinion that any single
                    sensation was an idea, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> representative of external
                    entities, and that a single sense is adequate to produce an experience more
                    limited in degree, but the same in kind as ours. So he maintained against Locke
                    and Berkeley that we can know through sight alone the magnitudes, distances, and
                    situations of objects. His position then much resembled that of the so-called
                    commonsense philosophers. To him an external world was as necessarily present in
                    senseas to them; and his criticism of Spinoza, that the assumption in his
                    definitions of what he meant to prove by means of them made his work easy, may
                    very aptly be applied to the <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >V0rigine.</hi> If a complete experience is given in a single sensation, it will
                    be easy to find it in a succession of them. But the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sensations</hi> marks an advance upon these
                    views. Now a sensation is not <hi rend="italic">perse</hi> an idea. A stricter
                    use of analysis detects other elements in ideas. Condillac saw from the first
                    that a sensation to be an idea must be representative of something out of the
                    present consciousness. Now he sees that, to be so, it must either exist in the
                    memory or be modified by judgments. That is to say, it must be the sensation of
                    a series of sensations, which has the marvellous power of returning upon itself;
                    or, in more intelligible language, it must be held in the grasp of the synthetic
                    unity of thought. In the <hi rend="italic">Origine</hi> Condillac really
                    develops experience out of perceptions, or sensations regarded as synonymous
                    with ideas. In the <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Sensations</hi> he has come to know that a sensation as such is not an idea. But
                    although he still professes to develop all the mental operations out of
                    sensation, he is as far as ever from bridging over the gap between sensations
                    and ideas, or even from acknowledging in his actual procedure the existence of
                    such a gap at all.</p>
                <p>When Condillac, largely owing, as he tells us to the influence of Mlle Ferrand,
                    abandoned the position of the <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine,</hi> that by sight alone we can judge of the
                    magnitudes, distances, &lt;fcc., of objects he seems to have been in unstable
                    equilibrium between sensationalism and a very different mode of philosophizing.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sensations</hi> he
                    shows how these judgments are founded not upon the direct intimations of sight,
                    but upon an association that haî sprung up between the sensations which we owe
                    to different senses. The mind, he sees clearly, has come to deal with relations
                    among sensations. He even goes the length of saying that the idea of
                    impenetrability cannot be a sensation, but is a judgment founded on sensation.
                    He was then on the verge of intellect proper, and within sight of something
                    deeper than sensation. The intelligible order of things is dimly seen by him to
                    be the reality for us, and he tries hard, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sensations,</hi> to show how we become aware
                    of it through the interaction of the different senses. But just then he falls
                    back again into sensationalism. He loses hold of judgment as the all-important
                    element, and conceives the senses in some strange way to acquire a habit of
                    immediately informing us of what a moment before he saw it needed an act of
                    judgment to reach. For an instant he had a glimpse of thought as constitutive of
                    experience. But forthwith the vision passes, and its place is taken by a
                    mysterious and totally unintelligible habit or instinct of sense. Accordingly,
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Art</hi><hi rend="italic">de Penser,</hi> he is back
                    again to the gross statements of the <hi rend="italic">Origine,</hi> that we may
                    find in sensation the ideas of extension and figure, and perceive as distinctly
                    and clearly that they do not belong to us, or to what in us is the subject of
                    thought, but to something outside of us.</p>
                <p>It is not difficult to see how his theory of reason sprang out of his theory of
                    the origin of knowledge, for of course his. psychology was thought out before
                    his logic. If all is sensation, and we can never get beyond sensation, then our
                    advancing knowledge must be only a ringing of the changes upon the primary
                    sensation. The latest results will be identical in the fullest sense with the
                    first beginnings, and all science will be reduced to a development of language,
                    a series of identical expressions, to which we are driven by the limitation of
                    our faculties preventing us from seeing the identity between remote terms. Thus,
                    in <hi rend="italic">L</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Art</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Raisonner,</hi> he shows at length that the demonstration of the rule for
                    finding the area of a triangle is necessitated by our inability to see the
                    identity between the idea we have of “measure” and that we have of the product
                    of the height of the triangle by half the base. Similarly, the argument in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sensations</hi> is
                    necessitated by our inability to see the essential identity between sensation
                    and thought. Every successive proposition is identical in idea with the
                    preceding one, and differs from it only in expression. There is no advance or
                    development in matter. In his psychology it is the same sensation throughout. In
                    his theory of reasoning it is always the same idea throughout. The difference is
                    merely in form, and it is not difficult to see how, in a philosophy which
                    neglects intelligible relations, and ignores the truth that they are
                    constitutive of experience, form must of necessity be degraded and become mere
                    form of words. This is the complaint which is urged by Hegel against all the
                    natural sciences. He, so to speak, accepts the verdict of Condillac upon them.
                    So far as they attempt to prove anything, he says, they are a mere string of
                    identical propositions. But to Hegel form was everything. The development of the
                    notion is what constitutes the universe; and accordingly he thought that a
                    different formula of reasoning must be found from any hitherto recognized.
                    Syllogistic reasoning is not adequate to any real development of form. It sinks
                    down into a mere change of verbal expression, as Condillac had asserted, while
                    the matter of thought is left precisely where it was. But matter is only the
                    potentiality of form, and form is no mere transformation of verbal expression,
                    but an organic growth of thought. Is there any standing ground between the
                    identity of Condillac and the dialectic of Hegel <hi rend="italic">1</hi></p>
                <p>There are many later systems which it would be interesting to compare with the
                    thoughts of Condillac, notably the psychology of Beneke, the later views of Mr
                    Lewes, and the logical doctrines of Professor Jevons. There is a remarkable
                    similarity between the identity of Condillac and the substitution of similars of
                    Professor Jevons. The logical machine is almost like a realized ideal of
                    Condillac; and Professor Jevons’s new system of symbols would probably have been
                    hailed by Condillac as the <hi rend="italic">langue</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Condillac’s important work <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Commerce</hi><hi rend="italic">et le Gouvernement</hi> was published in 1776,

                    The best European economists are said to be now gravitating to the opinion that
                    Condillac’s is the true conception of economic science. His work treats economic
                    science as the science of commerce or exchanges. It was originally intended to
                    consist of three parts, but the last never appeared. In the first part he
                    develops the principles of economic science, and treats of the phenomena of
                    commerce or exchanges. The second part considers the relations of commerce and
                    government, and their reciprocal influence. The third part was to have contained
                    a number of examples, to show that his theories had facts to rest upon as well
                    as argument. His great merit was to have fixed upon the wants and desires of the
                    human mind as the source of value. Hence he did not look on labour as a cause of
                    value. In an exchange both parties are gainers, for each gives what is
                    comparatively superfluous to him for what is necessary. Therein, he thinks, lies
                    the spring of all commercial activity. He is a strong free trader, and answers
                    by anticipation Saint Simon, Fourier, and their followers regarding the right of
                    inheritance.</p>

                    and sciences. He is very severe upon the error of cultivating only the memory
                    until a supposed “age of reason” has been reached. The young child begins to
                    reason, he thinks, in learning to use its senses, and no delay should be made in
                    encouraging him to observe his own mental processes and the facts around him. So
                    long as he is unable to make observations for himself he should be informed
                    about those of others. The teacher’s great object should be to train his pupil
                    to think, to find pleasure in mental exercise, and to frame just ideas.
                    Condillac took the hint as to the right order of studies from the experience of
                    nations, First he directed his pupil’s attention to those objects and studies
                    which meet the primary wants of man. Then he cultivated his taste. Finally, he
                    directed his thoughts to speculation. He characteristically regarded the arts of
                    speaking, writing, reasoning, and thinking as fundamentally the same, and
                    reduced them all to that of speaking. Condillac had perfect confidence in his
                    method, and boasted of its success, although it does not seem very appropriate
                    for a child of seven years, the age of the prince. His ideas on the importance
                    of early attention to the cultivation of the reasoning powers and the
                    educational uses of observation and experiment are far from being
                    obsolete.</p></note> were published at different times. The following is a list
