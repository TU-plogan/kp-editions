                    signified a collection of laws or ordinances made by the emperor. We find the
                    word used in the same sense in the early history of English law, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Constitutions of Clarendon. In its modern use
                    constitution has been restricted to those rules which concern the political
                    structure of society. If we take the accepted definition of a law as a command
                    imposed by a sovereign on the subject, the constitution would consist of the
                    rules which point out where the sovereign is to be found, the form in which his
                    powers are exercised, and the relations of the different members of the
                    sovereign body to each other where it consists of more persons than one. In
                    every independent political society, it is assumed by these definitions, there
                    will be found somewhere or other a sovereign, whether that sovereign be a single
                    person, or a body of persons, or several bodies of persons. The commands imposed
                    by the sovereign person or body on the rest of the society are positive laws,
                    properly so called. The sovereign body not only makes laws, but has two other
                    leading functions, viz., those of judicature and administration. Legislation is
                    for the most part performed directly by the sovereign body itself; judicature
                    and administration, for the most part, by delegates. The constitution of a
                    society, accordingly, would show how the sovereign body is composed, and what
                    are the relations of its members <hi rend="italic">inter se,</hi> and how the
                    sovereign functions of legislation, judicature, and administration are
                    exercised. Constitutional law consists of the rules relating to these subjects,
                    and these rules may either be laws properly so called, or they may not— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> they may or may not be commands imposed by the
                    sovereign body itself. The constitutional rule, for example, that the Queen and
                    Parliament are the sovereign, cannot be called a law; for a law presupposes the
                    fact which it asserts. And other rules, which are constantly observed in
                    practice, but have never been enacted by the sovereign power, are in the same
                    way constitutional rules which are not laws. It is an undoubted rule of the
                    constitution that the king shall not refuse his assent to a bill which has
                    passed both Houses, but it is certainly not a law. Should the king veto such a
                    bill his action would be unconstitutional, but not illegal. On the other hand
                    the rules relating to the election of members to the House of Commons are nearly
                    all positive laws strictly so called. Constitutional law, as the phrase is
                    commonly used, would include all the laws dealing with the sovereign body in the
                    exercise of its various functions, and all the rules, not being laws properly so
                    called, relating to the same subject.</p>
                <p>The above is an attempt to indicate the meaning of the phrases in their stricter
                    or more technical uses. Some wider meanings may be noticed. In the phrase
                    constitutional government, a form of government based on certain principles
                    which may roughly be called popular is the leading idea. England, Switzerland,
                    the United States, are all constitutional governments in this sense of the word.
                    Russia, France under the last empire, and Spain, on the other hand, would
                    generally be said to be countries without constitutional government. A country
                    where a large portion of the people has some considerable share in the supreme
                    power would be a constitutional country. On the other hand constitutional, as
                    applied to governments, may mean stable as opposed to unstable and anarchic
                    societies. Again, as a term of politics, constitutional has come to mean, in
                    England at least, not obedience to constitutional rules as above described, but
                    adherence to the existing type of the constitution or to some conspicuous
                    portions thereof,—in other words, Conservative. Thus the abolition of the Irish
                    Church, which was in every way a constitutional measure in the judicial meaning
                    of words, was not a constitutional measure in the party sense. In a country like
                    Spain, on the other hand, the party called constitutional is liberal.</p>
                <p>The ideas associated with constitution and -constitutionalism are thus, it will
                    be seen, mainly of modern and European growth. They are wholly inapplicable to
                    the primitive and .simple societies of the present or of former times. The
                    discussion of forms of government occupies a large space in the writings of the
                    Greek philosophers,—a fact which is to be explained by the existence among the
                    Greeks of many independent political communities, variously organized, and more
                    or less democratic in character. Between the political problems of the smaller
                    societies and those of the great European nations there is no useful parallel to
                    be drawn, although the predominance of classical learning made it the fashion
                    for a long time to apply Greek speculations on the nature of monarchy,
                    aristocracy, and democracy to public questions in modern Europe. Representation,
                    the characteristic principle of European constitutions, has, of course, no place
                    in societies which were not too large to admit of every free citizen
                    participating personally in the business of government. Nor is there much in the
                    politics or the political literature of the Romans to compare with the
                    constitutions of modern states. Their political system was almost from the
                    beginning one of empire, ruled absolutely by a small assembly or by one man.</p>
                <p>The impetus to constitutional government in modern times has to a large extent
                    come from England, and it is from English politics that the phrase and its
                    associations have been borrowed. England has offered to the world the one
                    conspicuous example of a long, continuous, and orderly development of political
                    institutions. The early date at which the principle of self-government was
                    established in this country, the steady growth of the principle, the absence of
                    civil dissension, and the preservation in the midst of change of so much of the
                    old organization, have given the English constitution a great influence over the
                    ideas of politicians in other countries. This fact is expressed in the
                    proverbial phrase—“England is the mother of parliaments.” It would not be
                    difficult to show that the leading features of the constitutions now established
                    in other nations have been based on, or defended by, considerations arising from
                    the political history of England.</p>
                <p>In one important respect England differs conspicuously from most other countries.
                    Her constitution is to a large extent <hi rend="italic">unwritten,</hi> using
                    the word in much the same sense as when we speak of unwritten law. Its rules can
                    be found in no written document, but depend, as so much of English law does, on
                    precedent modified by a constant process of interpretation. Many rules of the
                    constitution have in fact a purely legal history, that is to say, they have been
                    developed by the law courts, as part of the general body of the common law.
                    Others have in a similar way been developed by the practice of Parliament. Both
                    Houses, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n339/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0339-0310"/> in fact, have exhibited the same spirit of
                    adherence to precedent, coupled with a power of modifying precedent to suit
                    circumstances, which distinguishes thejudicial tribunals. In a constitutional
                    crisis the House of Commons appoints a committee to “search its journals for
                    precedents,” just as the Court of Queen’s Bench would examine the records of its
                    own decisions. And just as the law, while professing to remain the same, is in
                    process of constant change, so, too, the unwritten constitution is, without any
                    acknowledgment of the fact, constantly taking up new ground.</p>
                <p>In contrast with the mobility of an unwritten constitution is the fixity of a
                    constitution written out, like that of the United States or Switzerland, in one
                    authoritative code. The constitution of the United States, drawn up by a
                    Convention in 1789, is contained in a code of articles. It was ratified
                    separately by each State, and thenceforward became the positive and exclusive
                    statement of the constitution. The legislative powers of the legislature are not
                    to extend to certain kinds of bills, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ex post facto</hi> bills; the president has a veto which can only
                    be overcome by a majority of two-thirds in both Houses; the constitution itself
                    can only be changed in any particular by the consent of the legislatures or
                    conventions of three-fourths of the several States; and finally the judges of
                    the supreme court are to decide in all disputed cases whether an act of the
                    legislature is permitted by the constitution or not. This is truly a formidable
                    apparatus of provisions against change, and, in fact, only fifteen
                    constitutional amendments have been passed from 1789 to the present day. In the
                    same period the unwritten constitution of England has made a most marked
                    advance, chiefly in the direction of eliminating the separate powers of the
                    Crown, and diminishing those of the House of Lords. The Commons, through its
                    nominees, the Ministry, has absorbed the entire power of the Crown, and it has
                    more and more reduced the other House to a position of secondary importance. The
                    American constitution of 1789 was a faithful copy, so far as it was possible to
                    make one out of the materials in hand, of the contemporary constitution of
                    England. The position and powers of the president were a fair counterpart of the
                    royal prerogative of that day; the Senate and the Congress corresponded
                    sufficiently well to the House of Lords and the House of Commons, allowing for
                    the absence of the elements of hereditary rank and territorial influence. While
                    the English constitution has changed much, the American constitution has changed
                    little, if at all, in these respects. Allowing for the more democratic character
                    of the constituencies, the organization of the supreme power in the United
                    States is nearer the English type of the last century—is less modern, in fact
                    —than is the English constitution of the present day.</p>
                <p>One conspicuous feature of the English constitution, by which it is broadly
                    distinguished from written or artificial constitutions, is the presence
                    throughout its entire extent of legal fictions. The influence of the lawyers on
                    the progress of the constitution has already been noticed, and is nowhere more
                    clearly shown than in this peculiarity of its structure. As in the common law,
                    so in the constitutions, change has been effected in substance without any
                    corresponding change in terminology. There is hardly one of the phrases used to
                    describe the position of the Crown which can be understood in its literal sense,
                    and many of them are currently accepted in more senses than one.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the strongly marked historical character of our political
                    institutions, the fallacy of regarding them as elaborate contrivances devised to
                    effect the end of good government has always more or less prevailed. It finds
                    expression in what is called the theory of checks and balances—the theory that
                    power is so distributed among the different elements of the state that each acts
                    as a check on the other, and none is supreme. So Blackstone and writers of his
                    class tell us that the English constitution is the perfection of political
                    wisdom, inasmuch as it combines the virtues of monarchy, aristocracy, and
                    democracy without the faults which would attend any one of these varieties of
                    government unmodified by the others. The tendency to repeat the English type of
                    Parliament, in artificial or paper constitutions, is probably not entirely
                    unconnected with this habit of mind. The question of a second chamber has been
                    apractical difficulty of the first importance in all such constitutions. The
                    attempt to imitate the duality of the English Parliament results in two
                    co-ordinate Houses of legislature, each of which may at any moment bring
                    legislation to a stop. “In both the American and the Swiss constitution,” says
                    an eminent writer on this subject (Mr Bagehot), “the Upper House has as much
                    authority as the second; it could produce the maximum of impediment, the
                    dead-lock, if it liked; if it does not do so it is owing, not to the goodness of
                    the legal constitution, but to the discreetness of members of the chamber.” The
                    explanation may not unreasonably be found in the impossibility of creating a
                    second chamber with the same character which its history has imposed on the
                    English House of Lords. Our two Houses are far from being of co-ordinate
                    authority. In the last result, the will of the House of Commons must
                    prevail.</p>
                <p>A further exemplification of this view of the British constitution may be found
                    in the fact that its highest executive council, the Cabinet, is not even known
                    to the law.</p>
                <p>Between England and some other constitutional countries a difference of much
                    constitutional importance is to be found in the terms on which the component
                    parts of the country were brought together. All great societies have been
                    produced by the aggregation of small societies into larger and larger groups. In
                    England the process of consolidation was completed before the constitution
                    settled down into its present form. In the United States, on the other hand, in
                    Switzerland, and in Germany the constitution is in form an alliance among a
                    number of independent states, each of which may have a constitution and laws of
                    its own for local purposes. In federal governments it remains a question how far
                    the independence of individual states has been sacrificed by submission to a
                    constitution. In the United States constitutional progress is hampered by the
                    necessity thus created of having every amendment ratified by the separate vote
                    of three-fourths of the States. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.</hi> R.)</p>
