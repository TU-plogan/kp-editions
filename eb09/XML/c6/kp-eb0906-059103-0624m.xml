                <p><label type="entry">CROATIA <hi rend="smallcaps">and</hi></label> SLAVONIA, a
                    crown-land ofθ the Hungarian kingdom, which extends from 14° 25' to 20 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> β</hi> 25' E. long., and is bounded on the N.W. by Carniola
                    and Styria, N. by Hungary, S. by Servia, Bosnia, and Dalmatia, and W. by
                    Dalmatia and the Adriatic, on which it has a coast-line of about 88 miles,
                    Inclusive of the districts belonging to the Military Frontier, it has a total
                    area of about 16,785 English square miles; and according to the census of 1869
                    its total population amounted to 1,864,021, of whom 695,997 are assigned to the
                    military portion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mountains.—</hi> The whole country maybe divided into two great
                    natural sections, of which the more important belongs to the basin of the
                    Danube, and is mainly defined by that river and its two extensive tributaries,
                    the Drave and the Save, while the other consists of the highlands of the
                    Adriatic coast. The mountains are partly outrunners of the Alpine system, and
                    partly prolongations of the Karst; but the line of demarcation has not as yet
                    been clearly defined. The former, known chiefly as the Warasdin Mountains,
                    stretch eastward with gradually diminishing elevation through more than half the
                    length of the country to the neighbourhood of Diakovar, and attain
                    their-greatest height of 3483 feet in Mount Ivancica. The latter consist of
                    three more or less distinct chains running north-west and south-east :—the
                    Velebit or Velebitch, with a mean height of 3318 feet, which gives its steep and
                    barren character to the southern part of the coast; the Kapela, with a mean
                    height of 2488 feet, lying further inland, and connecting itself with the
                    mountains of Carniola; and the Plisevica, with a mean height of 3214 feet, which
                    forms the boundary between Bosnia and Croatia. The mean height of the whole of
                    the plateau to which these ranges belong is estimated at 2074 feet. Many parts
                    of the mountain regions are richly wooded with pine, beech, and chestnut, and
                    many of the smaller valleys and glens are abundantly fertile. The richest part
                    of Croatia, indeed, is not the valley of the Drave or the Save, but the hilly
                    district between the Kostel, the Ivancica, and the Agram Mountains, called by
                    the natives Zagorye, or the Land behind the Hills. A small group known as the
                    Vrdnik Mountains rises in the east of Slavonia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers, &amp;c.—</hi> From the point where it begins to form
                    the Croatian boundary, to its junction with the Danube below Esseg, the Drave
                    receives only one important tributary, the Bednya; but the Save is the recipient
                    of a large number of considerable affluents :—the Sotla, the Krapina, the
                    Zelina, the Lonya, the Ilova, the Pakra, and the Olyava from the Warasdin
                    Mountains; and the Kulpa, the Korana, and the Unna from the Karst. The Recina
                    falls into the sea; the Gaska loses itself in swampy hollows; and the Lika
                    plunges into a rocky abyss not far from Gospich. Extensive marshes occur along
                    the main rivers in Slavonia; and there is an interesting cluster of seven
                    lakes—called the Lakes of Plitvica, in connection with the Korana. Warm mineral
                    springs rise at Krapina, at Toplice near Warasdin, at Stubica near Agram, at
                    Daruvar, and at Topusko near Glina; and there is a sulphurous spring at Lipik
                    near Pakrac.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate of the lowlands is equable and
                    temperate; but the Karst district is exposed to very violent and sudden changes.
                    The mean temperature throughout the year for Agram is 52° Fahr., and throughout
                    the hottest month 72°. At Fiume it is very much warmer. The rain comes mainly
                    with the south-west wind, and the annual fall varies from 23 inches in the
                    lowlands to 51 in the Karst. The coast districts are exposed to the violent wind
                    called the Bora, which while it lasts is strong enough to render all locomotion
                    impossible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> About 16 per cent, of the whole country is
                    unproductive, and in the eastern districts a considerable proportion of the rest
                    is assigned to pasture. The chief crops are wheat, oats, rye, potatoes, flax,
                    and hemp; tobacco is also grown; and a good deal of attention is bestowed on the
                    vine, though the national beverage is prepared from the damson plum. Horses are
                    raised in Slavonia; the oak and beech woods furnish food to great <pb break="no"

                    excellent opportunity for the keeping of bees.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and Commerce.—</hi> With the exception of a few
                    establishments for silk-spinning, two or three glassworks, and the distilleries
                    which are scattered throughout the country, the only manufactories are at the
                    seaport towns of Fiume, BuCcari, and Porto Re. Iron-ore is worked at Rude,
                    Ruyevac, and Brod, sulphur at Radoboy, and coal at Pregrada; but none of the
                    mines are of great importance. The traffic of the country is furthered not only
                    by its 580 miles of navigable river, but by upwards of 2000 miles of regular
                    road and several lines of railway meeting at Agram. Among the roads the most
                    famous are the Maria Louisa, which connects Carlstadt with Fiume, and the
                    Josephina, which passes inland from Zengg.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Divisions.—</hi> The territory of Croatia and Slavonia is
                    divided into eight comitats named after their respective administrative
                    centres,—Agram, Fiume, Kreutz, Warasdin, Bellovar, Esseg, Pozsega, and Bukovar.
                    The city of Agram or Zagrab is the capital of the crown-land, and is rapidly
                    rising in importance. Of the other towns it is sufficient to mention, in
                    Croatia, Sissek, with its grain-trade, Karlstadt, the seat of a Greek Church
                    bishop, Kopreinitz, Buccari, with its free port, St Georgen, and Zengg; and in
                    Slavonia, Diakovar, the seat of the famous bishop Strossmayer, and Semlin, one
                    of the most valuable military and commercial ports on the Danube. Sluin, Glina,
                    and Petrinya were respectively the centres of the lst, 2d, and 3d banal
                    regiments; and Brod, Gradiska, Likka, Ogulin, Ottocsan, and Peterwardein give
                    their names to the other military districts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> The united kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia is
                    represented by a separate minister, without a portfolio, and in the Hungarian
                    diet by thirty-four members on the table of deputies, and two envoys from the
                    national diet on the table of magnates. The national diet is composed of the
                    Roman Catholic bishop, the Greek Catholic bishop, the prior of Aurana, the
                    magnates, counts, and barons, and seventy-seven deputies of towns, districts,
                    &amp;c. The kingdom is autonomous in domestic affairs, public worship,
                    education, and justice; and by the law of November 1874 the administrative and
                    the judicial departments are to be kept completely distinct. At the head of the
                    Government is the Ban or Banus, who also ranks as a privy councillor. The
                    highest court is the so-called septemviral table at Agram; and next in order is
                    the banal table. According to a law of 1873, 55 per cent, ‘of the taxes of the
                    kingdom fall to the Hungarian treasury, and the remainder is assigned to
                    domestic expenses.</p>
                <p>The Croats proper form about 74 per cent, of the total population, Serbs about 23
                    per cent., and the small remaining portion is composed of Germans, Magyars,
                    Jews, Italians, and Albanians. The Croats are Catholics, and employ the Latin
                    alphabet for their Slavonic language, which is closely connected with the
                    Serbian, and breaks up into two main dialects—the Sloveno-Croatian and the
                    Serbo-Croatian. The Serbs are members of the Greek Church, and employ the
                    Cyrillic alphabet.</p>
                <p>The principal educational institution in the country is the university
                    established in 1874 at Agram, where there is also the South Slavonian Academy of
                    Sciences and Arts, founded in 1866, as well as a Society of Agriculture,
                    Literature, and History. Diocesan seminaries for Catholic theologians are
                    maintained at Agram, Diakovar, and Zengg; and the priests of the Greek Church
                    have institutions at Carlowitz, Pakrac, and Plaski. General education is still
                    much neglected, and about six-sevenths of the population can neither read nor
                    write.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Croatia and Slavonia were, for the most part at
                    least, Included in the ancient Pannonia; and remains dating from the Roman
                    period are still to be seen at Mitrovitz, Illok, Sotin, and Tovarnik. After the
                    Ostrogoths and the Avars had come and gone, the territory was in 640 taken
                    possession of by the Slavonic races to which it owes its name—the Chrovats,
                    Chorvats, or Horvats, and the Slavs. Temporary recognition of the Frankish
                    kings, and the Byzantine emperors, was followed by the establishment of a more
                    independent kingdom, which included not only Croatia and Slavonia, but also
                    Dalmatia. In 1075, Zwonimir Demetrius, to whom the national party looks back as
                    to the national hero, formally rejected the Byzantine overlordship, and received
                    from Gregory VII. of Rome the title of king. In the 12th and 13th centuries the
                    land was the object of frequent contest between the Byzantines and the
                    Hungarians; and in the 14th and 15th it was still more harassed by the rivalry
                    of Hungary with Venice. In 1524 the whole country fell into the hands of the
                    Turks; but in 1526, after the battle of Mohacs, the districts of Agram, Kreutz,
                    and Warasdin were attached to the Austrian crown, and by the Carlowitz peace of
                    1699, the whole of the country to the north of the Unna was resigned by the
                    sultan. In 1767 the. three kingdoms of Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia were
                    united under the name of Illyria, but the union was broken in 1777. Croatia and
                    Slavonia continued to be regarded as part of the Hungarian kingdom; but a strong
                    national reaction took place in 1848-9 against the Magyar supremacy, and in
                    reward for the service rendered against the Magyar revolt by the ban Jellalich,
                    Austria declared the country independent of Hungary. In 1860, however, the
                    policy of Vienna was altered, and Croatia and Slavonia were again obliged, in
                    spite of the strong opposition of a large party, to resume their former
                    connection with Hungary, which was not recognized by the national diet till
                    1868, and then only after the central administration had interfered with the
                    elections in a most arbitrary manner.</p>
