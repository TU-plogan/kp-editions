                    1436-1506), was the eldest son of Dominico Colombo and Suzanna Fontanarossa, and
                    was born at Genoa in 1435 or 1436, the exact date being uncertain. His father
                    was a wool-comber, of some small means, wſlio was yet living two years after the
                    discovery of the West Indies, and who removed his business from Genoa to Savona
                    in 1469, His eldest boy was sent to the university of Pavia, where he devoted
                    himself to the mathematical and natural sciences, and where he probably received
                    instruction in nautical astronomy from Antonio da Terzago and Stefano di Faenza.
                    On his removal from the university it appears that he worked for some months at
                    his father’s trade; but on reaching his fifteenth year he made his choice of
                    life, and became a sailor.</p>
                <p>Of his apprenticeship, and the'first years of his career, no records exist. The
                    whole of his earlier life, indeed, is dubious and conjectural, founded as it is
                    on the half dozen dark and evasive chapters devoted by Fernando, his son and
                    biographer, to the first half century of his father’s times. It seems certain,
                    however, that these unknown years were stormy, laborious, and eventful;
                    “wherever ship has sailed,” he writes, “there have I journeyed.” He is known,
                    among other places, to have visited England, “Ultima Thule” (Iceland), the
                    Guinea coast, and the Greek Isles; and he appears to have been some time in the
                    service of René of Provence, for whom he is recorded to have intercepted and
                    seized a Venetian galley with great bravery and audacity. According to his son,
                    too, he sailed with Colombo el Mozo, a bold sea captain and privateer; and a sea
                    fight under this commander was the means of bringing him ashore in Portugal.
                    Meanwhile, however, he was preparing himself for greater achievements by reading
                    and meditating on the works of Ptolemy and Marinus, of Nearchus and Pliny, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cosmographia</hi> of Cardinal Aliaco, the travels of Marco
                    Polo and Mandeville. He mastered all the sciences essential to his calling,
                    learned to draw charts and construct spheres, and thus fitted himself to become
                    a consummate practical seaman and navigator.</p>
                <p>In 1470 he arrived at Lisbon, after being wrecked in a sea fight that began off
                    Cape St Vincent, and escaping to laud on a plank. In Portugal he married Felipa
                    Munnis Perestrello, daughter of a captain in the service of Prince Henry, called
                    the Navigator, one of the early colonists and the first governor of Porto Santo,
                    an island off Madeira. Columbus visited the island, and employed his time in
                    making maps and charts for a livelihood, while he pored over the logs and papers
                    of his deceased father-in-law, and talked with old seamen of their voyages, and
                    of the mystery of the western seas. About this time, too, he seems to have
                    arrived at the conclusion that much of the world remained undiscovered, and step
                    by step’ to have conceived that design of reaching Asia by sailing west which
                    was to result in the discovery of America. In 1474 we find him expounding his
                    views to Paolo Toscanelli, the Florentine physician and cosmographer, and
                    receiving the heartiest encouragement.</p>
                <p>These views he supported with three different arguments, derived from natural
                    reasons, from the theories of geographers, and from the reports and traditions
                    of mariners. “He believed the world to be a sphere,” says Helps; “he
                    underestimated its size; he over-estimated the size of the Asiatic continent.
                    The farther that continent extended to the east, the nearer it came round
                    towards Spain.” And he had but to turn from the marvellous propositions of
                    Mandeville and Aliaco to become the recipient of confidences more marvellous
                    still. The air was full of rumours, and the weird imaginings of many generations
                    of mediaeval navigators had taken shape and substance, and appeared bodily to
                    men’s eyes. Martin Vicente, a Portuguese pilot, had found, 400 leagues to the
                    westward of Cape St Vincent, and after a westerly gale of many days’ duration, a
                    piece of strange wood, wrought, but not with iron; Pedro Correa, his own
                    brother-in-law, had seen another such waif at Porto Santo, with great canes
                    capable of holding four quarts of wine between joint and joint, and had heard of
                    two men being washed up at Flores, “very broad-faced, and differing in aspect
                    from Christians.” West of the Azores now and then there hove in sight the
                    mysterious islands of St Brandam; and 200 leagues west of the Canaries lay
                    somewhere the lost Island of the Seven Cities, that two valiant Genoese had
                    vainly endeavoured to discover. In his northern journey, too, some vague and
                    formless traditions may have reached his ear, of the voyages of Biorn and Leif,
                    and of the pleasant coasts of Helleland and Vinland that lay towards the setting
                    sun. All were hints and rumours to bid the bold mariner sail westward, and this
                    he at length determined to do.</p>
                <p>The concurrence of some state or sovereign, however, was necessary for the
                    success of this design. The Senate of Genoa had the honour to receive the first
                    offer, and the responsibility of refusing it. Rejected by his native city, the
                    projector turned next to John II. of Portugal. This king had already an open
                    field for discovery and enterprise along the African coast; but he listened to
                    the Genoese, and referred him to a Committee of Council for Geographical
                    Affairs. The council’s report was altogether adverse; but the king, who was yet
                    inclined to favour the theory of Columbus, assented to the suggestion of the
                    bishop of Ceuta that the plan should be carried out in secret and without
                    Columbus’s knowledge by means of a caravel or light frigate. The caravel was
                    dispatched, but <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n199/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0199-0172"/> it returned after a brief absence, the sailors
                    having lost heart, and having refused to venture farther. Upon discovering this
                    dishonourable transaction Columbus felt so outraged and indignant that he sent
                    off his brother Bartholomew to England with letters for Henry VII., to whom he
                    had communicated his ideas. He himself left Lisbon for Spain (1484), taking with
                    him his son Diego, the only issue of his marriage with Felipa Munnis, who was by
                    this time dead. He departed secretly,—according to some writers, to give the
                    slip to King John, according to others, to escape his creditors. Three years
                    after (2Oth March 1488) a letter was sent by the king to “Christopher Colon, our
                    especial friend,” inviting him to return, and assuring him against arrest and
                    proceedings of any kind; but it was then too late.</p>
                <p>Columbus next betook himself to the south of Spain, and seems to have proposed
                    his plan first to the duke of Medina Sidonia (who was at first attracted by it,
                    but finally threw it up as visionary and impracticable), and next to the duke of
                    Medina Celi. The latter gave him great encouragement, entertained him for two
                    years, and even determined to furnish him with the three or four caravals.
                    Finally, however, being deterred by the con sideration that the enterprize was
                    too vast for a subject, he turned his guest from the determination he had come
                    to of making instant application at the court of France, by writing on his
                    behalf to queen Isabella; and Columbus repaired to the court at Cordova at her
                    bidding.</p>
                <p>It was an ill moment for the navigator’s fortune. Castile and Leon were in the
                    thick of that struggle which resulted in the final defeat of the Moors; and
                    neither Ferdinand nor Isabella had time to listen. The adventurer was indeed
                    kindly received; he was handed over to the care of Alonso de Quintanilla, whom
                    he speedily converted into an enthusiastic supporter of his theory. He made many
                    other friends, and here met with Beatriz Enriquez, the mother of his second son
                    Fernando.</p>
                <p>From Cordova Columbus followed the court to Salamanca, where he was introduced to
                    the notice of the grand cardinal, Pedro Gonzalez de Mendoza, “the third king of
                    Spain.” The cardinal, while approving the project, thought that it savoured
                    strongly of heterodoxy; but an interview with the projector brought him over,
                    and through his influence Columbus at last got audience of the king. The matter
                    was finally referred, however, to Fernando de Talavera. who in 1487 summoned a
                    junta of astronomers and cosmographers to confer with Columbus, and examine his
                    design and the arguments by which he supported it. The Dominicans of San Estebán
                    in Salamanca entertained Columbus during the conference. The jurors, who were
                    most of them ecclesiastics, were by no means unprejudiced, nor were they
                    disposed to abandon their pretensions toknowledge without a struggle. Columbus
                    argued his point, but was overwhelmed with Biblical texts, with quotations from
                    the great divines, with theological objections; and in a short time the junta
                    was adjourned. In 1489 Columbus, who had been following the court from place to
                    place (billeted in towns as an officer of the king’s, and gratified from time to
                    time with sums of money toward his expenses), was present at the siege of
                    Malaga. In 1490 the junta decided that his project was vain and impracticable,
                    and that it did not become their highnesses to have anything to do with it; and
                    this was confirmed, with some reservation, by their highnesses themselves, at
                    Seville.</p>
                <p>Columbus was now in despair. He at once betook himself to Huelva, where his
                    brother-in-law resided, with the intention of taking ship for France. He halted,
                    however, at Palos, a little maritime town in Andalusia. At the monastery of La
                    Rabida he knocked and asked for bread and water for his boy Diego, and presently
                    got into conversation with Juan Perez de Marchena, the guardian, who invited him
                    to take up his quarters in the monastery, and introduced him to Garci Fernandez,
                    a physician and an ardent student of geography. To these good men did Columbus
                    propound his theory and explain his plan. Juan Perez had been the queen’s
                    confessor; he wrote to her, and was summoned to her presence; and money was sent
                    to Columbus, to bring him once more to court. He reached Granada in time to
                    witness the surrender of the city; and negotiations were resumed. Columbus
                    believed in his mission, and stood out for high terms; he asked the rank of
                    Admiral at once, the vice-royalty of all he should discover, and a tenth of all
                    the gain, by conquest or by trade. These conditions were rejected, and the
                    negotiations were again interrupted. An interview with Mendoza appears to have
                    followed; but nothing came of it, and in January 1492 Columbus actually set out
                    for France. At length, however, on the entreaty of Luis de Santangel, receiver
                    of the ecclesiastical revenues of the crown of Aragon, Isabella was induced to
                    determine on the expedition. A messenger was sent after Columbus, and overtook
                    him at the Bridge of Pines, about two leagues from Granada. He returned to the
                    camp at Santa Fé; and on 17th April 1492, the agreement between him and their
                    Catholic majesties was signed and sealed.</p>
                <p>His aims were nothing less than the discovery of the marvellous province of
                    Cipango and the conversion to Christianity of the Grand Khan, to whom he
                    received a royal letter of introduction. The town of Palos was ordered to find
                    him two ships, and these were soon placed at his disposal. But no crews could be
                    got together, in spite of the indemnity offered to all criminals and broken men
                    who would serve on the expedition; and had not Juan Perez succeeded in
                    interesting Martin Alonso Pinzon and Vicente Yañez Pinzon in thecause,
                    Columbus’s departure had been long delayed. At last, however, men, ships, and
                    stores were ready. The expedition consisted of the “Santa Maria,” a decked ship,
                    with a crew of 50 men, commanded by the Admiral in person; and of two caravels,
                    the “Pinta,” with 30 men, under Martin Pinzon, and the “Niña,” with 24 men,
                    under his brother Vicente Yañez, afterwards (1499) the first to cross the line
                    in the American Atlantic. The adventurers numbered 120 souls; and on Friday, 3d
                    August 1492, at eight in the morning, the little fleet weighed anchor, and stood
                    out for the Canary Islands.</p>
                <p>An abstract of the Admiral’s diary made by the Bishop Las Casas is yet extant;
                    and from it many particulars may be gleaned concerning this first voyage. Three
                    days after the ships had set sail the “Pinta” lost her rudder; the Admiral was
                    in some alarm, but comforted himself with the reflection that Martin Pinzon was
                    energetic and ready-witted; they had, however, to put in (August 9) at
                    Teneriffe, to refit the caravel. On 6th September they weighed anchor once more
                    with all haste, Columbus having been informed that three Portuguese caravels
                    were on the look-out for him. On 13th September the variations of the magnetic
                    needle were for the first time observed; on the 15th a wonderful meteor fell
                    into the sea at four or five leagues distance. On the 16th they arrived at those
                    vast plains of seaweed called the Sargasso Sea; and thenceforward, writes the
                    Admiral, they had most temperate breezes, the sweetness of the mornings being
                    most delightful, the weather like an Andalusian April, and only the song of the
                    nightingale wanting. On the 17th the men began to murmur; they were frightened
                    by the strange phenomena of the variations of the compass, but the explanation
                    Columbus gave restored their tranquillity. On the 18th they saw many birds, and
                    a great ridge of low-lying cloud; and they expected to see land. On the 20th
                    they saw two pelicans, and were sure the land <pb break="no"

                    disappointed, and the men began to be afraid and discontented; and thenceforth
                    Columbus, who was keeping all the while a double reckoning, one for the crew and
                    one for himself, had great difficulty in restraining the men from the excesses
                    which they meditated. On the 25th Alonso Pinzon raised the cry of land, but it
                    proved a false alarm; as did the rumour to the same effect of the 7th October,
                    when the “Niña” hoisted a flag and fired a gun. On the 11 th the “Pinta” fished
                    up a cane, a log of wood, a stick wrought with iron, and a board, and the “Niña”
                    sighted a stake covered with dog-roses; “and with these signs all of them
                    breathed, and were glad.” At ten o’clock on that night Columbus perceived and
                    pointed out a light ahead; and at two in the morning of Friday, the 12 th
                    October, 1492, Rodrigo de Triana, a sailor aboard the “Niña,” announced the
                    appearance of what proved to be the New World. The land sighted was an island,
                    called by the Indians Guanahani, and named by Columbus San Salvador.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Helps refers to the island as
                    “one of the Bahamas.” It has been variously identified—with Turk’s Island, by
                    Navarrete (1825); with Cat Island, by Irving (1828) and Humboldt (1836); with
                    Mayaguarra, by Varnhagen (1864); and finally, with greatest shew of probability,
                    with Watling Island, by Munoz (1798), supported by Becher (1856), Peschel
                    (1857), and Major (1871'.</p></note></p>
                <p>The same morning Columbus landed, richly clad, and bearing the royal banner of
                    Spain. He was accompanied by the brothers Pinzon, bearing banners of the Green
                    Cross, a device of his own, and by great part of the crew. When they all had
                    “given thanks to God, kneeling upon the shore, and kissed the ground with tears
                    of joy, for the great mercy received,” the Admiral named the island, and took
                    solemn possession of it for their Catholic majesties of Castile and Leon. At the
                    same time such of the crews as had shown themselves doubtful and mutinous sought
                    his pardon weeping, and prostrated themselves at his feet.</p>
                <p>Into the detail of this voyage, of highest interest as it is, it is impossible to
                    go farther. It will be enough to say that it resulted in the discovery of the
                    islands of Santa Maria del Concepcion, Exuma, Isabella, Juanna or Cuba, Bohio,
                    the Cuban Archipelago (named by its finder the Jardin del Rey), the island of
                    Santa Catalina, and that of Hispaniola, now called Haiti, or San Domingo. Off
                    the last of these the “Santa Maria” went aground, owing to the carelessness of
                    the steersman. No lives were lost, but the ship had to be unloaded and
                    abandoned; and Columbus, who was anxious to return to Europe with the news of
                    his achievement, resolved to plant a colony on the island, to build a fort out
                    of the material of the stranded hulk, and to leave the crew. The fort was called
                    La Navidad; 43 Europeans were placed in charge; and on 16th January 1493,
                    Columbus, who had lost sight of Martin Pinzon, set sail alone in the “Niña” for
                    the east; and four days afterwards the “Pinta” joined her sister-ship off Monte
                    Christo. A storm, however, separated the vessels, and a long battle with the
                    trade winds caused great delay; and it was not until the 18th February that
                    Columbus reached the Island of Santa Maria in the Azores. Here he was threatened
                    with capture by the Portuguese governor, who could not for some time be brought
                    to recognize his commission. On 24th February, however, he was allowed to
                    proceed; and on 4th March the “Niña” dropped anchor off Lisbon. The king of
                    Portugal received the Admiral with the highest honours; and on 13th March the
                    “Niña” put out from the Tagus, and two days afterwards, Friday, 15th March,
                    dropped anchor off Palos.</p>
                <p>The court was at Barcelona; and thither, after despatching a letter announcing
                    his arrival, Columbus proceeded in person. He entered the city in a sort of
                    triumphal pro cession, was received by their majesties in full court, and,
                    seated in their presence, related the story of his wanderings, exhibiting the
                    “rich and strange” spoils of the new-found lands,—the gold, the cotton, the
                    parrots, the curious arms, the mysterious plants, the unknown birds and beasts,
                    and the nine Indians he had brought with him for baptism. All his honours and
                    privileges were confirmed to him; the title of Don was conferred on himself and
                    his brothers; he rode at the king’s bridle; he was served and saluted as a
                    grandee of Spain. And, greatest honour of all, a new and magnificent scutcheon
                    was blazoned for him (4th May 1493), whereon the royal castle and lion of
                    Castile and Leon were combined with the four anchors of his own old coat of
                    arms. Nor were their Catholic highnesses less busy on their own account than on
                    that of their servant. On 3d and 4th May Alexander VI. granted bulls confirming
                    to the crowns of Castile and Leon all the lands discovered,<note anchored="true"

                    considered as a part of India. In consequence of this notion, the name of Indies
                    is given to them by Ferdinand and Isabella in a ratification of their former
                    agreement which was granted to Columbus after his return.”—Robertson’s <hi

                    certain line of demarcation, on the same terms as those on which the Portuguese
                    held their colonies along the African "coast. A new expedition was got in
                    readiness with all possible dispatch, to secure and extend the discoveries
                    already made.</p>
                <p>After several delays the fleet weighed anchor on 25th September and steered
                    westwards. It consisted of three great carracks (galleons), and fourteen
                    caravels (light frigates), having on board about 1500 men, besides the animals
                    and material necessary for colonization. Twelve missionaries accompanied the
                    expedition, under the orders of Bernardo Buil, a Benedictine friar; and Columbus
                    had been directed (29th May 1493) to endeavour by all means in his power to
                    Christianize the inhabitants of the islands, to make them presents, and to
                    “honour them much,” while all under him were commanded to treatthem “wellaud
                    lovingly,” under pain of severe punishment. On 13th October the ships which had
                    put in at the Canaries, left Ferro; and so early as Sunday, 3d November, after a
                    single storm, “by the goodness of God and the wise management of the Admiral”
                    land was sighted to the west, which was named Dominica. Northwards from this new
                    found island the isles of Maria Galante and Guadaloupe were discovered and
                    named; and on the north-western course to La Navidad those of Montserrat,
                    Antigua, San Martin, and Santa Cruz were sighted, and the island now called
                    Porto Rico was touched at, hurriedly explored, and named San Juan. On 22d
                    November Columbus came in sight of Hispaniola, and sailing eastward to La
                    Navidad, found the fort burned and the colony dispersed. He decided on building
                    a second fort; and coasting on forty miles east of Cape Haytien, he pitched on a
                    spot where he founded the city and settlement of Isabella.</p>
                <p>The character in which Columbus had appeared had till now been that of the
                    greatest of mariners; but from this point forward his claims to supremacy are
                    embarrassed and complicated with the long series of failures, vexations,
                    miseries, insults, that have rendered his career as a planter of colonies and as
                    a ruler of men most pitiful and remarkable.</p>
                <p>The climate of Navidad proved unhealthy; the colonists were greedy of gold,
                    impatient of control, and as proud, ignorant, and mutinous as Spaniards could
                    be; and Columbus, whose inclinations drew him westward, was doubtless glad to
                    escape the worry and anxiety of his post, and to avail himself of the
                    instructions of his sovereigns as to further discoveries. In January 1494 he
                    sent home, by Antonio de Torres, that dispatch to their Catholic highnesses by
                    which he may be said to have founded <pb break="no"

                    mining camp of San Tomaso in the gold country; and on 24th April 1494, having
                    nominated a council of regency under his brother Diego, and appointed Pedro de
                    Margarite his captain-general, he put again to sea. After following the southern
                    shore of Cuba for some days, he steered southwards, and discovered the island of
                    Jamaica, which he named Santiago. He then resumed his exploration of the Cuban
                    coast, thread his way through a labyrinth of islets supposed to be the Morant
                    Keys, which he named the Garden of the Queen; and after coasting westwards for
                    many days, he became convinced that he had discovered continuous land, and
                    caused Perez de Luna, the notary, to draw up a document attesting his discovery
                    (12th June 1494), which was afterwards taken round and signed, in presence of
                    four witnesses, by the masters, mariners, and seamen of his three caravels, the
                    “Niña,” the “Cardera,” and the “San Juan.” He then stood to the south-east, and
                    sighted the island of Evangelita; and after many days of difficulties and
                    anxieties, he touched at and named the island La Mona. Thence he had intended to
                    sail eastwards, and complete the survey of the Caribbean Archipelago. But he was
                    exhausted by the terrible tear and wear of mind and body he had undergone (he
                    says himself that on this expedition he was three and thirty days almost without
                    any sleep), and on the day following his departure from La Mona, he fell into a
                    lethargy, that deprived him of sense and memory, and had well nigh proved fatal
                    to life. At last, on 29th September, the little fleet dropped anchor off
                    Isabella, and in his new city the great Admiral lay sick for five months.</p>
                <p>The colony was in a sad plight. Every one was discontented, and many were sick,
                    for the climate was unhealthy and there was nothing to eat. Margarite and Buil
                    had quitted Hispaniola for Spain; but ere his departure, the former, in his
                    capacity of captain-general, had done much to outrage and alienate the Indians.
                    The strongest measures were necessary to undo this mischief; and backed by his
                    brother Bartholomew, a bold and skilful mariner, and a soldier of courage and
                    resource, who had been with Diaz in his voyage round the Cape of Good Hope,
                    Columbus proceeded to reduce the natives under Spanish sway. Alonso de Ojeda
                    succeeded by a brilliant <hi rend="italic">coup de main</hi> in capturing the
                    cacique Caonabo, and the rest submitted. Five ship-loads of Indians were sent
                    off to Seville (24th June 1495) to be sold as slaves; and a tribute was imposed
                    upon their fellows, which must be looked upon as the origin of that system of
                    <hi rend="italic">repartimientos</hi> or <hi rend="italic">encomiendas</hi>
                    which was afterwards to work such cruel mischief among the conquered. But the
                    tide of court favour seemed to have turned against Columbus. In October 1495
                    Juan Aguado arrived at Isabella, with an open commission from their Catholic
                    majesties, to inquire into the circumstances of his rule; and much contest and
                    recrimination followed. Columbus -found that there was no time to be lost in
                    returning .home; he appointed his brother Bartholomew “adelantado” of the
                    island; and on lθth March 1496 he quitted Hispaniola in the “Niña.” The vessel,
                    after a protracted and perilous voyage, reached Cadiz on llth June 1496. The
                    Admiral landed in great dejection, wearing the costume of a Franciscan.
                    Reassured, however, by the reception of his sovereigns, he asked at once for
                    eight ships more, two to be sent to the colony with supplies, and six to be put
                    under his orders for new discoveries. The request was not immediately granted,
                    as the Spanish exchequer was not then well supplied. But principally owing to
                    the interest of the queen, an agreement was come to similar to that of 1492,
                    which was now confirmed. By this royal patent, moreover, a tract of land in
                    Hispaniola, of 50 leagues by 20, was made over to him. He was offered a dukedom
                    or a marquisate at his pleasure; for three years he was to receive an eighth of
                    the gross and a tenth of the net profits on each voyage; the right of creating a
                    mayorazgo or perpetual entail of titles and estates was granted him; and on 24th
                    June his two sons were received into Isabella’s service as pages. Meanwhile,
                    however, the preparing of the fleet proceeded slowly; and it was not till
                    the-30th May 1498 that he and his six ships set sail.</p>
                <p>From San Lucar he steered for Gome.ra, in the Canaries, and thence dispatched
                    three of his ships to San Domingo. He next proceeded to the Cape Verd Islands,
                    which he quitted on 4th July. On the 3lst of the same month, being greatly in
                    need of water, and fearing that no land lay westwards as they had hoped,
                    Columbus had turned his ship’s head north, when Alonso Perez, a mariner of
                    Huelva, saw land about 15 leagues to the south-west. It was crowned with three
                    hill-tops, and so when the sailors had sung the <hi rend="italic">Salve
                    Regina,</hi> the Admiral named it Trinidad, which name it yet bears. On
                    Wednesday, 1st August, he beheld for the first time in the mainland of South
                    America the continent he had sought so long, It seemed to him but an
                    insignificant island, and he called it Zeta. Sailing westwards, next day he saw
                    the Gulf of Paria, which was named by him the Golfo de la Balena, and was borne
                    into it at immense risk on the ridge of waters formed by the meeting with the
                    sea of the great rivers that empty themselves, all swollen with rain, into the
                    ocean. For many days he coasted the continent, esteeming as islands the several
                    projections he saw, and naming them accordingly; nor w as it until he had looked
                    on and considered the immense volume of fresh water poured out through the
                    embouchures of the river now called the Orinoco, that he concluded that the
                    so-called archipelago must be in very deed a great continent.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately at this time he was suffering intolerably from gout and ophthalmia;
                    his ships were crazy; and he was anxious to inspect the infant colony whence he
                    had been absent so long. And so, after touching at and naming the island of
                    Margarita, he bore away to the north-east, and on 30th August the fleet dropped
                    anchor off Isabella.</p>
                <p>He found that affairs had not prospered well in his absence. By the vigour and
                    activity of the adelantado, the whole island had been reduced under Spanish
                    sway, but at the expense of the colonists. Under the leadership of a certain
                    Roldan, a bold and unprincipled adventurer, they had risen in revolt, and
                    Columbus had to compromise matters in order to restore peace. Roldan retained
                    his office; such of his followers as chose to remain in the island were
                    gratified with <hi rend="italic">repartimientos</hi> of land and labour; and
                    some fifteen, choosing to return to Spain, were enriched with a number of
                    slaves, and sent home in two ships which sailed in the early part of October
                    1499.</p>
                <p>Five ship-loads of Indians had been deported to Spain some little time before. On
                    the arrival of these living cargoes at Seville, the queen, the stanch and steady
                    friend of Columbus, was moved with compassion and indignation. No one, she
                    declared, had authorized him to dispose of her vassals in any such manner; and
                    proclamations at Seville, Granada, and other chief places ordered (20th June
                    1499) the instant liberation and return of all the last gang of Indians. In
                    addition to this the ex-colonists had become incensed against Columbus and his
                    brothers. They were wont to parade their grievances in the very court-yards of
                    the Alhambra, to surround the king when he came forth with complaints and
                    reclamations, to insult the discoverer’s young sons with shouts and jeers. There
                    was no doubt that the colony itself, whatever the cause, had not prospered so
                    well as might have been desired. And, on the whole, it is not surprising that
                    Ferdinand, whose support to Columbus had never been very hearty, should <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0202-0175"/> about this time have determined to suspend him.
                    Accordingly on March 21, 1499, Francisco de Bobadilla was ordered “to ascertain
                    what persons had raised themselves against justice in the island of Hispaniola,
                    and to proceed against them according to law.” On May 21st the government of the
                    island was conferred on him, and he was accredited with an order that all arms
                    and fortresses should be handed over to him; and on May 26 he received a letter
                    for delivery to Columbus, stating that the bearer would “speak certain things to
                    him” on the part of their highnesses, and praying him “to give faith and
                    credence, and to act accordingly.” Bobadilla left Spain in July 1500, and landed
                    in Hispaniola in October.</p>
                <p>Columbus, meanwhile, had restored such tranquillity as was possible in his
                    government. With Roldan’s help he had beaten off an attempt on the island of the
                    adventurer Ojeda, his old lieutenant; the Indians were being collected into
                    villages and Christianized. Gold-mining was actively and profitably pursued; in
                    three years, he calculated, the royal revenues might be raised to an average of
                    60,000,000 reals. The arrival of Bobadilla, however, speedily changed this state
                    of affairs into a greater and more pitiable confusion than the island had ever
                    before witnessed. On landing, he took possession of the Admiral’s house and
                    summoned him and his brothers before him. Accusations of severity, of injustice,
                    of venality even, were poured down on their heads, and Columbus anticipated
                    nothing less than a shameful death. Bobadilla put all three in irons, and
                    shipped them off to Spain.</p>
                <p>Alonso de Villejo, captain of the caravel in which the illustrious prisoners
                    sailed, still retained a proper sense of the honour and respect due to Columbus,
                    and would have removed the fetters; but to this Columbus would not consent. He
                    would wear them, he said, until their highnesses, by whose order they had been
                    affixed, should order their removal; and he would keep them afterwards “as
                    relics and as memorials of the reward of his services.” He did so. His son
                    Fernando “saw them always hanging in his cabinet, and he requested that when he
                    died they might be buried with him.” Whether this last wish was complied with is
                    not known.</p>
                <p>A heart-broken and indignant letter from Columbus to Doña Juana de la Torre, the
                    governess of the infante Don Juan, arrived at court before the despatch of
                    Bobadilla. It was read to the queen, and its tidings were confirmed by
                    communications from Alonso de Villejo, and the alcaide of Cadiz. There was a
                    great movement of indignation; the tide of popular and royal feeling turned once
                    more in the Admiral’s favour. He received a large sum to defray his expenses;
                    and when he appeared at court, on 17th December, he was no longer in irons and
                    disgrace, but richly apparelled and surrounded with friends. He was received
                    with all honour and distinction. The queen is said to have been moved to tears
                    by the narration of his story. Their majesties not only repudiated Bobadilla’s
                    proceedings, but declined to inquire into the charges that he at the same time
                    brought, against his prisoners, and promised Columbus compensation for his
                    losses and satisfaction for his wrongs. A new governor, Nicolas de Ovando, was
                    appointed in Bobadilla’s room, and left San Lucar on 18th February 1502, with a
                    fleet of 30 ships. The latter was to be impeached and sent home; the Admiral’s
                    property was to be restored, and a fresh start was to be made in the conduct of
                    colonial affairs. Thus ended Columbus’s history as viceroy and governor of the
                    new Indies which he had presented to the country of his adoption.</p>
                <p>His hour of rest, however, was not yet come. Ever anxious to serve their Catholic
                    highnesses, “and particularly the queen,” he had determined to find a strait
                    through which he might penetrate westwards into Portuguese Asia. After the usual
                    inevitable delays his prayers were granted, and on 9th May 1502, with four
                    caravels and 150 men, he weighed anchor from Cadiz, and sailed on his fourth and
                    last great voyage. He first betook himself to the relief of the Portuguese fort
                    of Arzilla, which had been besieged by the Moors, but the siege had been raised
                    voluntarily before he arrived. He put to sea westwards once more, and on 13th
                    June discovered the island of Martinique. He had received positive instructions
                    from his sovereigns on no account to touch at Hispaniola; but his largest
                    caravel was greatly in need of repairs, and he had no choice but to abandon her
                    or disobey orders. He preferred the latter alternative, and sent a boat ashore
                    to Ovando, asking for a new ship and for permission to enter the harbour to
                    weather a hurricane which he saw was coming on. But his requests were refused,
                    and he coasted the island, castinganchor under lee of the land. Here he
                    weathered the storm, which drove the other caravels out to sea, and annihilated
                    the homeward-bound fleet, the richest that had till then been sent from
                    Hispaniola. Roldan and Bobadilla perished with others of the Admiral’s enemies;
                    and Fernando Colon, wþo accompanied his father on this voyage, wrote long years
                    afterwards, “I am satisfied it was the hand of God, for had they arrived in
                    Spain they had never been punished as their crimes deserved, but rather been
                    favoured and preferred.”</p>
                <p>After recruiting his flotilla at Azua, Columbus put in at Jaquimo and refitted
                    his four vessels; and on 14th July 1502 he steered for Jamaica. For nine weeks
                    the ships wandered painfully among the keys and shoals he had named the Garden
                    of the Queen, and only an opportune easterly wind prevented the crews from open
                    mutiny. The first land sighted was the islet of Guanaja, about forty miles east
                    of the coast of Honduras. Here he got news from an old Indian of a rich and vast
                    country lying to the eastward, which he at once concluded must be the long
                    sought for empire of the Grand Khan. Steering along the coast of Honduras, great
                    hardships were endured, but nothing approaching his ideal was discovered. On
                    12th September Cape Gracias-á-Dios was sighted. The men had become clamorous and
                    insubordinate; not until the 5th December, however, would he tack about, and
                    retrace his course. It now became his intention to plant a colony on the river
                    Veragua, which was afterwards to give his descendants a title of nobility; but
                    he had hardly put about when he was caught in a storm, which lasted eight days,
                    wrenched and strained his crazy, worm-eaten ships severely, and finally, on the
                    Epiphany, blew him into an embouchure which he named Bethlehem. Gold was very
                    plentiful in this place, and here he determined to found his settlement. By the
                    end of March 1503 a number of huts had been run up, and in these the adelantado
                    with 80 men was to remain, while Columbus returned to Spain for men and
                    supplies. Quarrels, however, arose with the natives; the adelantado made an
                    attempt to seize oh the person of the cacique, and failed; and before Columbus
                    could leave the coast he had to abandon a caravel, to take the settlers on
                    board, and to relinquish the enterprize. Steering eastwards, he left a second
                    caravel at Porto Bello; and on May 3lst he bore northwards for Cuba, where he
                    obtained supplies from the natives. From Cuba he bore up for Jamaica, and there,
                    in the harbour of Santa Gloria, now St Anne’s Bay, he ran his ships aground in a
                    small inlet still called Don Christopher’s Cove.</p>
                <p>The expedition was received with the greatest kindness by the natives, and here
                    Columbus remained upwards of a year awaiting the return of his lieutenant Diego
                    Mendez, whom he had dispatched to Ovando for assistance. During his critical
                    sojourn here, the admiral suffered much from disease and from the lawlessness of
                    his followers, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n203/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0203-0176"/> whose misconduct had alienated the natives, and
                    provoked them to withhold their accustomed supplies, until he dexterously worked
                    upon their superstitions by prognosticating an eclipse. Two vessels having at
                    last arrived for their relief from Mendez and Ovando, Columbus set sail for
                    Spain, and after a tempestuous voyage he landed once more at Seville on 7th
                    September 1504.</p>
                <p>As he was too ill to go to court, his son Diego was sent thither in his place, to
                    look after his interests and transact his business. Letter after letter followed
                    the young man from Seville,—one by the hands of Amerigo Vespucci. A licence to
                    ride on muleback was granted him on 23d February 1505; and in the following May
                    he was removed to the court at Segovia, and thence again to Valladolid. On the
                    landing of Philip and Juana at Coruña (25th April 1506) although “much oppressed
                    with the gout and troubled to see himself put by his rights,” he is known to
                    have sent off the adelantado to pay them his duty and to assure them that he was
                    yet able to do them extraordinary service. The last documentary note of him is
                    contained in a final codicil to the will of 1498, made at Valladolid on 19th May
                    1506. By this the old will is confirmed; the mayorazgo is bequeathed to his son
                    Diego, and his heirs male, failing these to Fernando, his second son, and
                    failing these to the heirs male of Bartholomew; only in case of the extinction
                    of the male line, direct or collateral, is it to descend to the females of the
                    family; and those into whose hands it may fall are never to diminish it, but
                    always to increase and ennoble it by all means possible. The head of the house
                    is to sign himself “The Admiral.” A tenth of the annual income is to be set
                    aside yearly for distribution among the poor relations of the house. A chapel is
                    founded and endowed for the saying of masses. Beatriz Enriquez is left to the
                    care of the young admiral in most grateful terms. Among other legacies is one of
                    “half a mark of silver to a Jew who used to live at the gate of the Jewry, in
                    Lisbon.” The codicil was written and signed with the Admiral’s own hand. Next
                    day (20th May 1506) he died.</p>
                <p>He was buried at Valladolid; but his remains were soon after transferred thence
                    to the Carthusian monastery of Las Cuevas, Seville, where the bones of Diego,
                    the second Admiral, were also laid. Exhumed in 1536, the bodies of both father
                    and son were taken over sea to Hispaniola (San Domingo), and interred in the
                    cathedral. In 1795-96, on the cession of that island to the French, the august
                    relics were re-exhumed, and were transferred with great state and solemnity to
                    the cathedral of the Havana, where they yet remain. The male issue of the
                    Admiral became extinct with the third generation, and the estates and titles
                    passed by marriage to a scion of the house of Bragança.</p>
                <p>In person Columbus was tall and shapely, long-faced and aquiline, white-eyed and
                    auburn-haired, and beautifully complexioned. At thirty his hair was quite grey.
                    He was temperate in eating, drinking, and dress; and “so strict in religious
                    matters, that for fasting and saying all the divine office, he might be thought
                    professed in some religious order.” His piety, as his son has noted, was earnest
                    and unwavering; it entered into and coloured alike his action and his speech; he
                    tries his pen in a Latin distich of prayer; his signature is a mystical
                    pietistic device. He was pre-eminently fitted for the task he created for
                    himself. Through deceit and opprobrium and disdain he pushed on towards the
                    consummation of his desire; and when the hour for action came the man was not
                    found wanting.</p>
