                    at Mileham, in Norfolk, on February 1, 1552. When only ten years old he lost his
                    father, who was a bencher of Lincoln’s Inn. From the grammar-school of Norwich
                    he passed to Trinity College, Cambridge; and after a course of three years, in
                    1572 he entered the Inn to which his father had belonged. To the study of law he

                    slept only six hours, and from three in the morning till nine at night he read
                    or took notes of the cases tried in Westminster Hall with as little interruption
                    as possible. In 1578 he was called to the bar, and in the next year he was
                    chosen reader at Lyon’s Inn. His extensive and exact legal erudition, and the
                    skill with which he argued the intricate cases of Lord Cromwell and Edward
                    Shelley, soon brought him a practice never before equalled, and caused him to be
                    universally recognized as the greatest lawyer of his day. In 1586 he was m¾de
                    recorder of Norwich, and in 1592 recorder of London, solicitor-general, and
                    reader in the Inner Temple. In 1593 he was returned as member of parliament for
                    his native county, and also chosen speaker of the House of Commons. In 1594 he
                    was promoted to the office of attorney-general, despite the claims of Bacon, who
                    was warmly supported by the earl of Essex. As crown lawyer his treatment of the
                    accused was marked by more than the harshness and violence common in his time;
                    and the fame of the victim has caused his behaviour in the trial of Raleigh to
                    be lastingly remembered against him. While the prisoner defended himself with
                    the calmest dignity and self-possession, Coke burst into the bitterest
                    invective, brutally addressing the great courtier as if he had been a servant,
                    in the phrase, long remembered for its insolence and its utter injustice,—“Thou
                    hast an English face, but a Spanish heart !”</p>
                <p>In 1582 Coke married the daughter of John Paston, a gentleman of Suffolk,
                    receiving with her a fortune of £30,000; but in six months he was left a
                    widower. Shortly after he sought the hand of Lady Elizabeth Hatton, daughter of
                    Thomas, second Lord Burghley, and granddaughter of the great Cecil. Bacon was
                    again his rival, and again unsuccessfully; the wealthy young widow became—not,
                    it is said, to his future comfort—Coke’s second wife.</p>
                <p>In 1606 Coke was made chief-justice of the Common Pleas, but in 1613 he was
                    removed to the office of chiefjustice of the King’s Bench, which gave him less
                    opportunity of interfering with the court. The change, though it brought
                    promotion in dignity, caused a diminution of income as well as of power; but
                    Coke received some compensation in being appointed a member of the Privy
                    Council. The independence of his conduct as a judge, though not unmixed with the
                    baser elements of prejudice and vulgar love of authority, has partly earned
                    forgiveness for the harshness which was so prominent in his sturdy character.
                    Full of an extreme reverence for the common law which he knew so well, he
                    defended it alike against the Court of Chancery, the ecclesiastical courts,
                    and·the royal prerogative. In a narrow spirit, and strongly influenced, no
                    doubt, by his enmity to the chancellor, Egerton, he sought to prevent the
                    interference of the Court of Chancery with even the unjust decisions of the
                    other courts. In , the case of an appeal from a sentence given in the King’s
                    Bench, he advised the victorious, but guilty, party to bring an action of
                    praemunire against all those who had been concerned in the appeal, and his
                    authority was stretched to the utmost to obtain the verdict he desired. On the
                    other hand, Coke has the credit of having repeatedly braved the anger of the
                    king. He freely gave his opinion that the royal proclamation cannot make that an
                    offence which was not an offence before. An equally famous but less satisfactory
                    instance occurred during the trial of Peacham, a divine in whose study a sermon
                    had been found containing libellous accusations against the king and the
                    Government. There was nothing to give colour to the charge of high treason with
                    which he was charged, and the sermon had never been preached or published; yet
                    Peacham was put to the torture, and Bacon was ordered to confer with the judges
                    individually concerning the matter. Coke declared such conference to be illegal,
                    and refused to give an opinion, except in writing, and even then he seems to
                    have said nothing decided. But the most remarkable case of all occurred in the
                    next year (1616). A trial was held before Coke in which one of the counsel
                    denied the validity of a grant made by the king to the bishop of Lichfield of a
                    benefice to be held <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">commendavi.</hi>
                    James, through Bacon, who was then attorney-general, commanded the chief-justice
                    to delay judgment till he himself should discuss the question with the judges.
                    At Coke’s request Bacon sent a letter containing the same command to each of the
                    judges, and Coke then obtained their signatures to a paper declaring that the
                    attorney-general’s instructions were illegal, and that they were bound to
                    proceed with the case. His Majesty expressed his displeasure, and summoned them
                    before him in the council-chamber, where he insisted on his supreme prerogative,
                    which, he said, ought not to be discussed in ordinary argument. Upon this all
                    the judges fell on their knees, seeking pardon for the form of their letter; but
                    Coke ventured to declare his continued belief in the loyalty of its substance,
                    and when asked if he would in the future delay a case at the king’s order, the
                    only reply he would vouchsafe was that he would do what became him as a judge.
                    Soon after he was dismissed from all his offices on the following charges,—the
                    concealment, as attorney-general, of a bond belonging to the king, a charge
                    which could not be proved, illegal interference with the Court' of Chancery, and
                    disrespect to the king in the case of commendams. He was also ordered by the
                    council to revise his book of reports, which was said to contain many
                    extravagant opinions (June 1616).</p>
                <p>Coke did not suffer these losses with patience. He offered his daughter Frances,
                    then little more than a child, in marriage to Sir John Villiers, brother of the
                    favourite Buckingham. Her mother, supported at first by her husband’s great
                    rival and her own former suitor, Bacon, objected to the match, and placed her in
                    concealment. But Coke discovered her hiding-place; and she was forced to wed ehe
                    man whom she declared that of all others she abhorred. The result was the
                    desertion of the husband and the fall of the wife. It is said, however, that
                    after his daughter’s public penance in the Savoy Church, Coke had heart enough
                    to receive her back to the home which he had forced her to leave. Almost all
                    that he gained by his heartless diplomacy was a seat in the council and in the
                    Star-Chamber.</p>
                <p>In 1620 a new and more honourable career opened for him. He was elected member of
                    parliament for Liskeard; and henceforth he was one of the most prominent of the
                    constitutional party. It was he who proposed a remonstrance against the growth
                    of Popery and the marriage of Prince Charles to the infanta of Spain, and who
                    led the Commons in the decisive step of entering on the journal of the House the
                    famous petition of the 18th December 1621, insisting on the freedom of
                    parliamentary discussion, and the liberty of speech of every individual member.
                    In consequence, together with Pym and Sir Robert Philips, he was thrown into
                    confinement; and, when in the August of the next year he was released, he was
                    commanded to remain in his house at Stoke-Poges during his Majesty’s pleasure.
                    Of the first and second parliaments of Charles I. Coke was again a member. From
                    the second he was excluded by being appointed sheriff of Buckinghamshire. In
                    1628 he was at once returned for both Buckinghamshire and Suffolk, and he took
                    his seat for the former county. After rendering othervaluable support to the
                    popular cause, he took a most important part in drawing up the great Petition of
                    Right. The last act of his public career was to <pb break="no"

                    the duke of Buckingham was bringing upon the country. At the close of the
                    session he retired into private life; and the six years that remained to him
                    were spent in revising and improving the works upon which, at least as much as
                    upon his public career, his fame now rests. He died on the 3d September
                    1633.</p>
