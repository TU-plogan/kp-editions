                <p><label type="entry">CONVEYANCING</label>, the art of preparing writings to effect
                    the transference or conveyance from one person to another of any piece of
                    property or valuable right. It is sometimes applied in a restricted sense to the
                    cumbrous forms which the feudal system has rendered necessary for the
                    transference and tenure of landed property. When left to shape itself by
                    individual practice, without legislative intervention, there were several causes
                    rendering such conveyancing cumbrous and complex. The theory of the feudal
                    tenures and hierarchy remaining unchanged throughout the social revolution which
                    had virtually abolished superiority and vassalage, and brought land out of
                    feudality into ordinary commerce, it became necessary to retain the feudal
                    ceremonies of the Middle Ages, and to adapt them by fictions and explanations to
                    modern exigencies. Hence, many years have not yet passed since, in Scotland,
                    when a field was bought and sold, a party of men assembled on it, and went
                    through the old form of symbolic investiture by the delivery of so much earth
                    and stone from the superior bailiff to the vassal’s attorney, who took
                    instruments and had the whole recorded at length by a notary of the empire. In
                    England, from the want of the general system of registration known in Scotland,
                    the complexities of conveyancing had become so inextricable, that one of the
                    most approved forms of transference was a fictitious suit and judgment of
                    possession called a fine and recovery. To these innate sources of complexity
                    must be added the timidity of conveyancers, who, afraid to commit themselves by
                    attempting to abbreviate or reconstruct the forms which they find in existence,
                    repeat them with additions from time to time as new circumstances must be
                    provided for. Hence, to keep conveyancing within rational bounds, the
                    legislature must interfere from time to time to sweep away excrescences, and
                    provide brief and simple forms. This, however, is a task which cannot be easily
                    accomplished, since it requires the very highest legal skill to adjust simple
                    forms to all exigencies, and anticipate the various shapes in which property may
                    fall to be dealt with. This service has been on various occasions performed by
                    distinguished lawyers; and, while it is productive of the greatest benefits to
                    society, it is one of the public services least susceptible of popular
                    appreciation. In 1834 the Act abolishing fines and recoveries created a reform
                    of this kind in the conveyancing of England, and a series of statutes passed in
                    1847 purified and simplified the conveyancing of Scotland.</p>
                <p>An attempt was made in 1862 to simplify the practice of conveyancing by two
                    Acts—one entitled an Act to Facilitate the Proof of Title to and Conveyance of
                    Real Estate, and the other the Declaration of Title Act, 1862. The former
                    (called also the Land Registry Act) provided for the registration of real
                    estates and of the title thereto. The latter was intended to enable persons
                    having interests in land to obtain a declaration of their title by which they
                    could give an indefeasible title to any person purchasing from them. Both
                    statutes have failed; of the latter a standard book of practice says, “it is
                    deemed unnecessary to detail its provisions.” A commission, reporting in 1868,
                    attributed the failure of the Registry Act to the principle of registering
                    indefeasible titles only. The “Act aimed at a standard of certainty and
                    perfection of title beyond what is ordinarily required in conveyancing
                    transactions, and hence as a natural consequence instead of facilitating it was
                    found in practice to impede the transfer of land.” Another attempt has been made
                    by the Land Transfer Act of 1875, which allows the registration of a possessory,
                    as well as of an absolute, title. It is the opinion of an eminent conveyancer
                    that the statute will probably achieve a success greater than that achieved by
                    its predecessors, but less than that which would be commensurate with the
                    ability and labour with which it has Been framed.</p>
                <p>Conveyancing, which in Scotland forms part of the ordinary business of a
                    solicitor, is in England almost a profession by itself. It is to a large extent
                    undertaken by barristers who devote themselves specially to the work. There is
                    also a class of conveyancers, qualified to be called to the bar, but not called,
                    who practise under annual certificates.</p>
                <p>An Act was passed in 1868 to consolidate the statutes relating to the
                    constitution and completion of titles to heritable property in Scotland, and to
                    make certain changes on the law of Scotland relating to heritable rights, and an

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0354-0325"/> Amendment Act was passed in the following year.
                    In 1874 the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act was passed, having for its object to
                    amend the law relating to land rights and conveyancing, and to simplify the
                    law.</p>
