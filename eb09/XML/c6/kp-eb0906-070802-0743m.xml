                    Coupar-Angus in Perthshire, is a royal and parliamentary burgh of Scotland, and
                    the principal town of the county of Fife. It stands on the left bank of the
                    Eden, in the centre of the Howe or Hollow of Fifeshire, about 6 miles from the
                    sea, and is about 32 miles distant by railway and ferry from Edinburgh. The
                    town-hall, the county hall, and the cornexchange are the chief public buildings,
                    and the principal educational establishment is the Madras Academy, originally
                    founded in 1823 by a joint-stock company, but extended and modified in keeping
                    with the will of Dr Bell, the well-known originator of the “Madras System,” who
                    left it a valuable endowment. The staple trade of Cupar has long been the
                    manufacture of linen; and it also possesses breweries, corn-mills, and
                    tan-yards. There are several collieries in the neighbourhood; and a stone quarry
                    and a considerable pottery exist at Cupar Muir, about a mile and a half to the
                    west of the town. The parliamentary burgh is a member of the St Andrews
                    district; its population in 1871 was 5105. Cupar received its municipal freedom
                    about 1356 by charter from David II. It was early remarkable for its castle,
                    which occupied the height to the east of the town now crowned by the academy
                    buildings, and was one of the principal strongholds of the Macduffs, the earls
                    or thanes of Fife. Being situated between Falkland and St Andrews, the town was
                    frequently visited by the Scottish kings; and in 1583 it was for a time the
                    residence of the court of James VI. The estate of Sir David Lindsay of the Mount
                    was within three miles of Cupar; and on a green esplanade in front of Macduff
                    Castle, still called the Play-field, the satirical drama of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Three Estates</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Tragedy of the
                    Cardinal</hi> were first performed. From the press of Mr Tullis in Cupar there
                    appeared about the beginning of the present century editions of Virgil, Horace,
                    and other classical authors, by Dr Hunter of St Andrews, which obtained high
                    reputation for their accurate typography. The Scotch proverb, “They that will to
                    Cupar maun to Cupar,” owes its origin to the fact that Cupar was the seat of a
                    court of justice, and refers originally to the obstinacy of persons determined
                    to appeal to the law.</p>
