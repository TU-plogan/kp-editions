                    were formerly enumerated, scattered throughout the tropical parts of both
                    hemispheres; but by referring the American plants to a different genus, the list
                    is now restricted to about 22 species. Of these 7 belong geographically to Asia;
                    and of the 15 African species 11 are found on the west coast, 2 in Central and
                    East Africa, and 2 are natives of Mauritius. Besides being found wild in
                    Abyssinia, the common coffee plant appears to be widely disseminated in Africa,
                    having been seen on the shores of the Victoria Nyanza and in Angola on the west
                    coast. Within the last year or two considerable attention has been devoted to a
                    West African species, <hi rend="italic">C. liberica,</hi> belonging to the
                    Liberian coast, with a view to its extensive introduction and cultivation. Its
                    produce, obtained from native plants, have been several years in the English
                    market.</p>
                <p>The common coffee shrub or tree is an evergreen plant, which under natural
                    conditions grows to a height of from 18 to 20 feet, with oblong-ovate,
                    acuminate, smooth, and shining leaves, measuring about 6 inches in length by 2⅜
                    wide. Its flowers, which are produced in dense clusters in the axils of the
                    leaves, have a five-toothed calyx, a tubular five-parted corolla, five stamens,
                    and a single bifid style. The flowers are pure white in colour, with a rich
                    fragrant odour, and the plants in blossom have a lovely and attractive
                    appearance, but the bloom is very evanescent. The fruit is a fleshy berry,
                    having the appearance and size of a small cherry, and as it ripens it assumes a
                    dark red colour. Each fruit contains two seeds embedded in a yellowish pulp, and
                    the seeds are enclosed in a thin membranous endocarp (the parchment). The seeds
                    which constitute the raw coffee of commerce are planoconvex in form, the flat
                    surfaces which are laid against each other within the berry having a
                    longitudinal furrow or groove. They are of a soft, semitranslucent, bluish or
                    greenish colour, hard and tough in texture. The regions found to be best adapted
                    for the cultivation of coffee are well-watered mountain slopes at an elevation
                    ranging from 1000 to 4000 feet above sea-level, in latitudes lying between 15°
                    N. and 15° S., although it is successfully cultivated from 25° N. to 30° S. of
                    the equator in situations where the temperature does not fall beneath 55° Fahr.
                    The Liberian coffee plant, <hi rend="italic">C. liberica,</hi> which has been
                    brought forward as a rival to the ordinarily cultivated species, is described as
                    a large leaved and large-fruited plant of a robust and hardy constitution. The
                    seeds yield a highly aromatic and fine-flavoured coffee; and so prolific is the
                    plant, that a single tree is said to have yielded the enormous quantity of 16 lb
                    weight at one gathering. It is a tree, moreover, which grows at low altitudes,
                    and it probably would flourish in many situations which have been proved to be
                    unsuitable for the Arabian coffee. Should it come up to the sanguine
                    expectations of Ceylon planters and others to whom it has been submitted, there
                    is no doubt that it will prove a formidable rival to the species which has
                    hitherto received the exclusive attention of planters. It grows wild in great
                    abundance along the whole of the Guinea coast.</p>
                <p>The early history of coffee as an economic product is involved in considerable
                    obscurity, the absence of historical fact being compensated for by an unusual
                    profusion of conjectural statements and by purely mythical stories. According to
                    a statement contained in a manuscript belonging to the Bibliothèque Nationale in
                    Paris, the use of coffee was known at a period so remote as 875 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> or exactly 1000 years ago. In a treatise
                    published in 1566 by an Arab sheikh it is stated that a knowledge of coffee was
                    first brought from Abyssinia into Arabia about the beginning of the 15th century
                    by a learned and pious Sheikh Djemal-eddin-Ebn-Abou-Alfagger. According to the
                    treatise alluded to the use of coffee as a beverage was prevalent among the
                    Abyssinians from the most remote period, and in Arabia the beverage when first
                    introduced only supplanted a preparation from the leaves of the cat, <hi
                        rend="italic">Celastrus</hi><hi rend="italic">edulis.</hi> Its peculiar
                    property of dissipating drowsiness and preventing sleep was taken advantage of
                    in connection with the prolonged religious services of the Mahometans, and its
                    use as a devotional antisoporific stirred up a fierce opposition on the part of
                    the strictly orthodox and conservative section of the priests. Coffee was by
                    them held to be an intoxicant beverage, and therefore prohibited by the Koran;
                    and the dreadful penalties of an outraged sacred law were held over the heads of
                    all who became addicted to its use. Notwithstanding the threats of divine
                    retribution, and though all manner of devices were adopted to check its growth,
                    the coffee-drinking habit spread rapidly among the Arabian Mahometans, and the
                    growth of coffee as well as its use as a national beverage became as inseparably
                    associated with Arabia as tea is with China. For about two centuries the entire
                    supply of the world, which, however, was then limited, was obtained from the
                    province of Yemen in South Arabia, where the celebrated Mocha or Mokha is still
                    cultivated.</p>
                <p>The knowledge of and taste for coffee spread but slowly outwards from Arabia
                    Felix, and it was not till the middle of the 16th century that coffee-houses
                    were established in Constantinople. Here also the new habit excited considerable
                    commotion among the ecclesiastical public. The popularity of the coffee-houses
                    had a depressing influence on the attendance at the mosques, and on that account
                    a fierce hostility was excited among the religious orders against the new
                    beverage. They laid their grievances before the sultan, who imposed a heavy tax
                    upon the coffee-houses, notwithstanding which they flourished and extended.
                    After the lapse of another hundred years coffee reached Great Britain, a
                    coffee-house having been opened in 1652 in London by a Greek, Pasqua Rossie.
                    Rossie came from Smyrna with Mr D. Edwards, a Turkey merchant, and in the
                    capacity of servant he prepared coffee daily for Mr Edwards and his visitors. So
                    popular did the new drink become with Mr Edwards’s friends that their visits
                    occasioned him great inconvenience to obviate which he <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n130/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0130-0111"/> directed Rossie to establish a public
                    coffee-house, which he accordingly did. The original establishment was in St
                    Michael’s Alley, Cornhill, over the door of which Rossie erected a sign with his
                    portrait, subsequently announcing himself to be “the first who made and publicly
                    sold coffee drink in England.” It is remarkable that the introduction of coffee
                    into England encountered the same hostility that it was fated to meet in other
                    countries. Charles II., in 1675, attempted to suppress coffee-houses by a royal
                    proclamation, in which it was stated that they were the resort of disaffected
                    persons “who devised and spread abroad divers false, malicious, and scandalous
                    reports, to the defamation of His Majesty’s Government, and to the disturbance
                    of the peace and quiet of the nation.” On the opinion of legal officials being
                    taken as to the legality of this step, an oracular deliverance was given to the
                    effect “that the retailing of coffee might be an innocent trade, but as it was
                    used to nourish sedition, spread lies, and scandalize great men, it might also
                    be a common nuisance.” In England as well as in other countries the most
                    effective check on the consumption of coffee was found to be a heavy tax, which,
                    while restricting honest trade, opened a &lt;hannel for extensive smuggling
                    operations. Coffee is spoken of as being in use in France between 1640 and 1660,
                    and thereafter it may be said that the use of coffee was an established custom
                    in Europe. It is noteworthy that the three principal dietetic beverages of the
                    world were introduced into Great Britain within a few years of each other. Cocoa
                    was the first of the three which actually appeared in Europe, having been
                    brought to Spain from South America; coffee followed, coming from Arabia by way
                    of Constantinople; and tea, the latest of the series, came from China by the
                    hands of the Dutch.</p>
                <p>Down to 1690 the only source of coffee supply was Arabia, but in that year
                    Governor-General Van Hoorne of the Dutch East Indies received a few coffee seeds
                    by traders who plied between the Arabian Gulf and Java. These seeds he planted
                    in a garden at Batavia, where they grew and flourished so abundantly that the
                    culture, on an extended scale, was immediately commenced in Java. One of the
                    first plants grown in that island was sent to Holland as a present to the
                    governor of the Dutch East India Company. It was planted in the Botanic Garden
                    at Amsterdam, and young plants grown from its seeds were sent to Surinam, where
                    the cultivation was established in 1718. Ten years later the plant was
                    introduced in the West Indian Islands, and gradually the culture extended
                    throughout the New World, till now the progeny of the single plant sent from
                    Java to Holland produces more coffee than is grown by all the other plants in
                    the world. The cultivation is now general throughout all civilized regions of
                    the tropical world. In point of quantity Brazil heads the list of coffee-growing
                    countries, its annual produce probably exceeding that of all other localities
                    combined. It is calculated that no less than 530,000,000 coffee trees are at
                    present flourishing throughout that empire. During the Brazilian financial year
                    ending 1872, more than 2,000,000 bags, each containing 160 H&gt;, were exported
                    from Brazil; and the United States alone absorb upwards of 200,000,000 lb of
                    Brazilian coffee annually. The other principal American localities for
                    coffee-growing are Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela, Guiana, Peru, and Bolivia,
                    with Jamaica, Cuba, Porto Rico, and the West Indian Islands generally. In the
                    East the principal coffee regions, following Brazil in amount, but much superior
                    in the quality of their produce, are Java and Ceylon. The annual produce of Java
                    reaches to about 130,000,000 ft); and from Ceylon about 100,000,000 lb is
                    annually exported. The culture of coffee is an important and rapidly growing
                    feature in Southern India, and it is also prosecuted in Sumatra, Réunion,
                    Mauritius, and Southern Arabia, and on the west coast of Africa. The present
                    total annual production of the world has been estimated to amount to not less
                    than 1,000,000,000 ft). At the beginning of the 18th century, while Arabia was
                    still the only source of supply, probably not more than 7,500,000 ft&gt; was
                    yearly exported from that country; the consumption of Europe in 1820 was stated
                    by A. Von Humboldt at about 140,000,000 ft), while 300,000,000 ft&gt; probably
                    represented the quantity used throughout the world. The yearly consumption in
                    Great Britain has for about 30 years been drooping in the face of a rapidly
                    increasing population and consuming capacity, while the quantity absorbed by
                    other countries has increased with extraordinary rapidity. The whole amount
                    entered for home consumption in 1790 was 973,110 ft»; and an increase in the
                    duty charged caused the consumption to drop in 1796 to 396,953 ft&gt;. A
                    reduction in the duty caused the consumption in 1808 to shoot up suddenly from
                    1,069,691 ft) in that year to 9,251,837 lb in 1809. The quantity consumed, never
                    again mounted so high till in 1825'it was affected by another reduction of duty,
                    and 10,760,112 lb was retained for the home market. Thereafter the consumption
                    rapidly ’ and steadily increased, reaching 22,669,253 ft) in 1830, 28,664,341 lb
                    in 1840, and in 1847 coming to its maximum of 37,441,373 ft), from which point
                    it again declined. In 1857 the consumption had fallen to 34,352,123 ft); in 1867
                    it was 31,567,760; and in 1869 it fell so low as 29,109,113 lb. The total
                    imports for the year 1874 amounted to 157,351,376 ft&gt;, but of this only
                    31,859,408 ft&gt; were retained for home consumption. The chief cause of the
                    declining popularity of coffee in Great Britain is doubtless to be found in the
                    extraordinary hold which its rival beverage—tea—has taken on the community; but
                    something of the falling off is also attributable to the extent to which coffee
                    was for a long period made the subject of adulteration and sophistication.
                    Indeed for some years, between 1840 and 1852, much of what was sold under the
                    name of coffee was actually chicory, a root which at that period was cultivated
                    and manufactured duty free, while coffee was subject to a heavy import duty.</p>
                <p>The different estimation in which coffee is held in various countries is well
                    brought out in the following estimate of the consumption per head calculated
                    from the official returns for 1873 :—</p>

                <p>The commercial distinctions as established in the British market relate—first, to
                    qualities, as “fine,” “middling,” “ordinary,” “low,” and “triage,” the last
                    being broken and damaged seeds; and secondly, to localities of production,</p>
                <p>Shape, size, and colour of seeds are the principal elements which determine the
                    commercial value of coffee. Shape, according to Mr W. P. Hiern (in a
                    communication to the Linnean Society, April 20, 1876), is related to the
                    particular part of the plant upon which the seed grows; size and succulence
                    correspond with the nature of the locality of growth; and colour has reference
                    to the degree of maturity attained by the fruit at the time of gathering. The
                    highly <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n131/mode/1up"

                    result of the coalescence of the two seeds within the fruit, thus producing the
                    appearance of a single rounded seed, usually of small size, whence the name.
                    Regarding the famous Mocha or « Mokha” coffee of Arabia, Mr W. G. Palgrave has
                    the following remarks :—</p>
                <p>“The best coffee, let cavillers say what they will, is that of Yemen, commonly
                    entitled ‘Mokha,’ from the main port of exportation. Now, I should be sorry to
                    incur a lawsuit for libel or defamation from our wholesale or retail tradesmen;
                    but were the particle <hi rend="italic">not</hi> prefixed to the countless
                    labels in London shop windows, that bear the name of the Red Sea haven, they
                    would have a more truthy import than what at present they convey. Very little,
                    so little indeed as to be quite unappreciable, of the Mokha or Yemen berry ever
                    finds its way westward of Constantinople. Arabia itself, Syria, and Egypt
                    consume fully two-thirds, and the remainder is almost exclusively absorbed by
                    Turkish and Armenian oesophagi. Nor do these last get for their share the best
                    or the purest. Before reaching the harbours of Alexandria, Jaffa, Beyrout,
                    &amp;c., for further exportation, the northern bales have been, while yet on
                    their way, sifted and re-sifted, grain by grain, and whatever they may have
                    contained of the hard, rounded, half-transparent, greenish-brown berry, the only
                    one really worth roasting and pounding, has been carefully picked out by
                    experienced fingers; and it is the less generous residue of flattened, opaque,
                    and whitish grains which alone, or almost alone, goes on board the shipping. So
                    constant is this selecting process that a gradation, regular as the degrees in a
                    map, may be observed in the quality of Mokha, that is, Yemen coffee, even within
                    the limits of Arabia itself, in proportion as one approaches to or recedes from
                    Wadi Nejrãn and the neighbourhood of Mecca, the first stages of the radiating
                    mart.’’</p>
                <p>The “Mocha” of the English market is principally the produce of India, but a good
                    deal of American coffee is also passed into consumption under that abused
                    name.</p>
                <p>The conditions most favourable for coffee planting are found in hilly situations,
                    where the ground is at once friable, well drained, and enriched by the washing
                    down of new soil from above by the frequent rains. The seeds are first sown in a
                    nursery, and the young plants when they are a few inches high are planted out in
                    the permanent plantation at distances from each other of from 6 to 8 feet. The
                    operation of planting is one which requires great care, and much labour must be
                    expended on drainage, weeding, and cleaning the plantation, and in pruning or
                    “handling” the plants. Chiefly for convenience of securing the crop, the trees
                    are rarely allowed to exceed from 4 to 6 feet in height, and being so pruned
                    down they extend their branches laterally in a vigorous manner. The plants begin
                    bearing in their second year, and by the third year they should yield a fairly
                    remunerative crop. The berries are ready for picking when they have assumed a
                    dark-red colour and the skin shrivels up. Immediately after the berries are
                    gathered they are conveyed to the storehouse, where they undergo the operation
                    of pulping; and on some hill estates in Ceylon, having suitable situation and
                    water supply, the gathered berries are carried by a water run through galvanized
                    pipes to the store. The pulping is performed in an apparatus having two
                    roughened cylinders which move in opposite directions. Between these the berries
                    are carried forward with a flow of water, and the seeds are deprived of their
                    surrounding pulp, being left invested in the skin or parchment. In this
                    condition they are spread out to dry, and as soon as practicable they are freed
                    from the husk or parchment by passing them between heavy wooden rollers and
                    winnowing away the broken husks. The shelled coffee is then sized by passing it
                    down a tube perforated throughout its length with holes of regularly increasing
                    diameter, and the various sizes are next hand-picked to free them from defective
                    or malformed seeds, the coffee is then ready to pack for export. A tree in good
                    bearing will yield from 1∣ to 2 ⅛ of berries in a year; but its fertility
                    depends largely upon conditions of climate, situation, and soil. Generally trees
                    planted in lofty dry situations and in light soils yield small berries, which
                    give a rich aromatic coffee, while in low, flat, moist climates a more abundant
                    yield of a large-sized berry is obtained. The greater weight of the coarser
                    qualities of coffee more than makes up for the smaller price obtained for them
                    as against the higher cost of the finer growths; and therefore quality is too
                    often sacrificed to quantity.</p>
                <p>The cultivation of coffee is attended with many risks and jnuch anxiety. In
                    Ceylon, where British capital and enterprize have hitherto found their principal
                    scope, the estates are exposed to the attacks of a most mischievous and
                    destructive rodent, the coffee or Golunda rat. A species of insect called the
                    coffee bug, <hi rend="italic">Lecanium cqffeae,</hi> is a still more formidable
                    and alarming pest with which planters have to contend. Of recent years prominent
                    attention has been drawn to two diseased conditions arising in Singalese and
                    Indian plantations by fungus growths. The first, called the coffee-leaf disease,
                    appeared in Ceylon in 1869, and in Mysore a year later. The fungus in this case,
                        <hi rend="italic">Hemileia</hi><hi rend="italic">vastatrix,</hi> is
                    endophytous, growing within the substance of the leaf, and while no effective
                    cure has been discovered for it, it is not yet clear that it seriously affects
                    the quality or amount of coffee yielded by the plants. The second, known as the
                    coffee-rot, on the other hand, works great havoc in the Mysore plantations, in
                    which it has been observed, being especially hurtful in wet seasons.</p>
                <p>This fungus has been examinee! by Mr Μ. C. Cooke, who names it <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pellicularia kole-rota,</hi> and describes the affected leaves as being
                    covered with a slimy gelatinous film, under which the leaves become black and
                    quickly drop off, as do also the clusters of coffee berries.</p>
                <p>Raw coffee seeds are tough and horny in structure, and are devoid of the peculiar
                    aroma and taste which are so characteristic of the roasted seeds. In minute
                    structure coffee is so distinct from all other vegetable substances that it is
                    readily recognized by means of the microscope, and as roasting does not destroy
                    its distinguishing peculiarities, microscopic examination forms the readiest
                    means of determining the genuineness of any sample. The substance of the seed,
                    according to Dr Hassall, consists “of an assemblage of vesicles or cells of an
                    angular form, which adhere so firmly together that they break up into pieces
                    rather than separate into distinct and perfect cells. The cavities of the cells
                    include, in the form of little drops, a considerable quantity of aromatic
                    volatile oil, on the presence of which the fragrance and many of the active
                    principles of the berry depend” (see fig. 2). The testa or investing membrane of
                    the seeds has a layer of long cells with a peculiar pitted structure. In
                    chemical composition the seeds are complex, and they contain variable
                    proportions of proximate principles. The following represents the average
                    constitution of raw coffee according to the analysis of Μ. Payen :—</p>

                <p>The physiological and dietetic value of coffee depends principally upon the
                    alkaloid caffeine which it contains, in common with tea, cocoa, maté or Paraguay
                    tea, guarana, and the African kola nut. Its commercial value is, however,
                    determined by the amount of the aromatic oil, caffeone, which develops in it by
                    the process of roasting. By prolonged keeping it is found that the richness of
                    any seeds in this peculiar oil is increased, and with increased aroma the coffee
                    also yields a blander and more mellow beverage. Stored coffee loses weight at
                    first with great rapidity, as much as 8 per cent, having been found to dissipate
                    in the first year of keeping, 5 per cent, in the second, and 2 per cent, in the
                    third; but such loss of weight is more than compensated by improvement in
                    quality and consequent enhancement of value.</p>
                <p>In the process of roasting, coffee seeds swell up by the liberation of gases
                    within their substance,—their weight decreasing in proportion to the extent to
                    which the operation is carried. Roasting also develops with the aromatic
                    caffeone above alluded to a bitter soluble principle, and it liberates a portion
                    of the caffeine from its combination with caffetannic acid. Roasting is an
                    operation of the greatest nicety, and one, moreover, of a crucial nature, for
                    equally by insufficient and by excessive roasting much of the aroma of the
                    coffee is lost; and its infusion is neither agreeable to the palate nor
                    exhilarating in its influence. The roaster must judge of the amount of heat
                    required for the adequate roasting of different qualities, and while that is
                    variable, the range of roasting temperature proper for individual kinds is only
                    narrow. In Continental countries it is the practice to roast in small
                    quantities, and thus the whole charge is well under the control of the roaster;
                    but in Britain large roasts are the rule, in dealing with which much difficulty
                    is experienced in producing uniform torréfaction, and in stopping the process at
                    the proper moment. The coffee-roasting apparatus is usually a malleable iron
                    cylinder mounted to revolve over the fire on a hollow axle which allows the
                    escape of gases generated during torréfaction. Messrs W. and G. Law of Edinburgh
                    have introduced a very ingenious adaptation of the cylinder whereby a compound
                    simultaneous horizontal and vertical motion is secured, causing the seeds to be
                    tossed about in all directions and communicating a uniform heat to every portion
                    of the cylinder. The roasting of coffee should be done as short a time as
                    practicable before the grinding for use, and as ground coffee especially parts
                    rapidly with its aroma, the grinding should only be done when coffee is about to
                    be prepared. Any ground coffee which may be kept should be rigidly excluded from
                    the air.</p>
                <p>While Arabia produces the choicest variety of coffee, the roasting of the seeds
                    and the preparation of the beverage are also here conducted with unequalled
                    skill. Mr W. G. Palgrave gives the following account of these operations in his
                        <hi rend="italic">Central and Eastern Arabia :—</hi></p>
                <p>“Without delay Sowelylim begins his preparations for coffee. These open by about
                    five minutes’ blowing with the bellows, and arranging the charcoal till a
                    sufficient heat has been produced. Next he places the largest of the
                    coffee-pots, a huge machine, and about two-thirds full of clear water, close by
                    the edge of the glowing coal· pit, that its contents may become gradually warm
                    while other operations are in progress. He then takes a dirty knotted rag out of
                    a niche in the wall close by, and having untied it, empties out of it three or
                    four handfuls of unroasted coffee, the which he places on a little trencher of
                    platted grass, and picks carefully out any blackened grains, or other
                    non-homologous substances commonly to be found intermixed with the berries when
                    purchased in gross; then, after much cleansing and shaking, he pours the grains
                    so cleansed into a large open iron ladle, and places it over the mouth of the
                    funnel, at the same time blowing the bellows and stirring the grains gently
                    round and round till they crackle, redden, and smoke a little, but carefully
                    withdrawing them from the heat long before they turn black or charred, after the
                    erroneous fashion of Turkey and Europe; after which he puts them a moment to
                    cool on the grass platter. He then sets the warm water in the large coffeepot
                    over the fire aperture, that it may be ready boiling at the right moment, and
                    draws in close between his own trouserless legs a large stone mortar with a
                    narrow pit in the middle, just enough to admit the black stone pestle of a foot
                    long and an inch and a half thick, which he now takes in hand. Next pouring the
                    half-roasted berries into the mortar he proceeds to pound them, striking right
                    into the narrow hollow with wonderful dexterity, not ever missing his blow till
                    the beans are smashed, but not reduced into powder. He then scoops them out, now
                    reduced to a sort of coarse reddish grit, very unlike the fine charcoal powder
                    which passes in some countries for coffee, and out of which every particle of
                    real aroma has long since been burned or ground. After all these operations he
                    takes a smaller coffee-pot in hand, fills it more than half with hot water from
                    the larger vessel, and then, shaking the pounded coffee into it, sets it on the
                    fire to boil, occasionally stirring it with a small stick as the water rises, to
                    check the ebullition and prevent overflowing. Nor is the boiling stage to be
                    long or vehement; on the contrary, it is and should be as slight as possible. In
                    the interim he takes out of another rag-knot a few aromatic seeds called heyl,
                    an Indian product, but of whose scientific name I regret to be wholly ignorant,
                    or a little saffron, and after slightly pounding these ingredients, throws them
                    into the simmering coffee to improve its flavour,—for such an additional spicing
                    is held indispensable in Arabia, though often’omitted elsewhere in the East.
                    Sugar, I may say, would be a totally unheard-of profanation. Last of all, he
                    strains off the liquor through some fibres of the inner palm-bark, placed for
                    that purpose in the jug-spout, and gets ready the tray of delicate
                    party-coloured grass and the small coffee-cups ready for pouring out.”</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that were proper attention bestowed upon the preparation of
                    coffee it would become a much more popular beverage in Great Britain than it now
                    is; but to obtain it in perfection much greater care is requisite than is
                    necessary in the case of tea. To obtain coffee with a full aroma it must be
                    prepared as an infusion with boiling water, or the water may simply be allowed
                    to reach the boiling point after infusion and nothing more. Dr Parkes has,
                    however, pointed out that by infusion alone much of the valuable soluble matter
                    in ground coffee remains unextracted; and he recommends that the coffee which
                    has already been used for infusion should be preserved and boiled, and that the
                    liquor therefrom should be used for infusing a fresh supply. By this means the
                    substance of the previously infused coffee and the aroma of the new are obtained
                    together. Among the numerous devices which have been proposed for preparing
                    coffee, none is more elegant and efficient than an apparatus constructed by Mr
                    James R. Napier, F.R.S., for which a patent was obtained by Mr David Thomson of
                    Glasgow. It consists of a glass globe <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (fig. 3), an
                    infusing jar <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> of glass or porcelain and a bent tube ι
                    c. of block tin or ' German silver fitted by a Cork stopper into the neck of the
                    globe and passing to the bottom of the jar, where it ends iu a finely perforated
                    disc. The appa ratus also requires a spirit lamp <hi rend="italic">d</hi> or
                    other means of communicating a certain amount of heat to the globe. The coffee
                    is infused with <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n133/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0133-0114"/> boding water in the jar, and a small quantity
                    of boiling water is also placed in the globe. The tube is then fitted in, and
                    the spirit lamp is lighted under the globe. The steam generated expels the air
                    from the globe, and it bubbles up through the jar. When the bubbles of air cease
                    to appear almost the whole of the air will have been ejected, and on withdrawing
                    the lamp the steam in the globe condenses, creating a vacuum, to fill up which
                    the infused coffee rushes up through the metal tube, being at the same time
                    filtered by the accumulated coffee grounds around the perforated disc. An error
                    of very frequent occurrence in the preparation of coffee, which results probably
                    from the habit of tea-making, consists in using too little coffee. For a pint of
                    the infusion from an ounce to an ounce and a half of coffee ought to be used.
                    According to the experiments of Aubert a cup of coffee made from a Prussian loth
                    (’ 587 oz.) contains from 15 to 1 ’ 9 grains of caffeine.</p>
                <p>Coffee belongs to the medicinal or auxiliary class of food substances, being
                    solely valuable for its stimulant effect upon the nervous and vascular system.
                    It produces a feeling of buoyancy and exhilaration comparable to a certain stage
                    of alcoholic intoxication, but which does not end in depression or collapse. It
                    increases the frequency of the pulse, lightens the sensation of fatigue, and it
                    sustains the strength under prolonged and severe muscular exertion. The value of
                    its hot infusion under the rigours of Arctic cold has been demonstrated in the
                    experience of all Arctic explorers, and it is scarcely less useful in tropical
                    regions, where it beneficially stimulates the action of the skin. It has been
                    affirmed that coffee and other substances containing the alkaloid caffeine have
                    an influence in retarding the waste of tissue in the human frame, but careful
                    and extended observation has demonstrated that they have no such effect.</p>
                <p>Although by microscopic, physical, and chemical tests the purity of coffee can be
                    determined with perfect certainty, yet ground coffee is subjected to many and
                    extensive adulterations. Chief among the adulterant substances, if it can be so
                    called, is chicory root; but it occupies a peculiar position, since very many
                    people on the Continent as well as in Great Britain deliberately prefer a
                    mixture of chicory with coffee to pure coffee. Chicory is indeed destitute of
                    the stimulant alkaloid and essential oil for which coffee is valued; but the
                    facts that it has stood the test of prolonged and extended use, and that its
                    infusion is, in some localities, used alone, indicate that it performs some
                    useful function in connection with coffee, as used at least by Western
                    communities. For one thing, it yields a copious amount of soluble matter in
                    infusion with hot water, and thus gives a specious appearance of strength .and
                    substance to what may be really only a very weak preparation of coffee. The
                    mixture of chicory with coffee is easily detected by the microscope, the
                    structure of both, which they retain after torréfaction, being very
                    characteristic and distinct. The granules of coffee, moreover, remain hard and
                    angular when mixed with water, to which they communicate but little colour;
                    chicory, on the other hand, dwelling up and softening, yields a deep brown
                    colour to water in which it is thrown. The specific gravity of an infusion of
                    chicory is also much higher than that of coffee. Among the numerous other
                    substances used to adulterate coffee are roasted and ground roots of the
                    dandelion, carrot, parsnip, and beet; beans, lupins, and other leguminous seeds;
                    wheat, rice, and various cereal grains; the seeds of the broom, fenugreek, and
                    iris; acorns; and “negro coffee,” the seeds of <hi rend="italic">Cassia</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">occidentalis.</hi> These with many more similar substances
                    have not only been used as adulterants, but under various high-sounding names
                    several of them have been introduced as substitutes for coffee; but they have
                    neither merited nor obtained any success, and their sole effect has been to
                    bring coffee into undeserved disrepute with the public.</p>
                <p>The leaves of the coffee tree contain caffeine in larger proportion than the
                    seeds themselves, and their use as a substitute for tea has frequently been
                    suggested. The leaves are actually so used in Sumatra, but being destitute of
                    any attractive aroma such as is possessed by both tea and coffee, the infusion
                    is not palatable. It is, moreover, not practicable to obtain both seeds and
                    leaves from the same plant, and as the commercial demand is for the seed alone,
                    no consideration either of profit or of any dietetic or economic advantage is
                    likely to lead to the growth of coffee trees on account of their leaves. <hi
