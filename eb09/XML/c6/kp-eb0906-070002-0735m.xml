                    took his degrees in arts, and obtained a fellowship. He took the degree of B.A.
                    in 1653; and, having proceeded Μ. A. in 1656, he was next year incorporated to
                    the same degree in the university of Oxford. For some time he applied himself to
                    the study of physic; and although he did not adhere to this profession, he
                    retained his knowledge of anatomy and medicine. Payne informs us that “he
                    distinguished himself, whilst he was a fellow of the college, by the performance
                    of his academical exercises. He went out batchelor of divinity at a publick
                    commencement; and tho’ it was hardly known that the same person performed those
                    great exercises twice, yet such was the expectation he had raised, that he was
                    afterwards sollicited to keep the act at another publick commencement for his
                    doctor’s degree.” He took the degree of B.D. in 1663, and that of D.D. in 1680.
                    Among his contemporaries and intimate friends were Dr Hezekiah Burton, Sir
                    Samuel Moreland, who was distinguished as a mathematician, Sir Orlando
                    Bridgeman, who became keeper of the great seal, and Samuel Pepys.</p>
                <p>To this academical connection he appears to have been in a great measure indebted
                    for his subsequent advancement in the church. When Bridgeman was appointed lord
                    keeper, he nominated Cumberland and Burton as his chaplains, nor did he
                    afterwards neglect the interest of either. Cumberland’s first preferment was the
                    rectory of Brampton, in Northamptonshire, which was bestowed upon him in 1658 by
                    Sir John Norwich. He then quitted the university, and went to reside on his
                    benefice, where he zealously devoted himself to the duties of his sacred office,
                    and to the prosecution of those abstruse studies to which he had long been
                    addicted. In 1661 he was appointed one of the twelve preachers of the
                    university. His character was very remote from that of a preferment-hunter; and
                    in this unambitious retirement he might have spent the remainder of his life, if
                    the lord keeper, who obtained his office in 1667, had not invited him to London,
                    and soon afterwards bestowed upon him the rectory of Allhallows at Stamford. In
                    his new situation he acquired new credit by the fidelity with which he
                    discharged his important functions. In addition to his ordinary duties, he
                    undertook the weekly lecture, and thus was obliged to preach thrice every week
                    in the same church. This labour he constantly and assiduously performed, and in
                    the mean time found sufficient leisure, as well as inclination, to prosecute his
                    scientific and philological studies.</p>
                <p>At the mature age of forty he published his earliest work, entitled <hi

                    Lectorem,” contributed by the authors’ friend Dr Burton. It appeared during the
                    same year with Fuffendorf’s <hi rend="italic">De Jure Naturae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Gentium.</hi> This work of the English
                    divine was highly commended in a subsequent publication of the German lawyer,
                    and his weighty suffrage must have had the effect of making it known on the
                    Continent. The book was reprinted at Lübeck in 1683, and again in 1694. It was
                    likewise reprinted at Dublin. As the work was printed in London while the author
                    was residing at Stamford, the first edition contains many typographical errors;
                    nor are they removed in the subsequent editions. Bentley afterwards undertook to
                    revise the entire text, and, according to his grandson’s account, he most
                    effectually performed this task; but Barbeyrac, who had the use of the corrected
                    copy, and who was a more competent judge of its value, entertained a less
                    favourable opinion. This copy is now in the library of Trinity College,
                    Cambridge. The author’s family intended to publish a splendid edition of the
                    work, but their laudable design was never executed.</p>
                <p>Tyrrell, who was the grandson of Archbishop Ussher, and is himself well known as
                    a writer on history and politics, digested Cumberland’s doctrines into a new
                    form, and published a considerable volume under the following title: <hi

                    Mr Hobbs's Principles put into another method: with the Right Reverend Author's

                    complete English version of the original work was published by John Maxwell, Μ.
                    A., prebendary of Connor, under the title of <hi rend="italic">A Treatise of the
                    Laws of Nature,</hi> &amp;c., London, 1727, 4to. A French translation was
                    executed by Barbeyrac, and published at Amsterdam in 1744.</p>
                <p>Having thus established a solid reputation, Dr Cumberland next prepared a work on
                    a very different subject,— <hi rend="italic">An Essay towards the Recovery of
                    the Jewish Measures and Weights, comprehending their Monies; by help of ancient
                    standards, compared with ours of England: useful also to state many of those of
                    the Greeks and Romans, and the Eastern Nations,</hi> London, 1686, 8vo. This
                    work, which is dedicated to his friend Pepys, obtained a copious notice from
                    Leclerc, and was translated into French.</p>
                <p>About this period he was greatly depressed, like many other good men, by
                    apprehensions respecting the growth of Popery; but his fears were at length
                    dispelled by the Revolution, which likewise brought along with it another
                    material change in his circumstances. In the course of the year 1691, he went,
                    according to his custom on a post-day, to read the newspaper at a coffee-house
                    in Stamford, and there, to his great surprise, he read that the king had
                    nominated Dr Cumberland to the bishopric of Peterborough. The face of the bishop
                    elect was scarcely known at court, and he had resorted to none of the usual
                    methods of advancing his temporal interest.</p>
                <p>“Being then sixty years old,” says his great-grandson, “he was with difficulty
                    persuaded to accept the offer, when it came to him from authority. The
                    persuasion of his friends, particularly Sir Orlando Bridgeman, at length
                    overcame his repugnance; and to that see, though very moderately endowed, he for
                    ever after devoted himself, and resisted every offer of translation, though
                    repeatedly made and earnestly recommended. To such of his friends as pressed an
                    exchange upon him he was accustomed to reply, that Peterborough was his first
                    espoused, and should be his only one; and, in fact, according to his principles,
                    no church revenue could enrich him; for I nave heard my father say that, at the
                    end of every year, whatever overplus he found upon a minute inspection of his
                    accounts was by him distributed to the poor, reserving only one small deposit of
                    £25 in cash, found at his death in his bureau, with directions to employ it for
                    the discharge of his funeral expenses,—a sum in his modest calculations fully
                    sufficient to commit his body to the earth.” <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0736-0701"/> To the duties of his new station he applied
                    himself with great assiduity. His charges to the clergy are described as plain
                    and unambitious, the earnest breathings of a pious mind. His old age was fresh
                    and vigorous, nor did he discontinue his episcopal visitations till after he
                    attained his eightieth year. When Dr Wilkins published the New Testament in
                    Coptic, he presented a copy to the bishop, who began to study the language after
                    he had completed the age of eighty-three. “At this age,” says his chaplain, “he
                    mastered the language, and went through great part of this version, and would
                    often give me excellent hints and remarks, as he proceeded in reading of it.” He
                    died in 1718, in the eighty-seventh year of his age: he was found sitting in his
                    library, in the attitude of one asleep, and with a book in his hand. The
                    great-grandson of Bishop Cumberland was Richard Cumberland, the dramatist, the
                    subject of the following notice.</p>
                <p>Bishop Cumberland was eminently distinguished by his gentleness and humility. He
                    was of a temper so cool and sedate that it could not be roused to anger, and
                    through the whole course of his life his soul is represented as having been in a
                    constant state of calmness and serenity, hardly ever ruffled by any passion. The
                    theory which he maintains in his principal work is founded on benevolence, and
                    it naturally flowed from the habitual temperament of the author’s mind. He was a
                    man of a sound understanding, improved by extensive learning, and has left
                    behind him several monuments of his talents and industry.</p>
                <p>The care of Cumberland’s posthumous publications devolved upon his domestic
                    chaplain Payne, who soon after the bishop’s death edited “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Sanchoniatho</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">s

                    history by Eratosthenes Cyrenaeus’s Canon, which Dicaearchus connects with the
                    first Olympiad. These authors are illustrated with many historical and
                    chronological remarks, proving them to contain a series of Phoenician and
                    Egyptian chronology, from the first man to the first Olympiad, agreeable to the
                    Scripture accounts,” Lond. 1720. The preface contains an account of the life,
                    character, and writings of the author, which was likewise published in a
                    separate form, and exhibits a pleasing picture of his happy old age. A German

                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Legibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae.</hi> The merits
                    of the work are almost confined to the general character and substance of the
                    speculation it contains, for its style is destitute of both strength and grace,
                    and its reasoning is diffuse and immethodical to a trying degree. Its main
                    design is to combat the principles which Hobbes had promulgated as to the
                    constitution of man, the nature of morality, and the origin of society, and to
                    prove, in opposition to what he had maintained, that self-advantage is not the
                    chief end of man, that force is not the source of personal obligation to moral
                    conduct nor the foundation of social rights, and that the state of nature is not
                    a state of war. The views of Hobbes seem to Cumberland utterly subversive of
                    religion, morality, and civil society, and he endeavours, as a rule, to
                    establish directly antagonistic propositions. He refrains, however, from
                    denunciation; he uses only calm and moderate language, and is a uniformly fair
                    opponent up to the measure of his insight.</p>
                <p>Laws of nature are defined by him as “immutably true propositions regulative of
                    voluntary actions as to the choice of good and the avoidance of evil, and which
                    carry with them an obligation to outward acts of obedience, even apart from
                    civil laws and from any c msiderations of compacts constituting governments.”
                    This definition he says will be admitted by all parties. Some deny that there
                    are any such laws, but they will grant as readily as their opponents that this
                    is what ought to be understood by them. There is thus common ground for the two
                    opposing schools of moralists to join issue. The question between them is, Do
                    such laws exist or do they not? In reasoning thus Cumberland obviously forgot
                    what the position maintained by his principal antagonist really was. Hobbes must
                    have refused to accept the definition proposed. He did not deny that there were
                    laws of nature, laws antecedent to government, laws even in a sense eternal and
                    immutable. The virtues as means to happiness seemed to him to be such laws. They
                    precede civil constitution, which merely perfects the obligation to practise
                    them. He expressly denied, however, that “they carry with them an obligation to
                    outward acts of obedience, even apart from civil laws and from any consideration
                    of compacts constituting governments.” And many besides Hobbes must have felt
                    dissatisfied with the definition. It is the reverse of unambiguous or luminous.
                    In what sense is a law of nature a “proposition î” Is it as the expression of a
                    constant relation among facts, or is it as the expression of a divine
                    commandment 1 A proposition is never in itself an ultimate fact although it may
                    be the statement of such a fact. And in what sense is a law of nature an
                    “immutably true” proposition î Is it one which men always and everywhere accept
                    and act on, or merely one which they always and everywhere ought to accept and
                    act on <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> The definition, in fact, raises various doubts
                    and difficulties, and can scarcely be said to clear away any.</p>
                <p>The existence of such laws as are defined may, according to Cumberland, be
                    established in two ways. The inquirer may start either from effects or causes.
                    The former method had been taken by Grotius, Sharrock, and Selden. They had
                    sought to prove that there were universal truths, entitled to be called laws of
                    nature, from the concurrence of the testimonies of many men, peoples, and ages
                    regarding them, through collecting the opinions of persons widely removed in
                    space and time from one another, and through generalizing the operations of
                    certain active principles. Cumberland admits this method to be valid, but he
                    prefers the other, that from causes to effects, as showing more convincingly
                    that the laws of nature carry with them a divine obligation. It not only
                    establishes laws of nature as universal, but as having been meant to be; it
                    shows that man has been constituted as he is in order that they might be. In the
                    prosecution of this method he expressly declines to have recourse to what he
                    calls “the short and easy expedient of the Platonists,” the assumption of innate
                    ideas of the laws of nature. He has not, he says, been so happy as to learn the
                    laws of nature by so simple a way. He thinksit ill-advised to build the doctrine
                    of natural religion and morality on an hypothesis which many philosophers, both
                    Gentile and Christian, had rejected, and which could not be proved against
                    Epicureans, the principal impugners of the existence of laws of nature. He
                    cannot assume, he says, without proof that such ideas existed from eternity in
                    the divine mind, but must start from what sense and experience furnish, and
                    thence by search into the nature of things discover what their laws are. It is
                    only through nature that we can rise to nature’s God. His attributes are not to
                    be known by direct intuition. He did not think, then, that the ground taken up
                    by More, Cudworth, and the other members of the Cambridge Platonic school was
                    such as they could hold against an adversary like Hobbes or from which they
                    could successfully assail him. His sympathies, however, were all on their side.
                    He wished success to their efforts, and he would do nothing to diminish their
                    chances of success. He would not even oppose the doctrine of innate ideas,
                    because it looked with a friendly eye upon piety and morality. He granted that

                <p>All the laws of nature, Cumberland maintains, may be reduced to one,—the law of
                    universal benevolence, of effort to promote the happiness of all rational
                    agents. This, he thinks, is the root and source of the entire world of moral
                    good. “No action can be called morally good which does not in its own nature
                    contribute somewhat to the happiness of men.” The theory of Cumberland implies
                    as an antecedent the system of Hobbes. Had there not been a theory of
                    selfishness, a doctrine which made self-love the universal principle of conduct,
                    we should not have had the whole nature of virtue resolved into a principle of
                    benevolence as it was by Cumberland. His opinion was evidently a reaction from
                    the opposite. In his dislike of the selfish theory he was tempted to carry his
                    refutation of it to the uttermost and maintain the negative in the directest
                    terms of antithesis. There was no other so forcible mode of denying the
                    obnoxious theory as by positively affirming and defending its contrary,·—that no
                    virtuous action whatever is self-regarding, or·, in other words, that the only
                    principle of right conduct is benevolence. The principle, therefore, which he
                    lays down as fundamental is that to pursue to the utmost of our power the
                    general good of the whole system of rational beings is to contribute to the
                    utmost of our power to the good of each of its parts, our own individual
                    happiness inclusive, and that to pursue an opposite end is to entail opposite
                    results, and among others our own individual misery. It is just the opposite of
                    the central idea of Hobbes. The happiness of the whole community, according to
                    Hobbes, will be best promoted if each man looks to himself and attends to his
                    own interests. The happiness of each individual, according to Cumberland, will
                    be best promoted if each man begins by endeavouring to promote the happiness of
                    the whole society. Both were right and both were wrong. Man is to a great extent
                    ruled by selfishness; the uncivilized man almost wholly. In savages and in
                    children selfishness is a decidedly stronger principle than benevolence. The
                    human being is keenly susceptible to its own sensational pleasures and pains
                    when almost incapable of entertaining any wide or elevated conceptions of
                    general good. Benevolence as a steady and vigorous principle of action does not
                    manifest itself early in the history either of the individual or of the race.
                    Then, there is a good deal of sense and truth in saying, Let the individual take
                    care of himself and the common good will be thereby best secured. It is far from
                    certain that if every man were setting the common good before him as his direct
                    and immediate object the great majority of them would not do more harm than
                    good. If the selfishness of the ignorant be bad, there is danger of their
                    benevolence being worse. On the other hand, Hobbes was wrong in affirming that
                    man is governed solely by self-interest, and Cumberland was right in maintaining
                    that disinterested benevolence is a principle of human nature. It exists from
                    the first in the human constitution, although only in germ, and moral progress
                    is marked throughout by its growth in strength. History shows us the obstacles
                    interposed by the narrowness and darkness of the human understanding, the
                    coldness and selfishness of the human heart, the jealousies of classes, and the
                    antipathies of nations continuously, if slowly, yielding in favour of universal
                    benevolence, benevolence to all rational and even sentient beings. Thus far the
                    truth is with Cumberland. His error is when he asserts that benevolence is the
                    sole principle of virtue. This clearly is an error, although it is one in which
                    he was followed by Hutcheson and some other philosophers. Benevolence cannot be
                    legitimately made to include love to God and the exercises of piety nor what
                    have been called the personal virtues. It is only itself virtuous when brought
                    under conformity to the moral law.</p>
                <p>In attempting to prove that all the virtues are forms or varieties of benevolence
                    Cumberland never appeals to history, although he believed that the law of
                    universal benevolence had been accepted by all nations and generations; and he
                    carefully abstains from arguments founded on revelation, feeling that it was
                    indispensable to establish the principles of moral right on nature as a basis.
                    There was another line of reasoning open to him, viz., deduction of the
                    propriety of certain actions from the consideration of the character and
                    position of rational agents in the universe; and this is that which he follows.
                    He argues that all that we see in nature is framed so as to avoid and reject
                    what is dangerous to the integrity of its constitution; that the human race
                    would be an anomaly in the world had it not for end its conservation in its best
                    estate; that benevolence of all to all is what in a rational view of the
                    creation ^ is alone accordant with its general plan; that various peculiarities
                    of man’s body indicate that he has been made to co-operate with his fellow men
                    and to maintain society; and that certain faculties of his mind explicitly and
                    positively show the common good to be more essentially connected with his
                    perfection than any pursuit of private advantage. The whole course of his
                    reasoning proceeds on, and is pervaded by, the principle of final causes.</p>
                <p>To the question, What is the foundation of rectitude î he replies, the greatest
                    good of the universe of rational beings. He may be regarded as the founder of
                    the utilitarian school in England, which numbers a Hume, Bentham, the Mills, and
                    Bain among its adherents. His utilitarian <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ism is
                    quite distinct from what is known as the selfish system; it errs by going to the
                    contrary extreme, by almost absorbing individual good in universal good. Nor
                    does it look merely to the lower pleasures, the pleasures of sense, for the
                    constituents of good, but rises above them to include especially what tends to
                    perfect, strengthen, and expand our true nature. Existence and the extension of
                    our powers of body, thought, and feeling are held to be good for their own sakes
                    without respect to enjoyment. Cumberland’s views on this point were long
                    abandoned by utilitarians as destroying the homogeneity and self-consistency of
                    their theory; but J. S. Mill and some recent writers have reproduced them,
                    without recognition of their paternity, as necessary to its defence against
                    charges not less serious then even inconsistency.</p>
                <p>The answer which Cumberland gives to the question, Whence comes our obligation to
                    observe the laws of nature <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> is that happiness flows from
                    obedience, and misery from disobedience to them, not as the mere results of a
                    blind necessity, but as the expressions of the divine will—the reward attached
                    by that will to obedience, and the punishment attached by it to disobedience.
                    This reward and punishment, supplemented by future retribution, the happy
                    immortality which awaits the good and the misery coming on the wicked, are, in
                    his view, the sanctions of the laws of nature, the sources of our obligation to
                    obey them. To the other great ethical question, How are moral distinctions
                    apprehended? he replies that it is by means of reason, of right reason. But by
                    right reason he means merely the power of rising to general laws of nature from
                    particular facts of experience. It is no peculiar faculty or distinctive
                    function of mind; it involves no original element of cognition; it begins with
                    sense and experience; it is gradually generated and wholly derivative. This
                    doctrine lies only in germ in Cumberland, but will be found in full flower in
                    Hartley, Mackintosh, and later associationists. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r.</hi><hi
