                    the E. and S. the China Sea, on the W. the Gulf of Siam, the kingdom of
                    Cambodia, and the Laos country tributary to the Siamese empire. According to the
                    most probable estimates the empire of Anam has an area of from 190,000 to
                    230,000 square miles, or about the same extent as France; while the French
                    colony occupies about 21,630. The western limits of this empire are, however,
                    very imperfectly determined, and the regions to the west of Tong-king are still
                    unexplored. The N. of Cochin China is washed by the Gulf of Tong-king, a great
                    inlet formed by the coast of Tong-king on the W. and the island of Hai-nan and
                    the peninsula of Lien-chow on the E. At its mouth, towards Tiger Island and the
                    S.W. part of Hai-nan, the gulf has a breadth of about 138 English miles, which
                    almost represents its medium breadth. Near the west coast are several islands,
                    and towards the head of the gulf a great number of islets and banks. From
                    soundings which have been taken throughout its whole extent, it has been found
                    that in the middle of the entrance there is a depth of from 210 to 330 feet,
                    which diminishes towards the coasts; and the depth is less half-way up the gulf,
                    where the bottom is generally soft.</p>
                <p>Passing along the coast from Cape Pak-loung, where the frontier commences between
                    China and Tong-king, we find that all the part north of the Gulf of Tong-king is
                    little known; it is said to be fringed with banks and rocks, and some large
                    islands have been visited by English vessels in pursuit of pirates. The most
                    important are the Pirate Islands, a group of multitudinous islets in a bay of
                    which the Chinese name is Fie-tzi-long, and the Pearl Islands. Next we find the
                    mouth of the River Lach-Huyen, which is deep, but obstructed about a mile inland
                    by a bar preventing the entrance of any vessel drawing more than 11⅜ feet, Next
                    come the mouths of the River of Tong-king, Song-Coi, or Hong-kiang (Red River).
                    The delta of this river is formed by four main branches—Cua<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cua signifies embouchure.</p></note> trà
                    lay, Cua lac, Cua dhai, Cua ba lat—which communicate with each other both by
                    natural channels, called arroyos, and by artificial canals. These are charged
                    with alluvial matter, and produce considerable increase of soil. Mr E. Ploix, a
                    hydrographic engineer who visited the gulf between 1857 and 1859, estimates the
                    annual advance of the coast at about 330 feet. It is by these rivers that
                    Ke-cho, or Ha-noi, the capital of Tong-king, can be reached. This town and the
                    port of Ninh-hai, in the province of Hai-dzuong, were opened to foreign commerce
                    by a treaty concluded between France and the Government of Hué, March 15, 1874.
                    To allow a ship to pass up the river at any season its draught must not exceed
                    5¾ feet, and from the end of May to the end of November, vessels drawing 12 feet
                    can cross the bars.</p>
                <p>About 18° 10' N. lat. lies the island Hon-tseu, or Goats’ Island, near a
                    prominent cape about 1410 feet high. A little to the south of Hon-tseu is the
                    point to the north of which there is only one tide in 24 hours, except during a
                    period of two weeks, when on three or four days there are two tides of little
                    force. At Cape Boung-Qui-hoa there is a good anchorage well sheltered by
                    islands, of which the chief is South Watcher Island, or South Vigie. In front of
                    Cape Lay is the little Tiger Island, where the west coast of the Gulf of
                    Tong-king terminates. On the China Sea the coast presents successively, as we
                    pass southward, the mouth of the River Hué, defended by a fort; the Bay of
                    Tourane, wide, deep, and well sheltered, but unfortunately situated in an
                    unhealthy district, and in the poorest part of the country; the Bay of
                    Quit-Quit, a very good anchorage, and the safest on this coast during the N.E.
                    monsoon; the Island Cu-lao-ró, or Pulo Canton; the port of Qui-nhon, or Binh
                    dhinh, in the province of this name, opened to European commerce by the treaty
                    of March 1874; the bay and the commodious port of Phu-yen; Cape Varela, or
                    Mui-nai, a very lofty peak visible 30 nautical miles out at sea, and to the
                    south of the cape the port of Hon-ro, safe at all seasons of the year; the Bay
                    of Phan-rang and Cape Padaran, or Mui-Din, districts bordered by coral banks;
                    Cape Ke-ga; and Cape Ba-kee, which forms the limit between lower Cochin China
                    and the kingdom of Anam. Between Cape Padaran and Cape Ba-kee the coast is low,
                    and bordered by dangerous banks. In front are the little islands of Pulo Cecir,
                    Catwick, and Pulo Sapate, of difficult access.</p>
                <p>The whole of lower Cochin China being formed of alluvial deposits, its coast is
                    very low, has little irregularity of surface, and is covered with mangroves. The
                    different mouths of the River Cambodia or Me-kong form a delta of more than 70
                    miles in extent. The soil is subject to frequent changes on account of the
                    alluvial deposits of the river, which is bordered by sand banks stretching
                    seawards out of sight of land. At the entrance of the River Don-nai, which leads
                    to Saigon, rises Cape St Jacques, a peak 920 feet above the level of the sea. At
                    45 sea-miles from the coast and from the mouths of the Me-kong, is the island of
                    Pulo Condore, with a good port, and a penitentiary established by the French
                    Government. On the west coast of Lower Cochin China, in the Gulf of Siam, is the
                    port of Ha-Tien, communicating by a canal with one of the arms of the
                    Me-kong.</p>
                <p>To the north of Tong∙king terminate the last underfalls of the high plateau of
                    Thibet; a long chain stretches parallel to the Sea of China as far as the south
                    of the kingdom of Anam of which it forms the western boundary. The highest point
                    of this chain does not exceed 5250 feet. Between the last ramifications of the
                    mountains of Thibet there descend from the plateau of Yun-nan and in a southeast
                    direction the affluents of the great River Song-Coi or Hong-kiang, which
                    undergoes periodic variations in the supply of its waters. In the month of March
                    it is very <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n113/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0113-0094"/> low; but every year about the month of July
                    it leaves its channel, floods a part of the country, and rolls along with a very
                    powerful current. Before passing Ha-noi it receives the tribute of two great
                    rivers, known to the natives by the names of the Black Biver and the Clear
                    River.</p>
                <p>The kingdom of Anam, closely shut in between the mountains and the sea, is
                    drained by numerous but unimportant streams. Lower Cochin China, or French
                    Cochin China, is abundantly watered by the numerous mouths and the canals which
                    form the delta of the Mekong or Cambodia. This river takes its rise in the
                    mountains of Thibet, waters the southern provinces of China and the district of
                    Laos tributary to Siam, and crosses through the kingdom of Cambodia, where it
                    divides into three branches. The first, which does not penetrate into Cochin
                    China, turns towards the north-west and loses itself in the Lake of Tonli Sap.
                    The second, which takes the name of Hinder River (Hau-giang or Song-sau) flows
                    south-east, enters Cochin China, communicates with the Sea of Siam by the Canal
                    Vinh-te of Ha-tien and by that of Rach-gia, and enters the China Sea by two
                    mouths. The third branch, named Front River (Tien-giang or Song-truoc), flows
                    parallel to the preceding, divides at Vinh-long into four arms, and debouches by
                    six mouths. These streams form numerous islands and communicate with each other
                    by means of canals or arroyos. In spite of the length of its course and the
                    great mass of its waters, the Me-koπg cannot be utilized as a means of
                    communication with Central China, because of the numerous <hi rend="italic"
                        >ressauts</hi> and rapids which encumber its course. It is besides subject
                    to an annual flood; the waters begin to rise in May, attain their maximum in
                    October, and decrease until March. From the month of March to the month of May
                    the level is almost constant. Two other streams water the east of Lower Cochin
                    China,—the Vaico, divided into two branches, and the Donnai. These rivers
                    .communicate with each other and with the mouths of the Me-kong by numerous
                    arroyos. The Donnai receives the Saigon River; and it is by this means that the
                    largest vessels reach the town of that name.</p>
                <p>The climate of the north of Anam differs much from that of the south. In
                    Tong-king, though it is usual to divide the year into a dry and a wet season,
                    there is properly speaking no dry season. In December and January the
                    thermometer falls to 41° or 43° Fahr. Summer corresponds to the period of the
                    rains from the end of April to the month of August; and at that time it is
                    excessively hot. Storms are frequent, and the coasts are often visited by
                    typhoons. At the same time Tong-king is a healthy country; the weather during
                    four months is excellent; and the French colony of Saigon might find there—what
                    has never been discovered in Cochin China proper—a suitable site for a
                    sanatorium. The climate of the French colony is unhealthy for Europeans; they
                    cannot be acclimatized. The mortality of the troops is rather high; and before
                    their residence was shortened to two years it might be calculated at 9 or 10 per
                    cent, for a three years’ residence, lhe chief cause of the maladies which affect
                    Europeans is the character of the soil. On the banks of the rivers, in the salt
                    marshes, and along the shores of the sea, intermittent fevers of great severity
                    are frequent. In the forest land rages the terrible wood-fever, from which the
                    native himself cannot escape, though be lives unharmed in the midst of the rice
                    swamps. But the great plague of Lower Cochin China is dysentery,—a disease
                    which, endemic in all warm countries, proves in Cochin China particularly fatal.
                    It is to it that the greater part of the deaths among Europeans are to be
                    ascribed; and they often succumb to its effects after their return to their
                    native country. Most of the children born of European parents in Cochin China
                    die a short time after birth. White women are there exposed to many dangers,
                    especially during their delivery; and there is consequently little hope of
                    forming there a race of creoles. The native women, on the contrary, are very
                    prolific, and suffer surprisingly little in childbirth. It is also interesting
                    to observe that the Anamites, like the races of the extreme East, recover from
                    ,wounds of the greatest severity, which would infallibly kill Europeans even in
                    their ow n country.</p>
                <p>The mean temperature of Lower Cochin China is 83° Fahr. The greatest heat in
                    April and May within doors is 97° Fahr. In the mornings of December the
                    temperature falls to 65° Fahr, The year is divided into the dry season, which
                    corresponds to the N.E. monsoon, and the rainy season, which corresponds to the
                    S.W. monsoon. What renders the climate peculiarly injurious and enervating is
                    that, besides the very slight difference between the temperatures of day and
                    night, the hygrometric readings are always very high. The surface of Cochin
                    China, composed of recent alluvial deposits, is absolutely flat, and in some
                    places is below the level of the sea. The slightness of the slope of this vast
                    plain allows the tide to advance far inland, and the borders of the rivers to be
                    alternately covered with water and exposed to the perpendicular rays of the sun.
                    All the coasts are covered by mangroves (the marsh-tree of the tropics), which
                    with their dull monotonous foliage everywhere betoken the unhealthiness of the
                    soil.</p>
                <p>The finest species of tiger, the royal tiger, is to be met with from the
                    mountains which bound Tong-king on the north as far as the south of Lower Cochin
                    China; and a short time ago it was still to be found in the wooded hills close
                    to Saigon. The other wild animals are the panther, the rhinoceros, the
                    elephant—which the people of Anam have not learned to domesticate—the cocoa-nut
                    bear, the stag, the wild boar, the wild ox, and monkeys of various kinds. The
                    domestic animals are goats, horses, buffaloes (with which the Indo-Chinese carry
                    on the difficult and unhealthy cultivation of the rice-fields), and pigs, which
                    are kept in great numbers. There are numerous birds of many species, which—ac in
                    all tropical regions—are remarkable for the beauty of their plumage. Among the
                    rest may be mentioned pea-fowl, pheasants, turtle-doves, the green pigeons of
                    Pulo Condore, paroquets, hornbills, sultana fowls, and various species of wading
                    birds and palmipeds. The rivers abound with life; and the fish, though of poor
                    quality, form an important part of the food of the people. They are caught,
                    along with frogs and snakes, even in the mud of the rice-fields. The crocodile
                    is frequently met with, and adds another item to the native cuisine. This hot
                    damp country swarms with reptiles, of which some species are very dangerous.
                    Among these are the huge cobra di capello (AEcyα), many species of adders, and
                    the immense python, which is of much use in destroying during the night all
                    kinds of rats, including the intolerable musk-rat.</p>
                <p>The forests furnish several kinds of timber for building. In the plains and
                    valleys are numerous fruit-trees, —the banana, the guava, the papaw, the
                    medlar-tree, the orange, the citron, and, most abundant of all, the cabbagepalm
                    and the cocoa-tree, and the cinnamon of which Tongking furnishes a superior
                    quality. The people of Anam are essentially agricultural. Besides rice, which is
                    the chief production of the country, the cultivated lands furnish cotton,
                    mulberry, sugar-cane, maize, betel-nut, and vegetables, especially potatoes,
                    earth-nuts, and pepper. Tea is cultivated also, especially in Tong-king, but the
                    people of Anam do not know how to prepare it.</p>
                <p>To the traveller who pays only a brief visit the kingdom of Anam appears ill
                    provided with metals. If a mine be discovered the natives forbid access to it,
                    and still more frequently<pb break="no"

                    to give any information. Two excellent authors, Messrs T. Crawfurd and M <hi
                        rend="superscript"> t</hi> Culloch have supported this false opinion in
                    their works. More precise information has, however, been obtained, recent
                    explorers of the country stating that Tong-king is very rich in metals, and
                    furnishes especially gold, silver, brass, zinc, and iron. It is from Tong-king
                    that the famous tam-tams, the manufacture of which is still a secret to
                    Europeans, are obtained. Cochin China, properly so-called, furnishes also gold,
                    silver, brass, and marble; and coal is found there in several places. Lower
                    Cochin China, like all alluvial plains, is poor in minerals; quarries, however,
                    of granite and of jet are worked.</p>
                <p>There is little industrial activity in Anam, but in Tong-king the manufacture of
                    articles inlaid with mother-of-pearl is carried on. From China Cochin China
                    receives a large quantity of manufactured goods, cotton and silk stuffs,
                    porcelain, and tea. The importation from France is also very considerable. The
                    principal exports are rice (which forms of itself half the sum total), salt
                    fish, provided principally by the fisheries at the mouth of the two chief
                    rivers, salt, undyed cotton, pepper, and the skins of animals. The great
                    commercial importance of Cochin China arises from the excellence of its
                    situation, as a way of communication with the rich and populous provinces of
                    middle China. England has long been seeking to open a route for trade between
                    the north-east of India, or Pegu, and the south-west of China, but up to the
                    present time, notwithstanding the courage and devotion of explorers, these
                    attempts have failed.</p>
                <p>From 1866 to 1868 a French expedition, commanded by Captain Doudart de Lagrée,
                    followed up the course of the Me-kong, and penetrated into middle China. This
                    expedition cost its chief his life, for he died in consequence of the fatigue
                    which he underwent in Yun-nan. This examination of the Me-kong proved that this
                    fine river is, as already noticed, unfit for regular navigation. Another route,
                    however, by the Tong-king, may be opened up; and it is comparatively easy and
                    habitually used by the natives. In 1872 Mr Dupuis, a French merchant, passed up
                    the course of the Hong-kiang as far as Mang-Hao, a town of Yun-nan, where the
                    river ceases to be navigable. He came down the river again in 1873. He declares
                    it to be navigable in every season, and has thus solved the problem which
                    Captain Doudart de Lagrée sought to solve by means of the Me-kong. Μ. Dupuis’s
                    expedition led the French authorities, at the solicitation of the Government of
                    Hué, to despatch Μ. Francis Garnier to the Tong-king; but the gallant explorer
                    was assassinated by pirates in the neighbourhood of Ha-noi.</p>
                <p>The native of Anam is the worst built and the ugliest of all the Indo-Chinese who
                    belong to the Mongolian race. He is scarcely of middle height, and is shorter
                    and less vigorous than his neighbours. His complexion is tawny, darker than that
                    of the Chinese, but clearer than that of the Cambodian; his skin is thick; his
                    forehead low; his skull slightly depressed at the top, but well developed at the
                    sides. His face is flat, with highly protruding cheek-bones, and is
                    lozenge-shaped or eurygnathous to a degree that is nowhere exceeded. His nose is
                    not only the flattest, but also the smallest among the Indo-Chinese; his mouth
                    is large, and his lips thick; his teeth are blackened and his gums destroyed by
                    the constant use of the betel-nut, the αreca-nut, and lime, a custom which
                    perhaps originated in hygienic reasons. His neck is short, his shoulders slope
                    greatly, his body is thick-set, large, all of one piece, as it were, and wanting
                    in suppleness. His pelvis is large, with a considerable separation of the upper
                    part of the femora, giving to his gait a curious swagger, which has, not without
                    reason, been described as theatrical. This odd swagger by itself suffices to
                    distinguish &lt;Λe Anamese from every other Indo-Chinese people without
                    exception. Another peculiarity, which especially distinguishes this race from
                    the other Indo-Chinese branches, is a greater separation of the big toe from the
                    rest than is found in any of the other peoples that walk bare-footed. It is
                    sufficiently general and well marked to serve as an ethnographic test; and it
                    indicates that the people of Anam are not descended—as some authors have
                    asserted—from a mingling of indigenous savages with the Chinese, but have
                    existed as a distinct race for a long time. According to Father Legrand de la
                    Liraye <hi rend="italic">(Notes ldstoriques</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">la nation</hi><hi rend="italic">Annamite,</hi> Saigon, 1865),
                    this curious feature has served to distinguish the people of Anam since the year
                    2285 B.c., that is to say, 63 years after the Biblical deluge. This statement,
                    taken as it is from the Chinese annals, shows that the Anamese could not have
                    received this characteristic from their neighbours; and it is a very curious
                    fact that it has been transmitted to the present inhabitants despite the
                    frequent intermarriages with other races'which must have taken place during this
                    period of forty centuries. The inhabitants of Lower Cochin China are evidently
                    weaker and smaller than those of Tong-king, and this probably results from their
                    dwelling in marshy rice-fields.</p>
                <p>In the midst of the Anamese live Cambodians and immigrant Chinese, the latter,
                    associated together-according to the districts they come from, carrying on
                    nearly all the commerce of the country. In the forests on the frontiers of
                    Cochin China dwell certain wretched savages called Mois, or Stiengs, of whom
                    little is known; and alongside of these are the Chams, a Mahometan people which
                    appear to be of Arab origin, and, in spite of a strong infusion of Chinese
                    blood, preserve the warlike qualities of their ancestors, their love of
                    fighting, their gay and open character, and their abstinence from theft. Their
                    stature is tall, and they are characterized by the enormous projection of the
                    soft parts of the abdomen. Their women, while mixing freely in society without
                    veiling, have a high-spirited virtue which forms a contrast to the corruption
                    that prevails around them. Their language shows that they once knew the lion and
                    the chamois; and while they are now inferior in civilization, they preserve
                    traces in their vocabulary of a higher condition. Among the different races
                    which inhabit Indo-China numerous mixtures take place. There are crosses of the
                    Anamite with the Hindu, with the Malay, with the Cambodian, and with the
                    Chinese. The last of these half breeds, who are called Min-huongs, are the most
                    numerous and interesting.</p>
                <p>Evidently derived from the Chinese, of which it appearsL to be a very ancient
                    dialect, the Anamese language is composed of monosyllables, of slightly varied
                    articulation, expressing absolutely different ideas according to the tone in
                    which they are pronounced. It is quite impossible to connect with our musical
                    system the utterance of the sounds of which the Chinese and Anamese languages
                    are composed. What is understood by a “tone” in this language is distinguished
                    in reality, not by the number of sonorous vibrations which belong to it, but
                    rather by a use of the vocal apparatus special to each. Thus, the sense will to
                    a native be completely changed according as the sound is the result of an
                    aspiration or of a simple utterance of the voice. Thence the difficulty of
                    substituting our phonetic alphabet for the ideographic characters of the
                    Chinese, as well as for the ideophonetic writing partly borrowed by the Anamese
                    from the letters of the celestial empire. We owe to the Jesuit missionaries the
                    introduction of an ingenious though very complicated system, which has caused
                    remarkable progress to be made in the employment of phonetic characters. By
                    means of six accents, one bar, and a crotchet, it is possible to note with
                    sufficient <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n115/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0115-0096"/> precision the indications of tone without
                    which the Anamese words have no sense for the natives. This system is
                    universally adopted in French Cochin China, and the new generation, almost
                    without exception, are able to read and write in Latin characters.</p>
                <p>The Anamese are idle, incapable of deep emotion, and fond of ease. They show much
                    outward respect for superiors and parents, but they take great delight in
                    mocking and banter. They cherish great love of their native soil and native
                    village, and cannot long remain far from home. On the whole they are mild, or
                    rather apathetic, but the facility with which they learn is remarkable.
                    Buddhism, mingled with coarse popular beliefs, is the dominant creed, but the
                    learned hold the doctrine of Confucius, and in truth the people of Anam are but
                    slightly religious. Nevertheless, like their neighbours, the Chinese and the
                    Cambodians, they have a great respect for the dead, and their worship almost
                    entirely consists of ceremonies in honour of their ancestors. Like the Chinese
                    they dispose of the body by inhumation. Among the savage tribes of the interior
                    there is scarcely any idea of a God, and the superstitious practices to which
                    they are addicted can scarcely be considered as the expression of a definite
                    religious idea. Christianity counts 400,000 adherents in Tong-king and 5000 in
                    Lower China.</p>
                <p>The system of government in the empire of Anam is pure and absolute monarchy
                    without any other constitution than powerful custom. The succession to the
                    throne follows the order of primogeniture. Between the citizens there exists the
                    most complete equality, since public offices are open to all, and there are no
                    other social distinctions than those due to office or fortune. The sovereign, at
                    once high priest and supreme judge, governs despotically with the assistance of
                    six ministers. The army, or rather the military list, for a large part of the
                    force exists only on paper, is composed of 80 regiments, with 500 men in each.
                    It is recruited from Cochin China; Tong-king furnishes no soldiers. It is under
                    the command of a commanderin-chief, a kind of constable of the kingdom, or grand
                    marshal, who is personally responsible for the defence of the citadel of Hué.
                    The marine, which has no ships, is composed of 30 regimeñts, under an
                    admiral-in-chief, who is assisted by a vice-admiral and two rear-admirals, each
                    of whom commands 10 regiments. The mandarins, as in China, form two distinct
                    classes—the civil and the military. The first class are scholars who have passed
                    literary examinations. The latter are chosen chiefly on account of physical
                    fitness; and it is only in the highest ranks that well-educated respectable men
                    are to be found. The people have a great regard for the learned, who have all
                    received a higher moral education,—that of Confucius. The mandarins are divided
                    into nine degrees, and each degree comprises two classes. Besides the French
                    colony, the empire of Anam is divided into 24 provinces placed each under the
                    authority of a governor. The province is subdivided into departments,
                    arrondissements, cantons, and communes. The French colony, administered by a
                    governor assisted by a privy council, comprehends the six ancient provinces of
                    the south. It is now divided into four provinces, bearing the names of their
                    chief cities,—Saigon, Mî-thô, Vinh-long, and Bassac. The provinces form together
                    19 inspectorships with an administrator of native affairs at the head of
                    each.</p>
                <p>The chief town and the ancient capital of Tong-king, Ha-noi, or Ke-cho (t.e., the
                    market), situated on one of the branches of the Song-Coi, though at present
                    greatly fallen, still contains at least 50,000 inhabitants. It possesses a very
                    large citadel, which serves as the residence of the viceroy and of the special
                    envoy or royal commissioner, who is the first authority in Tong-king. This
                    citadel, at present badly kept in repair and poorly equipped, was built in the
                    course of last century according to plans furnished by European engineers. The
                    provincial capitals of Hai-dzuong (30,000 inhabitants), Bac-Ninh, Nam-Dinh,
                    likewise possess important citadels; and that of Minh-binh, also the chief «town
                    of a province, is the strongest of all Tong-king. Hué, or Phu-tua-tien, capital
                    of the kingdom of Anam, is composed of two portions—the inner town, a vast
                    fortress built on the Vauban system according to the plans of French engineers,
                    and occupied by the Government; and the outer town, which is inhabited by the
                    mass of the population, who are estimated at 100,000 souls. Mention may also be
                    made of Tourane and Quin-nhon, or Binh-dhinh, important ports open to European
                    commerce. Saigon, the capital of the French colony, is composed of three towns
                    :—1st, an Asiatic town, inhabited by Anamese husbandmen, fishers, or servants,
                    by mercantile Chinamen, by Malays, Tagals, and Hindus engaged in various
                    occupations; 2d, the town of the colonists; and 3d, the Government town,
                    inhabited by the Government employés, administrators, officers, and physicians.
                    The houses are mainly built of brick. Two gardens, one belonging to the governor
                    and the other the botanical, overlook the town. The latter is very interesting,
                    containing as it does a fine collection of trees and plants, both indigenous and
                    exotic, as well as a very curious menagerie. At the port of Saigon 387 vessels
                    entered and 398 left in 1874, which forms about half of the whole maritime trade
                    in the colony. Eight miles from Saigon is the town of Cho-len <hi rend="italic"
                        >(i.e.,</hi> the great market), a Chinese town with an extensive commerce,
                    and according to some writers 80,000, according to others 30,000 or 40,000
                    inhabitants. The other towns of the colony are Go-cong to the south-west of
                    Saigon, where, in the midst of the rice fields, there lives an agricultural
                    population, which presents in all its purity the true Anamese type; Mî-thô, a
                    port on one of the arms of the Me kong, and the second town of the colony; the
                    fort and the town of Vinh-long; the fort and town of Chaudoc; Ha-tien, on the
                    Gulf of Siam, one of the most unhealthy places on the coast, inhabited by
                    Chinese and Anamese; and at the Cape St Jacques, the military port and fort of
                    Ba-ria.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to state the exact number of the population of the empire of
                    Anam, and authors vary greatly in their estimates. The data which appear most
                    worthy of credit give a total sum of 10 or 12 millions. As to the French colony,
                    the last official census of which the results have been published was made in
                    1873; it gives 1,487,200 inhabitants, of whom 49,500 were Chinese and 82,700
                    Cambodians. The Europeans numbered 1114, exclusive of the Government officials
                    and the garrison.</p>
                <p>The Anamese, according to their own annals, are natives of the south of China.
                    “In the 2d or 3d century before Abraham,” says Père Legrand de la Liraije, “four
                    barbarous tribes occupied the limits of the Chinese empire; to the south was the
                    tribe of the Giao-chi.” It is from this tribe that the Anamese claim to have
                    descended; and at the time when history begins to acquire some degree of
                    certitude, about 2357 before our era, the Chinese annals mention the Anamese
                    under the name of Giao-chi, which signifies “with the big toe.” According to
                    native scholars the history of this epoch is of a legendary character. It
                    results from their labours that for twenty centuries the race of Giao-chi was
                    governed in vassalage to the empire by a dynasty of Chinese origin, which lasted
                    till 257 B.c. From that date till 110 before the Christian era the throne was
                    held by two other vassal dynasties; and from 110 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    till 907 A.D. these dynasties were replaced by Chinese governors. In the
                    beginning of the 10th century some of the native chiefs, weary of the Chinese
                    rule, revolted; and their efforts were crowned with success. From 960 downwards,
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n116/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0116-0097"/> under the government of native princes, the
                    Anamese lived independent, and preserved rather the name than the reality of
                    vassalage to the Chinese empire. Since that time the nation, with a most
                    remarkable aptitude for expansion, has aggrandized itself at the expense of its
                    neighbours, and has conquered from the Cambodians Tsiampa and the six provinces
                    of the south which now form the French colony. It is to be noted that the
                    Cambodians, though endowed with physical force far superior to that of the
                    Cochin Chinese, have been beaten by them in every encounter.</p>
                <p>It is nearly a century since the first treaty of alliance was signed between
                    France and the kingdom of Anam. By this treaty, dated the 28th November 1787,
                    the king of Cochin-China ceded to France in full property the Peninsula of
                    Tourane and the Isle of Pulo-Condore. The agreement was only partially executed,
                    but it was sufficient to render the influence of France predominant in Cochin
                    China; and Christianity made rapid progress in Tong-king. At the death of the
                    king Gia-long, in 1820, the party hostile to strangers prevailed; and several
                    attempts to protect the French missionaries and establish the French influence
                    had failed, when in 1858, in consequence of the murder of Μ. Diaz,—who was put
                    to death by order of the king, merely on account of the news that a French ship
                    was cruising in sight of the coast,—a squadron was sent under the command of
                    Admiral Rigault de Genouilly, who seized Tourane. Shortly after the admiral made
                    explorations in the south, seeking a better situation for a settlement than
                    Tourane, and passing up the River Don-naï, he took possession of Saigon, the
                    true capital of Lower Cochin China. On the 5th June 1862 the court of Hué
                    accepted a treaty, by which it abandoned three provinces to France, and bound
                    itself to pay an indemnity of war. After various expeditions occasioned by
                    revolts, France occupied in 1867 the three other provinces of Lower Cochin
                    China, and after long negotiations a treaty was signed at Saigon, on the 15th
                    March 1874, definitively abandoning the six provinces to France. This treaty
                    opens besides to the commerce of all nations one port in eastern Cochin China
                    and one port in Tong-king, and guarantees liberty of transit from the sea as far
                    as Yun-nan.</p>
