                    (1808-1864), a famous English Orientalist, was born at Westbury, in Shropshire.
                    After being educated at the Free Grammar School of Newport, and at Christ
                    Church, Oxford, he took orders in 1832, became chaplain of Christ Church
                    College, sublibrarian of the Bodleian, and, in 1837, assistant keeper of MSS. in
                    the British Museum. He was afterwards appointed select preacher to the
                    university of Oxford, chaplain in ordinary to the queen, rector of St
                    Margaret’s, Westminster, and canon of Westminster. He was elected fellow of the
                    Royal Society, corresponding member of the German Oriental Society and of the
                    Institute of France, and foreign associate of the Institute, member of the
                    French Asiatic Society and of the Historico-Theolυgical Society of Leipsic, and
                    trustee of the British Museum. He died in 1864.</p>
                <p>Cureton’s most remarkable work was the edition with notes and an English
                    translation of the Epistles of St Ignatius to St Polycarp, the Ephesians, and
                    the Romans, from a Syriac MS., found in the monastery of St Mary Deipara, in the
                    desert of Nitria, near Cairo. He held that the MS. he used gave the truest text,
                    that all other texts were inaccurate, and that the epistles contained in the MS.
                    were the only genuine epistles of St Ignatius that we possess—a view which
                    received the support of F. C. Baur, Bunsen, and many others, but which was
                    opposed by Dr Wordsworth and by several German scholars. Cureton supported his
                    view by his <hi rend="italic">Vindiciae Ignatianae</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus Ignatianum,—a Complete Collection of the Ignatian Epistles,
                    genuine, interpolated, and spurious.</hi> He also edited a partial Syriac text
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Festal Letters of St Athanasius,</hi> which was
                    translated into English by Henry Burgess (1854), and published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Library of Fathers of the Holy Catholic Church; Remains of a very

                    Palimpsest;</hi> an Arabic work known as the <hi rend="italic">Thirty-first

                    the Creed of the Sunnites.</hi> Cureton also published several sermons, among
                    which was one entitled <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of the Trinity not
                    Speculative but Practical.</hi> After his death Dr W. Wright of the British
                    Museum edited with a preface the <hi rend="italic">Ancient Syriac Documents
                    relative to the earliest Establishment of Christianity in Edessa and the
                    neighbouring Countries, from the year of our Lord’s Ascension to the beginning
                    of the fourth Century; discovered, edited, and annotated by the late W.
                    Cureton.</hi></p>
