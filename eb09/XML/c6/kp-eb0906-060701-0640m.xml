                    strongly fortified seaport town of Russia and the great naval station of the
                    Russian fleet in the northern seas, the seat of the Russian admiralty and of a
                    military governor, is situated on the island of Kotlin, near the head of the
                    Gulf of Finland, twenty miles west of St Petersburg, of which it is the chief
                    port, in 59° 59' 30" N. lat., and 29° 46' 30" E. long. The island of Kotlin, or
                    Kettle (Finn., <hi rend="italic">Retusari,</hi> or Rat Island) is of calcareous
                    formation, and in general outline forms an elongated triangle, seven miles in
                    length by about one in breadth, with its base towards St Petersburg and the
                    mouths of the Neva, and its apex extending obliquely seawards. The eastern or
                    broad end is occupied by tho town of Cronstadt, and shoals extend for a mile and
                    a half from the western point of the island to the rock on which the Tolbaaken
                    lighthouse is built. The island thus divides the approach by sea to St
                    Petersburg into two channels; that on the northern side is obstructed by shoals
                    which extend across it from Kotlin to Lisi-ness on the mainland, and is only
                    passable by vessels drawing less than 15 feet; the southern channel, the highway
                    to the capital, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0641-0608"/> is narrowed by a spit which projects from
                    opposite Oranienbaum on the mainland, and, lying close to Cronstadt, has been
                    strongly guarded by batteries. The town of Cronstadt is built on level ground,
                    and is. thus exposed to inundations, from one of which it suffered in 1824. Its
                    streets are regular and well paved; the houses, with the exception of those
                    belonging to the Government, are chiefly of one story. On the south side of the
                    town there are three harbours—the large western or merchant harbour, capable of
                    containing 1000 ships, the western flank of which is formed by a great mole
                    joining the fortifications which traverse the breadth of the island on this
                    side, the middle harbour used chiefly for fitting out and repairing vessels, and
                    the eastern or war harbour for vessels of the Russian navy. The Peter and
                    Catherine Canals, communicating with the merchant and middle harbours, traverse
                    the town. Between them stood the old Italian palace of Prince Menschikoff—the
                    site of which is now occupied by a large building used as a school for pilots.
                    Among other public buildings may be mentioned the extensive naval hospital, the
                    British seamen’s hospital established in 1367, the civic hospital, admiralty,
                    arsenal, dockyards and foundries, custom-house, barracks, exchange, several
                    Greek churches, a Lutheran church, and English and Roman Catholic chapels.
                    Defending the navigable passages are Forts Alexander, Risbank, Constantine,
                    Peter the Great, Menschikoff, and Cronslott, all built of granite and armed with
                    heavy guns. During the Russian war of 1854-55 Cronstadt was considered
                    impregnable. Almost all vessels bound for St Petersburg touch at Cronstadt, and
                    those drawing more than 8 to 10 feet of water load and unload here, the goods
                    being conveyed to and from the capital in lighters. The port is ice-bound during
                    the winter months from November till April; but in other months about 3000
                    vessels enter and clear. There is regular steam communication with St
                    Petersburg, Peterhof and Oranienbaum, Revel, Helsingfors, Stockholm, Stettin,
                    Lubeck, and Havre. The exports consist chiefly of tallow, corn, hemp, and flax,
                    brought from the surrounding districts of the mainland. A very large proportion
                    of the inhabitants are sailors, and large numbers of artizans are employed in
                    the dockyards. The ironclad turret ship “Peter the Great” (9600 tons) and the
                    “Duke of Edinburgh” were built at Cronstadt in 1874-75. Cronstadt was founded in
                    1710 by Peter the Great, who took tho island of Kotlin from the Swedes in 1703.
                    The population at the census of 1867 was 45,115, but this varies very
                    considerably at different times of the year, the town being very full in summer
                    and partially deserted in winter.</p>
