                <p><label type="entry">CLIVE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label> (1725-1774),
                    Baron Clive of Plassy, in the peerage of Ireland, was the statesman and general
                    who founded the empire of British India before ho was forty years of age. He is
                    now represented by the Powis family, his son having been made earl of Powis in
                    the peerage of the United Kingdom. Clive was born on the 29th September 1725 at
                    Styche, the family estate in the parish of Moreton-Say, Market-Drayton,
                    Shropshire. We learn from himself, in his second speech in the House of Commons
                    in 1773, that as the estate yielded only £500 a year, his father followed the
                    profession of the law also. The Clives, or Clyves, formed one of the oldest
                    families in the county of Shropshire, having held the marior of that name in the
                    reign of Henry II. One Clive was Irish Chancellor of the Exchequer under Henry
                    VIII.; another was a member of the Long Parliament; Robert’s father sat for many
                    years for Montgomeryshire. His mother, to whom throughout life he was tenderly
                    attached, and who had a powerful influence on his career, was a daughter, and
                    with her sister Lady Sempill co-heir, of Nathaniel Gaskell of Manchester. Robert
                    was their eldest son. With his five sisters, all of whom were married in due
                    time, he ever maintained the most affectionate relations. His only brother
                    survived to 1825. Young Clive was the despair of his teachers. Sent from school
                    to school, and for only a short time at the Merchant Taylors’ school, which had
                    then a high reputation, he neglected his books for boyish adventures, often of
                    the most dangerous kind. But he was not so ignorant as it is the fashion of his
                    biographers to represent. He could translate Horace in after life, at the
                    opening of the book; and he must have laid in his youth the foundation of that
                    clear and vigorous English style which marked all his despatches, and made Lord
                    Chatham declare of one of his speeches in the House of Commons that it was the
                    most eloquent he had ever heard. From his earliest years, however, his ambition
                    was to lead his fellows; but he never sacrificed honour, as the word was then
                    understood, even to the fear of death. At eighteen he was sent out to Madras as
                    a “factor” or “writer” in the civil service of the East India Company. The
                    detention of the ship at Brazil for nine months enabled him to acquire the
                    Portuguese language, which, at a time when few or none of the Company’s servants
                    learned the vernaculars of India, he often found of use during his service
                    there. For the first two years of his residence he was miserable. He felt keenly
                    the separation from home; he was always breaking through the restraints imposed
                    on young “writers;” and he was rarely out of trouble with his fellows, with one
                    of whom he fought a duel. Thus early, too, the effect of the climate on his
                    health began to show itself in those fits of depression during one of which he
                    afterwards prematurely ended his life. The story is told of him by his
                    companions, though he himself never spoke of it, that he twice snapped a pistol
                    at his head in vain. His one solace was found in the Governor’s library, where
                    he sought to make up for past carelessness, not only by much reading, but by a
                    course of study. He was just of age, when in 1746 Madras was forced to
                    capitulate to Labourdonnais, during the war of the Austrian Succession. The
                    breach of that capitulation by Dupleix, then at the head of the French
                    settlements in India, led Clive, with others, to escape from the town to the
                    subordinate Fort St David, some twenty miles to the south. There, disgusted with
                    the state of affairs and the purely commercial duties of an East Indian
                    civilian, as they then were, Clive obtained an ensign’s commission.</p>
                <p>At this time India was ready to become the prize of the first conqueror who to
                    the dash of the soldier added the skill of the administrator. For the forty
                    years since the death of the Emperor Λurungzebe, the power of the Great Mogul
                    had gradually fallen into the hands of his provincial viceroys or soubadars. The
                    three greatest of these were the nawab of the Deccan, or South and Central
                    India, who ruled from Hyderabad, the nawab of Bengal, whose capital was
                    Moorshedabad, and the nawab or vizier of Oudh. The prize lay between Dupleix,
                    who had the genius of an administrator, or rather intriguer, but was no soldier,
                    and Clive, the first of a century’s brilliant succession of those
                    “soldier-politicals,” as they are called in the East, to whom, ending with Sir
                    Henry Lawrence, Great Britain owes the conquest and consolidation of its
                    greatest deperdency. Clive successively established British
                    ascend-encyaganist<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0018-0009"/> French influence in the three great provinces
                    under these nawabs. But his merit lies especially in the ability and foresight
                    with which he secured for his country, and for the good of the natives, the
                    richest of the three, Bengal. First, as to Madras and the Deccan, Clive had
                    hardly been able to commend himself to Major Stringer Lawrence, the commander of
                    the British troops, by his courage and skill in several small engagements, when
                    the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle forced him to return to his civil duties for a
                    short time. An attack of the malady which so severely affected his spirits led
                    him to visit Bengal, where he was soon to distinguish himself. On his return he
                    found a contest going on between two sets of rival claimants for the position of
                    viceroy of the Deccan, and for that of nawab of the Carnatic, the greatest of
                    the subordinate states under the Deccan. Dupleix, who took the part of the
                    pretenders to power in both places, was carrying all before him. The British had
                    been weakened by the withdrawal of a large force under Admiral Boscawen, and by
                    the return home, on leave, of Major Lawrence. But that officer had appointed
                    Clive commissary for the supply of the troops with provisions, with the rank of
                    captain. More than one disaster had taken place on a small scale, when Clive
                    drew up a plan for dividing the enemy’s forces, and offered to carry it out
                    himself. The pretender, Chunda Sahib, had been made nawab of the Carnatic with
                    Dupleix’s assistance, while the British had taken up the cause of the more
                    legitimate successor, Mahomed Ali, Chunda Sahib had left Arcot, the capital of
                    the Carnatic, to reduce Trichinopoly, then held by a weak English battalion.
                    Clive offered to attack Arcot that he might force Chunda Sahib to raise the
                    siege of Trichinopoly. But Madras and Fort St David could supply him with only
                    200 Europeans and 300 sepoys. Of the eight officers who led them, four were
                    civilians like Clive himself, and six had never been in action. His force had
                    but three field-pieces. The circumstance that Clive, at the head of this
                    handful, had been seen marching during a storm of thunder and lightning, led the
                    enemy to evacuate the fort, which the British at once began to strengthen
                    against a siege. Clive treated the great population of the city with so much
                    consideration that they helped him, not only to fortify his position, but to
                    make successful sallies against the enemy. As the days passed on, Chunda Sahib
                    sent a large army under his son and his French supporters, who entered Arcot and
                    closely besieged Clive in the citadel. An attempt to relieve him from Madras was
                    defeated. Meanwhile the news of the marvellous defence of the English reached
                    the Mahratta allies of Mahomed Ali, who advanced to Clive’s rescue. This led the
                    enemy to redouble their exertions, but in vain. After for fifty days besieging
                    the fort, and offering large sums to Clive to capitulate, they retired from
                    Arcot. The brave garrison had been so reduced by the gradual failure of
                    provisions that the sepoys offered to be content with the thin gruel which
                    resulted from the boiling of the rice, leaving the grain to their European
                    comrades. Of the 200 Europeans 45 had been killed, and of the 300 sepoys 30 had
                    fallen, while few of the survivors had escaped wounds. In India, we might say in
                    all history, there is no parallel to this exploit of 1751 till we come to the
                    siege of Lucknow in 1857. Clive, now reinforced, followed up his advantage, and
                    Major Lawrence returned in time to carry the war to a successful issue. In 1754
                    the first of our Carnatic treaties was made provisionally, between Mr T.
                    Saunders, the Company’s resident at Madras, and Μ. Godeheu, the French
                    commander, in which the English protégé, Mahomed Ali, was virtually recognized
                    as nawab, and both nations agreed to equalize their possessions. When war again
                    broke out in 1756, and the French, during Clive’s absence in Bengal, obtained
                    successes in the northern districts, his efforts helped to drive them from their
                    settlements. The lreaty of Paris in 1763 formally confirmed Mahomed Ali in the
                    position which Clive had won for him. Two years after, the Madras work of Clive
                    was completed by a firmaun from the emperor of Delhi, recognizing the British
                    possessions in Southern India.</p>
                <p>Ihe siege of Arcot at once gave Clive a European reputation. Pitt pronounced the
                    youth of twenty-seven who had done such deeds a “heaven-born general,” thus
                    endorsing the generous appreciation of his early commander, Major Lawrence. When
                    the Court of Directors voted him a sword worth £700, he refused to receive it
                    unless Lawrence was similarly honoured. He left Madras for home, after ten years
                    absence, early in 1753, but not before marrying Miss Margaret Maskelyne, the
                    sister of a friend, and of one who was afterwards well known as astronomer
                    royal. All his correspondence proves him to have been a good husband and father,
                    at a time when society was far from pure, and scandal made havoc of the highest
                    reputations. In after days, when Clive’s uprightness and stern reform of the
                    Company’s civil and military services made him many enemies, a biography of him
                    appeared under the assumed name of <hi rend="italic">Charles Carracioli,
                    Cent.</hi> All the evidence is against the probability of its scandalous stories
                    being true. Clive’s early life seems occasionally to have led him to yield to
                    one of the vices of his time, loose or free talk among intimate friends, but
                    beyond this nothing has been proved to his detriment. After he had been two
                    years at home the state of affairs in India made the directors anxious for his
                    return. He was sent out, in 1756, as governor of Fort St David, with the
                    reversion of the government of Madia”, and he received the commission of
                    lieutenant-colonel in the king’s army. He took Bombay on his way, and there
                    commanded the land force which captured Gheriah, the stronghold of the Màhratta
                    pirate, Angria. In the distribution of prize money which followed this
                    expedition he showed no little self-denial. He took his seat as govern&lt; r of
                    Fort St David on the day on which the nawab of Bengrl captured Calcutta. Thither
                    the Madras Government at once sent him, along with Admiral Watson. He entered on
                    the second period of his career.</p>
                <p>Since, in August 1690, Job Charnock had landed at the village of Chuttanutti with
                    a guard of one officer and 30 men, the infant capital of Calcutta had become a
                    rich centre of trade. The successive nawabs or viceroys of Bengal had been
                    friendly to it, till, in 1756, Suraj-ud-Dowlan succeeded his uncle at
                    Moorshedabad. His predecessor’s financial minister had fled to Calcutta to
                    escape the extortion of the new nawab, and the English governor refused to
                    deliver up the refugee. Enraged at this, Suraj-ud-Dowlah captured the old fort
                    of Calcutta on the 5th August, and plundered it of more than two millions
                    sterling. Many of the English fled to the ships and dropped down the river. The
                    146 who remained, were forced into “the Black Hole” in the stifling heat of the
                    sultriest period of the year. Only 23 came out alive. The fleet was as strong,
                    for those days, as the land force was weak. Disembarking his troops some miles
                    below the city, Clive marched through the jungles, where he lost bis way owing
                    to the treachery of his guides, but soon invested Fort William, while the fire
                    of the ships reduced it, on the 2d January 1757. On the 4th February he defeated
                    the whole army of the nawab, which had taken up a strong position just beyond
                    what is now the most northerly suburb of Calcutta. The nawab hastened to
                    conclude a treaty, under which favourable terms were conceded to the Company’s
                    trade, the factories and plundered property were restored, and an English mint
                    was established. In the accompanying agreement, offensive and defensive, Clive
                    appears under the name by which he was always known tj <pb break="no"

                    in war. The hero of Arcot had, at Angria’s stronghold, and now again under the
                    walls of Calcutta, established his reputation as the first captain of the time.
                    With 600 British soldiers, 800 sepoys, 7 field-pieces and 500 sailors to draw
                    them, he had routed a force of 34,000 men with 40 pieces of heavy cannon, 50
                    elephants, and a camp that extended upwards of four miles in length. His own
                    account, in a letter to the archbishop of Canterbury, gives a modest but vivid
                    description of the battle, the importance of which has been overshadowed by
                    Plassy. In spite of his double defeat and the treaty which followed it, the
                    madness of the nawab burst forth again. As England and France were once more at
                    war, Clive sent the fleet up the river against Chandernagore, while he besieged
                    it by land. After consenting to the siege, the nawab sought to assist the
                    French, but in vain. The capture of their principal settlement in India, next to
                    Pondicherry, which had fallen in the previous war, gave the combined forces
                    prize to the value of £130,000. The rule of Suraj-ud-Dowdah became as
                    intolerable to his own people as to the English. They formed a confederacy to
                    depose him, at the head of which was Jafíìer Ali Khan, his commander-in-chief.
                    Associating with himself Admiral Watson, Governor Drake, and Mr Watts, Clive
                    made a treaty in which it was agreed to give the office of souba, or viceroy of
                    Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, to Jaffier, who was to pay a million sterling to the
                    Company for its losses in Calcutta and the cost of its troops, half a million to
                    the English inhabitants of Calcutta, £200,000 to the native inhabitants, and
                    £70,000 to its Armenian merchants. Up to this point all is clear.
                    Suraj-ud-Dυwlah was hopeless as a ruler. His relations alike to his master, the
                    merely titular emperor of Delhi, and to the people left the province open to the
                    strongest. After “the Black Hole,” the battle of Calcutta, and the treachery at
                    Chandernagore in spite of the treaty which followed that battle, the East India
                    Company could treat the nawab only as an enemy. Clive, it is true, might have
                    disregarded all native intrigue, marched on Moorshedabad, and at once held the
                    delta of the Ganges in the Company’s name. But the time was not ripe for this,
                    and the consequences, with so small a force, might have been fatal. The idea of
                    acting directly as rulers, or save under native charters and names, was not
                    developed by events for half a century. The political morality of the time in
                    Europe, as well as the comparative weakness of the Company in India, led Clive
                    not only to meet the dishonesty of his native associate by equal dishonesty, but
                    to justify his conduct by the declaration, years after, in Parliament, that he
                    would do the same again. It became necessary to employ the richest Bengalee
                    trader, Omichund, as an agent between Jaffier Ali and the English officials.
                    Master of the secret of the confederacy against Suraj-ud-Dowlah, the Bengalee
                    threatened to betray it unless he was guaranteed, in the treaty itself,
                    £300,000. To dupe the villain, who was really paid by both sides, a second, or
                    fictitious treaty, was shown him with a clause to this effect. This Admiral
                    Watson refused to sign; “but,” Clive deponed to the House of Commons, “to the
                    best of his remembrance, he gave the gentleman who carried it leave to sign his
                    name upon it; his lordship never made any secret of it; he thinks it warrantable
                    in such a case, and would do it again a hundred times; he had no interested
                    motive in doing it, and did it with a design of disappointing the expectations
                    of a rapacious man.” Such is Clive’s own defence of the one act which, in a long
                    career of abounding temptations, stains his public life. °</p>
                <p>The whole hot season of 1757 was spent in these negotiations, till the middle of
                    June, when Clive began his march from Chandernagore, the British in boats, and
                    the sepoys along the right bank of the Hooghly. That river, above Calcutta is,
                    during the rainy season, fed by the overflow of the Ganges to the north through
                    three streams, which in the hot months are nearly dry. On the left bank of the
                    Bhagarutti, the most westerly of these, 100 miles above Chandernagore, stands
                    Moorshedabad, the capital of the Mogul viceroys of Bengal, and then so vast that
                    Clive compared it to the London of his day. Some miles farther down is the field
                    of Plassy, then an extensive grove of mango trees, of which enough yet remains,
                    in spite of the changing course of the stream, to enable the visitor to realize
                    the scene. On the 21st June Clive arrived on the bank opposite Plassy, in the
                    midst of that outburst of rain which ushers in the south-west monsoon of India.
                    His whole army amounted to 1100 Europeans and 2100 native troops, with 10
                    field-pieces. The nawab had drawn up 18,000 horse, 50,000 foot, and 53 pieces of
                    heavy ordnance, served by French artillerymen. For once in his career Clive
                    hesitated, and called a council of sixteen officers to decide, as he put it,
                    “whether in our present situation, without assistance, and on our own bottom, it
                    would be prudent to attack the nawab, or whether wo should wait till joined by
                    some country power <hi rend="italic">ì”</hi> Clive himself headed the nine who
                    voted for delay; Major (afterwards Sir) Eyre Coote, led the seven who counselled
                    immediate attack. But, either because his daring asserted itself, or because,
                    also, of a letter that he received from Jaffier Ali, as has been said, Clive was
                    the first to change his mind and to communicate with Major Eyre Coote. One
                    tradition, followed by Macaulay, represents him as spending an hour in thought
                    under the shade of some trees, while he resolved the issues of what was to prove
                    one of the decisive battles of the world. Another, turned into verse by an
                    Anglo-Indian poet, pictures his resolution as the result of a dream. However
                    that may be, he didwell as a soldier to trust to the dash and even rashness that
                    had gained Arcot and triumphed at Calcutta, and as a statesman, since retreat,
                    or even delay, would have put back the civilization of India for years. When,
                    after the heavy rain, the sun rose brightly on the 22d, the 3200 men and the six
                    guns crossed the river and took possession of the grove and its tanks of water,
                    while Clive established his headquarters in a hunting lodge. On the 23d the
                    engagement took place and lasted the whole day. Except the 40 Frenchmen and the
                    guns which they worked, the enemy did little to reply to the British cannonade
                    which, with the 39th Regiment, scattered the host, inflicting on it a loss of
                    500 men. Clive restrained the ardour of Major Kirkpatrick, for he trusted to
                    Jaffier Ali’s abstinence, if not desertion to his ranks, and knew the importance
                    of sparing his own small force. He lost hardly a white soldier; in all 22 sepoys
                    were killed and 50 wounded. His own account, written a month after the battle to
                    the secret committee of the court of directors, is not less unaffected than that
                    in which he had announced the defeat of the nawab at Calcutta. Suraj-ud-Dowlah
                    fled from the field on a camel, secured what wealth he could, and came to an
                    untimely end. Clive entered Moorshedabad, and established Jaffier Ali in the
                    position which his descendants have ever since enjoyed, as pensioners, but have
                    not unfrequently abused. When taken through the treasury, amid a million and a
                    half sterling’s worth of rupees, gold and silver plate, jewels, and rich goods,
                    and besought to ask what he would, Clive was content with £160,000, while half a
                    million was distributed among the army and navy, both in addition to gifts of
                    £24,000 to each member of the Company’s committee, and besides the public
                    compensation stipulated for in the treaty. It was to this occasion that he
                    referred in his defence before the House of Commons, when he declared that he
                    marvelled at his moderation. He sought rather to increase the shares of the
                    fleet and the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0020-0011"/> troops at his own expense, as lie had done at
                    Gheriah, and did more than once afterwards, with prize of war. What he did take
                    from the grateful nawab for himself was Jess than the circumstances justified
                    from an Oriental point of view, was far less than was pressed upon him, not only
                    by Jaøìer Ali, but by the hundreds of the native nobles whose gifts Clive
                    steadily refused, and was openly acknowledged from the first. He followed a
                    usage fully recognized by the Company, although the fruitful source of future
                    evils which he himself was again sent out to correct. The Company itself
                    acquired a revenue of £100,000 a year, and a contribution towards its losses and
                    military expenditure of a million and a half sterling. Such was Jaffier Ali’s
                    gratitude to Clive that he afterwards presented him with the quit-rent of the
                    Company’s lands in and around Calcutta, amounting to an annuity of £27,000 for
                    life, and left him by will the sum of £70,000, which Clive devoted to the
                    army.</p>
                <p>While busy with the civil administration, the conqueror of Plassy continued to
                    follow up his military success. He sent Major Coote in pursuit of the French
                    almost as far as Benares. He despatched Colonel Forde to Vizagapatam and the
                    northern districts of Madras, where that officer gained the battle of Condore,
                    pronounced by Broome “one of the most brilliant actions on military record.” He
                    came into direct contact, for the first time, with the Great Mogul himself, an
                    event which resulted in the most important consequences during the third period
                    of his career. Shah Aalum, when Shahzada, or heir-apparent, quarrelled with his
                    father Aalum Geer IL, the emperor, and united with the viceroys of Oudh and
                    Allahabad for the conquest of Bengal. He advanced as far as Patna, which he
                    besieged with 40,000 men. Jaffier Ali, in terror, sent his son to its relief,
                    and implored the aid of Clive. Major Caillaud defeated the prince’s army at the
                    battle of Sirpore, and dispersed it. Finally, at this period, Clive repelled the
                    aggression of the Dutch, and avenged the massacre of Amboyna, on that occasion
                    when he wrote his famous letter, “Dear Forde, fight them immediately <hi
                    rend="italic">; I</hi> will send you the order of council to-morrow.” Meanwhile
                    he never ceased to improve the organization and drill of the sepoy army, after a
                    European model, and enlisted into it many Mahometans of fine physique from Upper
                    India. He re· fortified Calcutta. In 1760, after four years of labour so
                    incessant and results so glorious, his health gave way and he returned to
                    England. “It appeared,” wrote a contemporary on the spot, <hi rend="italic"
                    >“as</hi> if the soul was departing from the government of Bengal.” He had been
                    formally made governor of Bengal by the court of directors at a time when his
                    nominal superiors in Madras sought to recall him to their help there. But he had
                    discerned the importance of the province even during his first visit to its rich
                    delta, mighty rivers, and teeming population. It should ba noticed, also, that
                    he had the kingly gift of selecting the ablest subordinates, for even thus early
                    he had discovered the ability of young Warren Hastings, destined to be his great
                    successor, and, a year after Plassy, made him “resident” at the nawab’s
                    court.</p>
                <p>In 1760, at thirty-five years of age, Clive returned to England with a fortune of
                    at least £300,000 and the quitrent of £27,000 a year, after caring for the
                    comfort of his parents and sisters, and giving Major Lawrence, his old
                    commanding officer, who had early encouraged his military genius, £500 a year.
                    The money had been honourably and publicly acquired, with the approval of the
                    Company. The amount might have been four times what it was, had Clive been
                    either greedy after wealth or ungenerous to the colleagues and the troops whom
                    he led to victory. In the five years of his conquests and administration in
                    Bengal, the young man had crowded together a succession of exploits which led
                    Lord Macaulay, in what that historian termed his “flashy” essay on the subject,
                    to compare him to Napoleon Bonaparte. But there was this difference in Clive’s
                    favour, due not more to the circumstances of the time than to the object of his
                    policy—he gave peace, security, prosperity, and such liberty as the case allowed
                    of to a people now reckoned at 240 millions, who had for centuries been the prey
                    of oppression, while Napoleon warred only for personal ambition, and the
                    absolutism he established has left not a wreck behind. During the three years
                    that Clive remained in England he sought a political position, chiefly that he
                    might influence the courso of events in India, which he had left full of
                    promise. He had been well received at court, had been made Baron Clive of
                    Plassy, in the peerage of Ireland, had bought estates, and had got not only
                    himself but his friends returned to the House of Commons after the fashion of
                    the time. Then it was that he set himself to reform the home system of the East
                    India Company, and commenced a bitter warfare with Mr Sulivan, chairman of the
                    court of directors, whom finally he defeated. In this he was aided by the news
                    of reverses in Bengal. Vansittart, his successor, having no great influence over
                    Jaffier Ali Khan, had put Kossim Ali Khan, the son-in-law, in his place in
                    consideration of certain payments to the English officials. After a brief tenure
                    Kossim Ali had fled, had ordered Summers, or Sumroo, a Swiss mercenary of his,
                    to butcher the garrison of 150 English at Patna, and had disappeared under the
                    protection of his brother viceroy of. Oudh. The whole Company’s service, civil
                    and military, had become demoralized by such gifts, and by the monopoly of the
                    inland as well as export trade, to such an extent that the natives were
                    pauperized, and the Company was plundered of the revenues which Clive had
                    acquired for them. The court of proprietors, accordingly, who elected the
                    directors, forced them, in spite of Sulivan, to hurry out Lord Clive to Bengal
                    with the double powers of governor and commander-in-chief.</p>
                <p>What he had done for Madras, what he had accomplished for Bengal proper, and what
                    he had effected in reforming the Company itself, he was now to complete in less
                    than two years, in this the third period of his career, by putting his country
                    politically in the place of the emperor of Delhi, and preventing forever the
                    possibility of the corruption to which the English in India had been driven by
                    an evil system. On the 3d May 1765, he landed at Calcutta to learn that Jaffier
                    Ali Khan had died, leaving him personally £70,000, and had been succeeded by his
                    son, though not before the Government had been further demoralized by taking
                    £100,000 as a gift from the new nawab; while Kossim Ali had induced not only the
                    viceroy of Oudh, but the emperor of Delhi himself, to invade Behar. After the
                    first mutiny in the Bengal army, which was suppressed by blowing the scρoy
                    ringleader from the guns, Major Munro, “the Napier of those times,” scattered
                    the united armies on the hard-fought field of Buxar. The emperor, Shah Aalum,
                    detached himself from the league, while the Oudh viceroy threw himself on the
                    mercy of the English. Clive had now an opportunity of repeating in Hindustan, or
                    Upper India, what he had accomplished fur the good of Bengal. He might have
                    secured what are now called the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, and have
                    rendered unnecessary the campaigns of Wellesley and Lake. But he had other work
                    in the consolidation of rich Bengal itself, making it a base from which the
                    mighty fabric of British India could afterwards steadily and proportionally
                    grow. Hence he returned to the Oudh viceroy all his territory save the provinces
                    of Allahabad and Corah, which he made over to the weak emperor. But from that
                    emperor he secured the most important document in the whole of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0021-0012"/> our Indian history up to that time, which appears
                    in the records as “firmaund from the King Shah Aalum, granting the dewany of
                    Bengal, Behar, and Orissa to the Company, 1765.” The date was the 12th August,
                    the place Benares, the throne an English dining-table covered with embroidered
                    cloth and surmounted by a chair in Clive’s tent. It is all pictured by a
                    Mahometan contemporary, who indignantly exclaims that so great a “transaction
                    was done and finished in less time than would have been taken up in the sale of
                    a jackass.” By this deed the Company became the real sovereign rulers of thirty
                    millions of people, yielding a revenue of four millions sterling. All this had
                    been accomplished by Clive in the few brief years since he had avenged “the
                    Black Hole” of Calcutta. This would be a small matter, or might even be a cause
                    of reproach, were it not that the Company’s, now the Queen’s, undisputed
                    sovereignty proved, after a sore period of transition, the salvation of these
                    millions. The lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, with some additions since
                    Clive’s time, now contains sixty millions of people, and yields an annual
                    revenue of twelve millions sterling, of which eight goes every year to assist in
                    the good government of the rest of India. But Clive, though thus moderate and
                    even generous to an extent which called forth the astonishment of the natives,
                    had all a statesman’s foresight. On the same date, he obtained not only an
                    imperial charter for the Company’s possessions in the Carnatic also, thus
                    completing the work he began at Arcot, but a third firmaun for the highest of
                    all the lieutenancies or soubaships of the empire, that of the Deccan itself.
                    The fact has only recently been discovered, by distinct allusion to it in a
                    letter from the secret committee of the court of directors to the Madras
                    Government, dated 27th April 1768. Still so disproportionate seemed the British
                    force, not only to the number and strength of the princes and people of India,
                    but to the claims and ambition of French, Dutch, and Danish rivals, that Clive’s
                    last advice to the directors, as he finally left India in 1777, was this, given
                    in a remarkable state paper but little known: “We are sensible that, since the
                    acquisition of the dewany, the power formerly belonging to the soubah of those
                    provinces is totally, in fact, vested in the East India Company. Nothing remains
                    to him but the name and shadow of authority. This name, however, this shadow, it
                    is indispensably necessary we should seem to venerate.” On a wider arena, even
                    that of the Great Mogul himself, the shadow was kept up till it obliterated
                    itself in the massacre of English people in the Delhi palace in 1857; and the
                    Queen was proclaimed, first, direct ruler on the 1st November 1858, and then
                    empress of India on the 1st January 1877</p>
                <p>Having thus founded the empire of British India, Clive’s painful duty was to
                    create a pure and strong administration, such as alone would justify its
                    possession By foreigners. The civil service was de-orientalized by raising the
                    miserable salaries which had tempted its members to be corrupt, by forbidding
                    the acceptance of gifts from natives, and by exacting covenants under which
                    participation in the inland trade was stopped. Not less important were his
                    military reforms. With his usual tact and nerve he put down a mutiny of the
                    English officers, who chose to resent the veto against receiving presents and
                    the reduction of batta at a time when two Mahratta armies were marching on
                    Bengal. His reorganization of the army, on the lines of that which he had begun
                    after Plassy, and which was neglected during his second visit to England, has
                    since attracted the admiration of the ablest Indian officers. He divided the
                    whole into three brigades, so as to make each a complete force, in itself equal
                    to any single native army that could be brought against it. His one fault was
                    that of his age and his position, with so small a number of men.</p>
                <p>He lacked a sufficient number of British artillerymen, and would not commit the
                    mistake of his successors, who trained natives to work the guns, which were
                    turned against us with such effect in 1857. It is sufficient to say that
                    Government has returned to his policy, for not a native gunner is now to be
                    found save in a few unhealthy and isolated frontier posts.</p>
                <p>Clive’s final return to England, a poorer man than he went out, in spite of still
                    more tremendous temptations, was the signal for an outburst of his personal
                    enemies, exceeded only by that which the malice of Sir Philip Francis afterwards
                    excited against Warren Hastings. Every civilian, whose illicit gains he had cut
                    off, every officer whose conspiracy he had foiled, every proprietor or director,
                    like Sulivan, whose selfish schemes he had thwarted, now sought their
                    opportunity. He had, with consistent generosity, at once made over the legacy of
                    £70,000 from the grateful Jaffier Ali, as the capital of what has since been
                    known as “the Clive Fund,” for the support of invalided European soldiers, as
                    well as officers, and their widows, and the Company had allowed 8 per cent, on
                    the sum for an object which it was otherwise bound to meet. Burgoyne, of
                    Saratoga memory, did his best to induce the House of Commons, in which Lord
                    Clive was now member for Shrewsbury, to impeach the man who gave his country an
                    empire, and the people of that empire peace and justice, and that, as we have
                    seen, without blot on the gift, save in the matter of Omichund. The result,
                    after the brilliant and honourable defences of his career which will be found in
                    Almon’s <hi rend="italic">Debates</hi> for 1773, was a compromise that saved
                    England this time from the dishonour which, when Warren Hastings had to run the
                    gauntlet, put it in the same category with France in the treatment of its public
                    benefactors abroad. On a division the House, by 155 to 95, carried the motion
                    that Lord Clive “did obtain and possess himself” of £234,000 during his first
                    administration of Bengal; but, refusing to express an opinion on the fact, it
                    passed unanimously the second motion, at five in the morning, “that Robert, Lord
                    Clive, did at the same time render great and meritorious services to his
                    country.” The one moral question, the one stain of all that brilliant and
                    tempted life—the Omichund treaty—was not touched.</p>
                <p>Only one who can personally understand what Clive’s power and services were will
                    rightly realize the effect on him, though in the prime of life, of the
                    discussions through which he had been dragged. We have referred to Warren
                    Hastings’s impeachment, but there is a more recent parallel. The marquis of
                    Dalhousie did almost as much to complete the territorial area and civilized
                    administration of British India in his eight years’ term of office as Lord Clive
                    to found the empire in a similar period. As Clive’s accusers sought a new weapon
                    in the great famine of 1770, for which he was in no sense responsible, so there
                    were critics who accused Dalhousie of having caused that mutiny which, in truth,
                    he would have prevented had the British Government listened to his counsel not
                    to reduce the small English army in the country. Clive tells us his own feelings
                    in a passage of first importance when we seek to form an opinion on the fatal
                    act by which he ended his life. In the greatest of his speeches, in reply to
                    Lord North, he said,—“My situation, sir, has not been an easy one for these
                    twelve months past, and though my conscience could never accuse me, yet I felt
                    for my friends who were involved in the same censure as myself I have been
                    examined by the select committee more like a sheep-stealer than a member of this
                    House.” Fully accepting that statement, and believing him to have been purer
                    than his accusers in spite of temptations unknown to them, we see in Clive’s end
                    the result merely of physical suffering, of chronic disease which opium failed
                    to abate, while the worry and chagrin <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0022-0013"/> caused by his enemies gave it full scope. This
                    great man, who fell short only of the highest form of moral greatness on one
                    supreme occasion, but who did more for his country than any soldier till
                    Wellington, and more for the people and princes of India than any statesman in
                    history, died by his own hand, November 22, 1774, in his fiftieth year.</p>
                <p>The portrait of Clive, by Dance, in the Council Chamber of Government House,
                    Calcutta, faithfully represents him. He was slightly above middle-size, with a
                    countenance rendered heavy and almost sad by a natural fulness above the eyes.
                    Reserved to the many, he was beloved by his own family and friends. His
                    encouragement of scientific undertakings like Major Rennell’s surveys, and of
                    philological researches like Mr Gladwin’s, was marked by the two honorary
                    distinctions of F.R.S. and LL.D.</p>
