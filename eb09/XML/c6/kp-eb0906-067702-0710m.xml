                    Hungarian traveller and philologist, born about 1790 at Körös in Transylvania,
                    belonged to a noble family which had sunk into poverty. He was educated at
                    Nagy-Enyed and at Göttingen; and, in order to carry out the dream of his youth

                    medicine and the Oriental languages. In 1820, having received from a friend the
                    promise of an annuity of 100 florins (about £10) to support him during his
                    travels, he set out for the East. He visited Egypt, and made his way to Tibet,
                    where he spent four years in a Buddhist monastery studying the language and the
                    Buddhist literature. To his intense disappointment he soon discovered that he
                    could not thus obtain any assistance in his great object; but, having visited
                    Bengal, his knowledge of Tibetan obtained him employment in the library of the
                    Asiatic Society there, which possessed more than 1000 volumes in that language;
                    and he was afterwards supported by the Government while he published a
                    Tibetan-English dictionary and grammar (both of which appeared at Calcutta in
                    1834). He also contributed several articles on the Tibetan language and
                    literature to the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of
                    Bengal,</hi> and he published an analysis of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kah-Gyur,</hi> the most important of the Buddhist sacred books. Meanwhile his
                    fame had reached his native country, and procured him a pension from the
                    Government, which, with characteristic devotion to learning, he devoted to the
                    purchase of books for Indian libraries. He spent some time in Calcutta, studying
                    Sanskrit and several other languages; but, early in 1842, he commenced his
                    second attempt to discover the origin of the Hungarians. He had only reached
                    Darjiling when he died on the 11th April 1842. An oration was delivered in his
                    honour before the Hungarian Academy by Eötrös, the novelist.</p>
