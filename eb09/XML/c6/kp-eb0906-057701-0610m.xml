                    was still living in Scotland; some time after that date, however, a quarrel with
                    his father, who had become a Protestant, drove him to France. In Paris his
                    dialectics and his sword-play are said to have gained him equal admiration; and,
                    according to Urquhart’s very doubtful story, a contest in twelve languages
                    resulted in an easy victory over the whole staff of the Sorbonne. His Parisian
                    triumphs were followed by a couple of years of obscure campaigning in the French
                    army, but in 1580 he appeared at Venice. A Latin poem addressed to Aldus
                    Manutius laid the foundation of a lasting friendship with the great printer, who
                    dedicated his edition of Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">Paradoxa</hi> to Crichton,
                    and, according to some, conferred on him still more substantial favours; he also
                    became intimate with Sperone Speroni, and with Lorenzo Massa and Giovanni
                    Donati. His first public display was the delivery of an address to the doge and
                    senate, whom he astonished with his eloquence and oratorical grace; and he
                    followed this up with a series of disputations on mathematical, theological, and
                    philosophical subjects, which so extended his fame that it was reckoned the
                    highest honour to Mazzoni, a famous dialectician, thrice to have met and
                    vanquished him in argument. But these exertions produced an illness which held
                    him prostrate for four months. At Padua, the scene of his next exhibition, he
                    astonished the assembled professors by extemporizing in succession a Latin poem,
                    a daring onslaught on certain Aristotelian errors, and an impassioned oration in
                    praise of ignorance. His return to Venice was signalized by the publication of
                    the challenge preserved by Aldus Manutius, in which he undertook not only to
                    refute innumerable errors in Aristotelians, mathematicians, and schoolmen, but
                    to meet his opponents on any ground, and to conduct the dispute either
                    logically, or according to the secret doctrine of numbers, or in a hundred sorts
                    of verse; and in the church of San Paolo and San Giovanni the young Scotsman
                    held his own for three days against all comers. He then seems to have quitted
                    the republic for Mantua, where he had been appointed tutor to Vincenzo Gonzaga,
                    heir to the dukedom. There he distinguished himself, according to Urquhart, by
                    killing a professional duellist, who had challenged and vanquished many of the
                    best swordsmen of Italy, and by playing before the court some fifteen characters
                    in succession, keeping the stage for five hours. His brilliance made men
                    envious, and he is said to have supplanted the prince in the affections of his
                    mistress. One July evening in 1582 he was attacked by three masquers in the
                    streets of Mantua. But he fought so well that their leader to save his life was
                    forced to discover himself. It <pb break="no"

                    his knee, and presenting his sword, asked pardon; but the prince basely ran him
                    through the body.</p>
