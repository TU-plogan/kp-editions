                <p><label type="entry">COMENIUS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Komensky, Johann
                    Amos</hi></label> (1592- 1671), a famous writer on education, and the last
                    bishop of the old church of the Moravian and Bohemian Brethren, was born at
                    Comna, or, according to another account, at Niwnitz, in Moravia, of poor parents
                    belonging to the sect of the Moravian Brethren. Having studied at Herborn and
                    Heidelberg, and travelled in Holland and England, he became rector of a school
                    at Prerau, and after that pastor and rector of a school atFulnek. In 1621 the
                    Spanish invasion and persecution of the Protestants robbed him of all he
                    possessed, and drove him into Poland. Soon after he was made bishop of the
                    church of the Brethren. He supported himself by teaching Latin at Lissa, and it
                    was here that he published his <hi rend="italic">Pansophiae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Prodromus</hi> (1630), a work on education, and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Janua Linguarum Reserata</hi> (1631), the latter of which gained
                    for him a great and wide-spread reputation, being produced in twelve European
                    languages, and also in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish. He subsequently published
                    several other works of a similar kind, as the <hi rend="italic">Eruditionis
                    Scholasticos Janua</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Janua</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Linguarum</hi><hi rend="italic">Trilinguis.</hi> His method of teaching
                    languages, which he seems to have been the first to adopt, consisted in giving,
                    in parallel columns, sentences conveying useful information, in the vernacular
                    and the languages intended to be taught <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> in
                    Comenius’s works, Latin and sometimes Greek). In some of his books, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Orbis Sensualium Pictus</hi> (1658), pictures are added; this work
                    is, indeed, the first children’s picture-book. In 1638 Comeniuswas requested by
                    the Government of Sweden to draw up a scheme for the management of the schools
                    of that country; and a few years after he was invited to join the commission
                    that the English Parliament then intended to appoint, in order to reform the
                    system of education. He visited England in 1641, but the disturbed state of
                    politics prevented the appointment of the commission, and Comenius passed over
                    to Sweden in August 1642. The great Swedish minister, Oxenstiern, obtained for
                    him a pension, and a commission to furnish a plan for regulating the Swedish
                    schools according to his own method. Devoting himself to the elaboration of his
                    scheme, Comenius settled first at Elbing, and then at Lissa; but, at the burning
                    of the latter city by the Poles, he lost nearly all his manuscripts, and he
                    finally removed to Amsterdam, where he died in 1671.</p>
                <p>As a theologian, Comenius was greatly influenced by Boehme. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Synopsis</hi><hi rend="italic">Γhιjsicce</hi><hi rend="italic">ad
                    Lumen</hi><hi rend="italic">Divinum</hi><hi rend="italic">Reformatée</hi> he
                    gives a physical theory of his own, said to be taken from the book of Genesis.
                    He was also famous for his prophecies, and the support he gave to visionaries.
                    In his <hi rend="italic">Lux in</hi><hi rend="italic">Tenebris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">he</hi> published the visions of Kotterus, Dabricius, and
                    Christina Poniatovia. Attempting to interpret the book of Revelation, he
                    promised the millennium in 1672, and guaranteed miraculous assistance to those
                    who would undertake the destruction of the Pope and the house of Austria, even
                    venturing to prophesy that Cromwell, Gustavus Adolphus, and Ragotski, prince of
                    Transylvania, would perform the task. He also wrote to Louis XIV., informing him
                    that the empire of the world should be his reward if he would overthrow the
                    enemies of God.</p>
                <p>Comenius also wrote against the Socinians, and published three historical works—
                    <hi rend="italic">Ratio</hi><hi rend="italic">Disciplinae Ordinisque</hi><hi
