                <p><label type="entry">CRETINISM</label> may be defined as an endemic idiocy, of
                    which the characteristic is an arrested development of body as well as mind. The
                    origin of the word is doubtful. Its southern French form <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrestiaa</hi> suggested to Michel a derivation from <hi rend="italic"
                    >cresta</hi><hi rend="italic">(crête),</hi> the goose foot of red cloth worn by
                    the Cagots of the Pyrenees. The Cagots, however, were not cretins. Again <hi

                    cretinism. Many other symptoms show that the whole organism is stunted. We quote
                    the vivid picture by Beaupré <hi rend="italic">(Dissertation</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les Cretins,</hi> translated in Blackie
                    on <hi rend="italic">Cretinism,</hi> Edin. 1855) :—</p>
                <p>“I see a head of unusual form and size, a squat and bloated figure, a stupid
                    look, bleared hollow and heavy eyes, thick projecting eyelids, and a flat nose.
                    His face is of a leaden hue, his skin dirty, flabby, covered with tetters, and
                    his thick tongue hangs down over his moist livid lips. His mouth, always open
                    and full of saliva, shows teeth going to decay. His chest is narrow, his back
                    curved, his breath asthmatic, his limbs short, misshapen, without power. The
                    knees are thick and inclined inward, the feet flat. The large head drops
                    listlessly on the breast; the abdomen is like a hag."</p>
                <p>Generally the cretin is deaf and dumb, or able to utter only a hoarse cry. He is
                    indifferent to heat, cold, blows, and even the most revolting odours. Some
                    appear to want intelligence altogether, and even the power of articulation.
                    Others acquire the rudiments of language, and are able to perform simple tasks.
                    There are, indeed, several distinct varieties of cretinism which have been
                    noticed by Abercrombie, founding on the descriptions of Fodéré and De Saussure
                    <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Fatuitate</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Alpina,</hi> Edin. 1803), Wenzel <hi rend="italic">(Ueber d.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cretinismus,</hi> Vienna, 1802), and Guggenbühl of the Abendberg
                    at Interlaken. The abnormal cranial development has been studied by Virchow <hi
                    rend="italic">(Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Cretinismus in Unterſranlcen,</hi>
                    Würzburg, 1852) and Vogt <hi rend="italic">(Mémoires sur les Microcéphales,</hi>
                    Geneva, 1867). Many cretins are hydrocephalic; but more frequently the skull is
                    microcéphalie, with premature ossification of the sutures and induration of
                    portions of the brain matter. The anterior lobes are said to be much lighter
                    thaù in healthy brains, but this difference does not extend to the cerebellum.
                    Vogt maintains that the <hi rend="italic">microcéphale</hi> has a pithecoid
                    skull at the crown, and a human skull at the base and crown. But his suggestion
                    that this is a case of atavism, and that cretins <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n606/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0606-0573"/> represent a stage through which the human race
                    passed in its evolution from the ape is generally repudiated. (See the <hi
                    rend="italic">Races of Man</hi> by Oscar Peschel, London, 1867, p. 66, and a
                    paper by Dr Ireland of Larbert on the Reports of Drs Lombroso and Valenthof
                    Bologna, A&lt;‰. <hi rend="italic">Med. Journals</hi> XX. p. 109). It is said
                    too that the respiration of cretins reaches only 15 instead of the normal 18 per
                    minute. Many die very young in epileptic convulsions, and survival to old age is
                    extremely rare. But the most striking sign of cretinism is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >goitre,</hi> variously known as bronchocele and struma, kropf (German), wen or
                    derby neck (English), mumps or branks (Scotch). From this must be distinguished
                    the weaver’s goitre, caused by the emanations from steeped flax; the
                    exophthalmic goitre, also called Grave’s disease, which is marked by
                    palpitations of the heart and prominence of the eyeballs; and the smaller goitre
                    which is sometimes connected with uterine affections. We should also mention the
                    epidemic goitre, such as that which attacked Captain Cook’s crew in 1772, when
                    they drank water from a melting iceberg. The endemic goitre is a tumour of the
                    thyroid gland of varying size, sometimes filled with a viscous fluid, sometimes
                    containing pus cysts and calcareous deposits. There is a large body of evidence
                    to the effect that goitre and cretinism are causally related,— that they are at
                    least effects of the same causes; or, as Maffei expresses it, “goitre is the
                    beginning of that degeneration of which cretinism is the end.” No doubt,
                    perfectly sane and healthy persons have goitres. For instance, Fodéré, an
                    eminent man of science who published an <hi rend="italic">Essai sur le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Goitre</hi> at Turin in 1792, himself suffered from this deformity
                    when a boy, and re-caught it when lecturing at Strasburg. But these cases are
                    few, and the statistical inquiries of Roesch in Wurtemberg <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ueber d. Cretinismus,</hi> Erlangen, 1844), and of Niepce in Dauphiné <hi
                    rend="italic">(Traité du</hi><hi rend="italic">Goitre</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    du Crétinisme,</hi> Paris, 1852), have established that the great mass of
                    cretins have goitres, and that goitre generally appears at the age when
                    development is arrested, that is, seven or eight years. Of Aosta, the home and
                    eentre of cretinism, Malacarne wrote in 1789, <hi rend="italic">Un
                    mente-</hi><hi rend="italic">ratto</hi><hi rend="italic">senzagozzo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e una</hi><hi rend="italic">cosa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >rarissima.</hi> The two things have been observed together in Africa and both
                    Americas by Park, Richardson, Humboldt, and other distinguished travellers.
                    Again cretinism is found in certain districts, it is in these districts also
                    that the non-cretinous cases of goitre are for the most part found. Healthy
                    parents, coming to an endemic district, produce children with goitres, or
                    cretins; parents with goitres, removing to an untainted neighbourhood, often
                    lose their own goitres, and seldom produce children subject to the deformity.
                    Nor does intermarriage with a healthy stranger avert the danger, if the
                    household remain subject to the endemic conditions. It may be added that in both
                    Europe and the United States deaf mutism, a form of arrested development, is
                    found in local contact with cretinism and goitre. Deaf-mutes are often found in
                    families of which the other members are cretins, and they are found as a class
                    in the neighbourhood of a cretin district. What then are the causes of
                    cretinism, of which we shall take goitre as a symptom? In the first place, the
                    phenomenon is not confined to any one race. The whites, the Indians, the
                    negroes, and the half breeds of Central and South Africa all exhibit the disease
                    in certain localities. So do the Malays and the Dyaks of Borneo, the Mongolians
                    of Nepaul, Siberia, and the Kwang Tung Mountains in China, the Berbers of Mount
                    Atlas. Nor is it confined to one elevation or character of surface. It appears
                    on the sea shore, as at Viborg, and at the mouth of the St Lawrence; on inland
                    plains, like those of Lombardy and Alsace; at the moderate elevations of La
                    Barthe and Luz in the Pyrenees; and on the high Peruvian plateau of Pasco, and
                    in the Himalayan valley of the Jumna. Nor can any thermic conditions be laid
                    down; for the symptoms range from the deserts of Algeria to Irkutsk in Siberia,
                    from an average temperature of 80° Fahr, to one of 14° Fahr. The idea of Fodéré
                    that cretinism is caused by a humid atmosphere does not receive much
                    encouragement from the facts. Peru has a very dry climate, and goitre is the
                    principal endemic; the British Isles with much rain and fog have little or no
                    cretinism ∙ at Cuzco, where it rains, as the inhabitants say, thirteen months in
                    the year, the disease is unknown. Morel, Virchow, and Koeberlé (in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai sur Crétinisme,</hi> Strasburg, 1862) have maintained that
                    cretinism is caused by a special form of marsh-fever, malaria, or even a special
                    organic poison-germ in the atmosphere. The maximum of miasmic fever, however,
                    has a geographical habitat very different from that of cretinism, which
                    frequently occurs in a rare atmosphere, impregnated with ozone. Hygienic
                    regulation, too, successfully resists cretinism, while respiration is sufficient
                    to let in the atmospheric poison. The favourite explanation of De Saussure, that
                    cretinism is caused by the stagnation of air in the deep valleys of the Alps and
                    Pyrenees, overlooks the well-known fact that morning and evening winds regularly
                    ventilate these valleys. Proceeding on this error, the Sardinian commission
                    recommended that trees near dwelling-houses should be cut down (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Rapport de la Commission</hi><hi rend="italic">Barde,</hi> Turin,
                    1848). Milk and vegetable diet, various kinds of farinaceous food, and defective
                    hygiene, have also been made responsible for the disease. But it is not only the
                    poor, the ill-fed, and ill-clad who contract goitre and become idiots; persons
                    in comfortable circumstances, living with every regard to cleanliness, in a
                    fertile country under a fine climate, are subject to the ailment. In Piedmont,
                    for instance, it was calculated that less than three-fifths of the cretins
                    belonged to the poor people; of course poverty aggravates every disease. The
                    general result of these abortive theories is that some local telluric conditions
                    must be ascertained. There are fragments of evidence showing the persistence of
                    cretinism in particular localities, the inhabitants of which have changed from
                    time to time. Every one knows Juvenal’s line—“Quis tumidum guttur miratur in
                    Alpibusî” and Shakespeare’s “mountaineers, dewlapped like bulls, whoso throats
                    had hanging at ’em wallets of flesh.” Catholic legends tell how in the 5th and
                    7th centuries Champagne and Liège were condemned for some sacrilege to have
                    women with goitres. The <hi rend="italic">Life of Charlemagne</hi> states that
                    in 772 his soldiers caught the goitre on the banks of the Rhine. It has always
                    been a popular as well as a scientific belief that water is the vehicle of the
                    poison. “Struma oritur ex metallicis et mineralibus aquis,” says Paracelsus.
                    Endemic goitre has been observed to increase when the summer heats altered the
                    chemical character of the water used for drinking and cooking; and it sometimes
                    disappears before modern arrangements for water supply. Goitre has in fact been
                    artificially produced by the use of water, for the purpose of evading the
                    conscription. But the question remains what is the poison thus conveyed? One
                    opinion was that there might be too little iodine. The old practice of eating
                    the ashes of sea-sponge led Coindet of Geneva to apply iodine to goitre with
                    success. It was also maintained that there might be a deficiency of the
                    phosphates of lime and magnesium. These views apparently proceeded on tho
                    principle that the human body required a certain normal proportion in the
                    chemical elements which it consumed. The whole subject has been elaborately
                    treated by Μ. St Lager in <hi rend="italic">Études sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les
                    causes</hi><hi rend="italic">du crétinisme et</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    goitre</hi><hi rend="italic">endémique,</hi> Paris, 1867. He takes the pathology
                    of cretinism as illustrating the wider question of the dependence of the human
                    organism on the chemical constitution <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n607/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0607-0574"/> of the soil. He has made an inquiry into the
                    geological features of the districts in which cretinism is endemic, compared
                    with the statistics of the cretin population. .He finds that cretinism is
                    confined to metalliferous districts, and occurs most frequently where iron
                    pyrites and copper pyrites predominate.</p>
                <p>Although dogs, pigs, and probably also horses, oxen, and sheep have been affected
                    by goitre, there is no reliable evidence of a connection between goitre and
                    feeble or stunted organization in any of the lower animals.</p>
                <p>Pronounced cretinism seems to be incurable. Dr Guggenbühl’s treatment at the
                    Abendberg was chiefly psy chological, and belongs to the general theory of the
                    treatment of idiots. But the Swiss commission, who reported on the Abendberg on
                    15th May 1849, say that the greater part of the inmates were not cretins at all,
                    but merely scrofulous children. Accordingly on GuggenbiihΓs death the Bern
                    Government declined any longer to support the establishment. Similar
                    establishments have been . founded at Marienberg in "Wurtemberg by Dr Roesch, at
                    Aosta in Piedmont, Basseno in Savoy, at Abbiategrasso in Lombardy, at Albany,
                    Utica, and other places in the United States. (See, for a list of idiot schools,
                    <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Heil und Pßege Anstalten f ür
                    psychisch. Kranke,</hi> by Dr H. Laehr, Berlin, 1875.) An institution at
                    Highgate, London, was founded in imitation of the Abendberg. It may be
                    interesting to note the places in which cretins have been found in the United
                    Kingdom. In England these are Oldham, Sholver Moor, Cromp. ton, Duffield,
                    Cromford (near Matlock), and other points in Derbyshire; endemic goitre has been
                    seen near Nottingham, Chesterfield, Pontefract, Ripon, and the mountainous parts
                    of Staffordshire and Yorkshire, the east of Cumberland, certain parts of
                    Worcester, Warwick, Cheshire, Monmouth, and. Leicester, near Horsham in
                    Hampshire, near Haslemere in Surrey, and near Beaconsfield in Buckingham. There
                    are cretins at Chiselborough in Somerset. In Scotland cretins and cases of
                    goitre have been seen in Perthshire, on the east coast of Fife, in Roxburgh, the
                    upper portions of Peebles and Selkirk, near Lanark and Dumfries, in the east of
                    Ayrshire, in the west of Berwick, the east of Wigtown, and in Kirkcudbright.</p>
