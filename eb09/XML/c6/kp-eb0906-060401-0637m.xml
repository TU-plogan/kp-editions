                    year of his birth is unknown, but 1490 has been fixed upon as a probable
                    approximate date. His childhood was passed near London—perhaps, as Foxe says,
                    close by Putney—where his father, according to Foxe, and also according to the

                    Cromwell entered the household of Cecily, marchioness of Dorset, and that
                    therefore his family must have possessed some influence; but the letter referred
                    to by Sir Henry Ellis as the only evidence of connection with the house of
                    Dorset belongs in all probability to the period when he was engaged in the cloth

                <p>While still in his teens Cromwell made his way to Italy, where he was to read
                    Machiavelli, and acquire those views of conduct and statesmanship which
                    determined his career. He first passed over to Flanders, and obtained a
                    situation as clerk in the English factory at Antwerp. He then took service,
                    there is good reason to believe, as a soldier in Italy; but the story narrated
                    by Foxe, that he was one of the duke of Bourbon’s followers at the siege of Rome
                    in May 1527, ñ extremely doubtful. The inaccuracy of Foxe is notorious, and
                    there is evidence in letters of his own that Cromwell was in England in January
                    1527, and again in 1528. It nevertheless remains possible that during the
                    interval he was at Rome on some diplomatic mission. Some time also he spent in
                    the office of a merchant at Venice, with whom Pole claims to have had personal
                    acquaintance; and Foxe asserts that, subsequently to his return to England, he
                    paid another visit to Italy, being engaged by the leading merchants of Boston in
                    Lincolnshire to procure certain privileges from the Γope. The well-known story
                    of the kindly help which he received while in distress from the Florentine
                    banker Frescobaldi, and the noble gratitude which he displayed in his
                    prosperity, rests apparently on no more certain authority than a novel of
                    Bandello and the statement of Foxe, though it is an interesting illustration of
                    the fame which he acquired as a man who never failed to π member a kindness.</p>

                    He also for a time followed his step-father’s trade of clothmerchant. In 1523 he
                    obtained a seat in Parliament; and he had most likely already entered the
                    service of Cardinal Wolsey. That he had done so within two or three years after

                    confiscated property of the monasteries granted by the Pope to Wolsey for the
                    endowment of his colleges at Ipswich and Oxford; and the manner in which he
                    performed this task, while it added very considerably to his purse, aroused
                    numerous and vehement complaints. Indeed, many expected to see him mount the
                    scaffold when his master’s protection ceased 'to be of avail.</p>
                <p>Among the followers of Wolsey, however, he had made himself of the first
                    importance; and when ruin overtook the cardinal, it was on Cromwell that he
                    leant. There are letters extant in Wolsey’s handwriting, addressing Cromwell as
                    a familiar friend, and earnestly begging his presence and advice; and there is
                    one in the handwriting of Cromwell, containing such counsel as might have been
                    given by an equal, and, with an air that savours somewhat of hypocrisy,
                    congratulating the fallen minister on being now “at liberty to serve God,” and
                    “banish and exile the vain desires of this unstable world.” For his fidelity,
                    and especially for his defence of Wolsey in the House of Commons,<note

                    >(Life of Wolsey,</hi> p. 276), says that a bill had been passed in the House of
                    Lords to “have my Lord Cardinal condemned of treason, . . . against which Master
                    Cromwell inveighed so discretely, with such witty persuasions and deep reasons
                    that the same would take there no effect.” But Herbert quotes the articles of
                    the bill, because, he says, “our vulgar chronicles misreport them,” and proves
                    that it was not a bill of impeachment, but one intended to disqualify Wolsey
                    from being restored to office <hi rend="italic">(Life of Henry VIII.</hi> pp.
                    408-16, Murray’s ed.). He adds, “These articles were presented to the Lords, and
                    then sent down to the Lower House, where Thomas Cromwell (obtaining the place of
                    a burgess) so wittily defended his master that no treason could be laid to his
                    charge. And upon this honest beginning Cromwell obtained his first reputation.”
                    Mr Brewer (<hi rend="italic">Calendar,</hi><hi rend="italic">kc.</hi> vol. iv.
                    Introd. p. 553), however is inclined to believe that Cromwell risked nothing by
                    his defence of Wolsey. The bill was dated 1st Dec., when Cromwell was already in
                    the king’s service; and there is no reason to believe that Henry was in favour
                    of the measure, which, on the contrary, was likely to be distasteful to him as
                    intended to limit his prerogative.</p></note> Cromwell received from his
                    contemporaries the highest praise. His conduct appears to have been simply that
                    of a man who, not forgetful of his own interests, was honourably desirous of
                    serving a patron to whom he was deeply indebted. At first he remained with the
                    cardinal, whom he accompanied to his uncomfortable exile at Esher. Bat he was
                    not long content to serve in unprofitable obscurity, and he was besides in some
                    alarm for his personal safety. New and aspiring projects began to fill his mind.
                    Cavendish, Wolsey’s gentleman-usher and biographer, tells how on AllHallows day
                    he found him gazing out of a window at Esher, with his primer in his hand,
                    employed, unlike his wont, in saying his matins. He complained with tears to
                    Cavendish that, while he had received no promotion from .the cardinal, he was
                    like to share his fall, and announced his intention of riding to the court that
                    very afternoon to stake his fortunes on an interview with the king. An account
                    of that interview has been given by Pole,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">* Apologia ad Carolum V.</hi> pp. 120-121,

                    who asserts that he received his information from some of the courtiers present.
                    Trusting in Henry’s love of power and his bitter irritation against the Pope,
                    Cromwell ventured to reveal the daring policy which he had conceived. The
                    authority of the Papacy in England was to be altogether abolished; and thus, not
                    only was the painful question of the divorce to be easily settled, but the
                    allegiance of the clergy, then divided, as Cromwell proved by reference to the
                    bishops’ oaths, between their sovereign and their spiritual head, was all to be
                    claimed by the former. And, besides, Cromwell appealed to the king’s cupidity by
                    showing that all the wealth of the clergy was at the disposal of the king, since
                    they (in common, indeed, with the whole nation) had, by receiving Wolsey as
                    Papal legate, fallen under the penalties of praemunire. The boldness and
                    originality of this advice, and the reputation for ability, address, and
                    fidelity which he had gained, pointed Cromwell out to Henry as likely to prove a
                    minister of no ordinary value; and he was at once taken into favour. The way,
                    however, had been previously prepared. The duke of Bedford, whose life Cromwell
                    had saved in Italy, spoke in his behalf; and he had recently laid several of the
                    other courtiers under obligations. He had advised the cardinal to advance his
                    interest at eourt by conferring handsome presents on those who had the greatest
                    influence with the king, and had himself undertaken to fix the amounts, and
                    choose the recipients, of these gifts.</p>
                <p>Thus Cromwell gained entrance into the king’s service. His rise was rapid, for he
                    possessed qualities which admirably fitted him ’for success as a minister of
                    Henry VIII. He was capable of carrying on a strong and arbitrary government with
                    a hand that shrank from no measure that seemed necessary, and an eye that never
                    failed in its vigilance; and, whenever the king chose to act independently, he
                    was supple enough to bend, and to bend gracefully, to the inevitable. In him
                    also the king found a servant who did not scorn to offer the flattery which ho
                    expected, who performed with zeal and care any service, however trivial, and who
                    was ever ready to join heartily in the hunting, gambling, and other pastimes in
                    which he delighted. That, with these qualities, he was of obscure birth was a
                    circumstance in his favour; for tho policy of humbling the nobility, which had
                    been steadily pursued by Henry VΠ., had not been reversed by his son.
                    Immediately, or almost immediately, after his interview with the king, Cromwell
                    was appointed privy councillor. One more service he rendered to Wolsey, as the
                    bearer of tho king’s gift of a thousand pounds; but his fortunes were no longer
                    linked with those of the cardinal. By 1532 he had obtained the posts of master
                    of the jewels and clerk of the hanaper; in 1533 he was raised to the office of
                    chancellor of the exchequer for life. By 1535 he had become master of the rolls,
                    secretary of state, and, most important of all, had been appointed to the
                    highest office in the church as vicar-general in ecclesiastical affairs,—a title
                    which was afterwards changed (with what change of power, if any, is now unknown)
                    for that of vicegerent. In 1536 he was made lord privy seal. In 1537 he received
                    the Order of the Garter. And, besides these dignities and offices, he held those
                    of great chamberlain, dean of Wells, chancellor of the university of Cambridge,
                    justice of the forests north of tho Trent, and Baron Cromwell of Oke-ham. On the
                    17th April 1540 he was created earl of Essex.</p>
                <p>To narrate the details and trace out the effects of Cromwell’s policy belongs to
                    history. In this biography it is sufficient to consider the general character of
                    the measures for which he was responsible, to estimate his aims, and motives,
                    and discuss the means which he employed.</p>
                <p>A great scheme, consistently carried out, is manifest throughout the whole of his
                    political career. All power was to be centralized in the hands of the king, or
                    in those of the ministers whom he appointed; for the present, that is, in the
                    hands of Cromwell himself. In secular affairs this centralization was already
                    almost complete. Parliament voted, and the judges decided, as the king wished;
                    and juries could be readily frightened into abject submission. The power of the
                    nobles, which of old had been the <pb break="no"

                    laid in the dust by the Wars of the Hoses and the successful policy of Henry VIL
                    The church alone retained a species of independence. That independence it was
                    therefore Cromwell’s first aim to destroy. The momentous contemporary events
                    which suggested his scheme gave him the opportunity of effecting its
                    accomplishment. It was the support of the Papacy which alone enabled the English
                    clergy to make any stand against their sovereign; and on the Continent that
                    authority had been repudiated by several states. In England the king’s mind was
                    ripe for a breach with Rome^ and the new learning had spread a general desire
                    for ecclesiastical reform. Henry was soon persuaded to sever every bond that
                    united England with Rome. Parliament complied with its usual facility. The
                    clergy were forced, as the price of escape from the penalties of praemunire, to
                    acknowledge the king’s headship of the church. And all Cromwell’s foreign policy
                    was directed to support this great revolution; England was to be placed at the
                    head of a Protestant league which should defy the emperor and the Pope.</p>
                <p>Such being Cromwell’s policy, it was natural that he should make ∙ himself the
                    recognized protector o <hi rend="superscript"> p</hi> Protestant heretics. He
                    was unable to offer the slightest resistance to the passing of the Six Articles,
                    by which Henry sought to fix the faith of England and terrify all parties into
                    order, but he allowed no Lutheran to pay the penalties which the Articles
                    enacted. He was the patron of Coverdale; and to him was due that, version of the
                    English Bible known as the <hi rend="italic">Great Bible,</hi> the first edition
                    of which has taken his name. In 1539 he obtained the' office of licenser of
                    Bibles; and he distributed copies all over England, commanding that in every
                    parish church whoever desired to read should have free opportunity. Whether he
                    had any sympathy with doctrinal Protestantism is very doubtful. Foxe <hi

                    true that he did read the New Testament, not without after results.<note

                    >(Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury,</hi> vol. i. p. 120) asserts of
                    Cromwell that it is “more than doubtful whether he ever understood Latin at
                    all.” But the evidence points decidedly in the opposite direction. Latimer
                    writes to him partly in Latin (Strype, vol. i. pt. i. p. 512); in a letter to
                    Henry VIII. he quotes in that language part of a letter from Melauchthon which
                    he had received (Strype, vol. i. pt. ii. p. 403); and Coverdale addresses him in
                    terms which could not have been applied in those days except as an insult to any
                    man ignorant of so common an accomplishment,</p></note> But his stay in Italy,
                    while it would tend to make him the enemy of the Papacy, would equally tend to
                    make him altogether anti-theological in his habits of thought. Distress,
                    however, seems to have driven him to the consolations afforded by the doctrines
                    of the old religion. In his perplexity at Esher, he is said to have betaken
                    himself to the repetition of prayers to the Virgin; and his will, dat*ed 1529,
                    also goes to show that he was doctrinally no heretic. In it he orders the
                    appointment of a priest at a salary of <hi rend="italic">£6,</hi> 13s. 4d. per
                    annum, to sing masses for his soul; for the same object he saddles a bequest to
                    his brother-in-law and sister with £8 a year, and leaves 20s. to each of the
                    five orders of friars in London; and he directs £20 to be divided among poor
                    householders that they may act as his beadsmen. It is possible, however, that
                    this may merely have been a politic deference to custom. Both the last speech of
                    Cromwell, which announces his return to Catholicism, and his last prayer, which
                    is Protestant in its tone, are of very doubtful authenticity.</p>
                <p>The work for which Cromwell is popularly remembered, that which earned him his
                    distinctive title of “malleus monachorum,” was the abolition of the monasteries.
                    The means he employed to accomplish this measure were characteristic.
                    Commissioners were sent to visit the monks and nuns, and give reports of
                    whatever irregularities could be discovered in their conduct. The juggleries of
                    pretended miracles were exposed; rough farces in ridicule of the priests, and
                    even of the sacraments, were allowed to be acted in place of the mysteries or
                    miracle-plays. Every shrine was destroyed, all its costly gifts being seized by
                    the king. The bones of St Thomas à Becket, the hero of a signal triumph of the
                    Papacy over the Crown, were dug up and burnt as those of a traitor; his name was
                    removed from the service-book; his festival ordered to be neglected; every
                    window erected to his memory ruthlessly destroyed; Cromwell even thought it
                    worth while to publish a proclamation giving an official account of his
                    treasons. A grant of the monastic property to the king was obtained from the
                    Commons, who expected that the pressure of taxation would thus be relieved. And
                    the nobles and wealthier commoners were conciliated by the chances that offered
                    of cheap purchases of land.</p>
                <p>For seven years Cromwell was supreme in the royal council, and supreme in all the
                    departments of the administration. He was not altogether independent; every
                    measure of importance had to be approved, and many were modified, by the king,
                    who, moreover, often chose to act for himself in matters of the greatest moment,
                    without even seeking his minister’s advice. Yet during the period of his
                    ministry Cromwell was certainly responsible for the general character of the
                    government. The servant of a master who spared no life that endangered his
                    authority or even disturbed his tranquillity, living in an age when to allow any
                    to escape whose acts or avowed opinions were inconsistent with the policy of the
                    Government would have been considered mere weak-minded lenity, he carried out
                    the principles of his master, he followed the practice of his age, with stern
                    and unvarying regularity. A position of unparalleled danger, both from traitors
                    at home and from foreign attacks, had been assumed by the Government. The
                    greatest promptitude and vigour were essential to safety. But during Cromwell s
                    ministry vigour and promptitude were carried to an extreme. Laws never equalled
                    for severity in the history of England were enacted. No opposition was allowed
                    to endure for a moment. It is true that the blood of More and Fisher, of the
                    marquis of Exeter, Lord Montague, and the countess of Salisbury (the last of
                    whom, indeed, was executed ten months after the death of Cromwell) was shed in
                    no private quarrel. Cromwell’s policy had been adopted by the king; and in some
                    cases he was no more than the king’s official agent. Yet that he fully
                    sympathized with these severities is past a doubt. The condemnation of Exeter,
                    Montague, and the countess of Salisbury by attainder without trial was due to
                    his suggestion. It was he, as numerous memoranda of his remain to prove, who
                    enforced the execution of the laws of treason upon minor offenders. It was he
                    who doomed “the Abbott Redyng to be sent down to be tryed and executed at Redyng
                    with his comply cys,”—“the Abbott of Glaston to be tryed at Glaston and also to
                    be executed there with his complycys,” and who ordered “that the evydens be well
                    sortyd and the indytmentts well drawn against the said abbotts and their
                    complycys,” and “to send Gendon to the Towre to be rakkyd.”<note anchored="true"

                    Throgmorton, once a spy of his own, now a follower of Cardinal Pole’s, in which,
                    after hinting that both master and servant may yet obtain mercy by submission,
                    he breaks into a threat—“There may be found ways enough in Italy to rid a
                    traitorous subject. Surely let him not think but, when justice can take no place
                    by process of law at home, sometimes she may be enforced to take new means
                    abroad.” In private matters Cromwell’s temper was equally arbitrary. Stowe’s
                    father, for instance, as the chronicler himself narrates, had his house removed
                    upon rollers, without his consent or even knowledge, to make room for Cromwell’s
                    buildings in Throgmorton Street, London; and Foxe, partisan as he was, gives
                    other instances.</p>
                <p>Such a career could not fail to surround Cromwell with numerous and implacable
                    enemies, and to afford many real grounds of accusation. His private expenditure
                    had been splendid; he was fond of adding house to house; and two hundred poor
                    persons were daily fed at his door. The cost of the system by which he supported
                    his power had been enormous. Presents had been freely lavished upon men of
                    influence, and an army of spies and agents had been maintained and generously
                    rewarded. Such expenses his private fortune and the grants he had received from
                    the king were quite inadequate to support; and it was easy to prove, not only
                    that he had been in the regular habit of receiving gifts from suitors and others
                    who desired his favour, but that much of the public money had been used by him
                    without passing through the public treasury. He was the patron of heretics. His
                    promises of a full treasury and relieved taxation had not been fulfilled;
                    taxation, indeed, had been increased; and, for that and many other reasons, his
                    government was now extremely unpopular. The nobles, almost to a man, and most of
                    the clergy, were his foes; but perhaps his deadliest enemy was his old companion
                    in the service of Wolsey, Stephen Gardyner, bishop of Winchester,, whom he had
                    in vain attempted to crush under the Act of Supremacy. That part of his policy
                    of which the accomplishment was desired by Henry was completely achieved, and
                    Henry had no longer any interest in supporting him. He had, besides, committed a
                    fatal mistake. His enemies had potent means in their possession for kindling
                    against him all the fury of which Henry’s nature was capable. It could be
                    proved, beyond the possibility of doubt, that he had been long engaged in
                    negotiations with the German Protestant princes without the knowledge of the
                    king, whom, besides, to further his plans, he had involved in the hateful
                    marriage with Anne of Cleves. His danger had not been unforeseen; and two years
                    before his fall he is said to have arranged his affairs, so that his family, and
                    his servants, to whom he was always a thoughtful and generous master, should not
                    be left unprovided for. But the blow fell unexpectedly. On the 10 th of June
                    1540 at the council table, the duke of Norfolk rose and accused him of high
                    treason. Witnesses were present to swear that he had declared that he would
                    fight in support of his opinions, “sword in hand, against the king and all
                    others,” and that in a year or two he would have so far carried out his policy
                    that the king .should no longer be able to resist it. In vain he passionately
                    exclaimed against the absurdity of charging him with treason. His enemies had
                    attained their revenge. In rude triumph the duke of Suffolk stripped him of his
                    George; the earl of Southampton tore the Garter from his knee. He was
                    immediately removed to the Tower. That night in the city the bells of the
                    churches rang out peals of joy, bonfires blazed, and many of the citizens held
                    exultant revel. His friend Cranmer alone uttered a word in his favour. A bill of
                    attainder, accusing him of peculation, extortion, bribery, contempt for the
                    nobility, heresy, and treason, was passed with acclamation. Twice in vain he
                    appealed to the king for mercy in terms of the most pitiful entreaty. Having
                    drawn up a statement concerning Henry’s relations with Anne of Cleves, adapted
                    to facilitate her divorce, he took the opportunity to protest against the
                    injustice and illegality of condemning him unheard, and concluded with a pitiful
                    cry for “Mercy! mercy! mercy !” And again, in a letter which he contrived to
                    convey to the king by the hands of his old servant, Sir Ralph Sadler, he
                    attempted to defend himself, especially against the charge— which he well knew
                    would be one of the most fatal brought against him—of having divulged certain of
                    the royal secrets, and once more, in humble but passionate language, besought
                    pardon. Henry was moved, but remained inexorable; and, on the 28th July 1540,
                    Thomas Cromwell was beheaded.</p>
