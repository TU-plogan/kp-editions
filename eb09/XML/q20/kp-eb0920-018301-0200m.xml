                    who was an only child, was much alone, but his mother (whose name was Eugénie
                    Rozat Lagis, and who was a person of education and strong though somewhat
                    unorthodox religious views) exercised great influence over him. He was sent to
                    school first at Bourg and then at Lyons, where he took no part in a celebrated
                    barring out which led to the expulsion of his schoolfellow Jules Janin. On
                    leaving school his father wished him to go into the army and then suggested
                    business. But Quinet was determined upon literature, and after a time got his
                    way. His first publication, the <hi rend="italic">Tablettes du Juif</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Errant,</hi> appeared in 1823. Being struck with Herder’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophie</hi><hi rend="italic">der Geschichte,</hi> he
                    undertook to translate it, learnt German for the purpose, published his work in
                    1827, and obtained by it considerable credit. At this time he was introduced to
                    Cousin and made the acquaintance of Michelet. He had visited Germany and England
                    before the appearance of his book. Cousin procured him a post on a Government
                    mission to the Morea in 1829, and on his return he published in 1830 a book on
                    <hi rend="italic">La Grèce Moderne.</hi> Some hopes of employment which he had
                    after the revolution of February were frustrated by the reputation of
                    speculative republicanism which he had acquired. But he joined the staff of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes,</hi> and for some years contributed to
                    it numerous essays, the most remarkable of which was that on “Les Épopées
                    Françaises du Xllème Siècle,” an early though not by any means the earliest
                    appreciation of the long-neglected <hi rend="italic">chansons</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de geste. Ahasvérus,</hi> his first original work of consequence,
                    appeared in 1833. This is a singular prose poem in language sometimes rather
                    bombastic but often beautiful. Shortly afterwards he married Minna Moré, a
                    German girl with whom he had fallen in love some years before. Then he visited
                    Italy, and, besides writing many essays, produced two poems, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Napoléon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Promethee</hi> (1833), which being written
                    in verse (of which he was not a master) are inferior to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ahasvérus.</hi> In 1838 he published a vigorous reply to Strauss’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Jesus,</hi> and in that year he received the Legion of
                    Honour. In 1839 he was appointed professor of foreign literature at Lyons, where
                    he began the brilliant course of lectures afterwards embodied in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Génie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Religions.</hi> Two years later he
                    was transferred to the Collège de France and the <hi rend="italic">Génie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Religions</hi> itself appeared (1842).</p>
                <p>Quinet’s Parisian professorship was more notorious than fortunate, owing, it must
                    be said, to his own fault. His chair was one of Southern Literature, but,
                    neglecting his proper subject, he chose, in conjunction with Michelet, to engage
                    in a violent polemic with the Jesuits and with Ultramontanism. Two books bearing
                    exactly these titles appeared in 1843 and 1844, and contained, as was usual with
                    Quinet, the substance of his lectures. These excited so much disturbance and the
                    author so obstinately refused to confine himself to literature proper that in
                    1846 the Government put an end to them—a course which was not disapproved by the
                    majority of his colleagues. By this time Quinet was a pronounced republican and
                    something of a revolutionist. He appeared in arms during the disturbances which
                    overthrew Louis Philippe, and was elected by the department of the Ain to the
                    Constituent and then to the Legislative Assembly, where he figured among the
                    extreme Radical party. He had published in 1848 <hi rend="italic">Les</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Révolutions</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Italie,</hi> one of his principal though
                    not one of his best works. He wrote numerous pamphlets during the short-lived
                    second republic, attacked the Roman expedition with all his strength, and was
                    from the first an uncompromising opponent of Prince Louis Napoleon. He was
                    banished from France after the <hi rend="italic">coup d'état,</hi> and
                    established himself at Brussels. His wife had died some time previously, and he
                    now married Mademoiselle Assaki, the daughter of a Roumanian poet. At Brussels
                    he lived for some seven years, during which he published <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Esclaves</hi> (1853), a dramatic poem, <hi rend="italic">Marnix</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Ste</hi><hi rend="italic">Aldégonde</hi>
                    (1854), a study of that Reformer in which he very greatly exaggerates Sainte
                    Aldegonde’s literary merit, and some other books. He then moved to Veytaux on
                    the shore of the Lake of Geneva, where he continued to reside till the fall of
                    the empire. Here his pen was busier than ever. In 1860 appeared a singular book
                    somewhat after the fashion of <hi rend="italic">Ahasvérus</hi> entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Merlin lΕnchanteur,</hi> in 1862 a <hi rend="italic">Histoire de
                    la Campagne</hi><hi rend="italic">de 1815,</hi> in 1865 an elaborate book on the
                    French Revolution, in which the author, republican as he was, blamed the acts of
                    the revolutionists unsparingly, and by that means drew down on himself much
                    wrath from more thoroughgoing partisans. Many pamphlets date from this period,
                    as does <hi rend="italic">La Création</hi> (1870), a third book of the class of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ahasvérus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Merlin,</hi> but even
                    vaguer, dealing not with history, legend, or philosophy, but with physical
                    science for the most part.</p>
                <p>Quinet had refused to return to France to join the Liberal opposition against
                    Napoleon III., but immediately after Sedan he returned. He was then restored to
                    his professorship<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n201/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0201-0184"/>, and during the siege wrote vehemently against
                    the Germans. He was elected deputy by the department of the Seine in 1871, and
                    was one of the most obstinate opponents of the terms of peace between France and
                    Germany. He continued to write till his death, which occurred at Versailles on
                    the 27th March 1875. <hi rend="italic">Le Siège</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Paris</hi><hi rend="italic">et la Défense Nationale</hi> appeared in 1871, <hi
                    rend="italic">La République</hi> in 1872, Ze <hi rend="italic">Livre de
                    l’Exilé</hi> in the year of its author’s death and after it. This has been
                    followed by three volumes of letters and some other work. Quinct had already in
                    1858 published a semi-biographic book called <hi rend="italic">Histoire de mes
                    Ldées.</hi> The whole of his very numerous works, the chief of which have been
                    already named, have appeared in a uniform edition of which some thirty volumes
                    are now published. His second wife, in 1870, published certain <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">d'Exil.</hi> There is in English an elaborate
                    <hi rend="italic">Early Life and Writings of Edgar Quinet,</hi> by R. Heath
                    (London, 1881), but it does not go beyond the year 1842.</p>
                <p>Quinet’s character was extremely amiable, and his letters to his mother, his
                    accounts of his early life, and so forth are likely always to make him
                    interesting. He was also a man of great moral conscientiousness, and as far as
                    intention went perfectly disinterested, though it may perhaps be questioned
                    whether the disappointment which he met with for years after the revolution of
                    February had not an insensible influence in determining his republicanism. But
                    he never temporized, and, as has been said above, hesitated not to criticize his
                    own party as severely as his opponents. He had, however, as a writer, a thinker,
                    and a politician, drawbacks which prevented him from taking the first rank, and
                    which will probably make his works, except those which are purely personal, less
                    and less read in the future. As a writer his chief fault is want of
                    concentration, as a thinker and politician vagueness and want of practical
                    determination. Bis work is very extensive and abounds in passages of great
                    beauty. But no single book of his can be called a masterpiece, and none is of
                    such a kind that the reader feels the subject to have been thoroughly treated in
                    accordance with a definite and consistent principle or series of principles. Of
                    verse he had but little command, and his abundance in a certain kind of effusive
                    prose wants chastisement and criticism. The singular rhapsodies, of which in the
                    three books <hi rend="italic">Ahasvérus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Merlin,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">La Création</hi> he has left great store, are too diffuse, too
                    inorganic, and too devoid of coherent and positive intention to rank very high.
                    They are more like recorded dreams than anything else. His historical and
                    philosophical works on the other hand, though showing much reading, fertile
                    thought, abundant facility of expression, and occasionally, where prejudice does
                    not come in, acute judgment, are rather (as not a few of them were in fact)
                    reported lectures than formal treatises. His rhetorical power was altogether
                    superior to his logical power, and the natural consequence is that his work is
                    full of contradictions. These contradictions were, moreover, due not merely to
                    an incapacity or an unwillingness to argue strictly, but also to the presence in
                    his mind of a large number of inconsistent tastes and prejudices which he either
                    could not or would not coordinate into an intelligible creed. Thus he has the
                    strongest attraction for the picturesque side of mediaevalism and catholicity,
                    the strongest repulsion for the restrictions λvhich mediaeval and Catholic
                    institutions imposed on individual liberty. He refused to submit himself to any
                    form of positive orthodoxy, yet when a man like Strauss pushed unorthodoxy to
                    its extreme limits Quinet revolted. As a politician he acted with the extreme
                    Radicals, yet universal suffrage, the cardinal doctrine of Radicalism, disgusted
                    him as unreasonable in its principle and dangerous in its results. His pervading
                    characteristic, therefore, is that of an eloquent vagueness, very stimulating
                    and touching at times, but as deficient in coercive force of matter as it is in
                    lasting precision and elegance of form. He is less inaccurate in fact than
                    Michelet, but he is also much less one-ideaed, and the result is that he seldom
                    attains to the vivid representation of which Michelet was a master. (G. SA.)</p>
