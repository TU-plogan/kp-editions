                    rend="italic">Curiata</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the consul Brutus, which
                    Tacitus assumes to have been identical with that of the kings.</p></note> The
                    number of the quaestors was originally two, but this was successively increased
                    to four (in 421 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> eight (in 267 or 241 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), and by Sulla (in 81 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>
                    to twenty. Caesar raised the number to forty (in 45 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> but Augustus reduced it again to twenty, which remained the regular
                    number under the empire. When the number was raised from two to four in 421 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the office was thrown open to the plebeians, and it
                    was the first office that was so opened. It was the lowest of the great offices
                    of state, and hence it was regularly the first sought by aspirants to a
                    political career. Towards the close of the republic, if not earlier, the
                    successful candidate was bound to have completed his thirtieth year before he
                    entered on office, but Augustus lowered the age to twenty-five. Originally the
                    quaestors seem to have been nominated by the consuls independently, but later,
                    perhaps from the fall of the decemvirs (449 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi>
                    they were elected by the people assembled in tribes <hi rend="italic">(comitia
                    tributa)</hi> and presided over by a consul or another of the higher
                    magistrates. The quaestors held office for one year, but, like the consuls and
                    praetors, they were often continued in office with the title of proquaestor.
                    Indeed it was a regular rule that the quaestor attached to a higher magistrate
                    should hold office as long as his superior; hence, when a consul regularly
                    presided over the city for one year, and afterwards as proconsul governed a
                    province for another year, his quaestor also regularly held office for two
                    years. Before the election of the quaestors the senate decided the duties to be
                    undertaken by them, and after election these duties were distributed amongst the
                    new quaestors either by lot or by the choice of the higher magistrates to whom a
                    quaestor was assigned. A peculiar burden laid on the quaestors, not so much as
                    an official duty, but rather as a sort of fee exacted from all who entered on
                    the political career, was the paving of the high roads, for which Claudius
                    substituted the exhibition of gladiatorial games. Various classes of quaestors
                    may be distinguished according to the duties they had respectively to discharge.
                    Up to 421 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> there were only two quaestors, and when
                    fresh ones were added the two original quaestors were distinguished by the
                    appellation of urban quaestors <hi rend="italic">(quaestores urbani),</hi>
                    doubtless because they were bound to remain in Rome during their term of
                    office.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Urban Quaestors.—</hi> Originally the duties of the
                    quaestors, like those of the consuls, were of a general and undefined nature;
                    specialization of function had not yet arisen—the consuls were simply the
                    superior, the quaestors simply the inferior magistrates of the republic. From a
                    very early time, however, the quaestors possessed criminal to the exclusion of
                    civil jurisdiction. The very name “quaestor” (from <hi rend="italic"
                    >quaerere,</hi> “to search out”) means “investigator,” “inquisitor.” In the code
                    of the Twelve Tables they are designated <hi rend="italic">qxιaestores</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">parricidii,</hi> “inquisitors of parricide or murder”;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The etymology and original
                    meaning of <hi rend="italic">parricidium</hi> are doubtful. In the latter part
                    of the word we have, of course, the same root as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >caedere,</hi> “to kill,” but whether or not the former part is from <hi
                    rend="italic">pater,</hi> “a father,” or from the same root that we have in <hi
                    rend="italic">per-ρeram, per-jurium,</hi> is a moot point. Mommsen takes the
                    latter view.</p></note> and perhaps originally this was their full title, which
                    was afterwards abbreviated into quaestors when their functions as criminal
                    judges fell into the background. In addition to parricide or murder we can
                    hardly doubt that all other crimes fell within the jurisdiction of the
                    quaestors; political crimes only seem to have been excepted. The criminal
                    jurisdiction of the quaestors appears <pb break="no"

                    the republic trial by permanent courts <hi rend="italic">(quaestiones

                    p. 506.</p></note></p>
                <p>The quaestors had also charge of the public treasury <hi rend="italic"
                    >(aerarium)</hi> in the temple of Saturn, and this was in the later times of the
                    republic their most important function. They kept the keys of the treasury and
                    had charge of its contents, including not only coin and bullion but also the
                    military standards and a large number of public documents, which in later times
                    comprised all the laws as well as the decrees of the senate. Their functions as
                    keepers of the treasury were withdrawn from the urban quaestors by Augustus and
                    transferred to other magistrates, but the office itself continued to exist into
                    the 3d century, though as to the nature of the duties attached to it we have
                    little or no information.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Military</hi><hi rend="italic">Quaestors.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> These were instituted in 421 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> when two new quaestors were added to the original two. They never
                    had a distinctive appellation like that of the urban quaestors, from whom,
                    however, they were clearly distinguished by the fact that, while the urban
                    quaestors did not stand in a special relation of subordination to any particular
                    magistrate, a non-urban quaestor was regularly assigned as an indispensable
                    assistant or adjutant to every general in command, whose name or title the
                    quaestor usually added to his own.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Thus Cicero speaks of the <hi rend="italic">provincia
                    consularis</hi> of the quaestor, and we find <hi rend="italic">quaestor</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cn.</hi><hi rend="italic">Pompei,</hi> &amp;c.</p></note>
                    Originally they were the adjutants of the consuls only, afterwards of the
                    provincial praetors, and still later of the proconsuls and propraetors. The
                    dictator alone among military commanders had no quaestor, because a quaestor
                    would have been a limitation to his powers. The governor of Sicily had two
                    quaestors; all other governors and commanders had but one. Between the quaestor
                    and his superior a close personal relation, analogous to that between a son and
                    his father, existed, and was not severed when their official connexion ceased.
                    Not till the close of the republic do cases occur of a quaestor being sent to a
                    province invested with praetorial and even consular powers; in one case at least
                    the quaestor so sent had a second quaestor placed under him. The duties of the
                    military quaestor, like those of the treasury quaestor, were primarily
                    financial. Moneys due to a provincial governor from the state treasury were
                    often, perhaps regularly, received and disbursed by the quaestor; the magazines
                    seem to have been under his charge; he coined money, on which not unfrequently
                    his name appears alone. The booty taken in war was not necessarily under the
                    control of the quaestor, but was dealt with, especially iu later times, by
                    inferior officers called <hi rend="italic">praefecti</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fabrum.</hi> But, though his duties were primarily financial, the quaestor was
                    after all the chief assistant or adjutant of his superior in command, and as
                    such he was invested with a certain degree of military power; under the republic
                    his military rank was superior to that of the legates, though under the empire
                    this relation was reversed. When the general left his province before the
                    arrival of his successor he usually committed it to the care of his quaestor,
                    and, if he died or was incapacitated from naming his successor, the quaestor
                    acted as his representative. Unlike the urban quaestor, the military quaestor
                    possessed not a criminal but a civil jurisdiction corresponding to that of the
                    aediles at Rome.</p>

                    rend="italic">—</hi> The subjugation of Italy occasioned the institution (in 267
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> of four new quaestors, who appear to have been
                    called <hi rend="italic">quaestores classici</hi> because they were originally
                    intended to superintend the building of the fleet <hi rend="italic"
                    >(classis)</hi>; their functions, however, are very imperfectly known. Though no
                    doubt intended to assist the consuls, they were not subordinated (like the
                    military quaestors) to a special consul. They were stationed at Ostia, at Gales
                    in Campania, and in Gaul about the Padus (Po). The station of the fourth is not
                    mentioned; perhaps it was Lilybaeum in Sicily.</p>
