                    county are nominally in the custody of the <hi rend="italic">custos
                    rotulorum,</hi> the highest civil officer in the county, practically in that of
                    the clerk of the peace, who is nominated by the <hi rend="italic">custos</hi>
                    and removable by the quarter sessions. In a city or borough he is appointed by
                    the council and removable by the recorder. The original jurisdiction of quarter
                    sessions seems to have been confined to cognizance of breaches of the peace. By
                    a series of statutes passed in the reign of Edward III. the time of the holding
                    of the sessions was fixed, and their jurisdiction extended to the trial of
                    felonies and trespasses. The jurisdiction now depends upon a mass of legislation
                    reaching from 1344 to the present time. The dates at which the county sessions
                    must meet are fixed, by 2 Geo. IV. and 1 Will. IV. c. 70, to be the first weeks
                    after the 11th of October, the 28th of December, the 31st of March, and the 24th
                    of June. Quarter sessions in a city or borough depend upon the Municipal
                    Corporations Act, 1882, 45 &amp; 46 Vict., c. 50. A grant of quarter sessions to
                    a city or borough is made by the crown in council on petition of the town
                    council. The main points in which borough differ from county quarter sessions
                    are these:—(1) the recorder, a barrister of five years’ standing, is sole judge
                    in place of a body of laymen; (2) the recorder has a discretion to fix his own
                    dates for the holding of a court, as long as he holds it once every quarter of a
                    year; it may be held more frequently if the recorder think fit or a secretary of
                    state so direct; (3) the recorder has no power to levy a borough rate or to
                    grant a licence for the sale of exciseable liquors by retail. In some few
                    boroughs the recorder is judge of the borough civil court. Quarter sessions in
                    the counties of Middlesex, Kent, and Lancaster, as also in London and the Cinque
                    Ports, are governed by special legislation.</p>
                <p>The jurisdiction of quarter sessions is either original or appellate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Original Jurisdiction.—Civil.—</hi> This includes the levying
                    of a county rate and its application, the appointment of a county licensing
                    committee, and of public officers, such as the county treasurer, the public
                    analyst, and the inspectors of weights and measures, the confirmation of
                    bye-laws made by local authorities, the increase or alteration of polling places
                    and petty sessional divisions, the regulation of police, and powers under
                    various Acts of Parliament, such as the Highway Acts, and the Contagious
                    Diseases (Animals) Act. The quarter sessions of the metropolitan counties have
                    by 25 Geo. II. c. 36 the power of licensing music-halls, &amp;c., within 20
                    miles of London.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Criminal.—</hi> Apart from statute, the commissions of justices
                    of the peace provide that they shall reserve the graver felonies for trial at
                    assizes. They are now forbidden by several Acts of Parliament to try a prisoner
                    for treason or murder, or for any felony punishable without a previous
                    conviction by penal servitude for life (such as burglary and rape), or for any
                    of the offences enumerated in 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 38, the most practically
                    important of which are perjury, forgery, bigamy, abduction, concealment of
                    birth, libel, bribery, and conspiracy. The procedure is by indictment, as at
                    assizes, and the trial of offences by jury. In the case of incorrigible rogues
                    and of sureties of the peace the quarter sessions exercise a quasi-criminal
                    jurisdiction without a jury. They may also estreat recognizances entered into
                    for appearance in a court of summary jurisdiction, but this part of their
                    jurisdiction may be considered practically obsolete, as the Summary Jurisdiction
                    Act, 1879, gives the court of summary jurisdiction power to estreat the
                    recognizances itself.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Appellate Jurisdiction.—Civil.—</hi> The principal cases in
                    which this jurisdiction is exercised are in appeals from orders of a court of
                    summary jurisdiction as to the assessment of the poor-rate and the removal and
                    settlement of paupers, and orders made under the Highway, Licensing, and
                    Bastardy Acts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Criminal.—</hi> An appeal lies to quarter sessions from a court
                    of summary jurisdiction only where such an appeal is expressly given by statute.
                    The appellate jurisdiction has been considerably increased by the Summary
                    Jurisdiction Act, 1879 (42 &amp; 43 Viet, c. 49), which allows an appeal (with
                    certain exceptions) from every conviction or order of a court of summary
                    jurisdiction inflicting imprisonment without the option of a fine. The appeal
                    may be <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n171/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0171-0160"/> brought in accordance with either the Act giving
                    the appeal or the Summary Jurisdiction Act.</p>
                <p>There is no appeal from quarter sessions on the facts, but their decision may be
                    reviewed by the High Court of Justice by means of <hi rend="italic">certiorari,
                    mandamus,</hi> prohibition, or a case stated under 12 &amp; 13 Vict. c. 45, §
                    11. A case may be stated for the opinion of the court of criminal appeal under
                    1Ï &amp; 12 Vict. c. 78, § 1.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ireland.—</hi> In Ireland the chairman of quarter sessions is a
                    salaried professional lawyer, and has important civil jurisdiction corresponding
                    very much to that of a county court judge in England. His jurisdiction depends
                    chiefly upon 14 &amp; 15 Vict. c. 57. The recorders of Dublin and Cork are
                    judges of the civil bill courts in those cities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> In Scotland quarter sessions were established
                    by the Act 1661, c. 338, under which justices were to meet on the first Tuesday
                    of March, May, and August, and the last Tuesday of October to “administrate
                    justice to the people in things that are within their jurisdiction and punish
                    the guilty for faults and crimes done and committed in the preceding quarter.”
                    The jurisdiction of quarter sessions in Scotland is more limited than in
                    England, much of what would be quarter-sessions work in England being done by
                    the sheriff or the commissioners of supply. Quarter sessions have appellate
                    jurisdiction in poaching, revenue, and licensing cases, and under the
                    Pawnbrokers and other Acts. All appeals from proceedings under the Summary
                    Jurisdiction Acts are taken to the High Court of Justiciary at Edinburgh or on
                    circuit (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. 33). The original jurisdiction of quarter sessions
                    is very limited, and almost entirely civil. Thus they have power to divide a
                    county and to make rules for carrying into effect the provisions of the Small
                    Debts Act, 6 Geo. IV. c. 48. The decision of quarter sessions may be reviewed by
                    advocation, suspension, or appeal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> In the United States courts of quarter
                    sessions exist in many of the States; their jurisdiction is determined by State
                    legislation, and extends as a rule only to the less grave crimes. They are in
                    some States constituted of professional judges.</p>
