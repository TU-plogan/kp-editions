                    the continent. Quebec is built on the northern extremity of an elevated
                    table-land which forms the left bank of the St Lawrence for a distance of 8
                    miles. The highest part of the headland is Cape Diamond, 333 feet above the
                    level of the water, and crowned by the citadel, which covers an area of forty
                    acres, and presents a bold and precipitous front on the south-east side, while
                    towards the north and west the declivity is more sloping and gradual. The
                    harbour of Quebec is spacious and capable of accommodating ships of the largest
                    tonnage, and its docks and tidal basin, when completed, will rank among the most
                    perfect works of the kind in the world. They are constructed of limestone and
                    iron, and, including the graving dock on the Levis side of the river, will cost
                    very nearly three millions of dollars. The harbour is protected towards the
                    northeast by the island of Orleans, on either side of which there is an
                    approach. The spring tides rise and fall about 18 feet. Quebec is divided into
                    upper and lower town,— access to the former being obtained by a steep and
                    winding street, several flights of narrow steps, and an elevator. In the lower
                    town are situated the principal banks, merchants’ offices, and wholesale and
                    retail stores. The streets, with one or two exceptions, are narrow and
                    irregular. In the upper towm, where the streets are wider and well-paved, are
                    the better class of dwelling houses, the public buildings, most of the churches,
                    the public walks and gardens, retail stores and small shops. To the west are the
                    suburbs of St John, St Louis, and St Roche. The latter occupies the lower plain,
                    and is rapidly becoming a place of commercial importance. The other two suburbs
                    are on the same level with the upper town. South-west of St John stretch the
                    historic Plains of Abraham. On this battlé-ground a column 40 feet high has been
                    erected to mark the spot where General Wolfe in 1759 died victorious. In the
                    governor’s garden, -which overlooks the St Lawrence, is a stately monument 65
                    feet in height, which is dedicated to the memory of Wolfe and Montcalm. An iron
                    pillar surmounted by a bronze statue, the gift of Prince Napoleon Bonaparte,
                    stands on St Foye road, and commemorates the achievements of the British and
                    French troops in 1760. Four martello towers occupy commanding positions. A point
                    of interest in the upper town is Dufferin Terrace, a magnificent promenade 1400
                    feet long and 200 feet above the level of the river. Part of this terrace
                    occupies the site of the old Château St Louis, -which was destroyed by fire in
                    1834. The view from the platform is very striking and beautiful. The Grand
                    Battery also affords a fine prospect. Quebec was once the walled city of the
                    north, but several of its ancient fortifications have been dismantled, and the
                    old gates <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n184/mode/1up"

                <p>Roman Catholic educational institutions. Morrin College (Presbyterian) was
                    founded by Dr Morrin, and is affiliated with M‘Gill University. Other Protestant
                    schools are the boys’ high school, the girls’ high school, a number of
                    academies, and public and private schools, all in a state of efficiency. In 1881
                    the number of children attending the various schools in Quebec was 9889, of whom
                    half were girls. There is no free public library in the city, but the Literary
                    and Historical Society,—the oldest chartered institution of the kind in Canada,
                    founded by Lord Dalhousie in 1824,—the Canadian Institute, the Geographical
                    Society, the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Advocates’ Library, and the
                    Parliamentary Library have valuable collections of books. The principal
                    benevolent institutions are the marine hospital, the Hôtel Dieu, founded in 1639
                    by the duchess of Aiguillon, the general hospital (1693), the Finlay Asylum, the
                    Jeffrey Hale Hospital, the Church of England Female Orphans’ Asylum, the Ladies’
                    Protestant Home, St Bridget’s Asylum, Grey Nunnery, and the lunatic asylum at
                    Beauport. Nine daily newspapers are published at Quebec, six of which are in the
                    French language. A good supply of water is afforded from Lake St Charles, but
                    the city has suffered so severely from devastating fires in the past that in
                    1883 the common council ordered an additional pipe to be laid at a cost of half
                    a million of dollars. Quebec is well lighted with gas and the electric light.
                    Connexion is had with all parts of Canada and the United States by several
                    railway lines, and the city is at the head of ocean steamship navigation to
                    Europe. There are two lines of street cars. The head offices of three banks are
                    situated in Quebec, viz., the Quebec Bank, the Union Bank of Lower Canada, and
                    La Banque Nationale. Besides these there are two savings banks, the Post Office
                    Savings Bank, and the agencies of the Bank of Montreal, the Bank of British
                    North America, and the Merchants’ Bank. The population of the city in 1871 was
                    59,699; in 1881, 62,446 (28,923 males and 33,523 females),—6200 being
                    Protestants.</p>
                <p>Shipbuilding was formerly one of the chief industries of Quebec, but of late
                    years very few wooden ships have been built. In 1883 the number was twenty-five,
                    representing a total tonnage of 4596 tons. Manufacturing is carried on to some
                    extent, the principal manufactures being iron castings, machinery, cutlery,
                    nails, leather, musical instruments, boots and shoes, paper, india-rubber goods,
                    ropes, tobacco, steel, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Quebec’s staple export is timber, the greater portion of the shipments reaching
                    town from the Ottawa and St Maurice districts. The rafts floating down the river
                    are collected in the coves, and fastened by booms are moored along the banks.
                    These coves extend along the river for upwards of 6 miles above the city. On the
                    right bank of the stream, not far from Quebec, are extensive sawmills. The port
                    is one of the leading emporiums of the export trade between Canada and Great
                    Britain. The number, tonnage, and crews of the vessels entered and cleared at
                    Quebec for several years is as follows :—</p>

                    and red pine—are exported from Quebec. The total value of exports in 1883 was

                <p>The city returns three members to the Canadian House of Commons, and three to the
                    provincial House of Assembly. It is governed by a mayor, eight alderffιen, and
                    sixteen councillors, who hold their offices for two years. Quebec is the seat of
                    the Roman Catholic archbishop, and the see of the bishop of the Church of
                    England.</p>
                <p>Quebec was first visited by the French navigator Jacques Cartier in 1535, when it
                    consisted of a sparsely-settled Indian village called Stadacona. In July 1608
                    the.city was founded by Champlain, who bestowed on it its present name. Its
                    growth was slow, and the numerous wars with the Indians and the English rendered
                    the work of colonization and settlement precarious and difficult. In 1629 the
                    English captured it, but three years later it was restored to the French. In
                    1663 the colony was created a royal government, and Quebec became the capital.
                    In 1690 Sir William Phips with a numerous fleet attempted to reconquer it, but
                    the French governor, Count de Frontenac, destroyed many of his vessels and
                    forced the English to fly. The French held possession until 1759, when it fell
                    into the hands of the British under Wolfe, and it was finally ceded to Britain
                    by the treaty of Paris in 1763. In 1775 General Montgomery with an American
                    force attacked the city, but he perished before its walls and his troops were
                    dispersed. Since then its capture has not been again attempted. (G. ST. )</p>
