                    than 35 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Concerning his family and his life but
                    few facts remain. His father taught rhetoric, with no great success, at Rome,
                    and Quintilian must have come there at an early age to reside, and must have
                    there grown up to manhood. The years from 61 to 68 he spent in Spain, probably
                    attached in some capacity to the retinue of the future emperor Galba, with whom
                    he returned to the capital. Quintilian must have brought back with him a
                    considerable reputation as a rhetorician. For at least twenty years after the
                    accession of Galba he was at the head of the foremost school of oratory in Rome,
                    and may fairly be called the Isocrates of his time. He also gained some but not
                    a great repute as a pleader in the courts. His greatest speech appears to have
                    been a defence of the queen Berenice, on what charge is not known. For a member
                    of a learned profession his circumstances were easy; but the question of
                    Juvenal, “How is it that Quintilian owns so many estates'?” ought perhaps not to
                    be accepted as evidence of great wealth. Vespasian created for him a
                    professorial chair of rhetoric, liberally endowed with public money, and from
                    this time he was unquestionably, as Martial calls him, “the supreme controller
                    of the restless youth.” About the year 88 Quintilian retired from teaching and
                    from pleading, to compose his great work on the training of the orator <hi
                    rend="italic">(Institutio Oratoria).</hi> After two years’ retirement he was
                    entrusted by Domitian with the education of two grand-nephews, whom he destined
                    as successors to his throne. Quintilian gained the titular rank of consul, and
                    probably died not long before the accession of Nerva (96 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.).</hi> A good many years earlier his wife had died at the age of nineteen,
                    leaving him two sons, one of whom died when seven years old, the other in his
                    eleventh year, while the father was engaged upon his great work.</p>
                <p>Such is the scanty record that remains of Quintilian’s uneventful life. But it is
                    possible to determine with some accuracy his relation to the literature and
                    culture of his time, which he powerfully influenced. His career brings home to
                    us the vast change which in a few generations had passed over Roman taste,
                    feeling, and society. In the days of Cicero rhetorical teaching had been
                    entirely in the hands of the Greeks. Even Cicero, when he wrote his rhetorical
                    works, was driven to plead that it could not be disgraceful to teach what it was
                    not disgraceful to learn. The Greek language, too, was in the main the vehicle
                    of instruction in rhetoric. The first attempt to open a Latin rhetorical school,
                    in 94 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was crushed by authority, and not until
                    the time of Augustus was there any professor of the art who had been born to the
                    full privileges of a Roman citizen. The appointment of Quintilian as professor
                    by the chief of the state marks the last stage in the emancipation of rhetorical
                    teaching from the old Roman prejudices.</p>
                <p>During the hundred years or more which elapsed between the death of Cicero and
                    the birth of Quintilian education all over the Roman empire had spread
                    enormously, and the education of the time found its end and climax in rhetoric.
                    Mental culture was for the most part acquired, not for its own sake, but as a
                    discipline to develop skill in speaking, the paramount qualification for a
                    public career. Rome, Italy, and the provinces alike resounded with rhetorical
                    exercitations, which were promoted on all sides by professorships, first of
                    Greek, later also of Latin rhetoric, endowed from municipal funds. The mock
                    contests of the future orators roused a vast amount of popular interest. In
                    Gaul, Spain, and Africa these pursuits were carried on with even greater energy
                    than at Rome. The seeds of the existing culture, such as it was, bore richer
                    fruit on the fresh soil of the Western provinces than in the exhausted lands of
                    Italy and the East. While Quintilian lived, men born in Spain dominated the
                    Latin schools and the Latin literature, and he died just too soon to see the
                    first provincial, also of Spanish origin, ascend the imperial throne.</p>
                <p>As an orator, a teacher, and an author, Quintilian set himself to stem the
                    current of popular taste which found its expression in what we are wont to call
                    silver Latin. In his youth the influence of the younger Seneca was dominant. But
                    the teacher of Quintilian was a man of another type, one whom he ventures to
                    class with the old orators of Rome. This was Domitius Afer, a rhetorician of
                    Nîmes, who rose to the consulship. Quintilian, however, owed more to the dead
                    than to the living. His great model was Cicero, of whom he speaks at all times
                    with unbounded eulogy, and whose faults he could scarce bring himself to
                    mention; nor could he well tolerate to hear them mentioned by others. The
                    reaction against the Ciceronian oratory which had begun in Cicero’s own lifetime
                    had acquired overwhelming strength after his death. Quintilian failed to check
                    it, as another teacher of rhetoric, equally an admirer of Cicero, had failed—the
                    historian Livy. Seneca the elder, a clear-sighted man who could see in Cicero
                    much to praise, and was not blind to the faults of his own age, condemned the
                    old style as lacking in power, while Tacitus, in his <hi rend="italic">Dialogue
                    on Orators,</hi> includes Cicero among the men of rude and “unkempt” antiquity.
                    The great movement for the poetization of Latin prose which was begun by Sallust
                    ran its course till it culminated in the monstrous style of Fronto. In the
                    courts judges, juries, and audiences alike demanded what was startling, quaint,
                    or epigrammatic, and the speakers practised a thousand tricks to satisfy the
                    demand. Oratory became above all things an art whose last thought was to conceal
                    itself. It is not surprising that Quintilian’s forensic efforts won for him no
                    great reputation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Institutio Oratoria</hi> is one long protest against the
                    tastes of the age. Starting with the maxim of Cato the Censor that the orator is
                    “the good man who is skilled in speaking,” Quintilian takes his future orator at
                    birth and shows how this goodness of character and skill in speaking may be best
                    produced. No detail of training in infancy, boyhood, or youth is too petty for
                    his attention. The parts of the work which relate to general education are of
                    great interest and importance. Quintilian postulates the widest culture; there
                    is no form of knowledge from which something may not be extracted for his
                    purpose; and he is fully alive to the importance of method in education. He
                    ridicules the fashion of the day, which hurried over preliminary cultivation,
                    and allowed men to grow grey while declaiming in the schools, where nature and
                    reality were forgotten. Yet he develops all the technicalities of rhetoric with
                    a fulness to which we find no parallel in ancient literature. Even in this
                    portion of the work the illustrations are so apposite and the style so dignified
                    and yet sweet that the modern reader, whose initial interest in rhetoric is of
                    necessity faint, is carried along with much <pb break="no"

                    parts of the rhetorical writings of Aristotle and Cicero. At all times the
                    student feels that he is in the company of a high-toned gentleman who, so far as
                    he could do so without ceasing to be a Roman, has taken up into his nature the
                    best results of ancient culture in all its forms. His literary sympathies are
                    extraordinarily wide. When obliged to condemn, as in the case of Seneca, he
                    bestows generous and even extravagant praise on such merit as he can find. He
                    can cordially admire even Sallust, the true fountain-head of the style which he
                    combats, while he will not suffer Lucilius to lie under the aspersions of
                    Horace. The passages in which Quintilian reviews the literature of Greece and
                    Rome are justly celebrated. The judgments which he passes may be in many
                    instances traditional, but, looking to all the circumstances of the time, it
                    seems remarkable that there should then have lived at Rome a single man who
                    could make them his own and give them expression. The form in which these
                    judgments are rendered is admirable. The gentle justness of the sentiments is
                    accompanied by a curious felicity of phrase. Who can forget “the immortal
                    swiftness of Sallust,” or “the milky richness of Livy,” or how “Horace soars now
                    and then, and is full of sλveetness and grace, and in his varied forms and
                    phrases is most fortunately bold”? Ancient literary criticism perhaps touched
                    its highest point in the hands of Quintilian.</p>
                <p>To comprehensive sympathy and clear intellectual vision Quintilian added refined
                    tenderness and freedom from self-assertion. Taking him all in all, we may say
                    that his personality must have been the most attractive of his time—more winning
                    and at the same time more lofty than that of the younger Pliny, his pupil, into
                    whom no small portion of the master’s spirit, and even some tincture of the
                    master’s literary taste, was instilled. It does not surprise us to hear that
                    Quintilian attributed any success he won as a pleader to his command of pathos,
                    a quality in which his great guide Cicero excelled. In spite of some
                    extravagances of phrase, Quintilian’s lament (in his sixth book) for his
                    girl-wife and his boy of great promise is the most pathetic of all the
                    lamentations for bereavement in which Latin literature is so rich. In his
                    precepts about early education Quintilian continually shows his shrinking from
                    cruelty and oppression. The educational method of “Orbilius, abounding in
                    blows,” has never been more earnestly rebuked.</p>
                <p>Quintilian for the most part avoids passing opinions on the problems of
                    philosophy, religion, and politics. The professed philosopher he disliked almost
                    as much as did Isocrates. He deemed that ethics formed the only valuable part of
                    philosophy and that ethical teaching ought to be in the hands of the
                    rhetoricians. In the divine government of the universe he seems to have had a
                    more than ornamental faith, though he doubted the immortality of the soul. As to
                    politics Quintilian, like others of his time, felt free to eulogize the great
                    anti-Caesarean leaders of the dying republic, but only because the assumption
                    was universal that the system they had championed was gone for ever. But
                    Quintilian did not trouble himself, as Statius did, to fling stones at the
                    emperors Caligula and Nero, who had missed their deification. He makes no
                    remark, laudatory or otherwise, on the government of any emperor before
                    Domitian. No character figured more largely in the rhetorical controversies of
                    the schools than the ideal despot, but no word ever betrayed a consciousness
                    that the actual occupant of the Palatine might exemplify the themes. Quintilian
                    has often been reproached with his flattery of Domitian. No doubt it was
                    fulsome. But it is confined to two or three passages, not thrust continually
                    upon the reader, as by Statius and Martial. To refuse the charge of Domitian’s
                    expected successors would have been perilous, and equally perilous would it have
                    been to omit from the <hi rend="italic">Institutio Oratoria</hi> all mention of
                    the emperor. And there was at the time only one dialect in which a man of
                    letters could speak who set any value on his personal safety. There was a choice
                    between extinction and the writing of a few sentences in the loathsome court
                    language, which might serve as an official test of loyalty. So Quintilian, man
                    of honour though he was, swallowed the test as best he might, even as two
                    generations ago in England unbelievers took the sacrament to avoid exclusion
                    from municipal affairs.</p>
                <p>The Latin of-Quintilian is not always free from the faults of style which he
                    condemns in others. It also exhibits many of the usages and constructions which
                    are characteristic of the silver Latin. But no writer of the decadence departs
                    less widely from the best models of the late republican period. The language is
                    on the whole clear and simple, and varied without resort to rhetorical devices
                    and poetical conceits. Besides the <hi rend="italic">Institutio Oratoria,</hi>
                    there have come down to us under Quintilian’s name 19 longer and 145 shorter <hi
                    rend="italic">Declamationes,</hi> or school exercitations on themes like those
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Controversies</hi> of Seneca. The longer pieces are
                    certainly not Quintilian’s. The shorter were probably published, if not by
                    himself, at least from notes taken at his lessons. It is strange that they could
                    ever have been supposed to belong to a later century; the style proclaims them
                    to be of Quintilian’s school and time. The works of Quintilian have often been
                    edited. Of the editions of the whole works the chief is that by Burmann (1720);
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Institutio Oratoria</hi> that by Spalding, completed by
                    Zumpt and Bonnell (1798-1834, the last volume containing a lexicon), and that by
                    Halm (1868). The tenth book of the <hi rend="italic">Institutio Oratoria</hi>
                    has often been separately edited, as by Krueger, Bonnell, Mayor (unfinished),
                    and others. There is a critical edition of the 145 <hi rend="italic"
                    >Declamationes</hi> by C. Ritter (1885). (J. S. R.)</p>
