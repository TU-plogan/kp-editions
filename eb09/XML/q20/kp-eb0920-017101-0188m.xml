                <p><label type="entry">QUEENSLAND</label>, a British colony, the north-eastern
                    portion of Australia, is situated between New South Wales and Torres Strait, and
                    between the Pacific Ocean and the Northern Territory of South Australia. Its
                    southern boundary is about 29° S. lat.; its western is 141° E. long, from 29° to
                    26° S. lat., and 138° E. thence to the Gulf of Carpentaria; its northern is
                    about 9° S. including the Torres Straits islands. In extreme length it is 1400
                    miles; in breadth, 1000. Its area is 669,520 square miles, or about 5∣ times
                    that of the United Kingdom. The population is under 300,000.</p>
                <p>With a seaboard of over 2500 miles, it is well favoured with ports on the Pacific
                    side. Moreton Bay receives the Brisbane river, on whose banks Brisbane, the
                    capital, stands. Maryborough port is on the Mary, which flows into Wide Bay;
                    Bundaberg, on the Burnett; Gladstone, on Port Curtis; Rockhampton, up the
                    Fitzroy (Keppel Bay); Mackay, on the Pioneer; Bowen, on Port Denison;
                    Townsville, on Cleveland Bay. Cairns and Port Douglas are near Trinity Bay;
                    Cardwell is on Rockingham Bay; Cooktown, on the Endeavour; Thursday Island port,
                    near Cape York; and Normanton, near the Gulf of Carpentaria. The new gulf port
                    is at Point Parker. The quiet Inner Passage, between the shore and the Great
                    Barrier Reef, 1200 miles long, favours the north-eastern Queensland ports.
                    Ipswich, Toowoomba, Oxley, Been-leigh, Maryborough, and Mackay are farming
                    centres; Warwick, Roma, Clermont, Blackall, Aramac, Hughenden, and Mitchell are
                    pastoral ones. Gympie, Charters Towers, Ravenswood, and Palmerville are
                    gold-mining towns; while Stanthorpe and Herberton have tin mines. Townships are
                    laid out by Government as occasion requires. There are fifteen large districts,
                    viz., Moreton, Darling Downs, Wide Bay, Burnett, Maranoa, Warrego, and South
                    Gregory, southward; Port Curtis, Leichhardt, South Kennedy, Mitchell, and North
                    Gregory, central; North Kennedy, Burke, and Cook, northward. Cape York Peninsula
                    is the northern limit. A few persons were sent to the Brisbane in 1826; but the
                    Moreton Bay district of New South Wales was thrown open to colonization in 1842.
                    It was named “Queensland” on its separation from the mother colony in 1859. A
                    natural but unfounded prejudice against its supposed warmer position retarded
                    its progress, or confined its few inhabitants to pastoral pursuits. The
                    discovery of abundant -wealth in minerals and sugar-lands, with the growing
                    conviction of its singular salubrity, greatly advanced the immigration prospects
                    of the colony. A broad plateau, of from 2000 to 5000 feet in height, extends
                    from north to south, at from 20 to 100 miles from the coast, forming the Main
                    Range. This region is the seat of mining, and will be of agriculture. The Coast
                    Range is less elevated. A plateau goes westward from the Great Dividing Range,
                    throwing most of its waters northward to the gulf. The Main Range sends numerous
                    but short streams to the Pacific, and a few long ones south-westward, lost in
                    earth or shallow lakes, unless feeding the river Darling. Going northward, the
                    leading rivers, in order, are the Logan, Brisbane, Mary, Burnett, Fitzroy,
                    Burdekin, Herbert, Johnstone, and Endeavour. The Fitzroy receives the Mackenzie
                    and Dawson; the Burdekin is supplied by the Cape, Belyando, and Suttor. The
                    chief gulf streams are the Mitchell, Flinders, Leichhardt, and Albert. The great
                    dry western plains have the Barcoo, Diamantina, Georgina, Warrego, Maranoa, and
                    Condamine. There are few lakes. A succession of elevated and nearly treeless
                    downs of remarkable fertility contrasts with the heavily timbered country
                    favoured by the rains. Cape York Peninsula is an epitome of Queensland. There is
                    good land alternating with bad. The hills are rich in gold, silver, copper, tin,
                    and coal. The forests are valuable, and the scrub is dense. Flats near the
                    mouths of the many streams are admirable for sugar-cane and rice, while rising
                    slopes suit coffee trees. West of the range dividing the gulf waters from the
                    Pacific is a sandy grassless region where the only vegetation is a poisonous
                    pea. Suddenly the traveller passes from this desert to the glorious downs around
                    Hughenden, a garden-land beside the Flinders. Farther north-west is the charming
                    Leichhardt river district, and the marvellous mineral Cloncurry highland.
                    Southward of that again is the country of the Diamantina and <pb break="no"

                    tracts of good black soil threaded by slight ridges of barren sandstone.
                    Droughts are there followed by floods from thunder showers. The south-western
                    portion is inferior to all, having heavy sand-rises between the grassy belts.
                    Still the pastoral settlers are taking up areas there. AU that dry warm west is
                    remarkably healthy for man and beast. The productive and better-watered part
                    between the Main Range and the Pacific has the principal population.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The coast-lands, with an annual rainfall of from
                    40 to 130 inches, are favoured by the south-east trade-winds and the summer
                    north-west monsoons. During 1882 there fell at Johnstone river, 17° S., nearly
                    160 inches on one hundred and ninety-seven days. Northern Queensland, up to the
                    ranges, is well watered. Central and southern districts are not so aided by the
                    monsoons. The highlands have on their eastern side from 30 to 70 inches, but on
                    their western only from 15 to 30. The gulf region has from 30 to 60. The
                    southern hills have far less rain than the northern ones. The arid western area
                    depends on occasional thunderstorms, though nature provides a grass that long
                    resists the drought. The low south-west basin, trending to the depressed lake
                    region of South Australia, has repeatedly seasons of intense dryness. In
                    temperature, Brisbane has a mean of 69° —between 34° and 105°. The hilly
                    districts, even in the tropics, have slight frosts in winter, but a high
                    barometer in the dry warm weather. North Queensland has less heat than its
                    latitude would seem to threaten. Tropical ports show a lower summer thermometer
                    than may sometimes be seen in Sydney, Adelaide, and Melbourne. The western heat
                    is stimulating in its dryness and electrical condition. The oppression on the
                    northern coast is felt during the rainy season, though the showers cool the air.
                    The prevalence of south-east winds off the sea mitigates the trials of summer.
                    The dreaded “hot wind,” brought southward by the usual course from central
                    Australian deserts, descends upon the southern colonies, avoiding Queensland.
                    Still the ordinary western breeze, passing over so great an expanse of land,
                    while positively cold on winter nights, is sufficiently hot during the
                    summer.</p>
                <p>In a recent year the colonial registrar-general gave the death-rate of Brisbane
                    municipality at 13 in the thousand, Toowoomba 17, and Rockhampton 15. In the
                    tropics it was 12 at Charters Towers and Cooktown, 15 at Townsville, but 29 at
                    Mackay, where the sickly Polynesians abound. The prevalent diseases are rather
                    from disordered liver and bowels than lungs and throat. Low fevers, seldom
                    fatal, continue for a time in all newly opened-up country throughout Australia,
                    as in America. Female mortality, even in the tropical ports, is considerably
                    less than that of males. Infants, as a rule, thrive better in the colony,
                    according to numbers, than in England. Cooktown, in lat. 16° S., is regarded by
                    some as the sanatorium of the future. Queensland can give invalids any climate
                    they may desire—moist and equable, dry and exhilarating, warm days and cool
                    nights, soft coast airs for bronchial affections, and more bracing ones for
                    other consumptives.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> Queensland is geologically connected with New
                    South Wales and Victoria by the great chain of hills continued through the
                    eastern portion of Australia, from Cape York to Bass’s Strait. That immense
                    range consists largely of Palaeozoic formations with igneous rocks. The
                    granites, porphyries, and basalts have greatly tilted and metamorphosed the
                    sedimentary deposits of Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Oolitic ages. The
                    width of this elevated and mineral part of the colony varies from 50 to 400
                    miles. Ancient formations, however, rise in the broad western plains, and
                    everywhere indicate metallic treasures. Nearer the eastern coast granite and
                    porphyritic rocks appear in greater force than in the Dividing Range, and the
                    voyager rarely loses sight of them all the way from Moreton Bay to Cape York.
                    They add much to the attractiveness of the scenery, especially in Whitsunday
                    Passage. The old sedimentary strata consist of sandstones, limestones,
                    conglomerates, and slates of various kinds. The Carboniferous beds are of great
                    extent, occupying thousands of square miles (perhaps as many as 100,000), on the
                    highlands, and on both sides of the Main Chain. It is in north and central
                    Queensland that the mineral is found of the true Palaeozoic character, bearing
                    the distinctive floral features of the English and New South Wales Newcastle
                    formation. The Jurassic and Liassic rocks of the southern hilly districts are
                    rich in cannel coal. The Wollumbilla beds are similar to the Upper Wiannamatta
                    ones of New South Wales. The Mesozoic or Secondary formations prevail largely to
                    the westward. Ammonites, belemnites, and ichthyosauri declare the same condition
                    of things as once existed in the English midlands. The Cretaceous and Oolitic
                    series on the western plains occupy nearly a third of Queensland, and their
                    grassy surface is being rapidly covered with flocks of sheep. A descent below
                    thé ocean level produced the Tertiary beds. The so-called “desert sandstone” may
                    have once covered nearly the whole of the colony, though suffering great
                    denudation afterwards, to the decided satisfaction of settlers. It still
                    stretches over much of the extensive plateau and both slopes. In some places it
                    is hundreds of feet thick. The favourite Downs have got free from this arid
                    incubus. Tertiary freshwater beds, not marine ones, are seen towards the coast.
                    The volcanic element is very distinguishable, and is a source of the large area
                    of fertile soil. Throughout the ranges, and over many of the downs, basalts and
                    lavas abound. Though no eruptive cone appears, there are hundreds of
                    well-defined extinct craters, some being 4000 feet above sea-level, surrounded
                    by sheets of lava and masses of volcanic ashes. The Great Barrier Reef,
                    following the line of the north-east coast for 1200 miles, preserves the memory
                    of an ancient shore; the coral animalculae built on the gradually sinking
                    cliffs. The reefs approach the coast-line within five miles northward and one
                    hundred southward, having an area of 30,000 square miles, and protecting eastern
                    Queensland from the violence of Pacific storms. A narrow deep trough in the
                    sea-bottom extends from Moreton Bay to Fiji. Within 100 miles of Cape Moreton
                    the water is 16,000 feet in depth. While the alluvial gold and tin-workings are
                    among the Tertiary and post-Tertiary formations, the veins and lodes of gold,
                    silver, copper, tin, and other metals are in the solid granite, or in the
                    ancient sedimentary rocks, particularly in association with dioritic and other
                    igneous intrusions. Greenstone has there some of the richest of copper lodes.
                    The celebrated tin mines of Tinaroo are in granite mountains 3000 feet high,
                    where Englishmen work without discomfort within the tropics. Some of the
                    tropical coal-fields are also at a considerable elevation, though nowhere arc
                    they situated in an insalubrious locality. The more southern coal seams are in
                    districts as healthful as they are beautiful. The Queensland fossils greatly
                    resemble those of other parts of the world. Those, however, of the more recent
                    Tertiary times indicate the presence of animals akin to existing marsupials,
                    though some of the kangaroo order stood a dozen feet in height, and had the bulk
                    of a hippopotamus. The diprotodon, 16 feet in length, may have pulled down
                    branches or young trees for its support. The rise of land would have diminished
                    water-supply in the interior, and caused the gradual disappearance of the
                    gigantic marsu- <pb break="no"

                    emu, once strode over Queensland plains. An ichthyosaurus, computed nearly
                    thirty feet in length, was found on the surface of the Flinders river downs. The
                    Secondary fossils have less resemblance than those of Western Australia to the
                    European species. Near the Condamine a fossil monitor twenty feet long was
                    unearthed. The northern coal-fields display the <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> Gold is found in alluvial deposits and in
                    quartz veins. The most important of the former were near the northern Palmer
                    river, but auriferous quartz now almost monopolizes the digger’s attention. The
                    recognized gold workings are over 7000 square miles. While there were 3454
                    Europeans, early in 1883, engaged in quartz mining, only 280 were on alluvial
                    ground; in the same year 2046 Chinese worked alluvial claims. Charters Towers in
                    the north and Gympie in the south are the chief gold centres; but Mount Morgan,
                    south of Rockhampton, is the richest mine yet discovered. The gold export
                    realized £1,498,433 in 1875, but only £829,655 in 1882. The decrease is owing to
                    the greater dependence of the miners on blasting rock.<note anchored="true"

                    mine of Charters Towers may be cited. Some Germans long struggled in vain, and
                    with difficulty got enough gold to supply them with food. Suddenly they struck a
                    rich reef. After considerable gains they formed a company to work the ground.
                    Upon a paid-up capital of £12,000, the shareholders’ dividends in four years
                    came to £138,399. Gympie affords even more remarkable instances of good
                    fortune.</p></note></p>
                <p>Gold is often found mixed with silver, copper, or lead. One lode had to the ton
                    75 to 120 ounces of silver and from ⅜ oz. to 4⅜ oz. of gold. Silver ore is being
                    worked to great advantage now near Ravenswood, Star river, and Sellheim river.
                    Copper has been long so low-priced in England that its extraction in the colony,
                    with high-rated labour, has been seriously checked. The cupriferous area is very
                    large there. Mount Perry, Peak Downs, Herberton, and Cloncurry are the leading
                    copper sites. The “Australian” mine of Cloncurry, 200 miles south of the gulf,
                    is very rich. In one place a lode, 80 to 120 feet wide, showed 30 per cent, of
                    bismuth and 40 of copper to the ton. Tin streams were first opened at
                    Stanthorpe, near the southern border. Tin lodes of astonishing richness exist in
                    the Wild river district about 19° S. lat. There are single claims of tin stream,
                    or on tin lodes, besides tin land leases, at Tate river, Wild river, and other
                    localities. The Tinaroo yield in the five years has been £383,350. Called the
                    Cornwall of Australia, this tin district shows gold, silver, copper, and
                    antimony. The tin export of the colony during 1883 was £298,845. Iron ores
                    abound, but with no present prospect of being utilized. Bismuth, graphite,
                    antimony, nickel, cinnabar, and other metals are known. Precious stones are
                    gathered from gold and tin workings. Building stones are plentiful in variety,
                    and good in quality. Granite, porphyry, basalt, sandstone, and marbles are
                    wrought. The coal is, after all, the most important and useful of the minerals.
                    Already steamers, foundries, and railways are being supplied from Queensland
                    pits. Several beds are known near Moreton Bay. About Ipswich and Darling Downs
                    the coal is clean to the touch. Some specimens cake, others do not. All are good
                    for gas and steam purposes. The Darling Downs beds are in an ancient lake, and
                    are valuable for fuel and oil. On 100 lb of that coal being burnt, 529 lb of
                    water were evaporated to 505 from Newcastle coal, leaving 16 lb of ash to 7 for
                    the other. That cannel is of Lias age. Much rests under the Eolian sandstone and
                    basalt of the west. The Burrurn mineral, between Maryborough and Bundaberg, is
                    true coal, yielding, at the first opening, 3000 tons a month. One seam would
                    give 5,000,000 tons. The Dawson, Bowen, and Mackenzie river basins, of vast
                    extent, are Palaeozoic, as in the Drummond range, and westward over the main
                    chain. Coal is found in the York peninsula. On the coal of Queensland the
                    distinguished Australian geologist, the Rev. J. Tenison Woods, expresses himself
                    thus :—“The fact that the coal formations cover so vast an extent of the
                    territory, and so many valuable coal-fields having been discovered, makes me
                    confident in predicting that its resources in coal are enormous, are equal, if
                    not superior, to any other colony, and will raise her shores to be in the end
                    the grand coal emporium of the southern hemisphere.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> Until the fast few years little cultivation
                    was to be seen, and only 180,000 acres yet receive such attention. Labour was
                    supposed to pay better in other employments. Still there can be grown in
                    Queensland corn of all varieties, hay, English vege tables, sweet potatoes,
                    melons, cassava, cocoa, indigo, arrowroot, ginger, colfee, rice, tobacco,
                    cotton, spices, cinchona, cocoa-nut, bread-fruit, and sugar-cane, with the
                    fruits of England, India, and China. Lucerne is much grown for stud stock, where
                    winter food is needed. Bananas, oranges, grapes, pine-apples, mangoes, guavas,
                    tamarinds, and dates thrive well. Coffee is being extensively produced. Many
                    Ceylon planters have recently settled in the colony. Cotton pods, tended mostly
                    in Moreton district, are now a paying crop. The mulberry success is paving the
                    way for silk culture. The Roma grapes and oranges are much esteemed. Bananas
                    grow on any coast-lauds. Arrowroot and tobacco are profitable. Sweet potatoes
                    are extensively used. Rice will be a crop of the future. Farmers in the southern
                    hills raise corn and English fruits. Dairy farming belongs more to a cooler
                    latitude. Wheat can be successfully produced, when labour is cheaper, over an
                    area of 60,000 square miles. Stanthorpe wheat gave 67 lb to the bushel. Maize is
                    a more certain crop. But sugar-cane is now the Queensland farmer’s chief
                    resource. From the southern border up to Cape York, if near the coast, it can be
                    raised. All round Moreton Bay, and in the Maryborough and Bundaberg
                    neighbourhood, it does well; but in the more northern parts, as at the Mackay,
                    Cairns, Burdekin, Johnstone, and Herbert fields, the yield is greater, and the
                    plant comes earlier to maturity. In the Mackay sugar district, dûring 1884,
                    there were 22,000 acres in cane. Coast Queensland has not only warmth, and rich
                    alluvial or scrub soil, but abundance of rain when growth requires it, with fine
                    weather at cane ripening for manufacturing sugar. Some planters have their own
                    appliances for the extraction of juice and the manufacture of sugar, but the
                    small farmers combine to have machinery in their district, or else dispose of
                    cane or juice for cash to the neighbouring sugar-maker. Polynesians or Kanakas
                    have been used for the sugar-house, though Europeans do all the work of growth
                    and manufacture in South Queensland. Chinese merchants are establishing cane
                    grounds, worked by their own countrymen; and Germans and Scandinavians have
                    extensively embarked in this industry.</p>
                <p>Pastoral farming is still the leading industry of the colony, and is rapidly
                    extending overall districts. An occasional check to its prosperity comes by
                    drought in the dry western interior. But a few good seasons, in that healthy
                    wilderness, enable the sheepmaster to recoup himself,—especially as, in the
                    remoter parts, he has a securer tenure and a very small rental. In “settled
                    districts,” and within 30 miles of the coast, a “run” is subject to resumption
                    by the state, at six months’ notice, should any part be required to be cut up
                    for farms. In the more distant “unsettled district” a lease of twenty-one years
                    is fairly secure. The rent advances every seven years of the term from about
                    half a farthing to a penny an acre. In the dry parts, where grass is
                    insufficient, cattle and sheep thrive well on the salt bush and other shrubs.
                    The only really unavailable pastoral region is that portion of the north-western
                    slope of the Main Range already referred to. The spear-grass sometimes sends its
                    barbed tufts into the flesh of sheep. Wild dogs, floods, and droughts have to be
                    encountered, though the animals to be tended are unaffected by ailments plaguing
                    flocks and herds in Britain. The western plains, dry but fertile, are best for
                    sheep; the hillsand moist coast-lands for cattle and horses. The merino sheep
                    yields excellent wool on tropical pastures, contrary to former expectations. The
                    sheep had increased from 3,000,000 to 12,000,000 between 1860 and 1883; and
                    cattle, from 430,000 to 4,320,000. To meet future droughts, subterranean streams
                    have been found by artesian wells in the most arid wastes, and the storage of
                    water after floods will furnish a supply in dry weather.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flora.—</hi> The Queensland flora comprehends most of the forms
                    peculiar to Australia, with the addition of about five hundred species belonging
                    to the Indian and Malayan regions. The eastern portion of New Holland may have a
                    vegetation of a somewhat different type from that of the western, but both have
                    older representatives than those found in the central zone from the gulf to the
                    Southern Ocean. The palms in the north-east of Queensland include the <hi

                    rivers. Coast-lands are crowded with trees, though brigalow-scrub, with the
                    silver-leaved tops, prevails far inland. There are trees rising above 300 feet.
                    One monster, near the Johnstone river, was seen 88 feet in girth at 55 feet from
                    the ground, and 150 at the base. The Moreton Bay fig-tree has immense wall-like
                    abutments. The bottle or gouty stem tree of the north, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dclabcchia Gregori,</hi> is allied to the African baobab. Flowers are numerous,
                    yielding often a powerful fragrance, though most commonly exhibited on shrubs.
                    Queensland is notably a timber region, having both hard and soft woods. Above
                    three hundred useful woods, many taking a fine polish, were sent to a recent
                    exhibition. An active export of some, particularly cedar and pine, is conducted
                    at Maryborough aud Port Curtis. Woods there are in use for building purposes,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna.—</hi> The Queensland fauna is much like that described
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">New South Wales.</hi> But forms are now living there
                    whose allies are elsewhere recognized as Tertiary Fossils. The marsupials
                    constitute a prominent family. The platypus or water mole is duck-billed and
                    web-footed. The dingo is a howling, nocturnal dog. Queensland birds are very
                    beautiful. One is something like the New Guinea bird of paradise. Other species
                    of the feathered order are kindred to some in the Asiatic islands. Bower birds
                    have a satin plumage, and indulge in play-bowers, adorned with shells and
                    stones. The regent bird and rifle bird are peculiarly attractive in colours.
                    Mound builders lay their eggs in sand heaps. The wild turkey and other game may
                    be easily obtained. North Queensland has a fine cassowary. Reptiles consist of
                    alligators, lizards, and snakes; few of the last, particularly of larger
                    species, are hurtful to man.</p>

                    North Australian seas. Deep-sea fishing is unknown in Queensland. About the
                    coasts are the usual edible Australian forms, as whiting, rock cod, bream,
                    flathead, Schnapper, guardfish, Ac. Sharks and alligators are there. The
                    shell-grinder, <hi rend="italic">C</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">estracion,</hi> is
                    similar to a shark found as fossil in Europe. Sword fish grow to a great size.
                    Some Queensland fish resemble varieties in Indian seas. The Chinese are the best
                    fishermen in Australian waters. The huge dugong, or sea cow, feeding on bay
                    grasses, has a delicate flesh, of the flavour of veal, and furnishes an oil with
                    the qualities of codliver oil. The fishery of the trepang, bêche-de-mer, or sea
                    slug employs a considerable number of boats about the coral reefs.</p>
                <p>Boiled, smoke-dried, and packed in bags, the trepang sells for exportation to
                    China, though its agreeable and most nourishing soup is relished by Australian
                    invalids. At Cooktown and Port Douglas more than £100 per ton may be had for the
                    produce. The pearl fishery is a prosperous and progressive one in or near Torres
                    Straits. A licence is paid, and the traffic is under Government supervision.
                    Thursday Island is the chief seat of this industry. The shells are procured by
                    diving, and fetch from £120 to £200 a ton. Mother-of-pearl and tortoiseshell
                    constitute important exports of the colony, capable of great expansion. Oysters
                    are as fine flavoured as they are abundant. Turtles are caught to the
                    northward.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> So extensive a coast-line, and so much of that
                    protected by the Barrier Reef, cannot but be favourable to commerce. The Torres
                    Strait mail service has opened up increased opportunities for trade with China,
                    India, Java, Ac. Contiguity to New Caledonia and the Pacific Isles will conduce
                    to mercantile relations. There are several lines of coasting steamers. The great
                    development of the mining, pastoral, and sugar industries, the rapid growth of
                    railways, an easy tariff, and the settlements of York Peninsula are giving a
                    great impetus to commerce. The exports for 1882 were £3,534,452; of which wool
                    brought £1,329,019; gold £829,655; tin £269,904; stock £280,466; sugar £153,188;
                    tallow £129,549; preserved meats £119,343; pearls £105,869; hides £88,359;
                    bêche-de-mer £25,032. The imports for that year were £6,318,463. Among these
                    imports some items may be cited: —for manufactured cotton, silk, and woollen
                    goods £839,352, unmanufactured £194,489; for metal goods and hardware £910,029;
                    flour and grain, £453,307; oilman’s stores, £376,987; spirits, wines, and beer,
                    £320,925; books and stationery, £113,798; tea, £109,286. Few of these articles
                    are yet re-exported. The exports for 1883 advanced to £4,652,880, to which wool
                    contributed £2,277,878, and sugar £538,785. The shipping exceeds 1,500,000 tons.
                    Dock conveniences, ships, and colonial-made steam dredgers exercise the state
                    care. The development of coal mines is aiding both shipping and railway
                    extension. With the establishment of British rule in New Guinea, a serious
                    danger to Queensland interests will be averted, and a happy opportunity offered
                    for the enlargement of its commerce.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> The colony is too young, its population too
                    scattered, its resources in raw material too extensive, for any great advance at
                    present in the industrial stage. Yet already large foundries are established, in
                    which agricultural instruments, mining machinery, sugar appliances, steam
                    engines, and locomotives are constructed. Tanneries, breweries, sugar-mills,
                    distilleries, tobaccofactories, cotton-ginning, woollen factories, wine-making,
                    meatpreserving, boot-factories, Ac., are being carried on. The sawmills near
                    Maryborough are, perhaps, equal to anything in the southern hemisphere, relays
                    of men working at night by electric light.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roads and Railways.—</hi> Nearly ninety divisional boards,
                    throughout the colony, raise means by rates for highway improvements, Government
                    supplementing their revenue, as in the case of municipalities, by special grants
                    in aid. Coaches travel inland 700 miles from the capital. At the end of 1884,
                    besides several hundreds of miles of railway in process of construction, the
                    lines opened to traffic were 1201 miles. The western line is from Brisbane, over
                    Darling Downs, through Roma. The south-west will be reached by Cun-namnulla.
                    From Rockhampton westward the railway has gone 350 miles on towards the downs of
                    the Barcoo. The line from Townsville, parallel to the last, after passing
                    Charters Towers, will go on to Hughenden and the Flinders river region. The
                    three great lines will be hereafter connected, and the Cloncurry and gulf
                    country united with the western ports. Maryborough is thus connected with Gympie
                    and Burrum, Bundaberg with Mount Perry, Brisbane with Warwick, and Brisbane with
                    several suburbs. The heavy loans of the colony are mainly devoted to the
                    construction of railways.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The governor is appointed by the Queen.
                    The executive council has 8 members, the legislative council 33, and the
                    assembly 55. The term of parliament is five years. There were in January 1884 42
                    electorates, 18 municipalities, 4 boroughs, 85 divisional boards, 49 police
                    districts. Excepting very occasional difficulties with blacks in remote and
                    scrubby districts, order is thoroughly observed. Numerous religious and
                    temperance organizations are of assistance in securing respect for law. Among
                    official departments are those of the colonial secretary, treasurer,
                    auditor-general, public works and mines, public lands, customs, administration
                    of justice, post office, police, immigration, and medical board.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Revenue.—</hi> Of a revenue of £2,102,095 in 1881-2, £806,719
                    came from taxation. For the year ending June 30, 1884, the total was £2,566,358.
                    Of this, the customs gave £866,475; excise, £34,441; land sales, £365,536;
                    pastoral rents, £246,103; railways, £581,642; post and telegraph, £155,996. The
                    expenditure was £2,317,674. In the settled districts, during 1883, 304 runs had
                    an area of 11,162 square mile?, at a rental of £21,419. In the unsettled
                    districts 8939 runs had 475,601 square miles, paying £216,638, averaging less
                    than a farthing an acre. Expired and renewed leases realize in- <pb break="no"

                <p>creasing rates. The absolute public debt in 1884 was £16,570,850. Of that amount
                    the outlay on railways was about 12 millions; immigration, 2; harbours, 1∣.
                    Roads and telegraph lines took other sums.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> Queensland led the way among the Australian
                    colonies, in the establishment of a system of public instruction free,
                    unsectarian, and compulsory. At the same time, however, the parliament declined
                    to grant further state aid to the clergy and religious edifices of Protestant
                    Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Wesleyans, and Roman Catholics, formerly drawing
                    from the treasury. State or provisional schools are formed wherever there is a
                    sufficient gathering of children. The annual public cost was £2, 17s. peι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> scholar. There are, however, self-supporting private
                    schools. Masters and mistresses of state schools are paid by the Government
                    according to their own educational status, the number of children, and the
                    proficiency of instruction. Excellent training schools for teachers are
                    established. Five superior grammar schools are partly supported by the state;
                    the municipal councils have voluntarily akled those institutions, and offered
                    scholarships to their pupils. The Government gives free education in grammar·
                    schools to successful scholars in state schools, besides three years’
                    exhibitions to universities to a certain number passing a high examination.
                    State aid is also rendered to schools of art, schools of design, free libraries,
                    and technical schools.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The estimated population in January 1884 was
                    290,000, of whom three-fifths were males. Polynesian labourers, imported for
                    three years, are about 8000. The Chinese, now restricted by a heavy poll tax,
                    may be 18,000. The Aborigines, very fast dying out, mainly by contact with
                    civilization, may be from 10,000 to 12,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The Portuguese may have known the northern shore
                    nearly a century before Torres, in 1605, sailed through the strait since called
                    after him, or before the Dutch landed in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Captain Cook
                    passed along the eastern coast in 1770, taking possession of the country as New
                    South Wales. Flinders visited Moreton Bay in 1802. Oxley was on the Brisbane in
                    1823, and Allan Cunningham on Darling Downs in 1827. Sir T. L. Mitchell in
                    1846-7 made known the Maranoa, Warrego, and Barcoo districts. Leichhardt in
                    1845-47 traversed the coast country, going round the gulf to Port Essington, but
                    was lost in his third great journey. Kennedy followed down the Barcoo, but was
                    killed by the blacks while exploring York Peninsula. Burke and "Wills crossed
                    western Queensland in 1860. Landesborough, Walker, M <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> Kinlay, Hann, Jack, Hodgkinson, and Favence continued the researches.
                    Squatters and miners have opened new regions. Before its separation in 1859 the
                    country was known as the Moreton Bay district of New South Wales. A desire to
                    form fresh penal dépôts led to the discovery of Brisbane river in December 1823,
                    and the proclamation of a penal settlement there in August 1826. The convict
                    population was gradually withdrawn again to Sydney, and the place was declared
                    open to free persons only in 1842. The first land sale in Brisbane was on August
                    9, 1843. An attempt was made in 1846, under the ministry of Sir James Graham and
                    Mr Gladstone, to establish at Gladstone on Port Curtis the colony of North
                    Australia for ticket-of-leave men from Britain and Van Diemen’s Land. Earl
                    Grey’s Government under strong colonial appeals arrested this policy, and broke
                    up the convict settlement. In 1841 there were 176 males and 24 females; in 1844,
                    540 in all; in 1846, 1867. In 1834 the governor and the English rulers thought
                    it necessary to abandon Moreton Bay altogether, but the order was withheld. The
                    first stock belonged wholly to the colonial Government, but flocks and herds of
                    settlers came on the Darling Downs in 1841. In 1844 there were 17 squatting
                    stations round Moreton Bay and 26 in Darling Downs, having 13,295 cattle and
                    184,651 sheep. In 1849 there were 2812 horses, 72,096 cattle, and 1,077,983
                    sheep. But there were few persons in Brisbane and Ipswich. The Rev. Dr Lang then
                    begin his agitation in England on behalf of this northern district. Some
                    settlers, who sought a separation from New South Wales, offered to accept
                    British convicts if the ministry granted independence. In answer to their
                    memorial a shipload of ticket-of-leave men was sent in 1850. In spite of the
                    objection of Sydney, the Moreton Bay district was proclaimed the colony of
                    Queensland on December 10, 1859. The population was then about 20,000, and the
                    revenue £6475. Little trade, no manufactures, wretched roads, defective
                    wharfage, struggling townships, and poor schools marked that epoch. Political
                    liberty occasioned a general advance. The first parliament, with the ministry of
                    Mr (now Sir R. G. W.) Herbert, organized a good school system, carried an
                    effective land, bill, and established real religious equality. While the
                    pastoral interest rapidly grew, the agricultural and trading classes got firm
                    footing. The revelation of gold and copper treasures increased the prosperity.
                    But a reaction followed; wool prices fell, cotton-growing ceased, early
                    sugar-cane efforts failed, and trouble succeeded excessive speculation in land
                    and mines. A steady application to legitimate pursuits, however, soon restored
                    confidence; and the colony, as its resources have gradually developed, has
                    continued to advance and prosper. (J. BO.)</p>
