                    (1744-1775), born in Boston, Mass., 1744, is the most eminent of a well-known
                    family whose founder emigrated to New England in 1633. At the time of his death,
                    at the age of thirty-one, he had won distinction as a lawyer, and his place was
                    secured in history as among the most eloquent, the most clear-sighted, and the
                    most devoted of the men who led the American colonists in the measures
                    preliminary to the revolution In 1767 he entered upon the public discussion of
                    political questions, maintaining with great ability and courage the <pb

                <p>duty of his countrymen to resist any encroachments upon their right to
                    self-government. In 1770 he wrote <hi rend="italic">An Address of the Merchants,
                    Traders, and Freeholders of Boston</hi> in favour of a non importation Act,
                    asserting, about the same time, in a newspaper article that Americans would
                    “know, resume, assert, and defend their rights” by the “arts of war” if “the
                    arts of policy” should fail. In December 1773 he took an active and leading part
                    in the town-meeting which virtually ordered the destruction of the cargoes of
                    the tea-ships in Boston harbour. The appeal to the other towns for help to
                    sustain Boston against the enforcement of the consequent Acts of Parliament was
                    written by him; and soon after there appeared under his own name <hi

                    paper, which made him a marked man both in England and America. He sailed a few
                    months afterwards for England with the approval of the leading revolutionists,
                    to present, though unofficially, to the ministry and other public men the
                    grievances and the determination of the colonists. After six months failing
                    health—he had long been threatened with consumption—compelled him to return
                    home, and he died on shipboard as the vessel was entering the harbour of
                    Gloucester, Massachusetts, April 26, 1775.</p>
                <p>A memoir written by his only son, <hi rend="smallcaps">Josiah Quincy</hi>
                    (1772-1864), containing his life, correspondence, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations on the Boston Port Bill,</hi> was published in 1825 (2d ed. 1874).
                    This only son of Josiah Quincy, jun., born in Boston in February 1772, lived to
                    be three times the age of his father, and filled public stations for more years
                    than his father lived; he was a member of Congress during the eventful period
                    from 1805 to 1813; as the second mayor of Boston his sagacity and energy insured
                    the future prosperity of that city; in Congress he maintained at the head of the
                    Federal party the struggle with the disastrous foreign policy of the
                    administrations of Jefferson and Madison, and the dangerous growth of the
                    slave-power, which he never ceased to oppose; as president of Harvard College
                    for sixteen years (1829-45) he increased the usefulness and added to the
                    influence of that seat of learning. He wrote a history of the college for two
                    hundred years, which was also largely a history of Massachusetts. He died in
                    June 1864 in the ninety-third year of his age. A life of him, by his youngest
                    son Edmund Quincy, an accomplished scholar and well-known author, was published
                    in 1867.</p>
