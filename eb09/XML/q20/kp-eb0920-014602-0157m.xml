                    well-known bird throughout almost all countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa,—in
                    modern ornithology the <hi rend="italic">Coturnix</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >communis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">C. dactylisonans.</hi> This last epithet was
                    given from the peculiar three-syllabled call-note of the cock, which has been
                    grotesquely rendered in several European languages, and in some parts of Great
                    Britain the species is popularly known by the nickname of “Wet-my-lips” or
                    “Wet-my-feet.” The Quail varies somewhat in colour, and the variation is rather
                    individual than attributable to local causes; but generally the plumage may be
                    described as reddish-brown above, almost each feather being transversely patched
                    with dark brown interrupted by a longitudinal stripe of light buff; the head is
                    dark brown above, with three longitudinal streaks of ochreous-white; the sides
                    of the breast and flanks are reddish-brown, distinctly striped with
                    ochreous-white; the rest of the lower parts are pale buff, clouded with a darker
                    shade, and passing into white on the belly. The cock, besides being generally
                    brighter in tint, not unfrequently has the chin and a double-throat band of
                    reddish or blackish-brown, which marks are wanting in the hen, whose breast is
                    usually spotted. Quails breed on the ground, as all gallinaceous birds commonly
                    do, and lay from nine to fifteen eggs of a yellowish-white, blotched and spotted
                    with dark brown. Though essentially migratory by nature, not a few Quails pass
                    the winter in the northern hemisphere and even in Britain, and many more in
                    southern Europe. In March and April they cross the Mediterranean from the south
                    on the way to their breed- <pb break="no"

                <p>ing homes in large bands, but these are said to be as nothing compared with the
                    enormous flights that emigrate from Europe towards the end of September. During
                    both migrations immense numbers are netted for the market, since they are almost
                    universally esteemed as delicate meat. On capture they are placed in long narrow
                    and low cages, darkened to prevent the prisoners from fighting, and, though they
                    are often so much crowded as to be hardly able to stir, the loss by death that
                    ensues is but trifling. Food, usually millet or hempseed, and water are supplied
                    in troughs hung in front, and thus these little birds are transported by tens of
                    thousands from the shores of the Mediterranean for consumption in the most
                    opulent and populous cities of Europe. The flesh of Quails caught in spring
                    commonly proves dry and indifferent, but that of those taken in autumn,
                    especially when they have been kept long enough to grow fat, as they quickly do,
                    is excellent. In no part of the British Islands at present do Quails exist in
                    sufficient numbers to be the especial object of sport, though there are many
                    places in which a few, and in some seasons more than a few, yearly fall to the
                    gun. When made to take wing, which is not always easily done, they rise with
                    great speed, but on such occasions they seldom fly far, and no one seeing them
                    only thus would be inclined to credit them with the power of extensive migration
                    that they possess, though this is often overtaxed, and the birds in their
                    transmarine voyages frequently drop exhausted into the sea or on any vessel that
                    may be in their way. In old days they were taken in England in a net, attracted
                    thereto by means of a Quail-call,—a simple instrument,<note anchored="true"

                    wholly neglected,—on which their notes are easily imitated.</p>
                <p>Five or six other species of the restricted genus <hi rend="italic">Coturnix</hi>
                    are now recognized; but the subject of the preceding remarks is generally
                    admitted to be that intended by the author of the book of Exodus (xvi. 13) as
                    having supplied food to the Israelites in the wilderness, though a few
                    ornithological writers have thought that bird to have been a <hi

                    well as the commoner one, which in Australia and Tasmania is wholly replaced by
                    <hi rend="italic">C. pectoralis,</hi> the Stubble-Quail of the colonists. In New
                    Zealand another species, <hi rend="italic">C. novae-zelandiae,</hi> was formerly
                    very abundant in some districts, but is considered to have been nearly if not
                    quite extirpated within the last twenty years by bush-fires. Some fifteen or
                    perhaps more species of Quails, inhabiting the Indian and Australian Regions,
                    have been separated, perhaps unnecessarily, to form the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Synoecus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Perdicula, Excalphatoria,</hi> and so forth;
                    but they call for no particular remark.</p>
                <p>America has some fifty or sixty species of birds which are commonly deemed
                    Quails, though by some authors placed in a distinct Family or Sub-family <hi

                    best known is the Virginian Quail, or Colin, as it is frequently called—that
                    being, according to Hernandez, its old Mexican name. It is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ortyx virginianus</hi> of modern ornithology, and has a wide distribution in
                    North America, in some parts of which it is known as the “Partridge,” as well as
                    by the nickname of “Bob-White,” aptly bestowed upon it from the call-note of the
                    cock. Many attempts have been made to introduce this bird to England (as indeed
                    similar trials have been made in the United States with Quails from Europe);
                    but, though it has been turned out by hundreds, and has been frequently known to
                    breed after liberation, its numbers rapidly diminish until it wholly disappears.
                    The beautiful tufted Quail of Cali fornia, <hi rend="italic">Lophortyx</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">californica,</hi> has also been tried in Europe without success.
                    All these American Quails or Colins seem to have the habit of perching on trees,
                    which none of the Old-World forms possess.</p>
                <p>Interesting from many points of view as is the group of Birds last mentioned,
                    there is another which, containing a score of species (or perhaps more) often
                    termed Quails or Button-Quails, is of still greater importance in the eyes of
                    the systematist. This is that comprehended by the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Turnix,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hemipodius</hi> of some authors, the
                    anatomical structure of which removes it far from the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coturnix,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ortyx,</hi> and their allies, and even from any
                    of the normal <hi rend="italic">Gallinae.</hi> Prof. Huxley, as already stated
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(Ornithology,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 36), would regard it as
                    the representative of a generalized stock from which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Charadriomorpliae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alectoromorphae,</hi> to say
                    nothing of other groups, have sprung. Want of space prevents our here dwelling
                    upon these curious birds. One species, <hi rend="italic">T. sylvatica,</hi>
                    inhabits Barbary and southern Spain, and under the name of Andalucian Hemipode
                    has been included (though on evidence not wholly satisfactory) among British
                    Birds as a reputed straggler. The rest are natives of various parts of the
                    Ethiopian, Indian, and Australian Regions. It is characteristic of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Turnix</hi> to want the hind toe; but the African <hi

                    >Pedionomus</hi> which have been referred to its neighbourhood have four toes on
                    each foot, and, since nothing is known of the anatomy or habits of the first and
