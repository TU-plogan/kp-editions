                    (1634-1719), Roman Catholic theologian, was born in Paris on July 14, 1634, and,
                    after graduating in the Sorbonne with distinction in 1653, joined the
                    Congregation of the Fathers of the Oratory in 1657, receiving priest’s orders in
                    1659. In 1675 he published an edition of the works of Leo the Great, in the
                    notes to which the Gallican liberties were defended. The work was consequently
                    put upon the <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> in the following year, and Quesnel’s
                    relations with his ecclesiastical superiors became so strained that in 1681 he
                    had to retire to Orleans. Four years later, finding himself unable to sign a
                    document imposed on all members of the Oratory in condemnation of Jansenism, he
                    fled to Brussels, where he was intimately associated with Arnauld, and where,
                    encouraged by him, he published in 1694-95 a complete edition of the <hi

                    on which he had first begun to engage himself shortly after joining the Oratory,
                    and a part of which had appeared as early as about 1671. The nature of its
                    contents, and still more the known sympathies of its author, made the book an
                    object of unwearying Jesuit hostility; Quesnel was imprisoned for a short time
                    in the palace of the archbishop of Mechlin in 1703, but happily succeeded in
                    escaping into Holland; his papers, however (compromising, it is said, to many
                    persons), fell into the hands of the enemy, and long were to the Père La Chaise
                    his “pot au noir” (as he called it) by means of which he was able to darken the
                    prospects of his adversaries as he chose. The bull <hi rend="italic"
