                    very local and remarkable species. Its chief home is in the mountains near Coban
                    in Vera Paz, but it also inhabits forests in other parts of Guatemala at an
                    elevation of from 6000 to 9000 feet.The Quezal is hardly so big as a
                    Turtle-Dove. The cock has a fine yellow bill and a head bearing a rounded crest
                    of filamentous feathers; lanceolate scapulars overhang the wings, and from the
                    rump spring the long flowing plumes which are so characteristic of the species,
                    and were so highly prized by the natives prior to the Spanish conquest that no
                    one was allowed to kill the bird when taken, but only to divest it of its
                    feathers, which were to be worn by the chiefs alone. These plumes, the middle
                    and longest of which may measure from three feet to three feet and a half, with
                    the upper surface, the throat, and chest, are of a resplendent

                    while the lower parts are of a vivid scarlet. The middle feathers of the tail,
                    ordinarily concealed, as are those of the Peacock, by the uropygials, are black,
                    and the outer white with a black base. In the hen the bill is black, the crest
                    more round and not filamentous, the uropygials scarcely elongated, and the vent
                    only scarlet. The eyes are of a yellowish-brown. Southern examples from Costa
                    Rica and Veragua have the tail-coverts much narrower, and have been needlessly
                    considered to form a distinct species under the name of <hi rend="italic">P.
