                    the west coast of British Columbia, to which they belong. They were so called by
                    Captain Dixon, who visited them in the “Queen Charlotte” in 1787, and spent more
                    than a month on their coasts. They are composed of two chief islands, Graham
                    Island to the north and Moresby Island to the south, separated by a very narrow
                    channel; but around these, especially in the south, are innumerable smaller
                    islands. The whole group has the form of a wedge with the point towards the
                    south. The extreme length is about 180 miles, and the greatest breadth 60 miles.
                    The total area cannot be determined, as the longitude of the west coast has not
                    yet been definitely ascertained. See vol. iv. Pl. XXXV.</p>
                <p>The islands are mountainous, and appear to be a partially submerged continuation
                    of the mountain chain traversing Vancouver’s Island, which lies to the south,
                    separated from the group by Queen Charlotte Sound. The mountains are situated
                    more particularly in the southern island, which is little more than a skeleton
                    of mountains washed at their base by the waters of numerous inlets. Many summits
                    here rise above 5000 feet in height. The larger island to the north, which has a
                    length of about 77 miles and a breadth equal to the maximum breadth of the
                    group, is in general lower, though here also there are hills rising to between
                    2000 and 3000 feet. Both the mountains and lowlands are well wooded, but in
                    general the timber is not found in accessible spots in sufficient quantity to
                    encourage attempts to develop the lumber trade. At present the principal
                    commercial resources of the islands are derived from the fish that frequent
                    these shores. Immense shoals of dog-fish visit the north and north-east, and
                    they are utilized for their oil by a company established on Skidegate Inlet on
                    the east side of Moresby Island. Holibut, herring, salmon, cod, and coalfish or
                    “skil” (this last also rich in oil and a valuable food-fish) are likewise
                    abundant. The climate is extremely moist, especially on the west side of the
                    watershed.</p>
                <p>Geologically the group appears to be composed mainly of Triassic, Cretaceous, and
                    Tertiary strata, with intrusive masses here and there of granite and other
                    igneous rocks. The Triassic deposits occupy almost the whole of the southern
                    part of the group, and it is uncertain whether some Palaeozoic rocks may not be
                    exposed at certain points, as they are in corresponding situations on the
                    mainland of British Columbia. The Cretaceous deposits lie unconformably on those
                    of Triassic age on both sides of Skidegate Inlet and Channel (in the south of
                    Graham Island and north-east of Moresby Island), and are interesting
                    geologically from containing a bed of anthracitic coal. These deposits are again
                    unconformably overlaid by those of Tertiary age extending over the greater part
                    of Graham Island; and the unconformity in this case is accompanied by evidence
                    of great disturbance, indicating that this was the chief period of
                    mountain-making in the group.</p>
                <p>The islands are inhabited by an interesting race of Indians called the Haidas,
                    who are chiefly found on the coasts, where they support themselves by fishing,
                    partly also by the cultivation of the potato, which was probably introduced
                    among them by some of the early voyagers. They tattoo their bodies, sometimes
                    paint their faces, and have many singular customs; but their greatest
                    peculiarity consists in their habit of erecting great numbers of carved posts as
                    ornaments in front of their dwellings. Their number is rapidly decreasing, and
                    in the last official report on the exploration of this group (Victoria, 1884),
                    it is estimated at only eight hundred.</p>
                <p>The fullest account of the Queen Charlotte Islands and their inhabitants is to be
                    found in the report of George Μ. Dawson in the <hi rend="italic">Report oj
                    Progress</hi> for 1878-79 of the Geological Survey of Canada.</p>
