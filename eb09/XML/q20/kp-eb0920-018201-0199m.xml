                    >vulgaris.</hi> For practical purposes it is perhaps better to consider it as
                    distinct from <hi rend="italic">Pyrus,</hi> differing from that genus in the
                    twisted manner in which the petals are arranged in the bud, and in the
                    many-celled ovary, in which the numerous ovules are disposed horizontally, not
                    vertically as in the pears. The quinces are much-branched shrubs or small trees
                    with entire leaves, small stipules, large solitary white or pink flowers like
                    those of a pear or apple, but with leafy calyxlobes, and a many-celled ovary, in
                    each cell of which are numerous horizontal ovules. The common quince is a native
                    of Persia and Anatolia, and perhaps also of Greece and the Crimea, but in these
                    latter localities it is doubtful whether or not the plant is not a relic of
                    former cultivation. By Franchet and Savatier <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cydonia</hi> is given as a native of Japan with the native name of
                    “maroumerou.” It is certain that the Greeks knew a common variety upon which
                    they engrafted scions of a better variety which they called κυδώνιοιζ, from
                    Cydon in Crete, whence it was obtained, and from which the names Cydonia,
                    Codogno (Italian), Coudougner and Coing (French), Quitte (German), and Quince
                    have been derived. Pliny (7/. <hi rend="italic">N.,</hi> xv. 11.) mentions that
                    the fruit of the quince, <hi rend="italic">Malum cotoneum,</hi> warded off the
                    influence of the evil eye; and other legends connect it with ancient Greek
                    mythology, as exemplified by statues in which the fruit is represented, as well
                    as by representations on the walls of Pompeii. The fragrance and astringency of
                    the fruit of the quince are well known, and the seeds are used medicinally for
                    the sake of the mucilage they yield when soaked in water, a peculiarity which is
                    not met with in pears. This mucilage is analogous to, and has the same
                    properties as, that which is formed from the seeds of linseed. In English
                    gardens three varieties are cultivated—the apple-shaped quince, the pear-shaped
                    quince, and the Portugal quince; the last-named has larger fruits than the other
                    two (4 inches in length, 3-3{ in width), of a rich yellow colour when ripe and
                    with less astringency, hence it is better suited for culinary and confectionary
                    purposes than the other two, but is said to be somewhat more tender. The common
                    quince and its varieties are very largely used as “dwarfing” stocks on which
                    choice pears are engrafted. The effect is to restrain the growth of the pear,
                    increase and hasten its fruitfulness, and enable it to withstand the effects of
                    cold (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Horticulture,</hi> vol. xii. p. 213). The common
                    Japan quince, <hi rend="italic">Pyrus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cydonia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">japonica,</hi> is grown in gardens for the sake of its flowers,
                    which vary in colour from creamy white to rich red, and are produced during the
                    winter and early spring months. <hi rend="italic">C. Maulei,</hi> a recently
                    introduced shrub from Japan, bears a profusion of equally beautiful orange-red
                    flowers, which are followed by fruit of a yellow colour and agreeable fragrance,
                    so that, when cooked with sugar, it forms an agreeable conserve, as in the case
                    of the ordinary quince. The fruit of the ordinary Japan quince is quite
                    uneatable.</p>
