                    important innovation in dramatic history. Tristan had offered it and it had been
                    accepted as his own at the price of a hundred crowns, which, though little
                    enough, was twice the regular price of a few years before. When Tristan told the
                    actors that it was the work of a novice they wished to throw up their bargain
                    and only held to it on the terms of a ninth part of the receipts. The piece
                    succeeded and Quinault followed it up, but he also read for the bar; and in
                    1660, when he married a widow with money, he bought himself a place in the Cour
                    des Comptes. Then he tried tragedies <hi rend="italic">{Agrippa,</hi> &lt;fcc.)
                    with more success than desert. He received one of the literary pensions then
                    recently established, and was elected to the Academy in 1670.</p>
                <p>Up to this time he had written some sixteen or seventeen comedies, tragedies, and
                    tragi-comedies, of which the tragedies were mostly of very small value and the
                    tragicomedies not of much more. But his comedies—especially his first piece <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Rivales, L’Amant Indiscret</hi> (1654) (which has some
                    likeness to Molière’s <hi rend="italic">Étourdi,</hi> and was with it used to
                    make up Newcastle’s and Dryden’s <hi rend="italic">Sir Martin Mar-all),</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Le Fantôme Amoureux</hi> (1659), and <hi rend="italic">La Mère
                    Coquette</hi> (1665), perhaps the best—are much better. None of these styles,
                    however, made Quinault worthy of a place here. In 1671 he contributed to the
                    singular miscellany of <hi rend="italic">Psyche,</hi> in which Corneille and
                    Molière also had a hand, and which was set to the music of Lulli. Here he showed
                    a remarkable faculty for lyrical drama, and from this time till just before his
                    death he confined himself to composing libretti for Lulli’s work. This was not
                    only very profitable (for he is said to have received four thousand livres for
                    each, which was much more than was usually paid even for tragedy), but it
                    established Quinault’s reputation as the master of a new style,—so much so that
                    even Boileau, who had previously attacked and satirized his dramatic work, was
                    converted, less to the opera, which he did not like, than to Quinault’s
                    remarkably ingenious and artist-like work in it. His libretti are among the very
                    few which are readable without the music, and which are yet carefully adapted to
                    it. They certainly do not contain very exalted poetry or very perfect drama.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n199/mode/1up"

                <p>But they are quite free from the ludicrous doggerel which (not merely in English)
                    has made the name libretto a byword, and at the same time they have quite enough
                    dramatic merit to carry the reader, much more the spectator, along with them. It
                    is not an exaggeration to say that Quinault, coming at the exact time when opera
                    became fashionable out of Italy, had very much to do with establishing it as a
                    permanent European <hi rend="italic">genre.</hi> His first piece after <hi
                    rend="italic">Psyche</hi> was a kind of classical masque, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Feast of Love and Bacchus</hi> (1672). Then came <hi rend="italic">Cadmus</hi>
                    (1674), then in the same year and the three following <hi rend="italic">Alceste,
                    Thésée,</hi><hi rend="italic">Atys</hi> (one of his best-liked pieces), and <hi
                    rend="italic">Isis.</hi> All these, it may be observed, were classical in
                    subject, and so was <hi rend="italic">Proserpine</hi> (1680), which was superior
                    to any of them. <hi rend="italic">The Triumph of Love</hi> (1681) is a mere
                    ballet, but in <hi rend="italic">Persée</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phaeton</hi>
                    Quinault returned to the classical opera. Then he finally deserted it for
                    romantic subjects, in which he was even more successful. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amadis</hi> (1684), <hi rend="italic">Roland</hi> (1685), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Armide</hi> (1686) are his masterpieces, the last being the most famous and the
                    best of all. It should perhaps be observed that the very artificiality of the
                    French lyric of the later 17th century and its resemblance to alexandrines cut
                    into lengths were aids to Quinault in arranging lyrical dialogue. Lulli died in
                    1687, and Quinault, his occupation gone (for the two had now worked together for
                    more than fifteen years, and it would probably have been difficult to find
                    another composer equally well suited to his librettist) became devout, began a
                    poem called the “Destruction of Heresy,” and died on November 26, 1688. The best
                    edition of his works is that of 1739 (Paris, 5 vols.).</p>
