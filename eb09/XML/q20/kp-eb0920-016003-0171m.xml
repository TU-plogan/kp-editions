                    improvement, of Cartesian geometry, in which the artifices of coordinate axes,
                    &lt;fcc., are got rid of, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> directions in space being
                    treated on precisely the same terms. It is therefore, except in some of its
                    degraded forms, possessed of the perfect isotropy of Euclidian space.</p>
                <p>From the purely geometrical point of view, a quaternion may be regarded as <hi
                    rend="italic">the quotient of two directed lines in sp&gt;ace—</hi> or, what
                    comes to the same thing, as <hi rend="italic">the factor, or operator, which
                    changes one directed line into another.</hi> Its analytical definition cannot be
                    given for the moment; it will appear in the course of the article.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History of the Method.—</hi> The evolution of quaternions
                    belongs in part to each of two weighty branches of mathematical history—the
                    interpretation of the <hi rend="italic">imaginary</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >impossible)</hi> quantity of common algebra, and the Cartesian application of
                    algebra to geometry. Sir W. R. Hamilton was led to his great invention by
                    keeping geometrical applications constantly before him while he endeavoured to
                    give a real significance to <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> ∕-l∙ We will therefore
                    confine ourselves, so far as his predecessors are concerned, to attempts at
                    interpretation which had geometrical applications in view.</p>
                <p>One geometrical interpretation of the negative sign of algebra was early seen to
                    be mere <hi rend="italic">reversal</hi> of direction along a line. Thus, when an
                    image is formed by a plane mirror, the distance of any point in it from the
                    mirror is simply the negative of that of the corresponding point of the object.
                    Or if motion in one direction along a line be treated as positive, motion in the
                    opposite direction along the same - line is negative. In the case of time,
                    measured from the Christian era, this distinction is at once given by the
                    letters <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    prefixed to the date. And to find the position, in time, of one event relatively
                    to another, we have only to subtract the date of the second (taking account of
                    its sign) from that of the first. Thus to find the interval between the battles
                    of Marathon (490 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) and Waterloo (1815 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> we have</p>
                <p>+1815 - ( - 490) = 2305 years.</p>
                <p>And it is obvious that the same process applies in all cases in which we deal
                    with quantities which may be regarded as of one directed dimension only, such as
                    distances along a line, rotations about an axis, &amp;c. But it <pb break="no"

                <p>is essential to notice that this is by no means necessarily true of <hi
                    rend="italic">operators.</hi> To turn a line through a certain angle in a given
                    plane, a certain operator is required; but when we wish to turn it through an
                    equal negative angle we must not, in general, employ the negative of the former
                    operator. For the negative of the operator which turns a line through a given
                    angle in a given plane will in all cases produce the negative of the original
                    result, which is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the result of the reverse operator,
                    unless the angle involved be an odd multiple of a right angle. This is, of
                    course, on the usual assumption that the sign of a product is changed when that
                    of <hi rend="italic">any one</hi> of its factors is changed, —which merely means
                    that -1 is commutative with all other quantities.</p>
                <p>The celebrated Wallis seems to have been the first to push this idea further. In
                    his <hi rend="italic">Treatise of Algebra</hi> (1685) he distinctly proposes to
                    construct the imaginary roots of a quadratic equation by going <hi rend="italic"
                    >out of</hi> the line on which the roots, if real, would have been
                    constructed.</p>
                <p>In 1804 the Abbé Buée,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1806.</p></note> apparently without any
                    knowledge of Wallis’s work, developed this idea so far as to make it useful in
                    geometrical applications. He gave, in fact, the theory of what in Hamilton’s
                    system is called <hi rend="italic">Composition of Vectors in one
                    plane—i.e.,</hi> the combination, by + and —, of complanar directed lines. His
                    constructions are based on the idea that the imaginaries ± <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi>- 1 represent a unit line, and its reverse, <hi rend="italic"
                    >perpendicular to</hi> the line on which the real units ± 1 are measured. In
                    this sense the imaginary expression <hi rend="italic">a + b f</hi>- 1 is
                    constructed by measuring a length <hi rend="italic">a</hi> along the fundamental
                    line (for real quantities), and from its extremity a line of length <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> in some direction perpendicular to the fundamental line.
                    But he did not attack the question of the representation of products or
                    quotients of directed lines. The step he took is really nothing more than the
                    kinematical principle of the composition of linear velocities, but expressed in
                    terms of the algebraic imaginary.</p>
                <p>In 1806 (the year of <hi rend="italic">publication</hi> of Buée’s paper) Argand
                    published a pamphlet<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Hoüel (Paris, 1874). There is added an important <hi rend="italic"

                    text above. Almost nothing can, it seems, be learned of Argand’s private life,
                    except that in all probability he λvas born at Geneva in 1768.</p></note> in
                    which precisely the same ideas are developed, but to a considerably greater
                    extent. For an interpretation is assigned to the <hi rend="italic">product</hi>
                    of two directed lines in one plane, when each is expressed as the sum of a real
                    and an imaginary part. This product is interpreted as another directed line,
                    forming the fourth term of a proportion, of which the first term is the real
                    (positive) unit-line, and the other two are the factor-lines. Argand’s work
                    remained unnoticed until the question was again raised in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gergonne's</hi><hi rend="italic">Annales,</hi> 1813, by Français. This writer
                    stated that he had found the germ of his remarks among the papers of his
                    deceased brother, and that they had come from Legendre, who had himself received
                    them from some one unnamed. This led to a letter from Argand, in which he stated
                    his communications with Legendre, and gave a résumé of the contents of his
                    pamphlet. In a further communication to the <hi rend="italic">Annales,</hi>
                    Argand pushed on the applications of his theory. He has given by means of it a
                    simple proof of the existence of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> roots, and no more, in
                    every rational algebraic equation of the nth order with real coefficients. About
                    1828 Warren in England, and Mourey in France, independently of one another and
                    of Argand, reinvented these modes of interpretation; and still later, in the
                    writings of</p>
                <p>Cauchy, Gauss, and others, the properties of the expression <hi rend="italic">a +
                    b f</hi>- 1 were developed into the immense and most important subject now
                    called the <hi rend="italic">theory of complex numbers</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Numbers, Theory of).</hi> From the more purely symbolical view
                    it was developed by Peacock, De Morgan, &lt;fcc., as <hi rend="italic">double
                    algebra.</hi></p>
                <p>Argand’s method may be put, for reference, in the following form. The directed
                    line whose length is <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and which makes an angle <hi
                    rend="italic">0</hi> with the real (positive) unit line, is expressed by α(cos0
                    + τsin0), where <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is regarded as + √ - 1. The sum of two
                    such lines (formed by adding together the real and the imaginary parts of two
                    such expressions) can, of course, be expressed as a third directed line— the
                    diagonal of the parallelogram of which they are conterminous sides. The product,
                    P, of two such lines is, as we have seen, given by 1: α(cos0 + isin0) :: α'(cos0
                    ’ + fsin0'): P, or P=αα ’ {cos(0 + 0') + isin(0 + 0')}.</p>
                <p>Its length is, therefore, the product of the lengths of the factors, and its
                    inclination to the real unit is the sum of those of the factors. If we write the
                    expressions for the two lines in the form A + Bi, A' + B'i, the product is AA' -
                    BB' + i(AB' + BA'); and the fact that the length of the product line is the
                    product of those of the factors is seen in the form</p>
                <p>(A <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + B <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)(A' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + B' <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) = (AA' - BB <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + (AB <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> + BA ’) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>In the modern theory of complex numbers this is expressed by saying that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Norm</hi> of a product is equal to the product of the norms of the
                    factors.</p>
                <p>Argand’s attempts to extend his method to space generally were fruitless. The
                    reasons will be obvious later; but we mention them just now because they called
                    forth from Servois (Gergonne’s <hi rend="italic">Annales,</hi> 1813) a very
                    remarkable comment, in which was contained the only yet discovered trace of an
                    anticipation of the method of Hamilton. Argand had been led to deny that such an
                    expression as <hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi>
                    could be expressed in the form A + Bz,— although, as is well known, Euler showed
                    that one of its values is a real quantity, the exponential function of - ττ∕2 .
                    Servois says, with reference to the general representation of a directed line in
                    space :—</p>
                <p>“L’analogie semblerait exiger que le trinôme fût de la forme 7&gt;cosα +

                    à cette condition seraient <hi rend="italic">absurdes</hi>; mais seraient-elles
                    imaginaires, réductibles à la forme générale Α + ΒχΖ-l? Voilà une question
                    d’analyse fort singulière que je soumets a vos lumières. La simple proposition
                    que je vous en fais suffit pour vous faire voir que je ne crois point que toute
                    fonction analytique non réelle soit vraiment réductible à la forme A + B√-
                    1.”</p>
                <p>As will be seen later, the fundamental <hi rend="italic">i, j, k</hi> of
                    quaternions, with their reciprocals, furnish a set of six quantities which
                    satisfy the conditions imposed by Servois. And it is quite certain that they
                    cannot be represented by ordinary imaginaries.</p>
                <p>Something far more closely analogous to quaternions than anything in Argand’s
                    work ought to have been suggested by De Moivre’s theorem <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >j^1730).</hi> Instead of regarding, as Buée and Argand had done, the expression
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (cos <hi rend="italic">θ + i</hi> sin <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ)</hi> as a directed line, let us suppose it to represent the <hi
                    rend="italic">operator</hi> which, when applied to <hi rend="italic">any</hi>
                    line in the plane in which <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> is measured, turns it in
                    that plane through the angle <hi rend="italic">θ,</hi> and at the same time
                    increases its length in the ratio <hi rend="italic">a</hi>: 1. From the new
                    point of view we see at once, as it were, <hi rend="italic">why</hi> it is true
                    that</p>
                <p>(cos <hi rend="italic">θ + i</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">θ)</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> m</hi> =cos <hi rend="italic">mθ + i</hi> sin <hi rend="italic"
                    >mθ.</hi></p>
                <p>For this equation merely states that <hi rend="italic">m</hi> turnings of a line
                    through successive equal angles, in one plane, give the same result as a single
                    turning through <hi rend="italic">m</hi> times the common angle. To make this
                    process applicable to <hi rend="italic">any</hi> plane in space, it is clear
                    that we must have <hi rend="italic">a special value of i</hi> for each such
                    plane. In other words, a unit line, drawn in any direction whatever, must have -
                    1 for its square. In such <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n173/mode/1up"

                    distinguished as the <hi rend="italic">real unit line</hi>: all will be alike
                    imaginary, or rather alike real. We may state, in passing, that every quaternion
                    can be represented as α(cos0 + ≡rsin0),—where <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is a real
                    number, <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> a real angle, and w a directed unit line whose
                    square is - 1. Hamilton took this grand step, but, as we have already said,
                    without any help from the previous work of De Moivrc. The course of his
                    investigations is minutely described in the preface to his first great work<note

                    of the many inquirers who endeavoured to give a real interpretation to the
                    imaginary of common algebra, found that at least two kinds, orders, or ranks of
                    quantities were necessary for the purpose. But, instead of dealing with points
                    on a line, and then wandering out at right angles to it, as Buée and Argand had
                    done, he chose to look on algebra as the science of <hi rend="italic">pure

                    “sets” of time-steps. In its essential nature a set is a linear function of any
                    number of <hi rend="italic">distinct</hi> units of the same species. Hence the
                    simplest form of a set is a <hi rend="italic">couple;</hi> and it was to the
                    possible laws of combination of couples that Hamilton first directed his
                    attention. It is obvious that the way in which the two separate time-steps are
                    involved in the couple will determine these laws of combination. But Hamilton’s
                    special object required that these laws should be such as to lead to certain
                    assumed results; and he therefore commenced by assuming these, and from the
                    assumption determined how the separate time-steps must be involved in the
                    couple. If we use Roman letters for mere numbers, capitals for instants of time,
                    Greek letters for time-steps, and a parenthesis to denote a couple, the laws
                    assumed by Hamilton as the basis of a system were as follows :—</p>
                <p>(B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>)-(A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, A <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) = (B <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>-A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> ~ <hi rend="smallcaps">A</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">) = (&lt;x,</hi> 3);</p>
                <p>(a, b)(α, ∕3) = (aa-bj8, ba + aβ).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Compare these with the long-subsequent ideas of Grassmann,
                    presently to be described.</p></note></p>
                <p>To show how we give, by such assumptions, a real interpretation to the ordinary
                    algebraic imaginary, take the simple case a = 0, b = l, and the second of the
                    above formulae gives</p>
                <p>(0, l)(α, 3) = (-3, a)·</p>
                <p>Multiply once more by the number-couple (0,1), and we have</p>
                <p>(0, l)(0, l)(α, 3) = (0, l)(-0, a) = (-a,~3) = (-l, 0)(a, 3)=-(a, 3)∙</p>
                <p>Thus the number-couple (0,1), when twice applied to a step-couple, simply changes
                    its sign. That we have here a perfectly <hi rend="italic">real</hi> and
                    intelligible interpretation of the ordinary algebraic imaginary is easily seen
                    by an illustration, even if it be a somewhat extravagant one. Some Eastern
                    potentate, possessed of absolute power, covets the vast possessions of his
                    vizier and of his barber. He determines to rob them both (an operation which may
                    be very satisfactorily expressed by - 1); but, being a wag, he chooses his own
                    way of doing it. He degrades his vizier to the office of barber, taking all his
                    goods in the process; and makes the barber his vizier. Next day he repeats the
                    operation. Each of the victims has been restored to his former rank, but the
                    operator - 1 has been applied to both.</p>
                <p>Hamilton, still keeping prominently before him as his great object the invention
                    of a method applicable to space of three dimensions, proceeded to study the
                    properties of <hi rend="italic">triplets</hi> of the form <hi rend="italic">x +
                    iy +jz,</hi> by which he proposed to represent the directed line in space whose
                    projections on the coordinate axes are <hi rend="italic">x, y, z.</hi> The
                    composition of two such lines by the algebraic addition of their several
                    projections agreed with the assumption of Buée and Argand for the case of
                    coplanar lines. But, assuming the <hi rend="italic">distributive</hi> principle,
                    the product of two lines appeared to give the expression <hi rend="italic">xx' -
                    yy' - zz' + i{yx</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">+ xyj +j{xz' + zxj + ijfiz</hi><hi
                    rend="italic                     superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">+
                    zyj.</hi></p>
                <p>For the square of j, like that of <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> was assumed to be
                    negative unity. But the interpretation of <hi rend="italic">ij</hi> presented a
                    difficulty,—in fact <hi rend="italic">the main difficulty</hi> of the whole
                    investigation,—and it is specially interesting to see how Hamilton attacked it.
                    He saw that he could get a hint from the simpler case, already thoroughly
                    discussed, provided the two factor lines were in one plane through the real unit
                    line. This requires merely that <hi rend="italic">y. z ::y': z';</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">yz'-zy</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">=0∙,</hi> but then the product
                    should be of the same form as the separate factors. Thus, in this special case,
                    the term in <hi rend="italic">ij</hi> ought to vanish. But the numerical factor
                    appears to be <hi rend="italic">yz' + zy',</hi> while it is the quantity <hi
                    rend="italic">yz — zy</hi> which really vanishes. Hence Hamilton was at first
                    inclined to think that <hi rend="italic">ij</hi> must be treated as <hi
                    rend="italic">nil.</hi> But he soon saw that “a less harsh supposition” would
                    suit the simple case. For his speculations on sets had already familiarized him
                    with the idea that multiplication might in certain cases not be commutative; so
                    that, as the last term in the above product is made up of the two separate terms
                    <hi rend="italic">ijyz' axd</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">,jizy',</hi> the term would
                    vanish of itself when the factor-lines are coplanar provided <hi rend="italic"
                    >ij= -ji,</hi> for it would then assume the form <hi rend="italic">ij (yz' -
                    zyj.</hi> He had now the following expression for the product of any two
                    directed lines <hi rend="italic">xx' - yy' - zz' + ijjx' + xyj +j(xz</hi><hi
                    rend="italic                     superscript"> ,</hi> + ≈c') + <hi rend="italic"
                    >ijjy≈' - zyj.</hi></p>
                <p>But his result had to be submitted to another test, the Law of the Norms. As soon
                    as he found, by trial, that this law was satisfied, he took the final step.
                    “This led me,” he says, “to conceive that perhaps, instead of seeking to <hi
                    rend="italic">confine</hi> ourselves to <hi rend="italic">triplets,</hi> we
                    ought to regard these as only <hi rend="italic">imperfect forms of</hi>
                    Quaternions, and that thus my old conception of <hi rend="italic">sets</hi>
                    might receive a new and useful application.” In a very short time he settled his
                    fundamental assumptions. He had now three distinct space-units <hi rend="italic"
                    >i, j, k;</hi> and the following conditions regulated their combination by
                    multiplication :—</p>
                <p>i <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =y <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =⅛ <hi

                <p>Hamilton at once found that the Law of the Norms holds,— not being aware that
                    Euler had long before decomposed the product of two sums of four squares into
                    this very set of four squares. And now a directed line in space came to be
                    represented as <hi rend="italic">ix+jy + kz,</hi> while the product of two lines
                    is the quaternion <hi rend="italic">- (xx! + yy</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">+zzj +

                <p>sought, was now, at least in part, attained.” The date ol this memorable
                    discovery is October 16, 1843.</p>
                <p>We can devote but a few lines to the consideration oi the expression above.
                    Suppose, for simplicity, the factorlines to be each of unit length. Then <hi
                    rend="italic">x, y, z, x', y', z</hi> express their direction-cosines. Also, if
                    <hi rend="italic">0</hi> be the angle between them, and <hi rend="italic">x",
                    y", z"</hi> the direction-cosines of a line perpendicular to each of them, we
                    have <hi rend="italic">xx' + yy' + zz —</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">θ, yz' — zy'
                    = x" sinθ,</hi> &amp;c., so that the product of two unit lines is now expressed
                    as - cosØ + <hi rend="italic">(ix" +jy"</hi> + ½z")sin0. Thus, when the factors
                    are parallel, or 0 = 0, the product, which is now the square of any (unit) line,
                    is—1. And when the two factor lines are at right angles to one another, or 0 =
                    τr∕2, the product is simply <hi rend="italic">ix" +jy"+kz'',</hi> the unit line
                    perpendicular to both. Hence, and in this lies the main element of the symmetry
                    and simplicity of the quaternion calculus, <hi rend="italic">all systems of
                    three mutually rectangular unit lines in space have the same properties as the
                    fundamental system i, j, k.</hi> In other words, if the system (considered as
                    rigid) be made to turn about till the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> factor
                    coincides with <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and the second with <hi rend="italic"
                    >j,</hi> the product will coincide with <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> This
                    fundamental system, therefore, becomes unnecessary; and the quaternion method,
                    in every case, takes its reference lines solely from the problem to which it is
                    applied. It has therefore, as it were, a unique <hi rend="italic">internal</hi>
                    character of its own.</p>
                <p>Hamilton, having gone thus far, proceeded to evolve these results from a train of
                    <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> or metaphysical reasoning, which is so
                    interesting in itself, and so characteristic of the man, that we briefly sketch
                    its nature.</p>
                <p>Let it be supposed that the product of two directed lines is something which has
                    quantity; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it may be halved, or doubled, for
                    instance. Also let us assume (a) space to have the same properties in all
                    directions, and make the convention (ό) that to change the sign of any one
                    factor changes the sign of a product. Then the product of two lines which have
                    the same direction <hi rend="italic">cannot be,</hi> even in part, <hi
                    rend="italic">a directed quantity.</hi> For, if the directed part have the same
                    direction as the factors, (δ) shows that it will be reversed by reversing
                    either, and therefore will recover its original direction when both are
                    reversed. But this would obviously be inconsistent with (a). If it be
                    perpendicular to the factor lines, (α) shows that it must have simultaneously
                    every such direction. Hence it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be a mere number.</p>
                <p>Again, the product of two lines at right angles to one another cannot, even in
                    part, be a number. For the reversal of either factor must, by (δ), change its
                    sign. But, if we look at the two factors in their new position by the light of
                    <hi rend="italic">(a),</hi> we see that the sign must not change. But there is
                    nothing to prevent its being represented by a directed line if, as farther
                    applications of (a) and (δ) show we must do, we take it perpendicular to each of
                    the factor lines. Hamilton seems never to have been quite satisfied with the
                    apparent <hi rend="italic">heterogeneity</hi> of a quaternion, depending as it
                    does on a numerical and a directed part. He indulged in a great deal of
                    speculation as to the existence of an <hi rend="italic">extra-spatial unit,</hi>
                    which was to furnish the <hi rend="italic">raison d'etre</hi> of the numerical
                    part, and render the quaternion <hi rend="italic">homogeneous</hi> as well as
                    linear. But, for this, we must refer to his own works.</p>
                <p>Hamilton was not the only worker at the theory of sets. The year after the first
                    publication of the quaternion method, there appeared a work of great
                    originality, by Grassmann,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    collected works of Möbius, and those of Clifford, for a general explanation of
                    Grassmann’s method.</p></note> in which results closely analogous to some of
                    those of Hamilton were given. In particular two species of multiplication
                    (“inner” and “outer”) of directed lines in one plane were given. The results of
                    these two kinds of multiplication correspond respectively to the numerical and
                    the directed parts of Hamilton’s quaternion product. But Grassmann distinctly
                    states in his preface that he had not had leisure to extend his method to angles
                    in space. Hamilton and Grassmann, while their earlier work had much in common,
                    had very different objects in view. Hamilton, as we have seen, had geometrical
                    application as his main object; when he realized the quaternion system, he felt
                    that his object was gained, and thenceforth confined himself to the development
                    of his method. Grassmann’s object seems to have been, all along, of a much more
                    ambitious character, viz., to discover, if possible, a system or systems in
                    which every conceivable mode of dealing with sets should be included. That he
                    made very great advances towards the attainment of this object all will allow;
                    that his method, even as completed in 1862, fully attains it is not so certain.
                    But his claims, however great they may be, can in no way conflict with those of
                    Hamilton, whose mode of multiplying <hi rend="italic">couples</hi> (in which the
                    “inner” and “outer” multiplication are essentially involved) was produced in
                    1833, and whose quaternion system was completed and published before Grassmann
                    had elaborated for press even the rudimentary portions of his own system, in
                    which the veritable difficulty of the whole subject, the application to angles
                    in space, had not even been attacked. Grassmann made in 1854 a somewhat savage
                    onslaught on Cauchy and De St Venant, the former of whom had invented, while the
                    latter had exemplified in application, the system of “<hi rend="italic"
                    >clefs</hi><hi rend="italic">algébriques,”</hi> which is almost precisely that
                    of Grassmann. But it is to be observed that Grassmann, though he virtually
                    accused Cauchy of plagiarism, does not appear to have preferred any such charge
                    against Hamilton. He does not allude to Hamilton in the second edition of his
                    work. But in 1877, in the <hi rend="italic">Mathematische Annalen,</hi> xii., he
                    gave a paper “On the Place of Quaternions in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ausdehnungslehre,”</hi> in which he condemns, as far as he can, the
                    nomenclature and methods of Hamilton. There are many other systems, based on
                    various principles, which have been given for application to geometry of
                    directed lines, but those which deal with products of lines are all of such
                    complexity as to be practically useless in application. Others, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bary-centrische</hi><hi rend="italic">Calcul</hi> of Mobius, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Méthode des Équipollences</hi> of Bellavitis, give elegant
                    modes of treating space problems, so long as we confine ourselves to projective
                    geometry and matters of that order; but they are limited in their field, and
                    therefore need not be discussed here. More general systems, having close
                    analogies to quaternions, have been given since Hamilton’s discovery was
                    published. As instances we may take Goodwin’s and O’Brien’s papers in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cambridge Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1849.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">delations to other Branches of Science.—</hi> Even the above
                    brief narrative shows how close is the connexion between quaternions and the
                    ordinary Cartesian space-geometry. Were this all, the gain by their introduction
                    would consist mainly in a clearer insight into the mechanism of coordinate
                    systems, rectangular or not—a very important addition to theory, but little
                    advance so far as practical application is concerned. But we have now to
                    consider that, as yet, we have not taken advantage of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >perfect symmetry</hi> of the method. When that is done, the full value of
                    Hamilton’s grand step becomes evident, and the gain is quite as extensive from
                    the practical as from the theoretical point of view. Hamilton, in fact,
                    remarks,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures on Quaternions,</hi> § 513.</p></note> “I regard it as an
                    inelegance and imperfection in this calculus, or rather in the state to which it
                    has hitherto been unfolded, whenever it becomes, or <hi rend="italic">seems</hi>
                    to become, necessary to have recourse to the resources of ordinary algebra, for
                    the <hi rend="italic">solution of equations in quaternions.”</hi> This refers to
                    the use of the <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi>
                    coordinates,—associated, of course, with <hi rend="italic">i, j, k.</hi> But
                    when, instead of the highly artificial expression <hi rend="italic">ix+jy +
                    kz,</hi> to denote a finite directed line, we employ a single letter, α
                    (Hamilton uses the Greek alphabet for this purpose), and find that we are
                    permitted to deal with it exactly as we should have dealt with the more complex
                    expression, the immense gain is at least in part obvious. Any quaternion may now
                    be expressed in numerous simple forms. Thus we may regard it as the sum of a
                    number and a line, <hi rend="italic">a + a,</hi> or as the product, <hi
                    rend="italic">βγ,</hi> or the quotient, δe^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>, of
                    two directed lines, &lt;fcc., while, in many cases, we may represent it, so far
                    as it is required, by a single letter such as <hi rend="italic">q, r,</hi>
                    &amp;c.</p>

                <p>Perhaps to the student there is no part of elementary mathematics so repulsive as
                    is spherical trigonometry. Also, everything relating to change of systems of
                    axes, as for instance in the kinematics of a rigid system, where we have
                    constantly to consider one set of rotations with regard to axes fixed in space,
                    and another set with regard to axes fixed in the system, is a matter of
                    troublesome complexity by the usual methods. But every quaternion formula is a
                    proposition in spherical (sometimes degrading to plane) trigonometry, and has
                    the full advantage of the symmetry of the method. And one of Hamilton’s earliest
                    advances in the study of his system (an advance independently made, only a few
                    months later, by Cayley) was the interpretation of the singular operator ?( )2~
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> &gt; where <hi rend="italic">q</hi> is a
                    quaternion. Applied to <hi rend="italic">any</hi> directed line, this operator
                    at once turns it, <hi rend="italic">conically,</hi> through a definite angle,
                    about a definite axis. Thus rotation is now expressed in symbols at least as
                    simply as it can be exhibited by means of a model. Had quaternions effected
                    nothing more than this, they would still have inaugurated one of the most
                    necessary, and apparently impracticable, of reforms.</p>
                <p>The physical properties of a heterogeneous body (provided they vary <hi
                    rend="italic">continuously</hi> from point to point) are known to depend, in the
                    neighbourhood of any one point of the body, on a quadric function of the
                    coordinates with reference to that point. The same is true of physical
                    quantities such as potential, temperature, &lt;fcc., throughout small regions in
                    which their variations are continuous; and also, without restriction of
                    dimensions, of moments of inertia, &amp;c. Hence, in addition to its geometrical
                    applications to surfaces of the second order, the theory of quadric functions of
                    position is of fundamental importance in physics. Here the symmetry points at
                    once to the selection of the three principal axes as the directions for <hi
                    rend="italic">i, j, k</hi>; and it would appear at first sight as if quaternions
                    could not simplify, though they might improve in elegance, the solution of
                    questions of this kind. But it is not so. Even in Hamilton’s earlier work it was
                    shown that all such questions were reducible to the <hi rend="italic">solution
                    of linear equations in quaternions ∙,</hi> and he proved that this, in turn,
                    depended on the determination of a certain operator, which could be represented
                    for purposes of calculation by a single symbol. The method is essentially the
                    same as that developed, under the name of “matrices” by Cayley in 1858; but it
                    has the peculiar advantage of the simplicity which is the natural consequence of
                    entire freedom from conventional reference lines.</p>
                <p>Sufficient has already been said to show the close connexion between quaternions
                    and the theory of numbers. But one most important connexion with modern physics
                    must be pointed out, as it is probably destined to be of great service in the
                    immediate future. In the theory of surfaces, in hydrbkinetics, heat-conduction,
                    potentials, &amp;c., we constantly meet with what is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laplace</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s operator, d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">

                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it is independent of the particular directions chosen
                    for the rectangular coordinate axes. Here, then, is a case specially adapted to
                    the isotropy of the quaternion system;</p>

                    1</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> and Hamilton easily saw that the expression
                    4-</p>
                <p>could be, like <hi rend="italic">ix +jy + kz,</hi> effectively expressed by a
                    single letter. He chose for this purpose ψ. And we now see that the square of v
                    is the negative of Laplace’s operator; while V itself, when applied to any
                    numerical quantity conceived as having a definite value at each point of space,
                    gives <hi rend="italic">the direction and the rate of most rapid change</hi> of
                    that quantity. Thus, applied to a potential, it gives the direction and
                    magnitude of the force: to a distribution of temperature in a conducting solid,
                    it gives (when multiplied by the conductivity) the flux of heat, Âc. No better
                    testimony to the value of the quaternion method could be desired than the
                    constant use made of its notation by mathematicians like Clifford (in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Kinematic)</hi> and by physicists like Clerk-Maxwell (in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Electricity and Magnetism).</hi> Neither of these men professed to
                    employ the calculus itself, but they recognized fully the extraordinary
                    clearness of insight which is gained even by merely translating the unwieldy
                    Cartesian expressions met with in hydrokinetics and in electrodynamics into the
                    pregnant language of quaternions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Works on the Subject.—</hi> Of course the great works on this
                    subject are the two immense treatises by Hamilton himself. Of these the second
                    <hi rend="italic">(Elements of Quaternions,</hi> London, 1866) was
                    posthumous—incomplete in one short part of the original plan only, but that a
                    most important part, the theory and applications of V. These two works, along
                    with Hamilton’s other papers on quaternions (in the <hi rend="italic">Dublin
                    Proceedings</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Transactions,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Magazine,</hi> &amp;c. ), are storehouses of information, of
                    which but a small portion has yet been extracted. A German translation of
                    Hamilton’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> has recently been published by
                    Gian.</p>

                <p>An excellent article on the “Principles” of the science, by Dillner, will be
                    found in the <hi rend="italic">Mathematische Annalen,</hi> vol. xi., 1877. And a
                    very valuable article on the general question, <hi rend="italic">Linear
                    Associated Algebra,</hi> by the late Prof. Peirce, was unfortunately
                    lithographed for private circulation only. Sylvester and others have recently
                    published extensive contributions to the subject, including quaternions under
                    the general class <hi rend="italic">matrix,</hi> and have developed much farther
                    than Hamilton lived to do the solution of equations in quaternions. Several of
                    the works named above are little more than compilations, and some of the French
                    ones arc painfully disfigured by an attempt to introduce an improvement of
                    Hamilton’s notation; but the mere fact that so many have already appeared shows
                    the sure progress which the method is now making. (P. G. T.)</p>
