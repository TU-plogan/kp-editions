                <p><label type="entry">QUININE</label>, the most important of the active principles
                    contained in cinchona bark (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Cinchona,</hi> vol. v. p.
                    780). Although the value of this bark in the treatment of intermittent fevers
                    became widely known in 1G38 through the cure of the countess of Chinchon, it was
                    not until 1810 that any attempt was made to determine definitely the active
                    principles to which its properties were due. In that year Gomez of Lisbon
                    obtained a mixture of alkaloids by treating an alcoholic extract of the bark
                    with water and then adding a solution of caustic potash. To this he gave the
                    name of cinchonino. In 1820 two French chemists, Pelletier and Caventou, proved
                    that the cinchonino of Gomez contained two alkaloids which they named quinine
                    and cinchonine. Some years afterwards quinidine and cinchonidine were
                    discovered, and subsequently several other alkaloids, but in smaller quantity,
                    in different varieties of the bark.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chemistry.—</hi> The alkaloids appear to exist in cinchona bark
                    chiefly in combination with cinchotannic and quinic acids, since solvents of the
                    alkaloids in the free state do not dissolve out any from the powdered bark. The
                    cinchotannic acid apparently becomes altered by atmospheric oxidation into a
                    red-colouring matter, known as cinchono-fulvic acid or cinchona red, which is
                    very abundant in some species, as in <hi rend="italic">C. succirubra.</hi> For
                    this reason those barks which, like <hi rend="italic">C. Calisaya, C.
                    officinalis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C. Ledgeriana,</hi> contain but little
                    colouring matter are preferred by manufacturers, the quinine being more easily
                    extracted from them in a colourless form. The value of cinchona bark for the
                    manufacture of quinine depends on the amount of quinine sulphate that can be
                    prepared from it in the crystalline form. The exact mode of extraction adopted
                    by manufacturers is kept a profound secret. That hitherto adopted by the Indian
                    Government for the preparation of the cinchona febrifuge (see below) has the
                    merit of simplicity, but the whole of the alkaloid present in the bark is not
                    obtained by it. This method is to exhaust the powdered bark as far as possible
                    by means of water acidulated with hydrochloric acid and then to precipitate the
                    mixed alkaloids by caustic soda. Another method which is said to give better
                    results consists in mixing the powdered bark with milk of lime, drying the mass
                    slowly with frequent stirring, exhausting the powder with boiling alcohol,
                    removing the excess of alcohol by distillation, adding sufficient dilute
                    sulphuric acid to dissolve the alkaloid and throw down colouring matter and
                    traces of lime, &amp;c., filtering, and allowing the neutralized liquid to
                    deposit crystals. The sulphates of the alkaloids thus obtained are not equally
                    soluble in water, and the sulphate of quinine can consequently be separated by
                    fractional crystallization, since, being less soluble in water than the other
                    sulphates, it crystallizes out first.</p>
                <p>The quinine of commerce is the neutral sulphate, containing 7- <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> molecules of water of crystallization, and having the
                    formula (C <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 24</hi> N <hi

                    from alcohol, or when dried over sulphuric acid, it contains only 2 molecules.
                    Cownlcy has shown that the salt containing 2 molecules of -water is the most
                    permanent one, for when the commercial sulphate containing 7J molecules is dried
                    at 100 <hi rend="superscript"> α</hi> C. it becomes anhydrous, and when
                    subsequently exposed freely to the air it rapidly absorbs 2 molecules of water;
                    and that the commercial salt, if exposed to the air, effloresces until only 2
                    molecules of water are retained.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Two other sulphates are known. The one contains a single equivalent of acid, and
                    in commerce bears the name of acid sulphate or soluble sulphate of quinine; it
                    is soluble in 11 parts of water, but with considerable difficulty in absolute
                    alcohol. The other sulphate contains 2 equivalents of sulphuric acid, is very
                    soluble in cold water, but quite insoluble in ether; it is not an article of
                    commerce. Both these sulphates crystallize with 7 molecules of water.</p>
                <p>The neutral sulphate of quinine occurs in commerce in the form of slender white
                    acicular crystals, which are very light and bulky. It is soluble in about 740
                    parts of cold water, but in 30 of boiling water, 60 of rectified spirits of wine
                    (sp. gr. 0 ’ 85), and 40 of glycerin. Its solubility in water is lessened by the
                    presence of sodium or magnesium sulphate, but is increased by nitrate of
                    potassium, ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi><pb break="no"

                <p>chloride of ammonium, and most acids. It is not soluble in fixed oils or in
                    ether, although the pure alkaloid is soluble in both. It becomes phosphorescent
                    on trituration. When prescribed it is generally rendered more soluble in water
                    by the addition of dilute sulphuric acid or of citric acid, one drop of the
                    former or fths of a grain of the latter being used for each grain of the
                    sulphate of quinine.</p>
                <p>When a solution of quinine is exposed to sunlight it assumes a yellowish or brown
                    colour due to the formation of “quiniretin,” a body which is isomeric with
                    quinine but has mot an alkaline reaction, is not precipitated by tannin, and has
                    an aromatic as well as a bitter taste. Quinine is precipitated from its solution
                    by alkalies and their carbonates. It is very soluble in solution of ammonia, and
                    also slightly soluble in lime water.</p>
                <p>The acid solution of sulphate of quinine is fluorescent, especially when dilute;
                    it is levogyrate; and when a solution of chlorine is first added and then
                    ammonia an emerald green colour, due to the formation of thalleoquin, is
                    developed. This test answers with a solution containing only 1 part of quinine
                    in 5000, or in a solution containing not more than part if bromine be used
                    instead of chlorine. The fluorescence is visible in an acid solution containing
                    one part in 200,000 of water.</p>
                <p>Quinine forms with sulphuric acid and iodine a compound known as herapathite, 4O

                    which possesses optical properties similar to those of tourmaline; it is soluble
                    in 1000 parts of boiling water; and its sparing solubility in cold alcohol has
                    been utilized for estimating quinine quantitatively. The other alkaloids are
                    distinguished from quinine thus:—quinidine resembles quinine, but is
                    dextrogyrate, and the iodide is very insoluble in water; the solution of
                    cinchonidine, which is levogyrate, does not give the thalleoquin test, nor
                    fluorescence; cinchonine resembles cinchonidine in these respects, but is
                    dextrogyrate.</p>
                <p>Commercial sulphate of quinine frequently contains from 1 to 10 per cent, of the
                    sulphate of cinchonidine owing to the use of barks containing it. The sulphate
                    of cinchonidine is more soluble than that of quinine; and, when 1 part of
                    quinine sulphate suspected to contain it is nearly dissolved in 24 parts of
                    boiling water, the sulphate of quinine crystallizes out on cooling, and the
                    cinchonidine is found in the clear mother liquor, from which it can be
                    precipitated by a solution of tartrate of potassium and sodium. Samples of
                    quinine in which cinchonidine is present usually contain, according to Hesse, a
                    smaller percentage of water than the pure sulphate, the cinchonidine salt
                    exercising a reducing influence on the quinine salt in this respect. Traces of
                    quinidine are also sometimes, though rarely, found in commercial quinine, but,
                    since quinidine is even more valuable as a medicine than quinine, its presence
                    does not detract in a medicinal point of view from the value of the latter.</p>
                <p>Owing to its voluminous character, as much as 18 per cent, of water may remain
                    present in apparently dry samples of sulphate of quinine. If it loses more than
                    14 ’ 6 per cent, of water when dried at 100 ’ C. it contains an excessive amount
                    of moisture. Owing to its variability in this respect the hydrochlorate of
                    quinine has been recommended as a more constant salt; it also possesses
                    advantages from a therapeutical point of view.</p>
                <p>Sulphate of quinine manufactured from cuprea bark <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Remijia</hi><hi rend="italic">pedunculatcî)</hi> is liable to contain from <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 10 to ‘90 per cent, of sulphate of homoquinine, which
                    almost coincides in solubility with sulphate of quinine. Homoquinine has been
                    shown by Paul and Cownley to be decomposed on treatment with caustic soda into
                    quinine and a new alkaloid, cupreine, in the proportion of 2 to 3.</p>
                <p>They have also shown that cupreine is soluble in a solution of caustic soda
                    (differing in this respect from quinine), and that therefore it is easy to
                    prepare sulphate of quinine perfectly free from either homoquinine or cupreine.
                    So far as the medicinal properties of cupreine and homoquinine are at present
                    known they appear to be of no practical importance.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In consequence of the high price of the alkaloid an attempt was made a few years
                    since by the Government of India to manufacture from cinchona bark a cheap
                    febrifuge which should represent the alkaloids contained in the bark and form a
                    substitute for quinine. This enterprise met with such success that in 1884 as
                    much as 8714 lb of the febrifuge were prepared; and during the previous year
                    9144 lb were distributed, of which 4880 lb were supplied to the Government
                    institutions at a cost of little more than a rupee per ounce.</p>
                <p>This mixture is known as cinchona febrifuge, and is prepared chiefly from <hi
                    rend="italic">C. succirubra,</hi> which succeeds better in India than the other
                    species in cultivation, and grows at a lower elevation, being consequently
                    procurable in large quantities at a comparatively low price. A mixture of the
                    cinchona alkaloids, consisting principally of cinchonidine sulphate, with
                    smaller quantities of the sulphates of quinine and cinchonine, is sold under the
                    name of “quine-tum” at a cheaper rate than quinine.</p>
                <p>In 1870 the Indian Government purchased no less than 81,G00 ounces of sulphate of
                    quinine, besides 8832 ounces of the sulphates of cinchonine, cinchonidine, and
                    quinidine; but at the present date it is able to meet the requirements of its
                    establishments almost entirely by the cinchona febrifuge prepared at the
                    Government plantations in India.</p>
                <p>Although quinine is manufactured in the United States, a large quantity has been
                    imported from Europe since the high duty levied on its manufacture has been
                    removed. There is considerable difficulty in obtaining trustworthy statistics as
                    to the extent of the manufacture of quinine. The largest sale that has taken
                    place in America appears to have been in 1883, when 1⅜ tons were put up to
                    auction, and in the same year 16,000 ounces were sold in London and a similar
                    quantity at Berlin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physiological Action.—</hi> Quinine arrests the movements of
                    the white corpuscles of the blood, rendering them round and darkly granulate,
                    and, by preventing them from making their exit from the blood-vessels,
                    diminishes or arrests the formation of pus in inflammation and causes
                    contraction of the spleen when that organ is enlarged. It acts upon the
                    cerebro-spinal nervous system, giving rise to headache and a sense of tension in
                    the brain; these symptoms may be removed by the addition of hydrobromic acid or
                    prevented by the use of the hydrobromide of quinine. It acts through the
                    sympathetic nervous system on the heart, and is thus capable of restraining all
                    the animal processes which develop heat, organic changes, or muscular action. It
                    is antagonistic to atropine in its physiological action.</p>
                <p>The use of quinine in medicine dates from its discovery in 1820. Its chief value
                    is as an antiperiodic, especially in intermittent fevers, but also in other
                    diseases when they assume a periodic character, such as neuralgia, asthma,
                    hooping cough, &lt;tc. In blood poisoning, whether arising from natural or
                    traumatic causes, it has been found of great utility. Its curative powers in
                    sunstroke have been repeatedly proved in the East Indies, and a dose of quinine
                    will often cut short an attack of catarrh if taken in the early stage. In
                    malarial districts persons have <pb break="no"

                    danger after taking a dose or two of five grains of quinine once or twice a day.
                    In the smallest medicinal doses it is purely tonic, in larger ones stimulant;
                    but it differs from other medicines of the same class in the stimulant action
                    being longer sustained. In large doses it acts as a sedative, and in excessive
                    doses it is poisonous. In some individuals it produces an erythematous eruption,
                    and it is also known to act as an oxytocic. Large doses also sometimes produce
                    deafness, and act injuriously in all inflammatory states of the mucous
                    membrane.</p>
                <p>The other alkaloids of cinchona bark—quinidine, cinchonidine, and cinchonine—also
                    possess similar properties, quinidine being even more effectual than quinine;
                    but cinchonine appears to produce nausea and gastric disturbance. This is also
                    the case with the cinchona febrifuge prepared from <hi rend="italic">C.

                <p>Until the year 1867 English manufacturers of quinine were entirely dependent upon
                    South America for their supplies of cinchona bark, which were obtained
                    exclusively from uncultivated trees, growing chiefly in Bolivia, Peru, and
                    Ecuador, the principal species which were used for the purpose being <hi

                    disappointment as quinine-yielding species, these have been replaced in the
                    plantations as rapidly as possible by the more valuable species, of which <hi
                    rend="italic">C'. Ledgeriana,</hi> yielding from 5 to 10 per cent, or even more
                    of quinine, <hi rend="italic">C. officinalis,</hi> and a hybrid between <hi

                    has been named <hi rend="italic">C. robusta,</hi> Trimen, are the most
                    important.</p></note> Recently <hi rend="italic">C. lancifolia,</hi> var. <hi
                    rend="italic">Calisaya,</hi> Wedd., known as the calisaya of Santa Fé, has been
                    strongly recommended for cultivation, because the shoots of felled trees afford
                    bark containing a considerable amount of quinine; <hi rend="italic">C.
                    Pitayensis</hi> has also been lately introduced into the Indian plantations on
                    account of yielding the valuable alkaloid quinidine, as well as quinine, but the
                    last two species have not as yet been grown in sufficient quantities to afford
                    marketable bark.</p>
                <p>The first importation from India took place in 1867, since which time the
                    cultivated bark has arrived in Europe in constantly increasing quantities,
                    London being the chief market for the Indian barks and Amsterdam for those of
                    Java. The principal sales take place in May. In 1876, when Indian calisaya bark
                    first came into the European market, the imports into London were the
                    following:— <hi rend="italic">Cinchona succirubra,</hi> 45,000 tb; <hi
                    rend="italic">C. officinalis,</hi> 20,000 lb; <hi rend="italic">C.
                    Calisaya,</hi> 1000 lb. During the last few years <hi rend="italic">Cinchona
                    Calisaya</hi> has also been cultivated extensively in Bolivia and in Tolima,
                    United States of Colombia, and this bark, which had almost disappeared from
                    commerce, is likely in a few years to again become an available source of
                    quinine.</p>
                <p>In order to obtain the cultivated bark as economically as possible, experiments
                    were made some years ago by Μ‘Ivor and others which resulted in the discovery
                    that, if the bark were removed from the trunks in alternate strips so as not to
                    injure the cambium, or actively growing zone, a new layer of bark was formed in
                    one year which was richer in quinine than the original bark and equal in
                    thickness to that of two or three years’ ordinary growth. This is known in
                    commerce as renewed bark. The process has been found to be most conveniently
                    practised when the trees are eight years old, at which age the bark separates
                    most easily. The yield of quinine has been ascertained to increase annually
                    until the eleventh year, at which it seems to reach its maximum. The portion of
                    the trunk from which the bark has been removed is sometimes protected by moss,
                    and the new bark which forms is then distinguished by the name of mossed bark.
                    The species which yield the largest amount of qui ine are by no means the
                    easiest to cultivate, and experiments have consequently been made in
                    cross-fertilization and grafting with the view of giving vigour of growth to
                    delicate trees yielding a large amount of alkaloid or of increasing the yield in
                    strong growing trees affording but little quinine. Grafting, however, has not
                    been found to answer the purpose, since the stock and the graft have been found
                    to retain their respective alkaloids in the natural proportion just as if
                    growing separately. Hybridization also is very uncertain, and is very difficult
                    to carry out effectually; hence the method of propagating the best varieties by
                    cuttings has been adopted except in the case of those which do not strike
                    readily, as in <hi rend="italic">C. Ledgeriana,</hi> in which the plants are
                    grown from the shoots of felled trees.</p>
                <p>A few years ago it was discovered that a bark imported from the United States of
                    Colombia under the name of cuprea bark, and derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ilemijia pcdunculata, Triana,</hi> and other species, contained quinine to the
                    extent of ⅛ to 2⅜ per cent., and in 1881 this bark was exported in enormous
                    quantities from Santander, exceeding in amount the united importations of all
                    the other cinchona barks; and by reason of its cheapness this has since that
                    date been largely used for the manufacture of quinine.</p>
                <p>The imports of cinchona bark into London in 1884, including cuprea bark, are
                    stated to have been 59,287 bales, into France 9271 bales, and into New York 8150
                    bales.</p>
                <p>Cinchona bark as imported is never uniform in quality. The South-American kinds
                    contain a variable admixture of inferior barks, and the cultivated Indian barks
                    comprise, under the respective names of yellow, pale, and red barks, a number of
                    varieties of unequal value. For this reason a sample from every bale is analysed
                    before the importations are offered for sale.</p>
                <p>The alkaloids are contained, according to Howard, chiefly in the cellular tissue
                    next to the liber. No definite knowledge has as yet been attained of the exact
                    steps by which quinine is formed in nature in the tissues of the bark, nor have
                    the numerous endeavours that have been made to build up quinine artificially or
                    to obtain some idea of its constitution by splitting it up into its component
                    parts been more successful. Nearly all that is known at present lias resulted
                    from analyses of the leaves, bark, and root. From these it appears that quinine
                    is present only in small quantities in the leaves, in larger quantity in the
                    stem bark, and increasing in proportion as it approaches the root, where quinine
                    appears to decrease and cinchonine to increase in amount, although the root bark
                    is generally richer in alkaloids than that of the stem. The altitude at which
                    the trees are grown seems to affect the production of quinine, since it has been
                    proved that the yield of quinine in <hi rend="italic">C. officinalis</hi> is
                    less when the trees are grown below 6000 feet than above that elevation, and
                    that cinchonidine, quinidine, and resin are at the same time increased in
                    amount. It has also been shown by Broughton that <hi rend="italic">C.
                    peruviana,</hi> which yields cinchonine but no quinine at a height of 6000 feet,
                    when grown at 7800 feet gives nearly as much crystallized sulphate of quinine,
                    and almost as readily, as <hi rend="italic">C. officinalis.</hi> Karsten also
                    ascertained by experiments made at Bogota on <hi rend="italic">C.
                    lancifolia</hi> that the barks of one district were sometimes devoid of quinine,
                    while those of the same species from a neighbouring locality yielded 3¾ to 4⅛
                    per cent, of the sulphate; moreover, Dr De Vrij found that the bark of <hi
                    rend="italic">C. officinalis</hi> cultivated at Utakamand varied in the yield of
                    quinine from 1 to 9 per cent. In these eases the variation may have been due to
                    altitude. Free access of air to the tissues also seems to increase the yield of
                    quinine, for the renewed bark is found to contain more quinine than the original
                    bark.</p>
