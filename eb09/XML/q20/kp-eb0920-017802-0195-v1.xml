                    (1580-1645), the greatest satiric writer of Spain, was born in 1580 at Madrid,
                    where his father, who came from the mountains of Burgos, was secretary to Anne
                    of Austria, fourth wife of Philip II. Early left an orphan and without other
                    protection than that of his guardian, D. Agustin de Villanueva, protonotary of
                    Aragon, the young man educated himself and chose his own career. Full of zeal to
                    conquer all knowledge, he betook himself to Alcala, the nearest university to
                    Madrid, where in a few years he covered a vast field of study, acquiring a
                    knowledge of classical and modern tongues—of Italian and French, Hebrew and
                    Arabic, of philosophy (or what passed by that name), theology, civil law, and
                    economics. His masters were astounded at his erudition, and his fame reached
                    beyond Spain; at twenty-one he was in correspondence with Justus Lipsius on
                    questions of Greek and Latin literature, and the great scholar loaded him with
                    praises and treated him as an equal. These years of study left a great and
                    permanent influence on Quevedo’s style; to them are due the pedantic traits and
                    mania for quotations which strike and offend us in most of his works.</p>
                <p>The licentiate of Alcala next betook himself to the court and mingled with the
                    corrupt society that surrounded Philip III., or rather the duke of Lerma, then
                    the real ruler of Spain. The cynical greed of the ministers, the meanness of
                    their flatterers, the corruption of all the royal officers, the financial
                    scandals, the shamelessness of the women, brutalized by the low place given to
                    them in family life and by the practices of a purely formalist religion, formed
                    a spectacle which soon awoke in Quevedo his talent as a painter of manners. At
                    Madrid or at Valladolid, where the court resided from 1601 to 1605, he mingled
                    freely with these intrigues and disorders, and soon lost the purity of his
                    morals, but not his independence, his uprightness and integrity. From this
                    period date his first <hi rend="italic">Dreams (Suenos),</hi> satirical
                    fantasies in which the spirit and manner of Lucian and Dante are combined.
                    “Dream of Skulls,” “The Possessed Alguazil,” “The Stables of Pluto,” “The
                    Madhouse of Love,” such are the titles of these earliest writings composed in
                    1607-8, which in some degree recall the “Dances of Death” of the later Middle
                    Ages; the author is transported in sleep to hell, λvhere he assists at the long
                    and lamentable procession of men of all conditions, professions, and trades who
                    move toward their punishment, clad in their most characteristic vices and
                    absurdities. The series was continued from 1612 to 1622 by “The World as it is”
                    and the “Review of Witticisms.” With the <hi rend="italic">Dreams</hi> may be
                    associated certain works of similar scope and tone, <hi rend="italic">e.g., To
                        every one according to his</hi> JForλs, and <hi rend="italic">Fortune made
                        Reasonable,</hi> where Jupiter in concert with Fortune, whom he has caused
                    to stop her wheel, orders all kinds of men instantly to resume their true nature
                    and the condition they deserve: thus the physician becomes a hangman, the
                    accused a judge, the painted lady a duenna and witch, and so forth.</p>
                <p>In 1609 Quevedo entered into relations with the famous D. Pedro Tellez Giron,
                    duke of Osuna, with whom his fortunes were linked for more than ten years. The
                    duke, celebrated for his bold enterprises of war against the Queen of the
                    Adriatic, for his share in the conspiracy of Venice in 1618, for the luxurious
                    splendour of his viceregal rule in Sicily and Naples, and finally for his
                    terrible disgrace, recognized Quevedo’s unusual merits and made him his
                    secretary. Thus between 1611 and 1620 he learned politics,—the one science which
                    he had perhaps till then neglected,—initiated himself into the questions that
                    divided Europe, and penetrated the designs and ambitions of the neighbours of
                    Spain as well as the secret history of the guilty intriguers protected by the
                    favour of Philip III. The result was that he wrote several political works,
                    particularly a lengthy treatise, <hi rend="italic">The Policy of God and the
                        Government of Christ,</hi> in which he lays down the duties of kings by
                    displaying to them how Christ has governed His church. The disgrace of the duke
                    of Osuna (1620) reached Quevedo, who was arrested and exiled to La Torre de Juan
                    Abad in New Castile, where he possessed lands and of which he afterwards became
                    seignior. Quevedo, though involved in the process against the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n196/mode/1up"

                <p>duke, remained faithful to him in his misfortunes, and bore exile and prison with
                    resignation. On the death of Philip III. (31st March 1621), he recommended
                    himself to the first minister of the new king by celebrating his accession to
                    power and saluting him as the vindicator of public morality in an elegant
                    epistle, in the style of Juvenal, on <hi rend="italic">The Present Habits of the
                        Spaniards.</hi> Olivares recalled him from his exile and gave him a charge
                    in the palace, and from this time Quevedo resided almost constantly at court,
                    where he acquired a position of great weight, only comparable to that of
                    Voltaire in the France of last century. Like Voltaire, he became a sort of
                    oracle, and exercised in Spain a kind of political and literary jurisdiction due
                    to his varied relations and knowledge, but especially to his biting and
                    unbridled wit, which had no respect of persons and laid bare every sore. General
                    politics, social economy, war, finance, literary and religious questions, all
                    fell under his dissecting knife, and he had a dissertation, a pamphlet, or a
                    song for everything. One day he is defending St James, the sole patron of Spain,
                    against a powerful coterie that wished to associate St Teresa with him, and
                    meeting these antagonists with the vehemence of a warm patriot and the learning
                    of a professional theologian; next day he is writing against the duke of Savoy,
                    the hidden enemy of Spain, or against the measures taken to change the value of
                    the currency; or once more he is engaged with the literary school of Gongora,
                    whose affectations and designed obscurity of style seem to him to sin against
                    the genius of the Castilian tongue. And in the midst of this incessant
                    controversy on every possible subject he finds time to compose a comic romance,
                        <hi rend="italic">Don Pablo of Segovia</hi> (1626),—a masterpiece of
                    sparkling verve and fun, which admirably continues the series of <hi
                        rend="italic">Lazarillo de Tormes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Guzman de
                        Alfarache,—</hi> to pen a dissertation on <hi rend="italic">The Constancy
                        and Patience of Job</hi> (1631), to translate St Francis de Sales and
                    Seneca, to compose thousands of verses, and to correspond with Spanish and
                    foreign scholars.</p>
                <p>But Quevedo was not to maintain unscathed the high position won by his knowledge,
                    talent, and biting wit. The government of Olivares, which he had welcomed as the
                    dawn of a political and social regeneration, made things worse instead of
                    better, committed fault upon fault, and led the country to ruin. Quevedo saw
                    this and could not hold his peace. An anonymous petition in verse enumerating to
                    the king in strong terms the grievances of his subjects was found in the early
                    part of December 1639 under the very napkin of Philip IV. It was shown to
                    Olivares, who exclaimed, “I am ruined”; but before his fall he sought vengeance
                    on the libeller. His suspicions fell on Quevedo, who had enemies glad to confirm
                    them. Quevedo was arrested on December 7, and carried under a strong escort to
                    the neighbouring convent of Leon, where he was kept in rigorous confinement till
                    the fall of the minister (23d January 1643) restored him to light and freedom,
                    but not to the health which he had lost in his dungeon. He had little more than
                    two years to live, and these were spent in inactive retreat, first at La Torre
                    de Juan Abad, and then at the neighbouring Villanueva de los Infantes, where he
                    died September 8, 1645.</p>
                <p>Quevedo was of middle height, with black, somewhat crisp hair, a very fair
                    complexion, a broad forehead, and very sharp eyes always furnished with
                    spectacles. The upper part of his body was well built but the lower part
                    deformed: he limped, and his feet turned inwards. Though of very dissolute
                    manners, he loved study most, and lived surrounded by books. He had a table on
                    wheels for reading in bed and a stand that enabled him to read at table. His
                    conversation, as one might guess from his books, was sparkling, full of
                    unexpected turns and slyness, and many bon-mots are ascribed to him. A few days
                    before his death, as he was about to dictate his last will, the curate who
                    attested it invited him to assign a sum for music at his funeral. “Music !” said
                    the dying man; “let those who hear it pay for that.”</p>
                <p>As a satirist and humorist Quevedo stands in the first rank of Spanish writers;
                    his other literary work does not count for much. I. I. Chifflet, in a letter of
                    February 2, 1629, calls him “a very learned man to be a Spaniard,” and indeed
                    his erudition was of a solid kind, but he merits attention not as a humanist,
                    philosopher, and moralist, but as the keen polemic writer, the pitiless mocker,
                    the profound observer of all that is wicked and absurd in human nature, and at
                    the same time as a finished master of style and of all the secrets of the
                    Spanish tongue. His style indeed is not absolutely pure, and already belongs to
                    the period of decadence. Quevedo, who ridiculed so well the bad taste of
                    “cultism,” fell himself into another fault and created the style called
                    “conceptism,” which hunts after ambiguous expressions and “double entendres.”
                    But, though involved and overcharged with ideas, his style is of singular force
                    and originality; after Cervantes he is the greatest Spanish writer of the 17th
                    century.</p>
                <p>There is an excellent collected edition of Quevedo’s prose works with a good life
                    of the author by D. Aureliano Fernandez-Guerra <hi rend="italic">(Bibl.
                        Ribadeneyra,</hi> vols, xxiii. and xlviii.); his poetical works in vol. lxix
                    of the same collection are badly edited by D. Florenzio Ianer. (A. M.-F.)</p>
