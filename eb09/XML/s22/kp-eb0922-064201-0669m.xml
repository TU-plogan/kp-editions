                    criminal procedure, but is not applied universally to all cases of demanding
                    attendance. Thus in the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division the summons is
                    usually, following the civil law, called a “citation,” while a summons to a
                    witness (at least in the superior courts) bears the name of “subpoena,” taken
                    from the initial words of the penal clause in its Latin form. Whatever be the
                    name, the principle of law is invariable, that a court before proceeding to
                    adjudicate should bring before itself by some formal legal process all persons
                    interested in the decision or able to influence the decision by giving evidence
                    as material witnesses. The oral summons, like the oral pleading, seems to have
                    been earlier in time than the written form. In Roman law the oral <hi
                    rend="italic">in jus vocatio</hi> existed centuries before the written <hi
                    rend="italic">libellus conventionis.</hi> The antiquity and importance of the
                    summons as a legal form in England is shown by the presence of the “sompnour,”
                    or summoner of the ecclesiastical court, as one of the characters in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Canterbury Tales,</hi> and by the comparative frequency of
                    “Sumner” as a surname. In civil procedure a summons may be issued either in the
                    High Court or in an inferior court, such as a county court. In the High Court
                    all actions are commenced by writ of summons. In the High Court the summons (in
                    this case not in the form of a writ) is also a convenient mode of determining
                    interlocutory matters by a judge or some other officer of the court— such as a
                    master in the Queen’s Bench Division or a chief clerk in the Chancery
                    Division—without the necessity of bringing the case into court.</p>
                <p>The tendency of recent legislation is towards the increased use of the summons as
                    a mode of presenting a case for decision. For instance, under the Vendor and
                    Purchaser Act, 1874, and the Conveyancing Act, 1881, many important questions,
                    even of title to real property, may be raised on summons. It thus approaches
                    very nearly to <hi rend="smallcaps">Pleading</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.);</hi>
                    in fact, the definition of pleading in the Judicature Act, 1873, s. 100,
                    includes summons. The Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, introduced two new forms
                    of summons,— (1) the general summons for directions, by which several matters
                    may be included in a single summons which before the rules must have been the
                    subject of separate applications; (2) the originating summons in the Chancery
                    Division, by which proceedings may be commenced without writ for certain kinds
                    of relief specified in the rules (see Ord. lv. r. 3). The originating summons to
                    a great extent supersedes the action for administration of a trust or of the
                    estate of a deceased person.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    before its return. A decision on a summons is generally subject to appeal. In
                    the Chancery Division it is customary to adjourn into court the consideration of
                    a summons of more than ordinary importance. The appendix to the Rules of 1883
                    contains forms of every kind of summons in the High Court. In the county courts
                    an action is commenced by plaint and summons. Two kinds of summons are in
                    use,—the ordinary and the default summons. The latter is an optional remedy of
                    the plaintiff in actions for debts or liquidated demands exceeding £5 <hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> and in all actions for the price or hire of goods sold or
                    let to the defendant to be used in the way of his calliug. It may also issue by
                    leave of the judge or registrar in other cases, with the single exception that
                    no leave can be given in claims under <hi rend="italic">£5</hi> where the claim
                    is not for the price or hire of goods sold or let as above, if the affidavit of
                    debt discloses that the defendant is a servant or person engaged in manual
                    labour. The advantage of a default summons is that judgment is entered for the
                    plaintiff without hearing unless the defendant gives notice of defence within a
                    limited time. A default summons must as a rule be served personally on the
                    defendant; an ordinary summons need not be served personally, but may in most
                    cases be delivered to a person at the defendant’s house or place of business. A
                    summons is also issued to a witness in the county court. Forms of summons are
                    given in the County Court Rules, 1886. These include certain special forms used
                    in Admiralty and interpleader actions and in proceedings under the Charitable
                    Trusts Acts, the Friendly Societies Act, 1875, and the Married Women’s Property
                    Act, 1882. In criminal law a summons is the mode of securing the attendance of
                    the defendant before a court of summary jurisdiction, whether it be sought to
                    obtain a conviction or an order against him. Forms of summons to a defendant, a
                    witness, or a surety will be found in the schedule to the Summary Jurisdiction
                    Act, 1848, and in the rules issued in accordance with the Summary Jurisdiction
                    Act, 1879 (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Summary Jurisdiction,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">supra).</hi> Forgery of a summons or use of any document falsely
                    purporting to be a summons or professing to act under such a document is
                    punishable as felony under the County Courts Act, 1846, and the Forgery Act of
                    1861.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> Summons is a term confined in strictness to the
                    commencement of an action in the Court of Session. Formerly it was the mode of
                    commencing an action in the sheriff court, but such an action is now commenced
                    by <hi rend="smallcaps">Petition</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> In some Acts
                    of Parliament, however— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Citation Amendment
                    Acts—the term "summons” is certainly used to denote part of the process of an
                    inferior court. The summons is a writ in the sovereign’s name, signed by a
                    writer to the signet, citing the defender to appear and answer the claim. The
                    will of the summons calls upon the defender to appear on the proper <hi
                    rend="italic">induciae. A</hi> privileged summons is one where the <hi
                    rend="italic">induciae</hi> are shortened to six days against defenders within
                    Scotland (6 Geo. IV. c. 120, s. 53). Defects in the summons are cured by
                    amendment or by a supplementary summons. The summons goes more into detail than
                    the English writ of summons, though it no longer states, as it once did, the
                    grounds of action, now stated in the condescendence and pursuer's pleas in law
                    annexed to the summons. The form of the summons is regulated by 13 and 14 Vict.
                    c. 36, s. 1, and Schedule A. After the action has been set on foot by summons,
                    the attendance of the parties and witnesses is obtained by citation. The
                    Citation Amendment Acts, 1871 and 1882, give additional facilities for the
                    execution of citations in civil cases by means of registered letters. In cases
                    in a court of summary jurisdiction the English summons is represented by the
                    warrant of citation.</p>
