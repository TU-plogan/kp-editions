                <p><label type="entry">SPONGES</label>. The great advance which has been made during
                    the past fifteen years in our knowledge of the sponges is due partly to the
                    vivifying influence of the evolutional hypothesis, but still more to the
                    opportunities afforded by novel methods of technique. To the strength and
                    weakness of the deductive method Haeckel’s work on the <hi rend="italic"

                    Form.</hi><hi rend="italic">Description of a Simple Sponge.—</hi> As an example
                    of one of the simplest known sponges we select <hi rend="italic">Ascetta
                    primordialis</hi> (fig. 1), Haeckel.</p><p>This is a hollow vase-like sac closed
                    at the lower end, by which it is attached, opening above by a comparatively
                    large aperture, the <hi rend="italic">osculum</hi> or vent, and at the sides by
                    numerous smaller apertures or <hi rend="italic">pores,</hi> which perforate the
                    walls. Except for the absence of tentacles and the presence of pores it offers a
                    general resemblance to some simple form of <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoon.</hi>
                    Histologically, however, it presents considerable differences, since, in
                    addition to an endoderm and an ectoderm, a third or mesodermic layer contributes
                    to the structure of the walls; and the endoderm consists of cells (see fig. 21
                    <hi rend="italic">g</hi>) each of which resembles in all essential features
                    those complicated unicellular organisms known as choano-flagellate <hi
                    rend="italic">Infusoria</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Protozoa,</hi> vol. xix.
                    p. 858). With this positive character is associated a negative one: nematocysts
                    are entirely absent. The activity</p></note> is a standing testimony, while the
                    slow but sure progress which accompanies the scientific method is equally
                    illustrated by the works of Schulze <hi rend="italic">(fio),</hi> who by a,
                    masterly application of the new processes has more than any one else
                    reconstructed on a sure basis the general morphology of the sponges. In the
                    general progress the fossil sponges have been involved, and the application of
                    Nicol’s method of studying fossil organisms in thin slices has led, in the hands
                    of Zittel and others (<hi rend="italic">24, 35</hi>), to a complete overthrow of
                    those older classifications which relegated every obscure petrifaction to the
                    fossil sponges and consigned them all to orders no longer existing. But, whilst
                    many problems have been solved, still more have been suggested. An almost
                    endless diversity in details differentiates the sponges into a vast number of
                    specific forms; the exclusive possession in common of a few simple characters
                    closely unites them into a compact group, sharply marked off from the rest of
                    the animal kingdom.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0436-0413"/> of the <hi rend="italic">Ascetta,</hi> as of all
                    sponges, is most obviously manifested, as Grant (<hi rend="italic">5</hi>) first
                    observed, by a rapid outflow of water from the oscule and a gentle instreaming
                    through the pores,—a movement brought about by the energetic action of the
                    flagella of the endodermic cells. The in streaming currents bear with them into
                    the cavity of the sac (paragastric cavity) both protoplasmic particles (such as
                    <hi rend="italic">Infusoria,</hi> diatoms, and other small organisms) and
                    dissolved oxygen, which are ingested by the flagellated cells of the en doderm.
                    The presence of one or more contractile vacuoles in these cells suggests that
                    they extricate water, urea, and car bonic acid. The insoluble re sidue of the
                    introduced food, together with the fluid excreta, is carried out through the os
                    cule by the excurrent water.</p>
                <p>New individuals are produced from the union of ova and spermatozoa, which develop
                    from wandering amoeboid cells in the mesoderm. The walls of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ascetta</hi> are strengthened by calcareous scleres, more especi ally
                    designated as spicules, which have the form of tri-</p>
                <p>radiate needles. If we make abstraction of these we obtain an ideal sponge, which
                    Haeckel has called <hi rend="italic">Olynthus (6),</hi> and which may be
                    regarded as the ancestral form from which all other sponges have been derived.
                    To give greater exactness to our abstraction we should perhaps stipulate for the
                    <hi rend="italic">Olynthus</hi> a somewhat thicker mesoderm and more spherical
                    form than a decalcified Ascon presents.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Canal System.—</hi> We shall now trace the several
                    modifications which the <hi rend="italic">Olynthus</hi> has undergone as
                    expressed in the different types of canal system.</p>
                <p>The simple paragaster of <hi rend="italic">Ascetta</hi> may become complicated in
                    a variety of ways, such as by the budding off from a parent form of stolon-like
                    extensions, which then give rise to fresh individuals, or by the branching of
                    the Ascon sac and the subsequent anastomosis of the branches; but in no case, so
                    long as the sponge remains within the Ascon type, does the endoderm become
                    differentiated into different histological elements. The most interesting
                    modification of the Ascon form occurs in <hi rend="italic">Homoderma
                    sycandra</hi> (<hi rend="italic">12</hi>), in which from the walls of a simple
                    Ascon caecal processes grow out radiately in close regular whorls, each process
                    reproducing the structure of the parent sponge (figs. 2, 3). From this it is but
                    a short step to the important departure which gives rise to the Sycons.</p>
                <p>In the simplest examples of this type the characters of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Homoderma sycandra</hi> are reproduced, with the important exception that the
                    endoderm lining the paragastric cavity of the original Ascon form loses its
                    primitive character, and from a layer of flagellated cells becomes converted
                    into a pavement epithelium, not in any distinguishable feature different from
                    that of the ectoderm. The flagellated cells are thus restricted to the caecal
                    outgrowths or radial tubes. Concurrently with this differentiation of the
                    endoderm a more abundant development of mesoderm occurs. In some Sycons <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sycaltis,</hi> Hk.) the radial tubes remain separate and free; in
                    others they lie close together and are united by trabeculae, or by a trabecular
                    network, consisting of mesodermic strands surrounded by ectoderm (fig. 4). The
                    spaces between the contiguous radial tubes thus become converted into narrow
                    canals, through which water passes from the exterior to enter the pores in the
                    walls of the radial tubes. These canals are the “intercanals” of Haeckel, now
                    generally known by their older name of <hi rend="italic">incurrent</hi> canals.
                    The openings of the incurrent canals to the exterior are called pores, a term
                    which we have also applied to the openings which lead directly into the radial
                    tubes or paragastric cavity; to avoid ambiguity we shall for the future
                    distinguish the latter kind of opening as a <hi rend="italic">prosopyle.</hi>
                    The term “pore” will then be restricted to the sense in which it was originally
                    used by</p>
                <p>Grant. The mouth by which a radial tube opens into the paragaster is known as a
                    <hi rend="italic">gastric ostium.</hi> In the higher forms of Sycons the radial
                    tubes no longer arise as simple outgrowths of the whole sponge-wall, but rather
                    as outgrowths<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n437/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0437-0414"/> of the endoderm into the mesoderm, which,
                    together with the ectoderm, exhibits an independent growth of its own; and this
                    results in the formation of a thick investment, known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cortex</hi> (fig. 5), to the whole exterior of the sponge. The radial tubes may
                    branch, <hi rend="italic">Heteropegma</hi> (fig. 4). If the branches are given
                    off regularly, as the radial tubes were in the first plan, and if at the same
                    time the original radial tube exchanges its flagellated for a pavement
                    epithelium, a structure as shown in fig. 6 <hi rend="italic">(Polejna</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">connexiva,</hi> Pol.) will result. This form might also be brought
                    about by unequal growth of the gastral endoderm leading to a folding of the
                    inner part of the sponge-wall. Very little direct evidence exists as to which of
                    these two plans has actually been followed. Phylogenetically the transition from
                    a simple Ascon to the most complicated Sycon can be traced step by step; and
                    ontogeny shows that such a Sycon form as <hi rend="italic">Grantia raphanus</hi>
                    passes through an Ascon phase in the course of its larval development.</p>
                <p>Returning to the ancestral form of sponge, <hi rend="italic">Olynthus,</hi> let
                    us conceive the endoderm growing out into a number of approximately spherical
                    chambers, each of which communicates with the exterior by a prosopyle and with
                    the paragastric cavity by a comparatively large aperture, which we may term for
                    distinction an <hi rend="italic">apopyle</hi>; at the same time let the endoderm
                    lose its flagellated character and become converted into a pavement epithelium,
                    except in the spherical chambers. Such a form, called by Haeckel “dyssycus,” may
                    be more briefly named a <hi rend="italic">Rhagon</hi> from the grape-like form
                    of its flagellated chambers, which differ from those of a Sycon both by their
                    form and their smaller dimensions. The Rhagon occurs as a stage in the early
                    development of <hi rend="italic">Plakina monolopha</hi> (Schulze) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Reniera fertilis</hi> (<hi rend="italic">9</hi>) (fig. 7); a
                    calcareous sponge which appears to approach it somewhat is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leucopsis pedunculata,</hi> Lfd. By the folding of the wall of a Rhagon, or by
                    its outgrowth into lobes, a complicated structure such as that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Plakina monolopha (20)</hi> (see fig. 26 <hi rend="italic">f</hi>)
                    results. This is characterized by the chambers retaining their immediate
                    communication with the incurrent and excurrent canals, opening into the latter
                    by the widely open apopyle and receiving the former by one or several
                    prosopyles. This may be termed the <hi rend="italic">eury-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pylous</hi> type of Rhagon canal system. The fold ing of the sponge-wall may be
                    simple, as in the example given, or too complex to unravel. In higher forms of
                    sponges <hi rend="italic">(Geodinidae, Stellettidge)</hi> the chambers cease to
                    open abruptly into the excurrent canals: each is prolonged into a narrow canal,
                    <hi rend="italic">aphodus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">abitus,</hi> which usually
                    directly, sometimes after uniting with one or more of its fellows, opens into an
                    excurrent canal. The prosopyles, now restrict ed to one for each chamber, may
                    remain unchanged in character, or at the most be prolonged into very short<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n438/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0438-0415"/> tubes, each a <hi rend="italic">prosodus</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">aditus</hi> (fig. 8). This may be termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >aphodal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">racemose</hi> type of Rhagon system, since
                    the chambers at the ends of the aphodi radiating from the excurrent canal look
                    like grapes on a bunch. As Haeckel, however, has used “racemose” in a different
                    sense, we shall adopt here the alternative term. By the extension of the
                    prosodal or adital canals into long tubes a still higher differentiation is
                    reached (fig. 9). This, which from the marked presence of both prosodal and
                    aphodal canals may be termed the <hi rend="italic">diplodal</hi> type of the
                    Rhagon canal system, occurs but rarely. <hi rend="italic">Chondrosia</hi> is an
                    example.</p>
                <p>The following scheme will render clear the foregoing distinctions :—</p>
                <p>1. Ascon type: simple, ex. <hi rend="italic">Ascetta,</hi> Hk.; strobiloid, ex.
                    <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi><hi rend="italic">derma,</hi> Lfd.</p>
                <p>2. Sycon type: simple radial tubes, ex. <hi rend="italic">Sycetta,</hi> Hk.;
                    branched radial tubes (cylindrical chambers), ex. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heteropegma,</hi> Fl.; chamber-layer folded, ex. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polejna,</hi> Pol.</p>
                <p>3. Rhagon type: eurypylous, with several prosopyles to each chamber, ex. <hi
                    rend="italic">Spοngelia;</hi> with a single prosopyle to each chamber, ex. <hi
                    rend="italic">Oscarella, Thenea</hi>; aphodal, aphodal canals well developed,
                    ex. <hi rend="italic">Geodia,</hi> Lmk.; diplodal, with both aphodal and
                    prosodal canals well developed, ex. <hi rend="italic">Chondrosia,</hi> O.S.</p>
                <p>In the case of the calcareous sponges Polejaeff has argued forcibly that the
                    eurypylous type arises directly from the Sycon and not from the Rhagon. It is
                    therefore doubtful how far the Rhagon in other sponges is a primitive form
                    derived directly from an <hi rend="italic">Olynthus,</hi> or whether it may not
                    be a secondary larval state resulting from the abbreviated development of a
                    former Sycon predecessor. Whatever may have been its past history, the Rhagon
                    serves now at all events as a starting-point for the development of the higher
                    forms of canal system.</p>
                <p>In the higher Rhagons, as in the Sycons, further complications ensue, owing to an
                    independent growth of the external ectoderm and the adjacent mesoderm. While the
                    endoderm, with its associated mesoderm, is growing out or folding to form the
                    excurrent canal system, the superficial mesoderm increases in thickness, and the
                    ectoderm, extending laterally from the sides of the incurrent sinuses, burrows
                    into it, parallel to the surface of the sponge. Thus it forms beneath the skin
                    (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the layer of superficial mesoderm and investing
                    ectoderm) cavities which may be either simple and spacious or be broken up into
                    a number of labyrinthine passages by a network of mesoblastic strands (invested
                    with ectoderm) which extend irregularly from roof to floor of the chamber. These
                    cavities are known as <hi rend="italic">subdermal chambers.</hi></p>
                <p>With the appearance of subdermal chambers the sponge becomes differentiated into
                    two almost independent regions, an outer or <hi rend="italic">ectosome</hi> and
                    an inner or <hi rend="italic">choanosome,</hi> which is characterized by the
                    presence of flagellated chambers. The ectosome forms the roof and walls of the
                    subdermal chambers, and is in its simplest form merely an investing skin; but in
                    a large number of sponges it acquires considerable thickness and a very
                    complicated histological structure. It is then known as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >cortex.</hi> The thickening which gives rise to a cortex takes place chiefly
                    beneath those parts of the skin which are not furnished with pores. Beneath the
                    pores—in this case collected into sieve-like areas—dome-like cavities are left
                    in the cortex; they open freely into the subdermal cavities below and their roof
                    is formed by the cribriform pore membrane above. In many sponges <hi
                    rend="italic">(Geodia, Stelletta)</hi> the cortical domes are constricted near
                    their communication with the subdermal cavity (subcortical crypt) by a
                    transverse muscular sphincter, which defines an outer division or <hi
                    rend="italic">ectochone</hi> from an inner or <hi rend="italic">endochone</hi>
                    (fig. 10), the whole structure being a <hi rend="italic">chone.</hi> The
                    endochone is frequently absent (fig. 10). The early development of the cortex
                    has scarcely yet been studied. In <hi rend="italic">Stelletta phrissens</hi>
                    (Soll.), one of the “Challenger” <hi rend="italic">Stel</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lettidae,</hi> an early form of the sponge (fig. ll), shows the choanosome
                    already characteristically folded within the cortex, which forms a com plete
                    not-folded envelope around it. The roots of the incurrent sinuses form widely
                    open spaces imme diately beneath the cortex and are the rudiments of subcortical
                    crypts. Again, in some sponges a part of the endoderm and asso ciated mesoderm
                    may like wise develop independ ently of the rest of the sponge, as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hexac</hi><hi rend="italic">tinellida,</hi> where the choa nosome
                    forms a middle layer between a reticulation of ectosome on the one side and of
                    endoderm and mesoderm, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., <hi rend="italic"
                    >endo</hi><hi rend="italic">some,</hi> on the other. Fin ally, the attached or
                    lower half of a Rhagon may de velop in an altogether dif ferent manner from the
                    other or upper half, the endoderm not producing any flagellated chambers. In
                    this case the upper portion alone is characterized by the flagellated chambers,
                    which are the distinctive mark of a sponge, and hence may be called the <hi
                    rend="italic">spongomere</hi>; the lower half, which consists of all three
                    fundamental layers, may be called the <hi rend="italic">hypomere.</hi></p>
                <p>The form and general composition of sponges are exceedingly various and often
                    difficult to analyse, presenting, along with some important differences, a
                    remarkable general resemblance to the <hi rend="italic">Coelentera</hi> in these
                    respects. Like them, some sponges are simple, and others, through asexual
                    multiplication, compound. The only criterion by which the individual sponge can
                    be recognized is the osculum; and, as it is frequently difficult, and in many
                    cases impossible, to distinguish this from the gastric opening of a large
                    excurrent canal, there are many cases in which the simple or compound nature of
                    the sponge must remain open to doubt. The oscule may also fail <hi rend="italic"
                    >(lipostomosis),</hi> and so may the paragastric cavity <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fipogastrosis);</hi> the problem then becomes insoluble. The loss of the
                    oscule<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n439/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0439-0416"/> may in some cases be due to the continued growth
                    of several endodermal folds towards the exterior, with a corresponding
                    absorption of the mesoderm and ectoderm which lie in the way, till the folds
                    penetrate to the ectoderm and open at the exterior, thus giving rise to
                    excurrent openings, which are not readily distinguishable from pores. At the
                    same time the original osculum closes up and entirely disappears. Lipogastrosis,
                    on the other hand, may be produced by the growing together of the roots of the
                    choanosomal folds, thus reducing the paragastric cavity to a labyrinth of
                    canals, which may easily be confounded with the usual form of excurrent canals.
                    While in some sponges the original oscule is lost, in others secondary
                    independent openings, deceptively like oscules, are added. This pseudostomosis
                    is due to a folding of the entire sponge, so as to produce secondary canals or
                    cavities, which may be incurrent (<hi rend="italic">vestibular)</hi> or
                    excurrent <hi rend="italic">{cloacal),</hi> the opening of the latter to the
                    exterior being termed a <hi rend="italic">false oscule</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pseudostome.</hi> The faulty use of the term oscule for what is neither
                    functionally nor morphologically a mouth is here obvious, for in one sense the
                    oscule is always a pseudostome; it would be better if the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >pseudoproct</hi> could be substituted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Skeleton.—</hi> All sponges, except three or four genera
                    belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Myxospongiae,</hi> possess some kind of
                    skeletal structures. They may be either calcareous or silicious or horny
                    scleres, the latter usually having the form of fibres, which sometimes enclose
                    silicious needles (spicules) or foreign bodies introduced from without. Foreign
                    bodies also contribute to the formation of the skeleton of some silicious
                    sponges, and occasionally form the entire skeleton, no other hard parts being
                    present.</p>
                <p>Mineral scleres usually occur in the form of spicules. The spicules of calcareous
                    sponges consist of carbonate of lime, having the crystalline structure and other
                    properties of calcite (<hi rend="italic">29</hi>). Each spicule, so far as its
                    mineral component is concerned, is a single crystal, all the molecules of
                    calcite of which it is built up being similarly oriented. On the other hand, its
                    form and general structure are purely organic. Its surfaces are always curved,
                    and usually it has the form of a cone or combination of cones, each of which
                    consists of concentric layers of calcite surrounding an axial fibre of organic
                    matter,—probably of the same nature as spongiolin or spongin, the chief
                    constituent of the fibres of horny sponges. A thin layer of organic matter,
                    known as the <hi rend="italic">spicule sheath,</hi> forms an outer investment to
                    the spicule and is best rendered visible as a residue by removing the calcite
                    with weak acid. Silicious spicules consist of colloid silica or opal, and hence
                    can be distinguished from calcareous by having no influence upon polarized
                    light. Structurally the two kinds of spicules present no important difference.
                    The spicules of different sponges differ greatly both in form and in size. They
                    may be conveniently divided into two groups,—minute or flesh spicules, which
                    usually serve as the support of a single cell only <hi rend="italic"
                    >{microscleres),</hi> and larger or skeletal spicules, which usually contribute
                    to the formation of a more or less consistent skeleton <hi rend="italic"
                    >{megascleres).</hi> The distinction is not one that can be exactly defined, and
                    must so far be regarded as of a provisional nature. There is usually but little
                    difficulty in applying it in practice, except in some doubtful cases where large
                    spicules do not form a continuous skeleton, or in others where flesh spicules
                    appear to be passing into those of larger size. It is indeed highly probable
                    that all large spicules have originated from flesh spicules (<hi rend="italic"
                    >12</hi>).</p>

                    the same axis. It is therefore uniaxial and equibiradiate (fig. 12 <hi

                    are with difficulty distinguished from the stylus, which is usually pointed at

                    rhabdus, but one of the most frequent occurrence, is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >triaene</hi>; in this form one ray of a rhabdus ends in three branches, which
                    diverge at equal angles from each other. The rhabdus then becomes known as the
                    shaft or <hi rend="italic">rhabdome,</hi> and the secondary rays are the arms or

                    >cladome</hi> of the spicule. The arms make different angles with the shaft:
                    when recurved a grapnel or <hi rend="italic">anatmaene</hi> is produced (fig. 13
                    <hi rend="italic">k),</hi> when projecting forwards a <hi rend="italic"

                    lamellae, or unite to form a disk, the triaene character of which is indicated
                    by the included axial fibre. The shaft may also become trifid at both ends, <hi
                    rend="italic">arnphitriaene</hi> (fig. 13 <hi rend="italic">p),</hi> and the
                    resulting rays all bifurcate, or the cladome may arise from the centre of the
                    rhabdome, <hi rend="italic">eentrotriaene</hi> (fig. 13 <hi rend="italic"

                    >{Rhabdocrepida)</hi> the normal growth of a strongyle is arrested at an early

                    in such a manner as to produce a very irregularly branching sclere or desma
                    (fig. 13 <hi rend="italic">s</hi>), within which the fundamental strongyle can
                    be seen enclosed. In such a desma no axial fibre besides that of the enclosed
                    strongyle is formed.</p>
                <p>The chief modification of the triradiate spicule is due to an elongation of one

                    triradiate. The angle included by the basal rays is usually over 120° (fig. 14
                    <hi rend="italic">a).</hi></p>
                <p>Some or all of the rays of the primitive calthrops (fig. 14 <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi>) may subdivide into a number of terminal spines <hi rend="italic"
                    >candelabra</hi> (fig. 14 <hi rend="italic">c</hi>); or some or all of them may
                    bifurcate once or twice and finally terminate by subdividing into numerous
                    variously shaped processes; such a <hi rend="italic">tctracladine</hi> desma
                    (fig. 14 <hi rend="italic">e)</hi> characterizes one division of the Lithistid
                    sponges.</p>
                <p>By the excess or defect of one or more rays a series of forms such as are
                    represented in fig. 15 arise. In the oxea, which results from the suppression of
                    all rays but two, the Sexradiate character is sometimes preserved by the axial
                    fibre, which gives off two or four processes in the middle of the spicule where
                    the defective arms would arise. Let fig. 12 <hi rend="italic">e</hi> represent a
                    regular Sexradiate spicule with its four horizontal arms extended beneath the
                    dermis of its sponge; the over-development of the proximal ray and a reduction
                    of the distal ray produce a form known as the <hi rend="italic">dagger</hi>
                    (fig. 15 <hi rend="italic">a</hi>); the suppression of the proximal ray and the
                    development of spines projecting forwards on the distal ray produce the <hi
                    rend="italic">pinnulus</hi> (fig. 15 <hi rend="italic">b, c</hi>); the
                    suppression of both proximal and distal rays gives the <hi rend="italic"
                    >staurus</hi> (fig. 15 <hi rend="italic">f</hi>), and the suppression of two of
                    the remaining horizontal rays a dermal rhabdus (fig. 15 <hi rend="italic"
                    >g).</hi> The suppression of a distal ray, excessive development of a proximal
                    ray, and recurved growth of the remaining rays produce an <hi rend="italic"
                    >anchor.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Hyalonema</hi> (glass rope sponge) anchors
                    over a foot long occur, but their arms or teeth are not restricted to four, and
                    the axial fibre gives off its processes before reaching the head of the spicule.
                    Such a grapnel helps to support the sponge in the ooze of the sea-bed. Other
                    characteristic spicules belonging to sponges distinguished by Sexradiate
                    spicules are the following :—the <hi rend="italic">uncinaria</hi> (fig. 16 <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>), a spinose oxea with the spines all pointing one way; the

                    (fig. 16 <hi rend="italic">c</hi>), a besom-shaped spicule with tylotate rays,

                    (fig. 15 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>), a shaft terminating at each end in a number
                    of recurved rays. When the Sexradiate spicules of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hexactinellida</hi> unite together in a manner to be described later, the rays
                    may be bent in a variety of ways out of the triaxial type, so that the

                    characteristic of the family <hi rend="italic">Geodinidae,</hi> the rays are
                    almost infinite in number, and coalesced for the greater part of their length;
                    the distal ends, however, remain separate, and, becoming slightly tylotate, are
                    produced into four or five recurved spines, which give attachment to connective
                    tissue fibres by which adjacent sterrasters are united together.</p>
                <p>In one aberrant group of Lithistid sponges (<hi rend="italic">Anomocladina)</hi>
                    the skeleton is formed of desmas, which are multiradiate, each presenting a
                    massive centrum (with an included cavity) produced into a variable number (4 to
                    8) of rays, which rays terminate in expanded ends (fig. 12 <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It is doubtful whether a distinction between megascleres and microscleres can be
                    maintained in the calcareous sponges, unless the minute oxeas which occur in <hi
                    rend="italic">Eilhardia sehulzei,</hi> Pol. (<hi rend="italic">16</hi>), are to
                    be referred to this group. They are widely distributed throughout the silicious
                    sponges, and by their different forms afford characters of the highest
                    importance in classification.</p>
                <p>One of the simplest forms is the <hi rend="italic">sigmaspire</hi> (fig. 17 <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>, <hi rend="italic">b</hi>); it looks like the letter C or
                    S, according to the direction in which it is viewed, its actual form being that
                    of a single turn of a cylindrical spiral. A turn and a part of a turn of a
                    spiral of somewhat higher pitch than that of a sigmaspire gives the <hi
                    rend="italic">toxaspire</hi> (fig. 17 <hi rend="italic">c</hi>); a continued
                    spiral growth through several revolutions gives the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pοlyspire.</hi> The sigmaspire becoming spined produces the <hi rend="italic"
                    >spiraster</hi> or <hi rend="italic">spinispirula</hi> (fig. 17 <hi
                    rend="italic">d)</hi>; this, by losing its curvature, becomes the <hi
                    rend="italic">sanidaster</hi> (fig. 17 <hi rend="italic">e),</hi> and by
                    simultaneous concentration of its spines into a whorl at each end, the <hi
                    rend="italic">amphiaster</hi> (fig. 17 <hi rend="italic">f</hi>). By reduction
                    of the spire the spiraster passes into the <hi rend="italic">stellate</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">aster</hi> (fig. 17 <hi rend="italic">n</hi>). A thickening
                    about the centre of the aster produces the <hi rend="italic">sρheraster</hi>
                    (fig. 17 <hi rend="italic">m),</hi> allied to which is the sterraster. By a
                    reduction in the number of its rays the aster becomes a minute calthrops, from
                    which, by increased growth, the skeletal calthrops may very well be derived; by
                    further reduction to two rays a little rhabdus or microrabd results, and of this
                    numerous varieties exist, of which the oxeate microrabd is the most interesting,
                    since it only differs in size from the commonest of all skeletal spicules, the
                    oxeate or acerate rhabdus. The sigmaspire is formed as a superficial spiral
                    thickening in the wall of a spicule cell or scleroblast; as superficial deposits
                    also the next group of spicules, the so-called <hi rend="italic"

                    round it a broad meridional band, interrupted only on one side, for 30° above
                    and below the equator; this will represent a truly C-shaped spicule, which
                    differs from a sigmaspire by the absence of spiral, twist. It may be termed a

                    in concentric coatings around an axial fibre, forms within the scleroblast a

                    17 <hi rend="italic">m)</hi> or twisted. The trichite sheaf may be regarded as a

                <p>Spongin is a horny substance, most similar to silk in chemical composition, from
                    which it differs in being insoluble in an ammoniacal solution of copper sulphate
                    (cuproso-ammonium sulphate). In <hi rend="italic">Darwinella aurea,</hi> F.
                    Müller, it occurs in forms somewhat resembling tri-, quadri-, and sex-radiate
                    spicules. But usually the spongin skeleton takes the form of fibres, consisting
                    of a central core of soft granular substance around which the spongin is
                    disposed in concentric layers, forming a hollow cylinder (fig. 23 <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi>). The relative diameters of the soft core and of the
                    spongin cylinder differ greatly in different sponges. The fibres branch so as to
                    form antler-like twigs or bushy tree-like growths, or anastomose to form a
                    continuous network, as in the bath sponge <hi rend="italic">(Euspongia
                    officinalis).</hi> The detailed characters of the network differ with the
                    species, and are useful in classification. In <hi rend="italic">Ianthella</hi>
                    certain cells (sponginblasts) become included between the successive layers of
                    the spongin cylinder, and their deep violet colour, contrasting with the amber
                    tint of the spongin, renders them very conspicuous.</p>
                <p>In some sponges the scleres are simply scattered through the mesoderm and do not
                    give rise to a continuous skeleton,— <hi rend="italic">Corticium, Chondrillα,
                    Thrombus.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Cαlcαreα</hi> and many silicious sponges
                    they are dispersed through the mesoderm, but so numerously that by the
                    overlapping of their rays a loosely felted skeleton is produced. In the
                    calcareous sponges the spicules are frequently regularly disposed; and in the
                    Sycons in particular a definite arrangement, on two plans, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >articulate</hi> and <hi rend="italic">inarticulate,</hi> can be traced in the
                    skeleton of the radial tubes. On the latter plan the triradiate or quadriradiate
                    spicules, the apical rays of which are of considerable length, are arranged in
                    two sets, one having the basal rays lying in the mesoderm of the paragastral
                    wall and the other with the corresponding rays in the dermal mesoderm. The
                    apical rays of each set lie in the mesoderm of the radial tubes parallel to
                    their length, but pointing in opposite directions (fig. 18 <hi rend="italic"
                    >b).</hi> In the articulate division numerous spicules, small in comparison with
                    the size of the radial tubes, form a series of rows round the tubes, their basal
                    rays lying parallel to the paragastric surface and the apical pointing towards
                    the ends of the radial tubes (fig. 18 <hi rend="italic">a).</hi></p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Silicispongia</hi> sheaves of long oxeate spicules
                    radiate from the base of the sponge if of a plate-like form, or from the centre
                    if globular, and extend to the surface. If triaenes are present their arms
                    usually extend within the mesoderm immediately below the dermal surface (fig.
                    19). Single spicules reach from centre to surface only in small sponges. As the
                    sponge increases in size the spicules must either correspondingly lengthen, or
                    fresh spicules must be added, if a continuous skeleton is to be formed. The
                    latter is the plan fol lowed in fact: the ad ditional spicules over lap the ends
                    of those first formed like the fusiform cells in a woody fibre. With the
                    formation of a fibre, often strengthened by spongin or bound to gether with
                    connective tissue, there appears to be a tendency for the constituent spicules
                    to diminish in size, and the length of each in <hi rend="italic">the most
                    markedly fibrous sponges is insignificant when compared with the length of the
                    fibre. The spicular fibre thus formed may be simple or echinated by spicules
                    either similar to those which form its mass or different. More usually they are
                    different, and generally styles, often spinose about their origin. The spongin
                    which sometimes cements together the spicules of a fibre may progressively
                    increase in quantity and the spicules diminish in number, till a horny fibre
                    containing one or more rows of small oxeas results. In an echinated fibre the
                    axial spicules may disappear and the echinating spicules persist. Finally all
                    spicules may be suppressed and the horny fibre of the Ceratose sponges results.
                    The horny fibres may next acquire the habit of embedding foreign bodies in their
                    substance, though foreign enclosures are not confined to the</hi> Ceratosa <hi
                    rend="italic">but occur in some</hi> Silici-spongiae <hi rend="italic">as well.
                    The included foreign bodies may increase in quantity out of all proportion to
                    the horny fibres; and finally the skeleton may consist of them alone, all
                    spongin matter having disappeared.</hi></p>
                <p>In the Lithistid sponges a skeleton is produced by the articulation of desmas
                    into a network. The rays of the desmas (figs. 12 <hi rend="italic">f</hi>, 13
                    <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> 14 <hi rend="italic">e)</hi> terminate in apophyses,
                    which apply themselves to some part of adjacent desmas, either to the centrum,
                    shaft, arms, or similar apophyses, and then, growing round them like a saddle on
                    a horse’s back, clasp them firmly without anchylosis. Thus they give rise to a
                    rigid network, in conjunction with which fibres composed of rhabdus spicules may
                    exist. In the <hi rend="italic">Hexactinellida</hi> both spicular felts and
                    fibres occur, and in one division <hi rend="italic">(Dictyonina)</hi> a rigid
                    network is produced, not, however, by a mere clasping of apophyses, but by a
                    true fusion. The rays of adjacent spicules overlap and a common investment of
                    silica grows over them.</p>

                    this membrane enables us readily to distinguish the excurrent from the incurrent
                    face of the chamber, since its convex surface is always turned towards the
                    prosopyle. In sponges with an aphodal canal system the flagellated chambers
                    usually pass gradually into the aphodal canal, but the incurrent canal enters
                    abruptly. This abrupt termination of the incurrent canal appears to mark the
                    termination of the ectoderm and the commencement of the endoderm. The
                    flagellated chambers differ greatly in size in different sponges, and evidently
                    manifest a tendency to become smaller as the canal system increases in
                    complexity; thus Sycon are always larger than Rhagon chambers, and eurypylous
                    than aphodal Rhagon chambers. In most sponges except the Ascons the mesoderm is
                    largely developed, and in many it undergoes a highly complex histological
                    differentiation. In its commonest and simplest form it consists of a clear,
                    colourless, gelatinous matrix in which irregularly branching stellate cells or
                    connective tissue corpuscles are embedded; these may be termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >collencytes</hi> (fig. 21 <hi rend="italic">a)</hi> and the tissue <hi
                    rend="italic">collen-chyme.</hi> In the higher sponges <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Geodia, Stelletta)</hi> it consists of small polygonal granular cells either
                    closely contiguous or separated by a very small quantity of structureless jelly,
                    and in this form may be termed <hi rend="italic">sarcenchyme</hi> (fig. 20).
                    Collenchyme does not originate through the transformation of sarcenchyme, as one
                    might expect, for it precedes the latter in development. Schulze (<hi

                    the gelatinous tissue which forms the chief part of the umbrella of

                    of the flagellated chambers in the bath sponge, the granules becoming more
                    numerous in sponges in which the canal system acquires a higher differentiation,
                    till at length the collencytes are concealed by them. According to this view,
                    sarcenchyme would appear to originate from a densely granular collenchyme.

                    different purposes: some appear to act as carriers of nourishment or as
                    scavengers of useless or irritant foreign matter; others may possibly contribute
                    to the formation of higher tissues, some certainly becoming converted into
                    sexual products. Their parentage and early history are unknown.</p>
                <p>A tissue (c <hi rend="italic">ystenchyme)</hi> which in some respects resembles
                    certain forms of vegetable parenchyme occurs in some sponges, particularly <hi
                    rend="italic">Geodinidae</hi> and other <hi rend="italic">Tetractinellida.</hi>
                    It consists of closely adjacent large oval cells, with thin well-defined walls
                    and fluid contents. Somewhere about the middle of the cell is the nucleus with
                    its nucleolus, supported by protoplasm, which extends from it in fine threads to
                    the inner side of the wall, where it spreads out in a thin investing film (fig.
                    21 <hi rend="italic">c</hi>). Cystenchyme very commonly forms a layer just below
                    the skin of some <hi rend="italic">Geodinidae,</hi> particularly of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pachymatisma,</hi> and, as on teasing the cortex of this sponge a
                    large number of refringent fluid globules immiscible with water are set free, it
                    is just possible that it is sometimes a fatty tissue, and if so the contained
                    oil must be soluble in alcohol, for alcoholic preparations show no trace of it.
                    A tissue resembling cartilage, <hi rend="italic">chondrenchyme,</hi> occurs in
                    <hi rend="italic">Corticidae</hi> (fig. 21 <hi rend="italic">b</hi>).</p>
                <p>Connective-tissue cells or <hi rend="italic">desmacytes</hi> are present in most
                    sponges; they are usually long fusiform bodies, consisting of a clear,
                    colourless, often minutely fibrillated sheath, surrounding a highly refringent
                    axial fibre, which stains deeply with reagents (fig. 21 <hi rend="italic"
                    >d).</hi> In other cases the des-macyte is simply a fusiform granular cell, with
                    a nucleus in the interior and a fibrillated appearance towards the ends. The
                    desmacytes are gathered together, their ends overlapping, into fibrous strands
                    or felted sheets, which in the ectosome of some sponges may acquire a
                    considerable thickness, often constituting the greater part of the cortex. The
                    spicules of the sponge often furnish them with a surface of attachment,
                    especially in the <hi rend="italic">Geodinidae,</hi> where each sterraster of
                    the cortex is united to its neighbours by desmacytes, in the manner shown in
                    fig. 10.</p>
                <p>Contractile fibre cells or <hi rend="italic">myocytes</hi> occur in all the
                    higher sponges. They appear to be of more than one kind. Most usually they are
                    fine granular fusiform cells with long filiform terminations, and with an
                    enclosed nucleus and nucleolus (fig. 21 <hi rend="italic">e).</hi> In the
                    majority of sponges both excurrent and incurrent canals are constricted at
                    intervals<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n443/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0443-0420"/> by transverse diaphragms or <hi rend="italic"
                    >vela,</hi> which contain myocytes concentrically and sometimes radiately
                    arranged. The excessive development of myocytes in such a velum gives rise to
                    muscular sphincters such as those which close the chones of many corticate
                    sponges, such as <hi rend="italic">Pachymatisma.</hi> In this sponge, which
                    occurs on the British shores, the function of the oscular sphincters can be
                    readily demonstrated, since irritation of the margin of the oscule is invariably
                    followed after a short interval by a slow closure of the sphincter.</p>
                <p>Supposed sense-cells or <hi rend="italic">aesthacytes</hi> (fig. 22) were first
                    observed by Stewart and have since been described by Von Lendenfeld (<hi
                    rend="italic">12</hi>). According to the latter, they are spindle-shaped cells,
                    0·01 mm. long by 0·002 thick; the distal end projects beyond the ectodermal
                    epithelium in a fine hair or palpocil; the body is granular and contains a large
                    oval nucleus; and the inner end is produced into fine threads, which extend into
                    the collenchyme and are supposed—though this is not proved—to become continuous
                    with large multiradiate collencytes, which Von Lendenfeld regards as multipolar
                    ganglion cells (fig. 22).</p>
                <p>More recently he has described an arrangement of these cells curiously suggestive
                    of a sense-organ. Numerous aesthacytes are collected over a small area, and at
                    their inner ends pass into a granular mass of cells with well-marked nuclei, but
                    with boundaries not so evident; these he regards as ganglion cells. From the
                    sides of the ganglion other slender fusiform cells, which Von Lendenfeld regards
                    as nerves, pass into the mesoderm, running tangentially beneath the skin. The
                    inner end of the ganglion is in communication with a membrane formed of fusiform
                    cells which Von Lendenfeld regards as muscular. If his observations and
                    inferences are confirmed, it is obvious that we have here a complete apparatus
                    for the conversion of external impressions into muscular movements.</p>
                <p>In most sponges a direct connexion can be traced by means of their branching
                    processes between the collencytes of the mesoderm and the cells of the
                    ectodermal and endodermal epithelium and the choanocytes of the flagellated
                    chambers. As the collencytes are also united amongst themselves, they place the
                    various histological constituents of the sponge in true protoplasmic continuity.
                    Hence we may with considerable probability regard the collencytes as furnishing
                    a means for the transmission of impulses: in other words, we may attribute to
                    them a rudimentary nervous function. In this case the modification of some of
                    the collencytes in communication with the ectoderm might readily follow and
                    special aesthacytes arise. Fusiform collencytes perpendicular to the ectoderm,
                    and with one end touching it, are common in a variety of sponges; but it is
                    difficult to trace the inner end into connexion with the stellate collencytes,
                    so that precisely in those cases in which it would be most interesting to find
                    such a connexion absolute proof of it is wanting.</p>
                <p>The colour of sponges usually depends on the presence of cells containing
                    granules of pigment; though dispersed generally through the mesoderm, these
                    cells are most richly developed in the ectosome. Pigment granules also occur in
                    the choanocytes of some sponges,— <hi rend="italic">Oscarella lobularis</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Aplysina aerophoba,</hi> for instance. In the latter the
                    pigment undergoes a remarkable change of colour when the sponge is exposed to
                    the air, and finally fades away. In many cases sponges borrow their colours from
                    parasitic algae (<hi rend="italic">O scillatoria</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hostoc)</hi> with which they are infested. The colours of sponge-pigments are
                    very various. They have been examined by Krukenberg and Merejknovsky.
                    Zoonerythin, a red pigment of the lipochrome series, is one of the most widely
                    diffused; it is regarded as having a respiratory function. Reserve cells or <hi
                    rend="italic">thesocytes</hi> (fig. 21 <hi rend="italic">f</hi>) have been
                    described in several sponges as well as amylin and oil-bearing cells.</p>
                <p>Each spicule of a sponge originates in a single cell (fig. 21 <hi rend="italic"
                    >h-n),</hi> within which it probably remains enclosed until it has completed its
                    full growth; the cell then probably atrophies. During its growth the spicule
                    slowly passes from the interior to the exterior of the sponge, and is finally
                    (in at least some sponges, <hi rend="italic">Geodia, Stelletta)</hi> cast out as
                    an effete product. The sponge is thus constantly producing and disengaging
                    spicules; and in this way we may account for the extraordinary profusion of
                    these structures in some modern marine deposits and in the ancient stratified
                    rocks. Within the latter these deciduous spicules have furnished silica for the
                    formation of flints, which have been produced by a silicious replacement of
                    carbonate of lime (<hi rend="italic">26</hi>) <hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>The horny fibres of the <hi rend="italic">Ceratosa</hi> are produced as a
                    secretion of cells known as <hi rend="italic">sponginblasts,</hi> which surround
                    as a continuous mantle the sides of each growing fibre, and cover in a thick cap
                    each growing point (fig. 23). The lateral sponginblasts are elongated radially
                    to the fibre; the terminal cells are polygonal and depressed. The latter give
                    rise to the soft granular core and the former to the spongin-walls of the fibre.
                    Cells similar to the lateral sponginblasts, and regarded as homologous with
                    them, occur in a single layer just below the outer epithelium of some horny
                    sponges <hi rend="italic">(Aplysilla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dendrilla</hi>)
                    and under certain circumstances secrete a large quantity of slimy mucus (<hi

                <p>By the possession of both sexual elements and a complex histological structure,
                    and in the character of their embryological development, the sponges are clearly
                    separated from the <hi rend="italic">Protozoa</hi>; on the other hand, the
                    choanoflagellate character of the endoderm, which it retains in the flagellated
                    chambers throughout the group without a single exception, as clearly marks them
                    off from the <hi rend="italic">Metazoa.</hi> They may therefore be regarded as a
                    separate phylum derived from the choanoflagellate <hi rend="italic"
                    >Infusoria,</hi> but pursuing for a certain distance a course of development
                    parallel with that of the <hi rend="italic">Metazoa.</hi></p>
                <p>Different views have been propounded by other authors. Savile Kent regards the
                    sponges as <hi rend="italic">Protozoa</hi> (<hi rend="italic">10</hi>); Balfour
                    suggested that they branched off from the Metazoan phylum at a point below the
                    <hi rend="italic">Coelentera,</hi> and considered them as intermediate between
                    <hi rend="italic">Protozoa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Metazoa;</hi> Schulze
                    regards them as derived from a simple ancestral form of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coelentera</hi> (<hi rend="italic">23</hi>); Marshall advocates the view that
                    they are degraded forms derived from Coelenterates which were already in
                    possession of tentacles and mesenteric pouches (<hi rend="italic">14</hi>).</p>
                <p>As a phylum the <hi rend="italic">Spongiae</hi> are certainly divisible into two
                    branches, one including the <hi rend="italic">Calcarea</hi> and the other the
                    remaining sponges, which Vosmaer has termed <hi rend="italic">Non-Calcarea,</hi>
                    and others <hi rend="italic">Plethospongiae.</hi> Since, however, the
                    choanocytes of the <hi rend="italic">Calcarea</hi> are usually, if not
                    universally, larger than those of other sponges, we may make use of this
                    difference in our nomenclature, and distinguish one branch as the <hi

                    absent. Examples: <hi rend="italic">Halisarca,</hi> Duj.; <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Halisarcina</hi> are evidently survivals from an ancient
                    and primitive type. The simplicity of the canal system is opposed to the view
                    that they are degraded forms; we may therefore regard the absence of scleres as
                    a persistent primary and not a secondary acquired character. They are as
                    interesting, therefore, from one point of view (absence of scleres) as the
                    Ascons are from another (undifferentiated endoderm). With the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chondrosina</hi> the case is different; they differ only from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chondrilla</hi> and its allies by the absence of asters; these differ only from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tethyidae</hi> by the absence of strongyloxeas; and we may
                    very reasonably assume that in these three groups we have a series due to loss
                    of characters, the <hi rend="italic">Chondrillae</hi> being reduced <hi
                    rend="italic">Tethyidae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Chondrosina</hi> reduced

                <p>This large sub-class embraces the great majority of existing sponges. Its
                    external boundaries are fairly well defined, its internal divisions much less
                    so, as its various orders and families pass into each other at many points of
                    contact. Although there does not appear to be much resemblance between a
                    Lithistid sponge, such as <hi rend="italic">Theonella,</hi> a Monaxonid such as
                    <hi rend="italic">Amorphina,</hi> and an ordinary "bath” sponge (<hi
                    rend="italic">Euspongia),</hi> yet between these extremes a long series of
                    intermediate forms exists, so nicely graduated as to render their disruption
                    into groups by no means an easy task. If the delimitation of orders is
                    difficult, that of genera is often impossible, so that they are reduced to
                    assemblages depending on the tact or taste of the author. Thus Polejaeff states
                    that with a single exception “none of the genera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ceratosa</hi> are separable by absolute characters.” The chief spicules of <hi
                    rend="italic">Monaxona</hi> are uniaxial, often accompanied by characteristic
                    microscleres. Although distinguished as a group by the absence of quadriradiate
                    or triaene spicules, two exceptions are known in which these occur (<hi
                    rend="italic">Tricentrion,</hi> Ehlers, and <hi rend="italic">Acarnus,</hi>
                    Gray); these, however, present unusual characters which suggest an independent
                    origin. The canal system of <hi rend="italic">Monaxona</hi> has not yet been
                    fully investigated; it appears usually to follow the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n445/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0445-0422"/> eurypylous Rhagon type, but the aphodal is not
                    unknown. The <hi rend="italic">Ceratosa</hi> contain all sponges with a horny
                    skeleton, except those in which the homy fibres are cored or spined with
                    silicious spicules secreted by the sponge (“proper” spicules); these are
                    arbitrarily assigned to the <hi rend="italic">Monaxona.</hi> There is
                    convenience in this proceeding, for horny matter is widely disseminated
                    throughout the <hi rend="italic">Demospongiae,</hi> occurring even in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lithistida,</hi> and it frequently serves to cement the oxeate
                    spicules of the <hi rend="italic">Monaxona</hi> into a fibre, without at the
                    same time forming a preponderant part of the skeleton. It would be wellnigh
                    impossible to say where the line should be drawn between a fibre composed of
                    spicules cemented by spongin and one consisting of spongin with embedded
                    spicules, while there is comparatively no difficulty in distinguishing between
                    fibres containing spicules and fibres devoid of them. That the distinction,
                    however, is entirely artificial is shown by the fact that, after spicules have
                    disappeared from the horny fibre, they may still persist in the mesoderm; thus
                    Von Lendenfeld announces the discovery of microscleres (cymba) in an Aplysillid
                    sponge and of strongyles in a <hi rend="italic">Cacospongia,</hi> both horny
                    sponges. (A form intermediate between this Aplysillid and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Desmacidonidae</hi> would appear to be <hi rend="italic">Toxo-chalina,</hi>
                    Ridley.) The <hi rend="italic">Ceratosa</hi> frequently enclose sand, <hi
                    rend="italic">Foraminifera,</hi> deciduous spicules of other sponges and of
                    compound Ascidians, and other foreign bodies within the horny fibres of their
                    skeleton; they also sometimes attach this material, probably by a secretion of
                    spongin, to their outer surface, and thus invest themselves in a thick
                    protective crust. In some <hi rend="italic">Ceratosa</hi> no other skeleton than
                    that provided by foreign enclosures is present. The canal system is syconate or
                    eurypylous in the simpler forms and diplodal in the higher. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Monaxonida</hi> make their earliest appearance in the Silurian
                    rocks (<hi rend="italic">Climacospongia,</hi> Hinde), and are now found in all
                    seas at all depths. The only sponges inhabiting fresh water belong to this
                    group. The <hi rend="italic">Tetractinellida</hi> adhere to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Monaxonida</hi> at more than one point, and one of these groups
                    has probably been a fruitful parent to the other, but which is offspring and
                    which parent is still a subject for discussion. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Choristida</hi> in its simplest forms presents a eurypylous Rhagon system, in
                    the higher an aphodal system. It is in this group that the most highly complex
                    cortex is met with; in the <hi rend="italic">Geodinidae,</hi> for instance, it
                    consists usually of at least five distinct layers. Thus, proceeding outwards,
                    next to the choanosome is a layer of thickly felted desmachyme, passing into
                    Collenchyme on its inner face; then follows a thick stratum of sterrasters
                    united together by desmacytes; this is succeeded by a layer of cystenchyme or
                    other tissue of variable thickness; external to this is a single layer of small
                    granular cells and associated dermal asters; and finally, the surface is
                    invested by a layer of pavement epithelium. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lithistida,</hi> like the <hi rend="italic">Ceratosa,</hi> are possibly of
                    polyphylitic origin; in one group (<hi rend="italic">Tctracladina)</hi> the
                    articulated scleres are evidently modified calthrops spicules (see fig. 14 <hi
                    rend="italic">e),</hi> and associated with them are free triaenes, which support
                    the dermis and resemble precisely the triaenes of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Choristida.</hi> In another group (<hi rend="italic">Rhabdocrepida)</hi> the
                    scleres are moulded on a Monaxonid base (see fig. 13 <hi rend="italic"
                    >q-s);</hi> but, associated with them, triaenes sometimes occur similar to those
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Tctracladina.</hi> Both these groups are in all
                    probability derived from the <hi rend="italic">Choristida,</hi> and a distinct
                    passage can be traced from the Tetracladose to the Rhabdocrepid group. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhabdocrepida</hi> we find forms without triaenes; these may
                    possibly be degenerate forms. The third group of Lithistids is derived from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhabdocrepida,</hi> the Anomocladine desma being derivable
                    from the Rhabdocrepid by a shortening of the main axis into a centrum. The thick
                    centrum, from which the arms, variable in number, originate, is hollowed out by
                    a cavity, which appears during life to have been occupied by a large nucleus,
                    like that of a scleroblast, and it is quite conceivable that the scleroblast,
                    which in the Tetracladine Lithistids lies in an angle between the arms, may have
                    become enclosed in an overgrowth of silica, from which additional arms were
                    produced. The constancy with which spicules in other sponges maintain their
                    independence is very striking. When once a persistent character like this is
                    disturbed, excessive variability may be predicted, as in the Anomocladine
                    scleres.</p>

                <p>The arrangement adopted above is founded on Von Lendenfeld’s revision (<hi
                    rend="italic">11</hi>) of the classification propounded by Polejaeff (<hi
                    rend="italic">16</hi>), who in a masterly survey has thrown an unexpected light
                    on the structure and inter-relationships of a group which Haeckel has rendered
                    famous. It should not be overlooked that Vosmaer (<hi rend="italic">31</hi>) had
                    previously explained the structure of the Leucones. However erroneous in detail,
                    Haeckel’s views are confirmed in their broad outlines, and it was with true
                    insight that he pronounced the <hi rend="italic">Calcarea</hi> to offer one of
                    the most luminous expositions of the evolutional theory. In this single group
                    the development in general of the canal system of the sponges is revealed from
                    its starting-point in the simple Ascon to its almost completed stage in the
                    Leucon, with a completeness that leaves little further to be hoped for, unless
                    it be the requisite physiological explanation.</p>

                    >Hippospongia equina</hi> (O.S.), the horse sponge or common bath sponge. The
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Euspongia</hi> is distinguished by the regular
                    development of the skeletal network throughout the body, its narrow meshes,
                    scarcely or not at all visible to the naked eye, and the regular radiate
                    arrangement of its chief fibres. <hi rend="italic">Hippospongia</hi> is
                    distinguished by the thinness of its fibres and the labyrinthic character of the
                    choanosome beneath the skin As a consequence its chief fibres have no regular
                    radiate arrangement. The species of <hi rend="italic">Euspongia</hi> are

                    fibres are of different thicknesses, irregularly swollen at intervals, without
                    exception cored by sand grains; in <hi rend="italic">E. zimocca</hi> they are

                    officinalis,</hi> again, the uniting fibres are soft, thin, and elastic; whilst
                    in <hi rend="italic">E. zimocca</hi> they are denser and thicker, to which
                    difference the latter sponge owes its characteristic hardness. Finally, the

                <p>Fresh individuals arise by asexual gemmation, both external and internal, by
                    fission, and by true sexual reproduction.</p>
                <p>Fission is probably one of the processes by which compound sponges are produced
                    from simple individuals. Artificial fission has been practised with success in
                    the cultivation of commercial sponges for the market. External gemmation has
                    been observed in <hi rend="italic">Thenea, Tethya, Polymastia,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Oscarella.</hi> A mass of indifferent sponge-cells accumulates at
                    some point beneath the skin, bulges out, drops off, and gives rise to a new
                    individual. Internal gemmation, which results in the formation of a statoblast,
                    is only known to occur in the freshwater <hi rend="italic">Spongillidae.</hi>
                    The statoblasts consist of a mass of yolk-bearing mesoderm cells, invested by a
                    capsule, which in <hi rend="italic">Ephydatia fluviatilis</hi> is composed of an
                    inner cuticle of spongin separated from a similar outer layer by an intermediate
                    zone of amphidisks and interspersed protoplasmic cells. On one side of the
                    capsule is a hilum which leads into the interior.</p>
                <p>Their development has recently been studied by Götte, with results that confirm
                    the conclusions of Carter (<hi rend="italic">3</hi>) and Lieberkühn (<hi
                    rend="italic">13</hi>). The process commences with an accumulation of amoeboid
                    cells within the mesoderm to form a globular cluster; yolk granules develop
                    within them, especially in those that lie nearer the centre. The external cells
                    give rise to the investing capsule; some resemble sponginblasts and secrete the
                    inner and outer horny cuticle; others give rise to the amphidisks and
                    interspersed cells of the middle layer. Under favourable conditions the interior
                    cells creep out through the pore of the capsule, and form a spreading heap,
                    which by subsequent differentiation gives rise to a young <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spongilla.</hi></p>
                <p>Since the freshwater sponges can only be regarded as modified descendants of
                    ancient marine species (probably of the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Halichondridae),</hi> we may consider the internal gemmules, like the similar
                    statoblasts of the freshwater <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa,</hi> as special
                    adaptations to a changed mode of life. They appear primarily to serve a
                    protective purpose, ensuring the persistence of the race, since they only appear
                    in extreme climates on the approach of drought, and in cold ones on the approach
                    of winter.</p>
                <p>As a secondary function they serve for the dispersal of the species; some are
                    light enough to float down a stream, but not too far, so that there is no danger
                    of their being carried to sea; others, which are characterized by large
                    air-chambers, are possibly distributed by the wind.</p>
                <p>Both sexual elements may be formed in the same individual, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g., Oscarella lobularis, Grantia raphanus,</hi> and many others; but even in
                    hermaphrodites one or other element usually occurs to excess in different
                    individuals, so that some are predominantly male and others predominantly
                    female. Polejaeff found only one such male form to 100 female forms in <hi
                    rend="italic">Grantia raphanus.</hi> In other sponges— <hi rend="italic">Reniera
                    fertilis, Euspongia officinalis—</hi> the sexes are distinct. The ova develop
                    from archaeocytes or wandering amoeboid cells, which increase in size and
                    acquire a store of reserve nourishment in the form of yolk granules; at first
                    they exhibit lively amoeboid movements, but later pass into a resting stage. The
                    cavity of the mesoderm within which they are situated becomes lined by a layer
                    of epithelium, which may not appear, however, till a late stage of segmentation.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Euspongia officinalis</hi> the ova occur congregated in
                    groups within the mesoderm, thus presenting an early form of ovary. The
                    spermatozoa, which also develop from wandering amoeboid cells, are minute bodies
                    with an oval or pear-shaped head and a long vibratile tail (fig. 24 <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi>). Each amoeboid cell produces a large number of
                    spermatozoa, which occur in spherical clusters or sperm-balls. The heads of the
                    spermatozoa, as in the <hi rend="italic">Metazoa,</hi> are produced from the
                    nucleus of the mother-cell, the tails from the surrounding protoplasm.</p>
                <p>The development in detail is upon two plans. In <hi rend="italic">Grantia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">raphanus</hi> (<hi rend="italic">15</hi>) the nucleus of the
                    mother-cell divides into two (fig. 24 <hi rend="italic">b);</hi> one of the
                    resulting daughter nuclei undergoes no further change, but with a small quantity
                    of peripheral protoplasm forms a “cover-cell” to the other or primitive sperm
                    nucleus and its associated protoplasm. The sperm nucleus repeatedly divides,
                    with<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n448/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0448-0425"/> out involving the surrounding protoplasm (fig. 24
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi>- <hi rend="italic">f</hi>). The resulting nuclei at
                    length cease to exhibit a nucleolus, and become directly transformed into the
                    heads of spermatozoa; the tails are appropriated by each head from the common
                    protoplasmic residue. The mothercell in this case undergoes no increase in
                    volume as development proceeds, and it is not enclosed within an “endothelial”
                    layer. In the second and apparently more usual case (<hi rend="italic">20</hi>)
                    no "cover-cell” is formed, but the mother-cell divides and subdivides,
                    protoplasm as well as nuclei, till a vast number of minute cells results; the
                    nucleus of each becomes the head of a spermatozoon and the protoplasm its tail.
                    In this case the sperm-ball does increase in bulk: it grows as it develops, and
                    the cavity containing it becomes lined by epithelium, or so-called “endothelium”
                    (fig. 24 <hi rend="italic">j</hi>). No doubt (<hi rend="italic">15</hi>) the
                    development of the epithelium stands in direct physiological connexion with the
                    growth of the sperm-ball.</p>
                <p>Obscure as are the details of this subject, sufficient is known to enable us to
                    make out two chief types of development. One, common amongst the calcareous
                    sponges, and possibly occurring in a single genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gummina)</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Micromastictora</hi>, is characterized
                    by what is known as the “amphiblastula” stage; the other, widely spread amongst
                    the <hi rend="italic">Micromastictora (Reniera, Dcsmacidon, Euspongia,
                    Spongelia, Aplysilla, Oscarella),</hi> is characterized by a “planula”
                    stage.</p>
                <p>The first has been most thoroughly investigated in <hi rend="italic">Grantia
                    raphanus</hi> by Schulze (<hi rend="italic">20</hi>). The ovum by repeated
                    segmentation gives rise to a hollow vesicle, the wall of which is formed by a
                    single layer of cells— <hi rend="italic">blastosphere</hi> (fig. 25 <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>). Eight cells at one pole of the blastosphere now become
                    differentiated from the rest; they remain rounded in form, comparatively large,
                    and become filled with granules (stored nutriment), while the others, rapidly
                    multiplying by division, become small, clear, columnar, and flagellated. By
                    further change the embryo becomes egg-shaped; the granular cells, now increased
                    in number to thirty-two, form the broader end, and the numerous small
                    flagellated cells the smaller end. Of the granular cells sixteen are arranged in
                    an equatorial girdle adjoining the flagellate cells. A blastosphere thus
                    differentiated into two halves composed of different cells is known as an <hi
                    rend="italic">amphiblastula.</hi> The amphiblastula (fig. 25 <hi rend="italic"
                    >e)</hi> now perforates the maternal tissue, and is borne along an excurrent
                    canal to the oscule, where it is discharged to the exterior and swims about in a
                    whirling lively dance.</p>
                <p>It then assumes a more spherical form, a change premonitory of the next most
                    remarkable phase of its career. In this the flagellated layer becomes flattened,
                    depressed, and finally invaginated within the hemisphere of granular cells, to
                    the inner face of which it applies itself, thus entirely obliterating the
                    cleavage cavity, but by the same process originating another (the invagination
                    cavity) at its expense (fig. 25 <hi rend="italic">f</hi>). The two-layered sac
                    thus produced is a <hi rend="italic">paragastrula</hi>; its outer layer, known
                    as the <hi rend="italic">epiblast,</hi> gives rise to the ectoderm, the inner
                    layer or hypoblast to the endoderm. The paragastrula next becomes somewhat
                    beehiveshaped, and the mouth of the paragastric cavity is diminished in size by
                    an ingrowth of the granular cells around its margin. The larva now settles mouth
                    downwards on some fixed object, and exchanges a free for a fixed and stationary
                    existence (fig. 25 <hi rend="italic">y</hi>). The granular cells completely
                    obliterate the original mouth, and grow along their outer edge over the surface
                    of attachment in irregular pseudopodial processes, which secure the young sponge
                    firmly to its seat (fig. 25 <hi rend="italic">h</hi>). The granular cells now
                    become almost transparent, owing to the exhaustion of the yolk granules, and
                    allow the hypoblast within to be readily seen; a layer of jelly-like material,
                    the rudimentary mesoderm, is also to be discerned between the two layers. The
                    spicules then become visible; slender oxeas appear first, and afterwards tri-and
                    quadri-radiate spicules. The larva now elongates into a somewhat cylindrical
                    form; the distal end flattens; and an oscule opens in its midst. Pores open in
                    the walls; the endodermal cells, which had temporarily lost their flagella,
                    reacquire them, at the same time extending the characteristic collar. In this
                    stage (fig. 25 <hi rend="italic">h, j)</hi> the young sponge corresponds to a
                    true Ascon, no trace of radial tubes being visible; but as they characterize the
                    parent sponge they must arise later, and thus we have clear evidence through
                    ontogeny of the development of a Sycon sponge from an Ascon.</p>
                <p>The three most striking features in the history of this larva are, first, the
                    amphiblastula stage; next the invagination of the flagellate cells within the
                    granular, instead of invagination in the reverse order; and third the attachment
                    of the larva by the oral instead of the aboral surface. Should Schulze be
                    correct in deriving the sponges from the <hi rend="italic">Coelentera,</hi> it
                    is probable that the reversal of the</p>
                <p>Coelenterate history as exemplified in the last two events will furnish an
                    explanation of the remarkable divergencies which distinguish the two phyla. The
                    history of the second or planula type has been thoroughly worked out by Schulze
                    (<hi rend="italic">20</hi>) in a little incrusting Tetrac-tinellid sponge (<hi
                    rend="italic">Plakina monolopha,</hi> Schulze). The ovum by regular segmentation
                    produces a blastosphere, the blastomeres of winch increase in number by further
                    subdivision till they become converted into hyaline cylindrical flagellated
                    cells (fig. 26 <hi rend="italic">f</hi>). Thus a blastosphere is produced
                    consisting wholly of similar flagellated cells. It becomes egg-shaped, and,
                    hitherto colourless, assumes a rose-red tint, which is deepest over the smaller
                    end. The larva (now a planula, fig. 26 <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> by the filling
                    in of the central cavity) escapes from the parent and swims about broad end
                    foremost. In this stage thin sections show that the cleavage cavity is
                    obliterated, its place being occupied by a mass of granular gelatinous material
                    containing nuclei (fig. 26 <hi rend="italic">b</hi>). In from one to three days
                    after hatching the larva becomes attached. It then spreads out into a convex
                    mass, and a cavity is produced within it by the splitting of the central jelly
                    (fig. 26 <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, <hi rend="italic">d</hi>; compare <hi
                    rend="italic">Eucope</hi> and others amongst the Coelenterates). This cavity
                    becomes lined by short cylindrical cells (endoderm), while the flagellated cells
                    of the exterior lose their flagella and become converted into pinnacocytes
                    (ectoderm). The gelatinous material left between the two layers now formed
                    acquires the characters of true Collenchyme and thus becomes the mesoderm. The
                    endoderm then sends off into the mesoderm, as buds, rounded chambers, which
                    communicate with the paragastric cavity by a wide mouth and with the exterior by
                    small pores (fig. 26 <hi rend="italic">e</hi>). An oscule is formed later, and
                    the sponge enters upon the Rhagon phase. Subsequent foldings of the sponge-wall
                    give rise to a very simple canal system (fig. 26 <hi rend="italic">f</hi>). In
                    addition to these two well-ascertained modes of development others have been
                    described which at present appear aberrant. In <hi rend="italic">Oscarella
                    lobularis,</hi> O.S. (<hi rend="italic">27),</hi> a curious series of early
                    developmental changes results in the formation of an irregular paragastrula, the
                    walls of which become folded (while still within the parent sponge) in a complex
                    fashion, so as to produce a form in which the incurrent and excurrent canals
                    appear to be already sketched out before the flagellated chambers are
                    differentiated off. In <hi rend="italic">Spongilla</hi> Götte describes the
                    ectoderm as becoming entirely lost on the attachment of the larva, so that the
                    future sponge proceeds from the endoderm alone. As <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spongilla,</hi> however,<pb break="no"

                <p>Probably in no other single group is the doctrine of homoplasy enunciated by
                    Lankester more tellingly illustrated than in the sponges. The independent
                    development of similar types of canal system in different groups, sometimes
                    within the limits of a single family, is a remarkable fact. In the following

                <p>In the gross anatomy of the canal system similar homoplasy obtains; thus, to cite
                    one case amongst many, a peculiar type of canal system characteristic of <hi
                    rend="italic">Siphonia</hi> (Lithistid) occurs also in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Emploca</hi> (Hexactinellid), <hi rend="italic">Schmidtia</hi> (Monaxonid), and
                    other apparently unrelated genera. The development of a cortex has likewise
                    taken place independently, but on parallel lines, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syconidae, Leu-conidae, Monaxona, Tetillidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stellettidae.</hi> Calcareous and silicious spicules have evidently an
                    independent history, and yet all the chief forms of the former are repeated in
                    the latter. Quite as remarkable is the similarity of the independently evolved
                    horny spicules of <hi rend="italic">Darwinella aurea</hi> to the quadri-and
                    sex-radiate silicious spicules. We have now sufficient knowledge of the
                    morphology and evolution of the sponge to furnish the physicist with data for an
                    explanation of the skeleton, at least in its main outlines. The obvious
                    conclusion from this is that variation does not depend upon accident, but on the
                    operation of physical laws as mechanical in their action here as in the mineral
                    world. Another important consequence follows: if homoplasy— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the independent evolution of similar structures —is of such certain
                    and quite common occurrence in the case of the sponges, it is also to be looked
                    for in other groups, and polyphylitic origin, so far from being improbable, is
                    as likely an occurrence as monophylitic origin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physiology and Aetiology.</hi></p>
                <p>Under the head of “physiology” we have almost a blank. At present we do not even
                    know what cells of the sponge are primarily concerned in the ingestion of food.
                    If a living sponge, such as <hi rend="italic">Spongilla,</hi> be fed with
                    carmine for a few minutes, then immersed in dilute osmic acid, and examined in
                    thin sections, its flagellated chambers are found to be all marked out as red
                    circular patches, and a closer investigation shows that the choanocytes, and
                    they alone, have ingested the carmine. In this way we confirm the earlier
                    observations of Carter made by teasing carmine-fed sponges. This might be
                    thought to decide the question; but, though it effectually disposes of
                    Polejaeff's argument that the choanocytes do not ingest nutriment because
                    mechanical disadvantages (conceived <hi rend="italic">a priori)</hi> make it
                    impossible, it has not proved a final solution. Von Lendenfeld, by feeding
                    sponges such as <hi rend="italic">Aplysilla</hi> with carmine for a longer
                    interval—a quarter of an hour—finds that amoeboid cells crowd about the sides
                    and particularly the floor of the subdermal cavities, and are soon loaded with
                    carmine granules; after a time they wander away to the flagellated chambers and
                    there cast out into the excurrent canals the carmine they have absorbed,
                    apparently in an altered state. On the other hand, the choanocytes, though they
                    at first absorb the carmine, soon thrust it out, apparently in an unaltered
                    state. Hence Von Lendenfeld concludes that it is the epithelium of the subdermal
                    cavities which is charged with the function of ingestion, and that the amoeboid
                    cells subsequently digest and distribute it, and finally cast out the worthless
                    residues. There may be much truth in this view, but it requires to be supported
                    by further evidence. (1) Sufficient proof is not adduced to show that the
                    carmine granules expelled from the amoeboid cells are really more decomposed
                    than those rejected by the choanocytes. (2) There is at present no proof that
                    carmine is a food, or that if it is sponges will readily feed upon it. In either
                    case one would expect the amoeboid cells to play the part which they perform in
                    other organisms and to remove as soon as possible useless or irritant matter
                    from the surface which it encumbers; at the same time the choanocytes, not
                    having found the food to their liking, would naturally eject it. (3) If the
                    choanocytes do not ingest food, how does the Ascon feed, since in this sponge
                    all the pinnacocytes are external? It is, however, a very noticeable fact that,
                    as the organization of a sponge increases in complexity, the choanocytal layers
                    become reduced in volume relative to the whole bulk of the individual; and it is
                    quite possible that as histological differentiation proceeds it may be
                    accompanied by physiological differentiation which relieves the choanocytes to
                    some extent of the ingestive part of their labours.</p>
                <p>The origin of the sponges is to be sought for among the choanoflagellate <hi
                    rend="italic">Infusoria</hi>; and Savile Kent has described a colonial form of
                    this group which is suggestively similar to a sponge. Its differences, however,
                    are as marked as its resemblances, and have been sufficiently pointed out by
                    Schulze (<hi rend="italic">23</hi>). Kent has called this form <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protospongia,</hi> a name already made use of, and fortunately, as the organism
                    is not in any sense a true sponge; the present writer proposes, therefore, to
                    call it <hi rend="italic">Savillia,</hi> in honour of its discoverer. It
                    consists of choanoflagellate <hi rend="italic">Infusoria</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Protozoa,</hi> vol. xix. p. 858, fig. XXI., 15), half
                    projecting from and half embedded in a structureless jelly or blastema, within
                    which other cells of an amoeboid character and reproductive function are
                    immersed. Professor Haddon arrives at the generalization that conjugation
                    amongst the <hi rend="italic">Protozoa</hi> always takes place between
                    individuals of the same order: flagellate cells conjugate with flagellate,
                    amoeboid with amoeboid, but never with flagellate; while in true sexual
                    reproduction the conjugation occurs between two individual cells in different
                    stages of their life cycle: a flagellate cell conjugates with a resting amoeboid
                    cell. Now <hi rend="italic">Savillia</hi> would appear to be extremely near such
                    a true sexual process, since the simultaneous coexistence of cells in two
                    different stages of life and within easy reach of each other—a necessary
                    preliminary, one would think, to the union—has already been brought about. That
                    coalescence between two different histological elements should result in
                    products similarly histologically differentiated (compare amphiblastula stage of
                    <hi rend="italic">Calcarea)</hi> has in it a certain fitness, which, however,
                    has still to be explained. The mode by which an organism like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Savillia</hi> might become transformed into an Ascon cannot be suggestively
                    outlined with any satisfactory results till our knowledge of the embryology of
                    sponges is more advanced. The minute characters of the flagellate cells of the
                    amphiblastula and other sponge larvae are still a subject for research. They
                    often possess a neck or collum; but the existence of a frill or collar is
                    disputed. Kent asserts that it is present in several embryos which he figures;
                    and Barrois makes the same assertion in respect to the larva of <hi
                    rend="italic">Oscarella,</hi> and illustrates his description with a figure. On
                    the other hand, Schulze and Marshall both<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n450/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0450-0427"/> deny its existence, and the former attributes
                    Kent’s observations to error. One constant character they do possess: they are
                    provided with flagella at some stage of their existence, but never with cilia.
                    Ciliated cells, indeed, are unknown amongst the sponges, and, when pinnacocytes
                    exceptionally acquire vibratile filaments, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oscarella</hi> and other sponges, these are invariably flagella, never cilia.
                    An Ascon stage having been reached at some point in the history of the sponges,
                    the Sycon tubes and Rhagon chambers would arise from it by the active
                    proliferation of choanocytes about regularly distributed centres, possibly as a
                    result of generous feeding. Vosmaer recognized as the physiological cause of
                    Sycon an extension of the choanocytal layer. Polejaeff, relying on Von
                    Lendenfeld’s experiments, which seem to prove that it is the pinnacocytes and
                    not the choanocytes which are concerned in the ingestion of nutriment, argues
                    that, as in Sycon the pinnacocytal layer is increased relatively to the
                    choanocytal, we have in this a true explanation of the transition. The existence
                    of <hi rend="italic">Homoderma,</hi> Lfd., however, shows that in the first
                    stage there was not a replacement of choanocytes by pinnacocytes, but that this
                    was a secondary change, following the development of radial tubes, and therefore
                    cannot be relied upon to explain them. The radial tubes having been formed by a
                    proliferation of choanocytal cells, the reduction of those lining the
                    paragastric cavity to pinnacocytes would follow in consequence of the poisonous
                    character of the water delivered from the radial tubes to the central cavity,
                    since this water not only parts with its dissolved oxygen to the choanocytes it
                    first encounters, but receives from them in exchange urea, carbonic acid, and
                    faecal residues. The development of subdermal cavities is explicable on Von
                    Lendenfeld’s hypothesis.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Distribution.</hi></p>
                <p>Our knowledge of this subject is at present but fragmentary; we await fuller
                    information in the remaining reports on the sponges obtained by the
                    “Challenger.” The sponges are widely distributed through existing seas, and
                    freshwater forms are found in the rivers and lakes of all continents except
                    Australia, and in numerous islands, including New Zealand. Many genera and
                    several species are cosmopolitan, and so are most orders.</p>
                <p>As instances of the same species occurring in widely remote localities we take
                    the following from Polejaeff :— <hi rend="italic">Sycon arcticum</hi> is found
                    at the Bermudas and in the Philippine Islands, as also are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lcuconia multiformis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lcucilla, uter; Sycon
                    raphanus</hi> occurs at Tristan da Cunha aud the Philippines; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heteropegma nodus-gordii</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lcuconia dura</hi> at the
                    Bermudas and Torres Straits. We do not know, however, whether these species are
                    isolated in their distribution or connected by intermediate localities. Of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Calcarea</hi> about eighty-one species have been obtained from
                    the Atlantic, twenty-two from the Pacific, and twenty-two from the Indian Ocean;
                    but these numbers no doubt depend largely on the extent to which the several
                    oceans have been investigated, for the largest number of species has been found
                    in the ocean nearest home. Schulze states that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hexactinellida</hi> brought home by the “Challenger” were obtained at seventeen
                    Atlantic stations, twenty-seven Pacific, and nineteen in the South Seas. In the
                    last the number of species was greatest, in the Atlantic least. They flourish
                    best on a bottom of diatomaceous mud. The <hi rend="italic">Calcarea</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Ceratosa</hi> are most abundant in shallow water and down to
                    40 fathoms, but they descend to from 400 to 450 fathoms. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hexactinellida</hi> are most numerous over continental depths, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e</hi>., 100 to 200 fathoms; but they extend downwards to over
                    2500 fathoms and upwards into shallow water (10 to 20 fathoms). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Lithistida</hi> are not such deep-water forms as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hexactinellida,</hi> being most numerous from 10 to 150 fathoms.
                    Only one or two species have been dredged from depths greater than 400 fathoms,
                    and none from 1000 fathoms. The <hi rend="italic">Choristida</hi> range from
                    shallow water to abyssal depths. A characteristic deep-sea Choristid genus is
                    <hi rend="italic">Thenea,</hi> Gray (= <hi rend="italic">Wyville
                    Thompsonia,</hi> Wright; <hi rend="italic">Dorvillia,</hi> Kent). This is most
                    frequently dredged from depths of from 1000 to 2000 fathoms; but it extends to
                    2700 fathoms on the one hand and to 100 on the other.</p>
                <p>Until about 1876 one of the chief obstacles to the inter pretation of fossil
                    sponges arose from a singular mineral replacement which most of them have
                    undergone, leading to the substitution of calcite for the silica of which their
                    skeletons were originally composed. This change was demonstrated by Zittel (<hi
                    rend="italic">35</hi>) and Sollas (<hi rend="italic">24</hi>), and, though it
                    was at first pronounced impossible, owing to objections founded on the chemical
                    nature of silica, it has since become generally recognized. These observers also
                    showed that the fossil sponges do not belong to extinct types, but are
                    assignable to existing orders. Zittel in addition subjected large collections to
                    a careful analysis and marshalled them into order with remarkable success. Since
                    then several palaeontologists have worked at the subject,—Pocta, Dunikowski, and
                    Hinde (<hi rend="italic">7</hi>), who has published a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catalogue—</hi> which is much more than a catalogue—of the sponges preserved in
                    the British Museum. The result of their labours is in general terms as follows.
                    Fossil sponges are chiefly such as from the coarseness or consistency of their
                    skeletons would be capable of preservation in a mineralized state. Thus the
                    majority are <hi rend="italic">Hexactinellida,</hi> chiefly <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictyonina; Tetractinellida,</hi> chiefly <hi rend="italic">Lithistida;</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Calcarea,</hi> chiefly <hi rend="italic">Leuconaria.</hi>
                    Monaxonid sponges rarely occur; the most ancient is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Climacospongia,</hi> Hinde, found in Silurian rocks. A very common
                    Halichondroid sponge of this group <hi rend="italic">(Pharetrospongia
                    strahani,</hi> Soll.) occurs in the Cambridge greensand; it owes its
                    preservation to the collection of its small oxeate spicules into dense fibres.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Choristida,</hi> though not so common as the Lithistids,
                    are commoner than the Monaxonids, particularly in Mesozoic strata.</p>
                <p>The distribution of fossil sponges in the stratified systems may be summarized as
                    follows. <hi rend="smallcaps">Calcarea.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Homocoelα,</hi>
                    none. <hi rend="italic">Heterocoela,</hi> a Syconid, in the Jurassic system.
                    Numerous <hi rend="italic">Leuconaria</hi> from the Devonian upwards. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Myxospongiae.</hi> —None; not fitted for preservation. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hexactinellida.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Lyssacina,</hi> from the
                    Lower Cambrian upwards. <hi rend="italic">Dictyonina,</hi> commencing in the
                    Silurian; most numerous in the Mesozoic group; still existing. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Monaxonida.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Monaxona,</hi> from the
                    Silurian upwards. <hi rend="italic">Ceratosa,</hi> none; few are fitted for
                    preservation. <hi rend="smallcaps">Tetractinellida.—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Choristida,</hi> from the Carboniferous upwards; most numerous in the
                    Cretaceous system. <hi rend="italic">Lithistida,</hi> from the Silurian upwards;
                    most numerous in the Mesozoic group. In ancient times the Hexactinellids and
                    Lithistids seem not to have been so comparatively uncommon in shallow water as
                    they are at the present day. Thus, in the Lower Jurassic strata of the
                    south-west of England we find Dictyonine Hexactinellids, Lithistids, and
                    Leuconarian <hi rend="italic">Calcarea</hi> associated together in a shelly
                    breccia and in company with littoral shells, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Patella</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trochus.</hi> Several Palaeozoic
                    Hexactinellids actually occur in a fine-grained sandstone. Of the Chalk, which
                    is the great mine of fossil sponges, we must speak with caution, owing to the
                    insufficient evidence as to the depth at which it was deposited.</p>
                <p>As shown by <hi rend="italic">Protospongia,</hi> the phylum of the sponges was in
                    existence in very early Cambrian times, and probably much earlier. Before the
                    end of the Silurian period its main branches had spread themselves out, and,
                    developing fresh shoots since then, they have extended to the present day. Of
                    the offshoots none of higher value than families are known to have become
                    extinct, and of these decayed branches there are very few. The existence in
                    modern seas of the <hi rend="italic">Asconidae,</hi> which must surely have
                    branched off very near the base of the stem, is another curious instance of the
                    persistence of simple types, which would thus appear not to be so vastly worse
                    off in the struggle for existence than their more highly organized
                    descendants.</p>

                <p>When the living matter is removed from a Ceratose sponge a network of elastic
                    horny fibres, the skeleton of the animal, remains behind. This is the sponge of
                    commerce. Of such sponges the softest, finest in texture, and most valued is the
                    Turkey or Levant sponge, <hi rend="italic">Euspongia officinalis,</hi> Lin. The
                    other two varieties are the <hi rend="italic">Hippospongia equina,</hi> O.
                    Schmidt, and the Zimocca sponge, <hi rend="italic">Euspongia Zimocca,</hi> O.S.,
                    which is not so soft as the others (see p. 423 above). All three species are
                    found at from 2 to 100 fathoms along the whole Mediterranean coast, including
                    its bays, gulfs, and islands, except the western half of its northern shores as
                    far as Venice and the Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily. Bath
                    sponges occur around the shores of the Bahamas, and less abundantly on the north
                    coast of Cuba. They are of several kinds, one not distinguishable from the fine
                    Levant sponge; others, the “yellow” and “hardhead” varieties, resemble the
                    Zimocca sponge; and of horse sponges there appear to be several varieties, such
                    as the “lamb’s-wool” and the “velvet” sponge <hi rend="italic">(Hippospongia
                    gossypina</hi> and <hi rend="italic">H. meandriformis).</hi> The fine bath
                    sponge occurs on the shores of Australia (Torres Straits, the west coast, and
                    Port Phillip on the south coast). A sponge eminently adapted for bathing
                    purposes <hi rend="italic">(Coscinoderma lanuginosum,</hi> Crtr.; <hi
                    rend="italic">Euspongia mathewsii,</hi> Lfd.), but not yet brought into the
                    market, occurs about the South Caroline Islands, where it is actually in use,
                    and at Port Phillip in Australia. The fine bath sponge occurs in the North
                    Pacific, South Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, so that its distribution is
                    world-wide.</p>
                <p>The methods employed to get sponges from the bottom of the sea, where they grow
                    attached to rocks, stones, and other objects, depend on the depths from which
                    they are to be brought. In comparatively shallow water they may be loosened and
                    hooked up by a harpoon; at greater depths, down to 30 or 40 fathoms, they are
                    dived for; and at depths of from 50 to 100 fathoms they are dredged with a net.
                    The method of harpooning was the earliest practised, and is still carried on in
                    probably its most primitive form by the Dalmatian fishermen. Small boats are
                    used, manned by a single harpooner with a boy to steer; when, however, the
                    expedition is to extend over night the crew is doubled. The harpoon is a
                    five-pronged fork with a long wooden handle, and if this is not long enough
                    another harpoon is lashed on to it. The Greek fishers use a large boat furnished
                    with two or three smaller ones, from which the actual harpooning is carried on;
                    the crew numbers seven or eight. One of the chief difficulties is to see the
                    bottom distinctly through a troubled surface. The Dalmatian fishers throw a
                    smooth stone dipped in oil a yard or so in front of the boat; the stone scatters
                    drops of oil as it flies and so makes a smooth track for the “lookout.” The
                    Greeks use a zinc-plate cylinder about 1 ½ feet long and 1 foot wide, closed at
                    the lower end by a plate of glass, which is immersed below the surface of the
                    sea; on looking through this the bottom may be clearly seen even in 30 fathoms.
                    This plan is also adopted in the Bahamas, where harpooning carried on after the
                    Greek system gives employment to over 5000 men and boys.</p>
                <p>The primitive method of diving with no other apparatus than a slab of stone to
                    serve as a sinker and a cord to communicate with the surface is still practised
                    in the Mediterranean. The diver carries a net round his neck to hold the
                    sponges. On reaching the bottom he hastily snatches up whatever sponge he sees.
                    After staying down as long as he is able—an interval which varies from two to at
                    the most three minutes—he tugs violently at the cord and is rapidly drawn up. On
                    entering the boat from depths of 25 fathoms he quickly recovers from the effects
                    of his plunge after a few powerful respirations; but after working at depths of
                    30 to 40 fathoms or more he reaches the surface in a swooning state. At the
                    beginning of the season blood usually flows from the mouth and nose after a
                    descent; this is regarded as a symptom of good condition; should it be wanting
                    the diver will scarcely venture a second plunge for the rest of the season. The
                    work is severe, and frequently the diver returns empty-handed to the boat.
                    Diving is usually carried on in the summer months; in winter it is too cold, at
                    all events without a diving-dress. The ordinary diver’s dress with pumping
                    apparatus is largely used by the Greeks. The diving is carried on from a ship
                    manned by eight or nine men, including one, or rarely two, divers. At a depth of
                    from 10 to 15 fathoms the diver can remain under for an hour, at greater depths
                    up to 20 fathoms only a few minutes; the consequences of a longer stay are palsy
                    of the lower extremities, stricture, and other complaints. Dredging is chiefly
                    carried on along the west coast of Asia Minor, principally in winter after the
                    autumn storms have torn up the seaweeds covering the bottom. The mouth of the
                    dredge is 6 yards wide and 1 yard high; the net is made of camel-hair cords of
                    the thickness of a finger, with meshes 4 inches square. It is drawn along the
                    bottom by a tow-line attached to the bowsprit of a sailing vessel or hauled in
                    from the shore.</p>
                <p>Prompted by a suggestion made by Oscar Schmidt, that sponges might be
                    artificially propagated from cuttings, the Italian Government supplied funds for
                    experiments to determine the feasibility of cultivating sponges as an industrial
                    pursuit. A station was established on the island of Lesina, off the Dalmatian
                    coast, and experiments were carried on there for six years (1867-72) under the
                    superintendence of Von Buccich. The results were on the whole successful, but
                    all expectations of creating a new source of income for the sponge-fishers of
                    Dalmatia were defeated by the hostility of the fishers themselves.</p>
                <p>The details of the method of sponge-farming as practised by Von Buccich are
                    briefly as follows. The selected specimens, which should be obtained in as
                    uninjured a state as possible, are placed on a board moistened with sea water
                    and cut with a knife or fine saw into pieces about 1 inch square, care being
                    taken to preserve the outer skin as intact as possible. The operation is best
                    performed in winter, as exposure to the air is then far less fatal than in
                    summer. The sponge cuttings are then trepanned and skewered on bamboo rods; the
                    rods, each bearing three cuttings, are secured in an upright position between
                    two parallel boards, which are then sunk to the bottom of the sea and weighted
                    with stones. In choosing a spot for the sponge-farm the mouths of rivers and
                    proximity to submarine springs must be avoided; mud in this case, as in that of
                    reef-building<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n452/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0452-0429"/> corals, is fatal. A favourable situation is a
                    sheltered bay with a rocky bottom overgrown with green seaweed and freshened by
                    gentle waves and currents. So favoured, the cuttings grow to a sponge two or
                    three times their original size in one year, and at the end of five to seven
                    years are large enough for the market. Similar experiments with similar results
                    have more recently been carried on in Florida. The chief drawback to successful
                    sponge-farming would appear to be the long interval which the cultivator has to
                    wait for his first crop.</p>
                <p>After the sponge has been taken from the sea, it is exposed to the air till signs
                    of decomposition set in, and then without delay either beaten with a thick stick
                    or trodden by the feet in a stream of flowing water till the skin and other soft
                    tissues are completely removed. If this process is postponed for only a few
                    hours after the sponge has been exposed a whole day to the air it is almost
                    impossible to completely purify it. After cleaning it is hung up in the air to
                    dry, and then with others finally pressed into bales. If not completely dried
                    before packing the sponges “heat,” orange yellow spots appearing on the parts
                    attacked. The only remedy for this is to unpack the bale and remove the affected
                    sponges. The orangecoloured spots produced by this “pest,” or “cholera” as the
                    Levant fishermen term it, must not be confounded with the brownish red colour
                    which many sponges naturally possess, especially near their base. The sponges on
                    reaching the wholesale houses are cut to a symmetrical shape and further
                    cleaned. The light-coloured sponges often seen in chemists’ shops have been
                    bleached by chemical means which impair their durability. Sponges are sold by
                    weight; sand is used as an “adulteration.”</p>
                <p>It is difficult to obtain recent statistics as to the extent of the sponge trade;
                    the following table gives a summary of the sponges sold in Trieste, the great
                    European sponge market, in the year 1871 :—</p>
