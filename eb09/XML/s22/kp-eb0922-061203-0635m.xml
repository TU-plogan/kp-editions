                    charmingly situated among vine-clad and wooded hills, and stands at a height of
                    nearly 900 feet above the sea. The town is intersected from south-west to
                    north-east by the long and handsome</p>
                <p>Königs-Strasse, dividing it into an upper and lower half. In all its main feat
                    ures it is essentially a modern town, and few of its principal buildings are
                    older than the present cen tury. Many of its modern edifices are, however, of
                    considerable architectural importance, and the recent revival of the Renaissance
                    style is perhaps nowhere better illustrated than at</p>
                <p>Stuttgart. The lower or south-eastern half contains both the small group of
                    streets belonging to old</p>
                <p>Stuttgart and also the most important part of the new town. A large proportion of
                    the most prominent buildings are clustered round the spacious Schloss-Platz, on
                    or near which are the following edifices :—the new palace, an imposing structure
                    of the 18th century, finished in 1806; the old palace, a building of the 16th
                    century, with a picturesque arcaded court; the Königsbau, a huge modern
                    building, with a fine colonnade, containing ball and concert rooms, shops,
                    &amp;c.; the so-called Akademie, formerly (1775-94) the seat of the
                    Carls-Schule, where Schiller received part of his education, and now occupied by
                    the king’s private library and by guard-rooms; the new courts of justice; the
                    palaces of the crown prince and of Prince William; the Stiftskirche, or
                    collegiate church, a fine specimen of 15th-century Gothic; the extensive royal
                    stables; the new postoffice; the theatre; and the central railway station, one
                    of the handsomest structures of the kind in Germany. In the centre of the
                    Schloss-Platz is the lofty jubilee column erected in memory of King William I.;
                    in the court-yard of the old palace is a bronze equestrian statue of Count
                    Eberhard with the Beard; and adjacent is a fine statue, designed by Thorwaldsen,
                    of Schiller, who was a native of Würtemberg. Among the other principal buildings
                    are the polytechnic and architectural schools, the Late Gothic Leonhardskirche
                    and Spitalkirche, the fine modern Gothic church of St John, the new Roman
                    Catholic church, the neat little English church, the synagogue, and several
                    handsome villas and mansions, chiefly in the resuscitated Renaissance style.</p>
                <p>The art collections of Stuttgart are numerous and valuable. The museum of art
                    comprises a picture gallery, an almost unique collection of casts of
                    Thorwaldsen’s works, and a cabinet of engravings. The royal library contains
                    about 350,000 printed volumes, including what is said to be the largest
                    collection of Bibles in the world, and also 4000 MSS., many of great rarity. To
                    these may be added the industrial museum, the cabinet of coins, the museum of
                    natural history, the fine collection of majolica in the new palace, and the
                    museum of antiquities. The city also contains numerous excellent educational
                    establishments, though the state university is not here but at Tübingen, and its
                    conservatorium of music has long been renowned. Stuttgart is the centre of the
                    publishing trade of South Germany, and has a busy industry in everything
                    connected with the production of books. In various other industrial departments
                    it also takes a high place, its manufactures including machinery, textile
                    fabrics, pianos and other musical instruments, artists’ colours, chemicals,
                    sugar, and chocolate. Its trade is considerable. The population of Stuttgart in
                    1885 was 125,510, showing an increase of 7 per cent. since 1880. Four-fifths of
                    these are Protestants. The town proper contains about 110,000 inhabitants, while
                    the above total is made up by adding the populations of the suburban villages of
                    Berg, Gablenberg, and Heslach. Stuttgart is the headquarters of the 13th corps
                    of the German army, and contains a comparatively large garrison, for which
                    accommodation is provided in three extensive barracks within the town and on the
                    outskirts.</p>
                <p>To the north-east of the new palace lies the beautiful palace park, embellished
                    with statuary and artificial sheets of water, and extending nearly all the way
                    to Cannstatt, a distance of over two miles. Cannstatt, a town with (1880) 16,205
                    inhabitants, is not officially incorporated with Stuttgart, but may be looked on
                    as practically forming part of it. Its beautiful situation on the Neckar, its
                    tepid saline and chalybeate springs, and its educational advantages attract
                    numerous visitors. In the environs of Stuttgart and Cannstatt lie Rosenstein,
                    the Solitude, Hohenheim, the Wilhelma, and other royal chateaus.</p>
                <p>Stuttgart seems to have originated in a stud (“Stuten Garten ”) of the early
                    counts of Würtemberg, and the first mention of it occurs in a document of 1229.
                    Its importance is of comparatively modern growth, and in early Würtemberg
                    history we find it overshadowed by Cannstatt, the central situation of which, on
                    the Neckar, seemed to mark it out as the natural capital of the country. After
                    the destruction of the castle of Würtemberg Count Eberhard, however, transferred
                    his residence to Stuttgart (1320), and in 1482 it became the recognized capital
                    of all the Würtemberg territories. Even as capital its growth was slow, and it
                    enjoys little prominence in history. At the beginning of the present century it
                    did not contain 20,000 inhabitants, and its real advance begins with the reign
                    of King William I. (1816-1864), who exerted himself in every way to improve and
                    beautify his capital. In 1849 Stuttgart was the. place of meeting of the
                    so-called “Rump Parliament” (Rumpfparlament). Among its eminent natives are
                    Hegel (b. 1770), the philosopher, and Hauff (b. 1802), the poet and
                    story-teller.</p>
