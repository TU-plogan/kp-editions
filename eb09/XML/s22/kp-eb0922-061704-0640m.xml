                    considerable fortune, of which the poet was left master at the age of eighteen.

                    learning. Mr Alfred Suckling, who edited his works in 1836, corrected this
                    error, ascertaining that he was born at Whitton in Middlesex and baptized on
                    10th February 1609. He was sent to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1623, at what
                    was then the usual age, and thereafter travelled on the Continent, as was also
                    the custom for youths of his birth. Returning to London, he did not long remain
                    inactive at court, but sought experience as a soldier, volunteering into the
                    force raised by the marquis of Hamilton for the support of Gustavus Adolphus in
                    the Palatinate. He reached Germany in July 1631 and was back at Whitehall in May
                    1632; but during this time he saw a good deal of hard service, being present at
                    the battle of Leipsic and the sieges of Crossen, Guben, Glogau, and Magdeburg.
                    Reappearing at court, he at once became a prominent figure. “He had the peculiar
                    happiness of making everything that he did become him.” He was ready of wit,
                    handsome of person, wealthy and generous, a leader in all pastimes, the best
                    bowler and the best card-player at court. His happy skill in verse was only one
                    of the distinctions of a man who excelled in everything; but, as it happened,
                    both the king and the queen had literary tastes, and he aimed at distinction in
                    poetry with the ardent thoroughness which seems to have been part of his
                    character. He became eminent at court just at the time when masques, after being
                    the rage for a few years, had reached the height of their splendour and were
                    beginning to pall; and it occurred to him to apply to the ordinary drama the
                    improved scenery which the taste for masques had developed. We can trace in his
                    plays both the taste for spectacular effect and the admiration for the wit of
                    Shakespeare which he shared with his royal master. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aglaura</hi> was the first of them, and is said to have been the first play
                    produced with elaborate stage scenery. It was produced first at Christmas in
                    1637 with a tragic ending, then reproduced at the following Easter with
                    ingenious changes in the fifth act which made it end happily. With all its
                    clever play on words and images, and its natural felicity of diction, it is not
                    an interesting drama to read; the characters have no body or vitality. But it is
                    full of incident, as if the dramatist were revelling in the newly discovered
                    power of shifting the scenes, and making the most of his advantage in having the
                    co-operation of Inigo Jones. His comedy the <hi rend="italic">Goblins</hi> is
                    much happier, and there the frequent changes of scene are used with great skill
                    to maintain the liveliness of the action. Suckling produced another tragedy in
                    1639, <hi rend="italic">Brennoralt;</hi> it has more body than its predecessor,
                    but shows no mastery of passion or tragic character. He began still another
                    tragedy, the <hi rend="italic">Sad One,</hi> but was abruptly stopped in his
                    literary career by the beginning of a tragedy in real life, the quarrel between
                    Charles and his subjects. Suckling took a prominent part for a time on the
                    Royalist side. When war was levied on the Scottish Covenanters in 1639 Suckling
                    raised a troop of a hundred horse at his own expense and accompanied them on the
                    bloodless expedition to the Border. He was elected member for Bramber to the
                    Long Parliament which met in November 1640; but in May of the following year he
                    got into trouble in connexion with a plot for the escape of Strafford from the
                    Tower and a project for calling in French aid, was charged with high treason,
                    and fled beyond sea. The circumstances of his short life in exile are obscure.
                    He continued to attract attention, and many pamphlets about him were circulated,
                    one in particular describing how he eloped with a lady to Spain and fell into
                    the clutches of the Inquisition. The tradition is that he committed suicide in
                    Paris some time before the end of 1642. Suckling’s reputation as a poet rests
                    not upon his plays but upon his minor pieces. They have wit and fancy and at
                    times exquisite felicity of diction. The happiest as a whole is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ballad upon a Wedding.</hi> “Prithee, why so pale, fond lover ?”
                    is an occasional song in <hi rend="italic">Aglaura.</hi></p>
                <p>A collection of Suckling’s poems was first published in 1646 with the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Fragmenta Aurea.</hi> The so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Selections</hi> published by Mr Alfred Suckling in 1836 is really a full
                    edition of his poems, letters, and plays, which was re-edited, with slight
                    additions, by Mr W. C. Hazlitt in 1874.</p>
