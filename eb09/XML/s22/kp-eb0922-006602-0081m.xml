                    in 1837. He then became assistant to his father in chemistry, mineralogy, and
                    geology, working in his laboratory at the college, and pursuing original
                    investigations. He began teaching in the laboratory soon afterwards. The school
                    thus informally established was shortly afterwards recognized by a formal act of
                    the corporation of the college, and ultimately developed into the Sheffield
                    Scientific School of Yale College. In 1838 he became associate editor with his
                    father of the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Science and Arts,</hi> and
                    he continued in the editorship of the journal until the close of his life, Prof.
                    J. D. Dana (his brother-in-law) having joined him in 1846. In the winter of
                    1845-46 he gave a course of lectures on agricultural chemistry in New Orleans,
                    which is believed to have been the first course of lectures upon that subject
                    ever given in the United States. In 1849 he was appointed professor of medical
                    chemistry and toxicology in the medical department of Louisville university,
                    Louisville, Kentucky, which position he held for five years. In 1854 he
                    succeeded his father as professor of chemistry, and continued to give
                    instruction in this science, first in the academical and afterwards in the
                    medical department of Yale College, until his death in 1885. In 1853 he was
                    connected with the exhibition at the Crystal Palace in New York, having charge
                    of the departments of chemistry, geology, and mineralogy. As a result of this
                    work he edited a large quarto volume, <hi rend="italic">The World of Science,
                    Art, and Industry</hi> (1853), followed in 1854 by <hi rend="italic">The
                    Progress of Science and Mechanism.</hi> He also published in 1846 <hi
                    rend="italic">First Principles of Chemistry,</hi> a text-book which had a wide
                    sale and passed through three editions. In 1858 he published a manual of physics
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">First Principles of Physics or Natural
                    Philosophy</hi> (2d ed. 1861). In 1864 and again in 1867 and 1872 Silliman
                    visited California, being engaged in professional work connected with various
                    mines and in mineralogical and geological explorations. Still later he made
                    several visits to the mining regions of the western States and Territories, and
                    the results of his observations formed the subjects of numerous scientific
                    papers. In 1874, the centennial anniversary of Priestley’s discovery of oxygen,
                    he delivered at Northumberland, Pa., where Priestley had resided during the
                    later years of his life, an historical address on “Amer<pb break="no"

                    afterwards expanded into a considerable volume.</p>
