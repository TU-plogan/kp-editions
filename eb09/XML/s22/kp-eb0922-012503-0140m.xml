                    describes it as “enfans du diable, que les Hurons appelle Scangaresse, .... une
                    beste fort puante,” &amp;c. This fully shows in what reputation the skunk was
                    then held, a reputation which has lasted to the present time, and has become so
                    notorious that the mere name of skunk is an opprobrious epithet and can hardly
                    be used in polite society.</p>
                <p>The skunks, for there are several species of these animals, are members of the
                    Meline or badger-like section of the family <hi rend="italic">Mustelidae,</hi>
                    which contains also the<pb break="no"

                    largest family of the <hi rend="italic">Arctoidea</hi> or bear-like division of
                    the Land <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> vol. xv. p. 439-40, where the zoological characters of these
                    groups are given in detail).</p>
                <p>The common skunk <hi rend="italic">(Mephitis mephitica)</hi> is a native of North
                    America, extending from Hudson’s Bay southwards to Guatemala in Central America.
                    It is a beautiful little animal, about the size of a cat, though of a stouter
                    and heavier build, with rich lustrous black fur, strikingly varied on the back
                    by a very variably shaped patch or streak of white. Its muzzle is long and
                    pointed, its eyes sharp and bead-like, and its grey or white tail is long and
                    unusually bushy.</p>
                <p>The following account of the habits and disposition of the skunk is extracted
                    from Dr C. Hart Merriam’s <hi rend="italic">Mammals of the Adirondack Region,
                    New York,</hi> 1884 :—</p>
                <p>“The skunk preys upon mice, salamanders, frogs, and the eggs of birds that nest
                    on or within reach from the ground. At times he eats carrion, and if he chances
                    to stumble upon a hen’s nest the eggs are liable to suffer; and once in a while
                    he acquires the evil habit of robbing the hen-roost, but as a rule skunks are
                    not addicted to this vice.</p>
                <p>“Of all our native mammals perhaps no one is so universally abused and has so
                    many unpleasant things said about it as the innocent subject of the present
                    biography; and yet no other species is half so valuable to the farmer.
                    Pre-eminently an insect-eater, he destroys more beetles, grasshoppers, and the
                    like than all our other mammals together, and in addition to these he devours
                    vast numbers of mice.</p>
                <p>“He does not evince that dread of man that is so manifest in the vast majority of
                    our mammals, and when met during any of his circumambulations rarely thinks of
                    running away. He is slow in movement and deliberate in action and does not often
                    hurry himself in whatever he does. His ordinary gait is a measured walk, but
                    when pressed for time he breaks into a low shuffling gallop. It is hard to
                    intimidate a skunk, but when once really frightened he manages to get over the
                    ground at a very fair pace.</p>
                <p>“Skunks remain active throughout the greater part of the year in this region, and
                    hibernate only during the severest portion of the winter. They differ from most
                    of our hibernating mammals in that the inactive period is apparently dependent
                    solely on the temperature, while the mere amount of snow has no influence
                    whatever upon their movements.</p>
                <p>“Skunks, particularly when young, make very pretty pets, being attractive in
                    appearance, gentle in disposition, interesting in manners, and cleanly in
                    habits—rare qualities indeed! They are playful, sometimes mischievous, and
                    manifest considerable affection for those who have the care of them. Their flesh
                    is white, tender, and sweet, and is delicious eating.</p>
                <p>“Skunks have large families, from six to ten young being commonly raised each
                    season; and as a rule they all live in the same hole until the following
                    spring.”</p>
                <p>We now come to the consideration of the remarkable and overpowering odour which
                    has brought the skunk into such evil notoriety, and which is not the mere smell
                    of the animal itself, as in the case of most other evilsmelling mammals, but
                    arises from the much-modified secretion of the anal glands. These glands,
                    although present in all <hi rend="italic">Mustelidae,</hi> are especially
                    developed in the skunks, and are peculiar for being so entirely under the
                    control of the animal that at ordinary times, as Dr Merriam has stated, the
                    animal is enabled to be both cleanly and free from smell. The glands which
                    secrete the odoriferous fluid are modifications of the ordinary anal glands
                    possessed by nearly all <hi rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> but in the skunks they
                    are enormously enlarged, entirely surround the rectum, and are provided with
                    thick muscular gizzard-like coats. The two ducts leading from these glands open
                    at the tips of two small conical papillae placed just inside the anus, in such a
                    position that by everting the anus the animal can protrude them externally, and
                    with them can guide the direction of the jet of nauseous fluid, which is often
                    propelled by the powerful muscles surrounding the glands to a distance of from 8
                    to 12 feet.</p>
                <p>It is almost needless to state that the old stories about the skunk’s smell
                    arising from its urine, and of its splashing the fluid about with its tail are
                    both entirely without foundation. The secretion itself is a clear yellowish
                    liquid, with a marvellously penetrating ammoniacal and nauseous smell. So
                    powerful and penetrating is this smell that Dr Merriam says, “I have known the
                    scent to become strikingly apparent in every part of a well-closed house, in
                    winter, within five minutes time after a skunk had been killed at a distance of
                    more than a hundred yards,” and under favourable conditions it may be distinctly
                    perceived at a distance of more than a mile; instances are also on record of
                    persons having become entirely unconscious after inhaling the smell. On the
                    other hand it is said to act as a potent remedy in cases of asthma and similar
                    diseases, but to most people such a remedy would be almost worse than the
                    disease itself.</p>
                <p>The other species of skunk are the following :—</p>
                <p>The Long-tailed Skunk (<hi rend="italic">Mephitis macrum),</hi> a native of
                    central and southern Mexico, differs from the common species by generally having
                    two white stripes along its sides, and by its much longer and bushier tail.</p>
                <p>The little Striped Skunk <hi rend="italic">(Mephitis putorius),</hi> found in the
                    southern United States, and ranging southwards to Yucatan and Guatemala, is much
                    smaller than <hi rend="italic">M. mephitica,</hi> and its colouring is of a very
                    peculiar and striking nature, consisting of four interrupted longitudinal white
                    stripes on a black ground, the general aspect of the animal being one of the
                    most beautiful and striking in all this brightly marked family. Its skull also
                    differs to such an extent from that of the common skunk that this species has
                    been separated as a distinct genus under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spilogale,</hi> but there is hardly sufficient reason for this.</p>
                <p>Finally, the Conepatl <hi rend="italic">(Concρatus mapurito),</hi> the skunk of
                    tropical America, ranging from Texas to Chili and Patagonia, differs still more
                    from the true skunks, although in colour it is almost precisely similar to the
                    common species, varying in the same way and to the same remarkable extent in the
                    relative development of the black and white. Its build is heavier than in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mephitis</hi>; its snout and head are more pig-like; and its
                    nostrils open downwards and forwards instead of laterally on the sides of the
                    muzzle. Its skull has many special characters, and its teeth are different in
                    shape and, as a rule, in number also, the first minute premolar of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mephitis</hi> being almost invariably absent, so that its dental
                    formula is only i <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,
                    c <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi
