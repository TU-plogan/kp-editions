                <p><label type="entry">SIMPSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir James Young,
                    Bart</hi></label>. (1811-1870), physician, was born in the town of Bathgate,
                    Linlithgow, Scotland, on the 7th of June 1811. His father was a baker in that
                    town, who largely owed a moderate success in business to a shrewd and managing
                    wife. James was the youngest of a family of eight, and for the furtherance of
                    his worldly prospects the others struggled and sacrificed. At the age of
                    fourteen he entered the university of Edinburgh as a student in the arts
                    classes. Two years later he began his medical studies. At the age of nineteen he
                    obtained the licence of the College of Surgeons, and two years afterwards took
                    the degree of doctor of medicine. Dr Thomson, who then occupied the chair of
                    pathology in the university, impressed with the graduation thesis, “On Death
                    from Inflammation,” presented by Simpson, offered him his assistantship. The
                    offer was accepted, and during the session 1837-38 he acted as interim lecturer
                    on pathology during the illness of the professor. The following winter he
                    delivered his first course of lectures on obstetric medicine in the
                    extra-academical school. On February 4, 1840, he was elected to the
                    professorship of medicine and midwifery in the university. Towards the end of
                    1846 he was present at an operation performed by Liston on a patient rendered
                    unconscious by the inhalation of sulphuric ether. The success of the proceeding
                    was so marked that Simpson immediately began to use it in midwifery practice. He
                    continued, however, to search for other substances having similar effects, and
                    in March 1847 he read a paper on chloroform to the Medico-Chirurgical Society of
                    Edinburgh, in which he fully detailed the history of the use of anaesthetics
                    from the earliest times, but especially dwelt upon the advantages of chloroform
                    over ether. He advocated its use, not only for the prevention of pain in
                    surgical operations, but also for the relief of pain in obstetrical practice.
                    His strong and uncompromising advocacy of its use in the latter class of cases
                    gave rise to one of the angriest and most widespread controversies of the time,
                    and, although his views may not have been generally indorsed by later
                    professional practice, anaesthetics in surgical operations have from that time
                    held an indisputed place, and Simpson’s anaesthetic still continues the
                    favourite in the practice of the Edinburgh school. In 1847 he was appointed a
                    physician to the queen in Scotland. In 1859 he advocated the use of acupressure
                    in place of ligatures for arresting bleeding; his views on this subject have,
                    however, given place to improvements in the ligature and to a better knowledge
                    of the conditions influencing its efficiency. His contributions to the
                    literature of his profession and to archaeology, in which latter he took an
                    active interest, were very numerous, and embrace <hi rend="italic">Obstetric
                    Memoirs and Contributions</hi> (2 vols.), <hi rend="italic">Homoeopathy,
                    Acupressure, Selected Obstetrical Works, Anaesthesia and Hospitalism, Clinical
                    Lectures on the Diseases of Women,</hi> and three volumes of essays on
                    archaeological subjects. Simpson, who had been created a baronet in 1866, died
                    on May 6th 1870, and was accorded a public funeral; his statue in bronze now
                    stands in West Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>Simpson was a man of strong individuality and somewhat hasty temper, an
                    uncompromising and aggressive opponent when he believed himself in the right,
                    yet so tender and sympathetic that he endeared himself to an immense circle of
                    friends and patients. Endowed with great mental power, activity, and
                    receptivity, he performed a very large amount of literary work, much of which
                    was of great value at the time and still continues to be of interest. He will,
                    however, be chiefly remembered in the annals of medicine as a great personality,
                    who brilliantly fought and won the battle for anaesthetics, and introduced
                    chloroform.</p>
