                    English scholar and poet of the 15th century. Mr Dyce, the editor of his works,
                    fixes his birth about 1460. His first essay in verse was a poem after the manner
                    of Lydgate on the death of Edward IV. (1483). He lived to pay compliments to
                    Catherine, wife of Henry VIII., to jeer at the Scotch over the battle of
                    Flodden, and to make fierce attacks on Wolsey, and is supposed to have died in
                    1529. In general intellectual force, fierceness of invective, wildness of
                    buffoonery, and coarseness of language Skelton bears some likeness to Swift. But
                    he stands by himself as one of the most eccentric and paradoxical characters in
                    English literature. He began life apparently as the protegé of a pious, learned,
                    and literary lady, the mother of Henry VII., who founded St John’s College and
                    Christ’s College, Cambridge, and translated devotional works from the French. He
                    was himself one of the most notable scholars of his time, was appointed tutor to

                    applied this title as well as that of <hi rend="italic">orator regius</hi> to
                    himself without challenge. At about the age of forty he took orders, and was
                    appointed rector of Diss in Norfolk, where he seems to have spent the last
                    twenty-five years of his life. Yet this eminent scholar and churchman is the
                    author of the oldest and the best drinking song in the English language—the
                    drinking song in <hi rend="italic">Gammer Gurton's Needle,</hi> and of one of
                    the coarsest poems in any language— <hi rend="italic">The Tunning of Elinor
                        Rumming.</hi> He is the author of a satire against the clergy of his time—
                        <hi rend="italic">Colin Clout,—</hi> unsurpassed in pre-Reformation
                    literature for direct and merciless ridicule, and of a satire against the great
                    cardinal when at the height of his greatness— <hi rend="italic">Why come ye not
                        to Court?—</hi> boiling over with ferocious invective and insolent contempt.
                    At the same time he had such a repute for rough wit and irregularity of life
                    that he became the hero of a book of “merry tales.” These mythical tales were
                    probably in the mind of the historian who has described Skelton as a “ribald
                    buffoon,” “a profligate and ill-living wretch.” Whether the real Skelton
                    deserved such epithets is doubtful; his verse undoubtedly contains much that may
                    fairly be described as ribaldry and buffoonery. It has not a trace of the
                    chivalrous spirit of Chaucer, and his most characteristic form, known as
                    Skeltonical verse, is wayward and unconventional—adopted as if in mad defiance
                    of regular metre. Still, as Skelton himself claimed for it, “it has in it some
                    pith.”</p>
                <p>“Though my ryme be ragged,</p>
                <p>Tattered, and jagged,</p>
                <p>Rudely rain-beaten,</p>
                <p>Rusty and moth-eaten,</p>
                <p>If ye take well therewith It hath in it some pith.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Colin Clout, Why come ye not to Court?</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">The Book of Philip Sparrow</hi> —which Coleridge pronounced
                    “an exquisite and original poem ”—are written in this metre. <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Bouge</hi> (ship) <hi rend="italic">of Court,</hi> a satirical vision
                    of personified abstractions, is more conventional in form, and was probably one
                    of his earlier works. Both it and his interlude <hi rend="italic"
                        >Magnificence</hi> show great power in the vivid description of
                    character.</p>
