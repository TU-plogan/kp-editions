                    S.W. and W. by Dumbartonshire. In the north-east there are two isolated
                    portions,—one forming the parish of Alva, bounded partly by Clackmannan and
                    partly by Perthshire, and the other forming part of the parish of Logie and
                    bounded by Perthshire. The outlines of the main portion are extremely irregular,
                    the boundary on the north following for the most part the windings of the Forth,
                    while on the west it passes through the middle of Loch Lomond, and on the south
                    coincides to a considerable extent with various streams. The extreme length of
                    the county from north-west to south-east is about 45 miles, and the greatest
                    breadth from north to south about 18 miles. The land area is 286,338 acres, and
                    the total area 298,579 acres, or about 466 square miles. Apart from the district
                    round Loch Lomond, the principal charm of the scenery of Stirlingshire is in the
                    views of the valley of the Forth with the winding river, and for background the
                    distant peaks of the Grampians, or the nearer ranges of the Ochils, which
                    encroach on the north-eastern corner and detached sections of the county. The
                    valley of the Forth runs along nearly the whole of the northern border, widening
                    towards the east. The centre of the county from north-east to south-west is
                    occupied by the broad irregular ranges of the Lennox Hills, which are known
                    under four different names, according to the parishes in which they are
                    principally situated,—the Gargunnock Hills (attaining a height of 1591 feet),
                    the Fintry Hills (1676), the Kilsyth Hills (1393), and the Campsie Fells (1894).
                    Nearly the whole of the county to the north-east of Loch Lomond is occupied by a
                    spur of the Grampians, reaching in Ben Lomond a height of 3192 feet. Besides
                    Loch Lomond, situated partly in Dumbartonshire, and Loch Katrine, which bounds
                    the county at its north-western corner, the principal lakes are Loch Arklet to
                    the south of Loch Katrine, Loch Coulter, in the south of St Ninians parish, Loch
                    Ellrig in Falkirk parish, and Black Loch partly in Lanarkshire. The river Forth,
                    from its junction with the Kelty near Gartmore, forms the northern boundary of
                    the county, except where it bounds on the north the part of Kippen parish which
                    is in Perthshire and separates a portion of Lecropt parish from that of St
                    Ninians and a portion of Logie from that of St Ninians and Stirling. It receives
                    from the north the Teith, which touches the county at Lecropt parish, and the
                    Allan, which separates the parishes of Lecropt and Logie, and from the south the
                    Boquhan burn, the Touch burn, and the Bannock burn. The Carron water flows
                    eastwards from the Fintry Hills to the Firth of Forth at Grangemouth. On the
                    south there are a number of streams which form at various places the boundary of
                    the county,—the Endrick water flowing westwards from the Fintry Hills to Loch
                    Lomond, the Kelvin from near Kilsyth flowing south-westwards to the Clyde, and
                    the Avon from Lanarkshire flowing north-eastwards to the Firth of Forth. The
                    Forth and Clyde Canal crosses the south-eastern corner of the county from
                    Castlecary to Grangemouth.</p>
                <p>The whole of the district to the north of Loch Lomond is occupied by the
                    crystalline schists of the Highlands, which, by the existence of a great fault,
                    are connected on the east with the Old Red Sandstone, which occupies the broad
                    valley between the base of the Highland hills and the chain of the Ochils. These
                    latter heights, portions of which are included in detached areas of the county,
                    consist of volcanic rocks associated with the Old Red Sandstone (see vol. x. p.
                    343). The Lennox Hills in the centre of the county are formed by volcanic rocks
                    of Carbonifer ous age resting on strata of red and white sandstone (see vol. x.
                    p. 346). The lower grounds are deeply buried under glacial drifts, and
                    conspicuously marked by broad terraces that represent former sea-margins. On one
                    of these, at a height of 50 feet above the present sea-level, lies the Carse of
                    Falkirk. Another stands at an elevation of about 100 feet. There are saline
                    mineral springs at Bridge of Allan.</p>
                <p>The coalfield runs obliquely along the south-east of the county, the principal
                    seams being in Denny, Kilsyth, Larbert, Falkirk, and Slamannan parishes.
                    Ironstone, fireclay, and oil-shale are also found. Limestone is extensively
                    wrought in the Campsie district, and there are a number of sandstone quarries in
                    various parts of the county. The total output of coal in 1884 was 1,182,891
                    tons, of ironstone 75,351 tons, of fireclay 15,872, and of oil-shale 4535.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> According to the landowners return of
                    1872-73 the land was held by 4257 proprietors, possessing 284,751 acres, at an
                    annual valuation of £521,407, an average value all over of £1,16s. 3¾d. Of the
                    proprietors 3409 possessed less than one acre. The following possessed over 5000
                    acres each:—Duke of Montrose, 68,878; William Forbes, 13,041; Rear-admiral Sir
                    William Edmonstone, 9778; Hon. Mrs. Margaret Lennox, 7606; Alex. Graham Speirs,
                    7172; W. C. G. Bontine, 6931; Lieutenant-Col. John Murray, 6813; Sir Alex. C. R.
                    Gibson-Maitland, 6023; Henry Fletcher Campbell, 5679; and James Johnstone, 5340.
                    The two arable soils of Stirlingshire are distinguished locally as carse and
                    dryfield, the remainder of the county being occupied by mountain pasture land,
                    moor, and moss. The Carse of Stirling extends along the banks of the Forth from
                    Buchlyvie to the eastern extremity of the county,— a length of about 28 miles,
                    with a breadth varying from 1 to 4 miles, the total area being about 30,000
                    acres. The carse soil consists of the finest clays, without stones, but
                    interspersed with strata of marine shells. It has been partly reclaimed from
                    superincumbent peat moss, of which there are still considerable areas adjoining
                    it. It requires a great deal of labour, but, by means of draining, subsoil
                    ploughing, and the use of lime, has been rendered one of the most fertile soils
                    in Scotland, being specially well adapted for wheat and beans. The dryfield
                    occupies the slopes of the hills above the carse and the valleys in the interior
                    of the county, which constitute the more fertile portions, the crops for which
                    it is best suited being potatoes and turnips. A great part of the dryfield has
                    been reclaimed from moor within the present century. The Lennox Hills, occupying
                    about a fourth of the total area of the county, form one of the most valuable
                    tracts of pasture land in Scotland. The following table gives a classification
                    of the holdings in 1875 and 1885 :—</p>

                <p>According to the agricultural returns for 1886, out of a total of 295,285 acres
                    115,477, or nearly 39 per cent., were arable land, the area under corn crops
                    amounting to 29,306 acres, under green crops to 8752, rotation grasses 30,664,
                    permanent pasture 45,232, flax 15 and fallow 1508. Oats, the principal corn
                    crop, occupied 19,662 acres, wheat 2065 acres (a decrease of about one half
                    within twenty years), barley 4297 acres, rye 30, beans 3221, and pease 31. Of
                    green crops the principal are potatoes (3500 acres) and turnips (4623 acres).
                    Considerably more than half of the arable area is occupied by rotation grasses
                    and permanent pasture, and their acreage is constantly increasing, which is
                    sufficiently accounted for by the steady increase in the numbers of sheep and
                    cattle. The number of horses in 1886 was 4616, of which 3176 were used solely
                    for purposes of agriculture, and 1440 were unbroken horses and mares kept solely
                    for purposes of breeding. The Clydesdale breed are in general use on the larger
                    farms. Cattle in 1886 numbered 29,422, of which 10,745 were cows and heifers in
                    milk or in calf, and 8684 were other cattle two years old and above.
                    Butter-making is largely practised on the dryfield farms, the Ayrshire being the
                    principal breed of cows, but cattle-feeding is also an important industry, for
                    which Irish cattle and cross breeds are frequently bought, a considerable number
                    of shorthorns being also reared. Sheep, chiefly blackfaced, for which there is
                    extensive pasturage on the Lennox Hills and the slopes of the Grampians,
                    numbered 109,897 in 1886, and pigs 1775.</p>
                <p>Though, as is evident from the remains of trees in the mosses, an extensive
                    district of the county was at one time occupied by forest, it is now
                    comparatively devoid of timber, the area under woods in 1881 being only 12,483
                    acres. There is a natural tendency to the growth of birch on the lower slopes of
                    the mountains in the parishes<pb break="no"

                    on the borders of Loch Lomond. Larch and Scotch firs principally occupy the
                    modern plantations in the other parts of the county. In 1886 there were only 31
                    acres under orchards, 27 under market gardens, and 53 under nursery grounds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures. —</hi> The Carron ironworks, founded in 1760, for
                    a long time led the van in British iron manufacture, and are still among the
                    most extensive in the kingdom. The Falkirk ironworks, founded in 1819, are the
                    next to them in importance in the county, but there are many others in the same
                    district. The woollen manufacture is next to iron in importance. It includes
                    carpets, tartans, shawls, and tweeds, the principal seats of the industry being
                    Alva, Bannockburn, Cambusbarron, and Stirling. Calico printing is carried on in
                    the western part of the county, especially at Campsie and Milngavie. There are
                    chemical works at Stirling, Falkirk, Denny, and Campsie. Throughout the county
                    there are a considerable number of breweries and distilleries. At Grangemouth,
                    the principal port in the county, shipbuilding is carried on.</p>

                    prisons in both towns. The high court of justiciary holds circuit courts at
                    Stirling. There are 21 entire civil parishes within the county and parts of 5

                    burgh of barony, and Alva (4961), Bridge of Allan (3005), Denny and Dunipace
                    (4080), Grangemouth (4424), and Milngavie (2636) police burghs. In addition to
                    these the following places had each upwards of 2000 inhabitants:</p>
                <p>Bannockburn (2549), Lennoxtown (3249), and Stenhousemuir (2617). From 39,761 in
                    1765 the population of the county had by 1801 increased to 50,825, by 1831 to
                    72,621, by 1861 to 91,926, by 1871 to 98,176, and by 1881 to 112,443, of whom
                    56,147 were males and 56,296 were females. The number of persons to the square
                    mile is 251, and in point of density Stirling ranks ninth among the counties of
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>One member is returned to parliament by the county, and Stirling and Falkirk are
                    members of separate districts of burghs, which are respectively named from them,
                    each returning one member.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> In 81 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the Romans
                    under Agricola penetrated as far north as the firths of Clyde (Clota) and Forth
                    (Bodotria). To secure their conquests they erected between these a line of forts
                    or <hi rend="italic">praesidia,</hi> generally two miles apart. In 139 Lollius
                    Urbicus erected along the line of the forts the rampart of Antoninus’s wall,
                    afterwards known as Graham’s dyke. The wall, after crossing the parish of East
                    Kilpatrick, passed outside the present county of Stirling, till it reached
                    Castlecary, whence it passed by Camelon and Falkirk to Carriden in
                    Linlithgowshire. Castlecary, where many Roman remains have been found, was
                    perhaps the principal Roman station on the line of the wall, and there was
                    another important one at Camelon. A Roman road, the Camelon causeway, passed
                    eastwards from Castlecary to the south of the rampart, and after two miles
                    crossed it and held on to Camelon, whence it went northward by Bannockburn, St
                    Ninians, and Stirling to the Forth, where there was an important station near
                    the present bridge of Drip. Thence it passed north by Keir to Dunblane. To the
                    north-east of the Carron ironworks there was at one time a finely-preserved
                    circular Roman building, called Arthur’s Oon (oven) or Julius’s Hof, which was
                    demolished in 1743, but of which a drawing is preserved in Camden’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Britannia.</hi> In the parish of Dunipace are two beautiful mounds
                    called “the Hills of Dunipace,” which some have supposed to have been erected as
                    monuments of peace between the Romans and Caledonians, but which are more
                    probably of natural origin. Tho remains of what was supposed to have been an
                    early British stronghold were discovered at Torwood in 1864. A group of cairns
                    at Craigmaddie, near Milngavie, is supposed to mark the scene of a battle
                    between the Picts and Danes. Among the remains of old feudal castles may be
                    mentioned Graham’s castle, among the Fintry Hills, which belonged to Sir John de
                    Graham, who was killed in the battle of Falkirk in 1298; Herbertshire, on the
                    north bank of the Carron near Denny, originally a royal hunting seat, and still
                    one of the finest embattled residences in the county (now a boarding school);
                    the ancient keep of Castlecary, partly destroyed by the Highlanders in 1715;
                    Torwood, surrounded by the remains of the Caledonian forest, in one of the oaks
                    of which Wallace took refuge; and the round tower of Carnock, called Bruce’s
                    castle, of unknown history. Sir William Wallace lived occasionally with his
                    uncle, the parson of Dunipace, and the county is specially associated with his
                    exploits and those of Robert Bruce, being the scene of some of the principal
                    battles in the struggle for Scottish independence (Stirling bridge, September
                    10, 1297; Falkirk, July 22, 1298; Bannockburn, June 24, 1314). At Sauchieburn,
                    11th June 1488, James III. was defeated by his insurgent nobles, and during his
                    flight, having stopped at a cottage in the village of Milton, was there stabbed
                    to death. Kilsyth saw the defeat of the Covenanters by Montrose, 15th August
                    1645, a result which for a time laid Scotland at Montrose’s feet; and a hundred
                    years afterwards—17th January 1746—the Highlanders under Prince Charles Edward
                    routed the Hanoverians at Falkirk.</p>
