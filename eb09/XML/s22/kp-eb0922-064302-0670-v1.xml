                    dictated by political, or economic, or moral considerations. They have existed
                    both in ancient and in modern states. In Greece, it was amongst the Dorian
                    races, whose temper was austere and rigid, that they most prevailed. All the
                    inhabitants of Laconia were forbidden to attend drinking entertainments, nor
                    could a Lacedaemonian possess a house or furniture which was the work of more

                    of the <hi rend="italic">pheiditia</hi> (public meals) than by special
                    enactments. The possession of gold or silver was interdicted to the citizens of
                    Sparta, and the use of iron money alone was permitted by the Lycurgean
                    legislation. “Even in the cities which had early departed from the Doric
                    customs,” says K. O. Müller, “there were frequent and strict prohibitions
                    against expensiveness of female attire, prostitutes alone being wisely
                    excepted.” In the Locrian code of Zaleucus citizens were forbidden to drink
                    undiluted wine. The Solonian sumptuary enactments were directed principally
                    against the extravagance of female apparel and dowries of excessive amount;
                    costly banquets also were forbidden, and expensive funeral solemnities. The
                    Pythagoreans in Magna Gracia not only protested against the luxury of their time
                    but encouraged legislation with a view to restraining it.</p>
                <p>At Rome the system of sumptuary edicts and enactments was largely developed,
                    whilst the objects of such legislation were concurrently sought to be attained
                    through the exercise of the censorial power. The code of the Twelve Tables
                    contained provisions limiting the expenditure on funerals. The most important
                    sumptuary laws of the Roman commonwealth were those which follow. (1) The Oppian
                    law, 215 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> provided that no woman should possess
                    more than half an ounce of gold, or wear a dress of different colours, or ride
                    in a carriage in the city or within a mile of it except on occasions of public
                    religious ceremonies. This law, which had been partly dictated by the financial
                    necessities of the conflict with Hannibal, was repealed twenty years later,
                    against the advice of Cato. Livy (xxxiv. 1-8) gives an interesting account of
                    the commotion excited by the proposal of the repeal, and of the exertions of the
                    Roman women against the law, which almost amounted to a female <hi rend="italic"
                        >émeute. (2)</hi> The Orchian law, 187 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    limited the number of guests at entertainments. An attempt being made to repeal
                    this law, Cato offered strong opposition and delivered a speech on the subject,
                    of which some fragments have been preserved. (3) The Fannian law, 161 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> limited the sums to be spent on entertainments;
                    it provided amongst other things that no fowl should be served but a single hen,
                    and that not fattened. (4) The Didian law, 143 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    extended to the whole of Italy the provisions of the Fannian law, and made the
                    guests as well as the givers of entertainments at which the law was violated
                    liable to the penalties. After a considerable interval, Sulla anew directed
                    legislation against the luxury of the table and also limited the cost of
                    funerals and of sepulchral monuments. We are told that he violated his own law
                    as to funerals when burying his wife Metella, and also his law on entertainments
                    when seeking to forget his grief for her loss in extravagant drinking and
                    feasting (Plut., <hi rend="italic">Sull.,</hi> 35). Julius Caesar, in the
                    capacity of <hi rend="italic">praefectus moribus,</hi> after the African war
                    re-enacted some of the sumptuary laws which had fallen into neglect; Cicero
                    implies <hi rend="italic">{fEp. ad Att.,</hi> xiii. 7) that in Caesar’s absence
                    his legislation of this kind was not attended to. Suetonius tells us that Caesar
                    had officers stationed in the market-places to seize such provisions as were
                    forbidden by law, and sent lictors and soldiers to feasts to remove all illegal
                    eatables <hi rend="italic">(Jul.,</hi> 43). Augustus fixed anew the expense to
                    be incurred in entertainments on ordinary and festal days. Tiberius also sought
                    to check inordinate expense on banquets, and a decree of the senate was passed
                    in his reign forbidding the use of gold vases except in sacred rites, and
                    prohibiting the wearing of silk garments by men. But it appears from Tacitus
                        (<hi rend="italic">Ann</hi>., iii. 5, where a speech is put into his mouth
                    very much in the spirit of Horace’s “Quid leges sine moribus Vanae proficiunt?
                    ”), that he looked more to the improvement of manners than to direct legislative
                    action for the restriction of luxury. Suetonius mentions some regulations made
                    by Nero, and we hear of further legislation of this kind by Hadrian and later
                    emperors. In the time of Tertullian the sumptuary laws appear to have been
                    things of the past <hi rend="italic">(Apol.,</hi> c. vi.).</p>
                <p>In modern times the first important sumptuary legislation was—in Italy that of
                    Frederick II.; in Aragon that of James I., in 1234; in France that of Philip
                    IV.; in England that of Edward II. and Edward III. In 1294 Philip IV. made
                    provisions as to the dress and the table expenditure of the several orders of
                    men in his kingdom, the most remarkable of which may be seen in Guizot’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Civilisation en France,</hi> leç. 15. Charles V. of France
                    forbade the use of long-pointed shoes, a fashion against which popes and
                    councils had protested in vain. Under later kings the use of gold and silver
                    embroidery, silk stuffs, and fine linen wares was restricted,—at first moral and
                    afterwards economic motives being put forward, the latter especially from the
                    rise of the mercantile theory. In England we hear much from the writers of the
                    14th century of the extravagance of dress at that period. They remark both on
                    the great splendour and expensiveness of the apparel of the higher orders and on
                    the fantastic and deforming fashions adopted by persons of all ranks. The
                    parliament held at Westminster in 1363 made laws (37 Edw. III. c. 8-14) to
                    restrain this undue expenditure and to regulate the dress of the several classes
                    of the people. These statutes were repealed in the following year, but similar
                    ones were passed again in the same reign. They seem, however, to have had little
                    effect, for in the reign of Richard II. the same excesses prevailed, apparently
                    in a still greater degree. Another statute was passed in the year 1463 (3 Edw.
                    IV. c. 5) for the regulation of the dress of persons of all ranks. In this it
                    was stated that “the commons of the realm, as well men as women, wear excessive
                    and inordinate apparel to the great displeasure of God, the enriching of strange
                    realms, and the destruction of this realm.” An Act of 1444 had previously
                    regulated the clothing, when it formed a part of the wages, of servants employed
                    in husbandry; a bailiff or overseer was to have an allowance of 5s. a year for
                    his clothing, a hind or principal servant 4s., and an ordinary servant 3s.
                    4d.,—sums equivalent respectively to 50s., 40s., and 33s. 4d. of our money
                    (Henry). Already in the reign of Edward II. a proclamation had been issued
                    against the “outrageous and excessive multitude of meats and dishes which the
                    great men of the kingdom had used, and still used, in their castles,” as well as
                    “persons of inferior rank imitating their example, beyond what their stations
                    required and their circumstances could afford ”; and the rule was laid down that
                    the great men should have but two courses of flesh meat served up to their
                    tables, and on fish days two courses of fish, each course consisting of but two
                    kinds. In 1363, at the same time when costumes were regulated, it was enacted
                    that the servants of gentlemen, merchants, and artificers should have only one
                    meal of flesh or fish in the day, and that their other food should consist of
                    milk, butter, and cheese. Similar Acts to those above mentioned were passed in
                    Scotland also. In 1433 (temp. James I.), by an Act of a parliament which sat at
                    Perth, the manner of living of all orders in Scotland was prescribed, and in
                    particular the use of pies and baked meats, which had been only lately
                    introduced into the country, was forbidden to all under the rank of baron. In
                    1457 (temp. James II.) an Act was passed against “sumptuous cleithing.” A
                    Scottish sumptuary law of 1621 was the last of the kind in Great Britain.</p>
                <p>Ferguson and others have pointed out that “luxury” is a term of relative import
                    and that all luxuries do not deserve to be discouraged. Roscher has called
                    attention to the fact that the nature of the prevalent luxury changes with the
                    stage of social develop-<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n672/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0672-0645"/> ment. He endeavours to show that there are
                    three periods in the history of luxury,—one in which it is coarse and profuse; a
                    second in which it aims mainly at comfort and elegance; and a third, proper to
                    periods of decadence, in which it is perverted to vicious and unnatural ends.
                    The second of these began, in modern times, with the emergence of the Western
                    nations from the mediaeval period, and in the ancient communities at epochs of
                    similar transition. Roscher holds that the sumptuary legislation which regularly
                    appears at the opening of this stage was then useful as promoting the
                    reformation of habits. He remarks that the contemporary formation of strong
                    Governments, disposed from the consciousness of their strength to interfere with
                    the lives of their subjects, tended to encourage such legislation, as did also
                    the jealousy felt by the hitherto dominant ranks of the rising wealth of the
                    citizen classes, who are apt to imitate the conduct of their superiors. It is
                    certainly desirable that habits of wasteful expenditure and frequent and wanton
                    changes of fashion should be discouraged. But such action belongs more properly
                    to the spiritual than to the temporal power. In ancient, especially Roman, life,
                    when there was a confusion of the two powers in the state system, sumptuary
                    legislation was more natural than in the modern world, in which those powers
                    have been in general really, though imperfectly, separated. How far regulation
                    of this kind could, and might usefully, be carried out by a spiritual power
                    under purely moral sanctions, and whether and to what extent social offices,
                    private as well as public, should be discriminated by costume, are questions
                    which need not be discussed at present. Political economists are practically
                    unanimous in their reprobation of the policy of legislative compulsion in these
                    matters. In a well-known passage Adam Smith protests against the “impertinence
                    and presumption of kings and ministers in pretending to watch over the economy
                    of private people and to restrain their expense, being themselves always and
                    without any exception the greatest spendthrifts in the society.” Yet he does not
                    seem to have been averse to all attempts to influence through taxation the
                    expenditure of the humbler classes. The modern taxes on carriages, coats of
                    arms, hair-powder, playing-cards, &amp;c., ought perhaps not to be regarded as
                    resting on the principle of sumptuary laws, but only as means of proportioning
                    taxation to the capacity of bearing the burden.</p>
